   "Though I would not call the death penalty murder, I am personally against it. I see it mainly as state sanctioned and state administered vengeance. Though I admit that, if a loved one would be brutally killed, my anger and grief would probably drive me to want such vengeance as well, I don't think we should set social policy based on our most instinctive emotions but on rational reasons. \n \n So, what are some of the reasons why we impose various types of punishments on criminal offenders?\n 1) Protecting the public. This, I think, is the most important. A serious violent offender that runs a high risk of offending again should be kept locked away from the public for however long such risk exists. The justice system too often fails us in this. It may not be an easy job to judge which criminals will continue to be high risks, but I think the justice system could do a better job than it is currently doing. Often enough, a life sentence needs to really be just that - a LIFE sentence with no opportunity for release. Where the death penalty is concerned, as long as high risk prisoners are truly kept to a life sentence, then the requirement for protecting the public is kept and there is no need to kill them.\n \n 2) Punishment to rehabilitate the prisoner to be capable of reentering society safely. This has always led to mixed results. For some prisoners, punishment will deter them from ever committing another major crime. For others, it is irrelevant. Either way, even if it is not 100% effective, it is worth the effort to try to rehabilitate prisoners just for the sake of the majority that will not become repeat offenders. Where the death penalty is concerned, it is irrelevant to speak of rehabilitation since any lessons the criminal learns from that sentence will be moot since he will never re-enter society - he will be dead. This is partly true for life sentences as well.\n \n 3) Deterrence. The statistics about the effectiveness of the death penalty in deterring crimes are very mixed and seem inconclusive. Statistical studies made by various groups often show opposite conclusions. Unless there can be solid uncontestable evidence shown that the death penalty is significant in deterring crime, this cannot be used as an argument for the death penalty. \n \n 4) Restoration - i.e. righting the wrong  For example, a vandal might be made to clean up the mess he has made. Though this happens to some degree for minor offenses, it doesn't seem to be followed too much for higher level offenses. Either way, this is irrelevant for the death penalty. What, really, does the death of the perpetrator give to the grieving family besides a sense of satisfaction of vengeance?",

I think he was trying to say that there are some inherent and intrinsic fundamentals of the justice system that are natural and unchangeable. \n \n I do agree that reform needs to be obtained in our justice system, but that does not include scrapping a viable form of punishment for crimes and criminals that are both found unacceptable to societies base standards. If that involves a few statistical errors, so be it. Yes, I could perhaps \"change my tune\" if I believed that my family member was innocent. However, if I thought they were guilty of such crimes...\"fry 'em\". That is what intelligent and civlized people who believe in the death penalty do.

Given that there were over 16,000 murders in 2003 out in the real world (I can't find 2002 figures, but they'll be similar), that's not a lot of killers who go on to kill in prison. In fact, that makes prison safer than the outside world - 4 per 100,000 behind bars, vs 5.5 per 100,000 in the free world.\n In short, that argument doesn't work.

At what point of its development are you referring to? And explain to me how a child can learn in the womb if he IN FACT has no \"mental existence\" as you so incorrectly claim?\n The parents of ten-year-old musical genius Ariel explain to the programme that they developed their son's talent by ensuring he listened to classical music when he was in the womb.\n \n He was raised in a house dominated by music and had his first piano bought for him before he was even born. By the age of five he had taught himself to play the piano and aged seven he was playing in concerts with an adult orchestra. The film follows Ariel, from Israel, as he plays in a late-night jazz club and jets to Italy to perform his jazz debut outside Israel.http://uk-tv-guide.com/pick-of-the-day/18-8-2008/documentary-superhuman-genius-is-their-genius-due-to-nature-or-nurture\n \n What I marvel at iangb, is the ease in which your side categorizes the unborn as not living, or having no mental existence, when all you need do is look into a mirror or think a sentient thought to realize that you were once exactly where they are now. Yet you think nothing of marginalizing who and what they are for the sake of your pro-death philosophy. It's pathetic, really, since at the same time you will attempt to take some imaginary moral high road as you argue against the death penalty for legally convicted murderers who acted with malice and premeditation.

I could use the same argument further back in time - that 'a sperm cell will grow into a sentient being if allowed to survive'.\n \n \nReally? At what point of its development are you referring to? And explain to me how a child can learn in the womb if he IN FACT has no \"mental existence\" as you so incorrectly claim?\n [blurb]\n\n Was the child in your blurb born after 24 weeks of pregnancy (the point at which an abortion becomes illegal in the UK)? If not, then all that they experienced after this point may have been relevant. Your example is bogus anyway, as the child was born into a musical life so it is impossible to tell what the effects of the 'womb coaching' were.\n \n \n What we have here (as ever) is a problem of where to draw the line between 'potential for sentient life' and 'actual sentient life'. You chose to draw it at conception, I chose to draw it at the point where the foetus can survive outside the womb. In fact, it is a smooth emergent transition. You have no right to state that your opinion is any more or less valid than mine.\n \n Would you like to get back on topic now?",

Campaigners who cite research showing improved survival rates for very premature babies, combined with evidence suggesting young foetuses can feel pain, are putting pressure on MPs ahead of a crucial debate on the issue next month.\n MPs are planning to add amendments to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill to reduce the limit to 20 or 21 weeks.

   "Absolutely no ridicule should be generated over your serious post.\n \n Even for believers such as yourself, I think that it is important to realize that we on earth are not qualified to render what you might call \"God's justice.\"\n \n Christian Redemptionists notwithstanding, the USA is not, never has been, and, I hope never will be a theocracy. We live under the civil law, and the civil law tells us that crimes are prosecuted in the name of the state - The People of the State of \"X\" v. John Doe.\n \n \n This was done precisely to make the rendering of justice a concern of all the inhabitants of a state, municipality, or nation.\n \n In Biblical terms, this means that we must \"Render unto Caesar (earthly trials, convictions, and punishments) that which is Caesar's and render unto God that which is Gods' (eternal punishment if one is a believer).\n \n That being said, I oppose capital punishment for, among other reasons, it allows fallible humans to make the choice of who shall live and who shall die.\n\n \n You are absolutely right to a point, but we are not talking about the prosecution, but rather the punishment. If victims or families of the victim were allowed to prosecute, the prosecution would almost always be biased and unfair towards the accused. This is why I said the punishment should be decided by the victim or the victims family, and to my knowledge there is nothing in the bible that says that only the state can administer punishment.

Unless a violent criminal is specifically sentenced to live the remainder of his/her life in jail, then in a lot of cases, that criminal is going to be free one day, unless a criminal is so old upon sentencing that death is eminent while in prison. So I have a solution, how would you feel about a convicted rapist being casterated along with his prison sentence, then upon release he is not likely to repeat the crime. How would you feel about a convicted murderer having his hands removed along with his sentence, and upon his release he can no longer use deadly weapons such as guns or knives to murder again, although a knife is questionable due to modern prosthetics. And how would you feel about a child rapist having to be casterated, plus undergo very painful mental conditioning that will keep him from repeating his crime, plus his sentence in prison, plus the mental conditioning will continue for the duration of his life after release.

And as far as thinking about this a lot, that is a false assumption on your part, but how does one not have feelings on this as I see it on the news almost daily. So what is one supposed to do if a criminal violently attacks a member of his family, just sit idly back and watch a soft judicial system set the criminal free after a short stay in prison, or get off on a technicality because the arresting officer didnt use proper punctuation in the report. How can you possibly view this as justice, you can not. You seem to advocate criminal rights while opposing rights for the victim. A child who is raped, should that child survive the attack, will suffer emotionally and mentally for the rest of their life, and in some cases, if the child is a female, she can not have children as a result of the attack. So then why shouldnt the criminal who caused this also be made to suffer greatly as well, and since our judicial system is not going to do this, then somebody else should.

He catches the rapist, tortures them to death, and then is found guilty of murder and executed.\n \n Problem 1: What sort of message, grizzly, are you then giving to your child - who you have now left fatherless?

What argument would you give to them that would prevent them from torturing you to death, just as you have killed their son/brother/etc?\n \n Now consider the alternative. You catch the rapist, and hand them over to the criminal justice system. They lock him away for a length of time, and prevent him from legally working with children ever again. He may go on to rape again, but this is a problem that can be improved on - and not by the methods that you are suggesting. You bring your daughter up as a happy member of society rather than forcing her to live as a rape victim without a father figure.\n \n I really can't see why you would choose your original scenario.\n\n \n People have been going to jail as far back as time nearly, and yet crime has gotten worse, criminals know that they will only serve a short time in prison because of early releases and parroll and so on. You gave me a scenario, so now I will give you one, a man savagely rapes you 13 year old daughter, you catch him and hold him till the police get there, he is arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to 20 years for his crime. Five years later, you find out he is getting out on parroll for good behavior. During that previous 5 years of his incarseration, you have spent a small fortune on counseling for you daughter who had been raped. The rapist is now out of jail, one night you are working late at the office, and you get a phone call, its the police, and they tell you that you need to come home now. So you hurry home, and upon your arrival the police inform you that your daughter, the one who was raped, was found raped and murdered and we have the rapist/killer in custody. It turns out to be the original rapist, exacting revenge on you and your daughter for putting him in jail. Now how would you feel if something like this happened to you and your child. What if the rapist raped your sister, or niece next time, what if your daughter took her own life as a result of the rapist getting out of jail after only five years or any length of time for that matter. All because you did not make certain that the guy that raped your daughter would never again repeat the crime. I just would not take a chance that somehow this rapist is going to turn into a model citizen while doing a short stretch in prison. Statistics show that a large number of convicted criminals go right back to their crimes after being released from prison. No, death is the one sure way to prevent repeats from violent criminals. And what message would I be sending my child, the message that the guy who did that to her wont do it again.",

My actions and his may both be against the law, but I didnt make him a victim as he did my daughter, after that, they can do whatever they want to me, at least my child would be safe from him.

He will get twenty years, and be out in as little as five years, only to repeat his crime or retaliate against my family.

If he had been a murderer or could have been convicted of it, the Government would have gladly executed him as a killer. But since they couldn't justify that action, they attempted to lock him up and throw away the key until the public outcry for his release became an international cause celeb.

   "But there is a reason -- justice. There is little difference between executing someone and putting him in prison for the rest of his life with no chance of parole.\n\n \n Although I see your point, I don''t really agree, because there are (rarely, indeed) stories with surprising endings. By the way, in some prison, there are people who learn things, and can develop a sort of life, though it's not comparable to a regular one. No matter what kind of life it is, if it's bearable, it's always better than death.\n \n \nYou think about the unfortunate soul who is truly innocent of murder and executed anyway. For that one who shouldn't be executed there are hundreds or thousands who should be.\n\n \n That is what I cannot understand, I mean the relation you make between the innocent and the murderers (those who should be executed and those who are not).\n \n Innocent people have nothing to do with the guilty, therefore they should not pay, in any way, the price for others.\n \n \nAs for the likelihood that either of my two children is wrongly accused, tried, convicted of murder and denied every opportunity to exculpate him/herself -- that likelihood is negligible, as it is for most people.\n \n That low risk is one we all accept here in the United States, or at least in those states that have the death penalty.\n\n \n Of course I wish you not to face such a situation ever. I still wonder how this risk can be accepted. Justice is not perfect, as you said, since it's a human enterprise, I got it, but its goal is to propose the best system possible. If you start from the principle that mistakes leading to death of innocent people can be made, even at a very low percentage, it's letting entrance to some random factor, an unbearable thing when it comes to life and death. \n \n That makes me think about the competitive examination you can do to get a job, which puts most people on a quite equal ground; but some propose a fistful of jobs for some thousands candidates. The system still works, but there are some external factors that come into account when the jury has to choose eventually among the best ones. Sometimes there is no way to distinct them except chosing the one who has the best tie or the most beautiful legs. \n \n Even in this case, I find random factors quite acceptable, because if you don't get this job, you can try to get another one.\n \n When the \"bad luck\" factor takes care of you when you're judged for a murder\n you did not commit, I still don't see how you can accept it. Well, I know I'm a little redundant here, but you talk about the probability of this happening to your children as if it were a normal thing, and that's beyond me.\n \n \n \n \nOne does not have to witness an execution to be aware one took place. The point is to demonstrate social resolve against murder, something Americans do not currently do.\n\n \n I get your point.\n \n \n \n \nYour rate of murder isn't low because you abolished capital punishment.\n \n \n I didn't say that.\n \n \nI'm a Californian. I defend the death penalty here only. It doesn't matter to me whether other states, or other countries, have or don't have the death penalty.\n\n \n We're on Internet and I just thought it's a good thing to think worldwide but it's ok. I never visited the states.\n \n \n \nYou may have been mugged, and you have my condolences, but you do not live in Los Angeles, as I do. There are elementary school children here who commit murder. They have weapons more powerful than are used by the local police, and know how to use them.\n\n \n Here (and you threw me the line of course) we have come to a connected topic that allows me (not too heavily) to say that the absence of weapons in my country is a powerful way to avoid a higher murder rate. Violent agressions still happen, but do not lead to death as often as they do in, say, your state of California. Here we see and you already knew that before the means to solve a problem we can think of the means to avoid them.\n \n \nThese monsters are not amenable to reason. They have already concluded that they're above the law. They are convinced that society lacks the will to stand up to them, and for the most part, they're right.\n\n \n It sounds a little too easy to say, but what gave birth to the monsters, actually? You gave a bit of the answer. Caution, I don't support any violence on the pretext of poverty, segregation , etc, but I can understand how it happens.\n \n \nThugs only respect bigger thugs, Olivortex. The biggest thug has to be the state.\n\n \n You nailed it :)\n \n In a way, I can't contradict you, because it's a known fact that power makes you a thug, generally.\n \n But it would be smarter to act in a wise way and not as a thug, because, yes, what goes around comes around.\n \n \n\n That's nonsense. The gentlest people in the United States play the most violent video games. There's no association between fantasy games and violent behavior.\n\n \n I agree for the first part, but the second is more discutable. I can see how people in general, and more importantly the children get used to violence through its representation. Just like some people view sexual practice through extreme movies, when it's totally remote from what people need and want. I know of course that I can distinguish a movie or a game and reality, but I have observed how some images leave marks on a child's mind. There are, also, the famous videos displaying children going literally mad because of a failure at a video game.\n \n There is an association in that sense, not all the people have a a resistant mind enough not to be influenced at all by these media.\n \n \n \n \nI was beaten but never beat my children. I made a point of that. Why?\n\n \n Because you have been smart enough to make your own personnality and to find your own way of raising them. For this you have my congratulations but we are not all the same.\n \n \nIf only your theory had any basis in fact.\n \n The fact is that violence and non-violence both beget violence. Antisocial behavior isn't learned. It's the end-result of a decision, the creation of an attitude. \n\n \n You seem to interpret a more reasoned sentence (that is, not death penalty) as a sign of weakness.\n \n Violence and non-violence are not equals. Education is supposed to give people the tools to live together in peace when the conditions allow them to. \n \n Education is the first thing. Death penalty is at the end.\n \n \nIt is not the byproduct of too much self-esteem, not too little.\n \n\n \n I didn't get that one.",

   "How many thousands of examples could we dig up from just the American Penal system when convicted killers served part of their sentence and were released early or on good behavior, or because of over crowded Prisons, and proceeded to murder someone else, yet again! It happens all of the time with all kinds of serious criminals from killers to rapists to child molesters. Recidivism is not some theoretical concept which requires a lengthy study to confirm; it is a known reality with every type of crime committed and is the reason murderers and those who commit serious crimes against people deserve the death penalty before they can slip through a broken legal system and recommit.\n\n \n It's an important point made here. It's one of the major failures of legal systems in general. The problem is that prison is not designed as a rehabilitation tool but only as a punishment. \n \n Note that people who have killed sometimes succeed in leading a \"normal\" life afterwards (talking about \"crimes of passion\" or unfairly judged self-defense here). \n \n But I'd agree turning a psycho into a cool guy is a fairy tale. So it would be logical to keep those who deserve it in a cell until they die. Then there is the overcrowded prison problem.",

It's simply a matter of attitude. \n\n \n \nAntisocial behavior isn't learned. It's the end-result of a decision, the creation of an attitude. \n\n \n I was thinking that when you create something you are always influenced by external sources.\n \n I've made a quick google search, that you might qualify as biased. Anyway it would have been hard doing otherwise.\n \n What is Antisocial Behavior?\n \n The part that interested me the most:\n \n \nAntisocial behavior can start out in childhood, adolescence or adulthood. In children it is referred to as a conduct disorder, in adults as antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorders developed early in life, prior to puberty, are more likely to continue into adulthood and also more likely to be aggressive. Conversely, a child that develops antisocial behavior at or after puberty has a better chance of the disorder not continuing into adulthood.\n \n Antisocial behavior as seen in children is a growing concern among educators. Escalating violence in schools is an outward manifestation of antisocial behavior. Researchers have linked certain factors to the childhood form, finding it is often passed down within the family, though the genetics of this are not well understood. There also seem to be other common factors. Children with conduct disorders are often victims of abuse or have been exposed to aversive or punitive environments. Parenting is often inconsistent, swinging from excessive leniency to excessive punishment.\n \n\n \n \n Conduct disorder - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n A small excerpt:\n \n \nSome motives for such behavior are genetic inheritance of a difficult temperament, ineffective parenting, and living in a neighborhood in which violence is common.\n\n \n And you're not against violence? \n \n I would be the first to say that I didn't bring any \"proof\" of any sort here, but you see my point. I have understood what you meant by :\n \n \nThat children are inured to violence isn't a bad thing. They should have an appreciation of violence and its consequences as early as possible.\n\n \n But it seems obvious that making violence commonplace (like making public executions in a Afghan fashion) is not a good thing.",

The Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 prohibited residents from owning handguns, excluding those registered prior to February 5, 1977; however, this law was subsequently overturned in March 2007 by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Parker v. District of Columbia. The ruling was upheld in June 2008 by the Supreme Court of the United States in District of Columbia v. Heller. Both courts held that the city's handgun ban violated individuals' Second Amendment right to gun ownership. However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. Additionally, city laws still prohibit carrying guns, both openly and concealed.\n \n Critics, citing numerous statistics, have questioned the efficiency of these restrictions. The combination in Washington of strict gun-restriction laws and high levels of gun violence is sometimes used to criticize gun-restriction laws in general as ineffective. However, a significant portion of firearms used in crime are either obtained on the second-hand market or in neighboring states. Results from the ATF's Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative indicate that the percentage of imported guns involved in crimes is tied to the stringency of local firearm laws\n\n \n It is said here that gun-restriction laws were innefective because people found a way to get guns anyway. What would be effective would be the actual absence of guns.\n \n Crime in Washington, D.C. - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

Theirs is an organization founded on fear and political agenda. They support gun bans, not gun ownership. The facts of the real world don't support their message of fear, so they have to come up with a load of BS to shape the figures into what they say they are.\n \n Take for example how they said 95% of all guns in Mexico came from the United States. What they'll never tell you is that 95% of the fraction that Mexico turned over for the ATF to trace came from the United States. But they refused to turn over most of the confiscated weapons for tracing purposes.\n \n \nFrance makes lots of weapons and sells it to other countries, but Jacques Chirac was against war in Iraq and had a generally peaceful discourse.\n\n \n There's a difference between the Violence Policy Center and France. The VPC is actively calling for a ban on guns and using fear and trickery to try and further their message. And on the flipside they have an FFL license, which only applies to businesses that intend to sell guns.\n \n So why would they have a business license to deal in the buying and selling of guns, when they're calling for public support of more and more weapons restrictions? That would be like Obama wanting to see segregation brought back against black people.\n \n \nIn my country we have a quite easy access to some vaccins and all kinds of medecine that are not available in other countries of the third world. So yeah, if you can remove the cause, you won't have the effect.\n\n \n Except for the fact that such isn't realistic or possible. If you've even got France in the business of the arms trade, playing an active role, then you're gonna be hard pressed to get any country to stop making and selling weapons.\n \n Even if you could, you'd never be able to find, confiscate and destroy them all. There's always going to be enough left that somebody will be able to make more based on existing specimens.\n \n \nHow come there is no way? Who says cars will last as long as man exists? I know the car market is strong and impossible to ignore today but it doesn't mean it will last forever.\n\n \n Guns have been around since at least the 1500s and in continuous production, made by the millions since their creation by people in all manner of shops and locations either with or without regulation. And that's just the ones the governments know about.\n \n Let's see the car industry compare to that.\n \n \nForever is a long time, and nothing prevents us from making some effort to start the change.\n\n \n That's like the city of Chicago implementing their gun ban in hopes that other cities would follow their example.

   "Well met and greetings. My compliments to you on your argument thusfar.\n \n \n \n \nThe idea is quite tempting! :) Joke apart, the main difference between firearms and cars is that firearms were designed to hurt at best, and to kill at worst. Cars were designed to go from one place to another. Except in some special cases of crazy drivers looking for some pedestrians to crush or accidents, they don't kill on purpose. People holding guns rarely kill by accident, but even when they didn't intend to kill but just do bad things to someone they don't like much, then they're in trouble for murder if the guy eventually dies. No one will convince me that there are as many crazy drivers as there are shooters.\n\n \n Regardless of the design or the intent the result is what you have been arguing, namely numbers. The numbers of people killed by firearms in America pale beside the number of deaths resulting from vehicles or falls. Regardless of the intent of the ladder it provides a means to reach a great height from which the theories of Sir Isaac Newton take over. Regardless of the intent of the vehicle more people are killed annually in automobile accidents. A child is more likely to drown in a backyard pool than be killed playing with a firearm but we do not consider banning backyard pools because they are somewhat less easy to demagogue.\n \n If we revisit your notion of intent you must needs consider that the firearm is just as capable of defense as it is offense. If you subtract the number of deaths resulting from the legal and proper use of a firearm in self defense you are left with a smaller number. If you subtract suicides (and indeed you must because those bent on self destruction have other means to an end, ladders for instance) the numbers dwindle further. Given the inherent and demonstrated dangers attendant to ladders and swimming pools and the fact that one may not easily use either as a means of self defense it should give one pause to consider in what direction the rhetoric should be directed.\n \n \nBut to me it doesn't change the fact that when you give people more means to kill other people with efficiency, you will very likely observe an increasing murder rate, because of this gain of efficiency. Sorry for using this word, it's not very adapted, but you know what I mean.\n\n \n If I put a gun in your hand right now would you suddenly be more likely to become a murderer?

   "I couldn't help but think about the discussion with Oli when I read this. Something he said about somebody with a knife being somehow less deadly than somebody with a gun.\n \n Report: 300 dead in December Congo massacre - CNN.com\n \n \nA rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least 321 civilians and abducted 250 others -- including at least 80 children -- in a previously unreported rampage late last year, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Saturday.\n \n The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) carried out the brutal campaign in northeastern Congo over four days in December, the report said.\n \n LRA forces attacked at least 10 villages from December 14 to 17, killing and abducting hundreds of civilians -- including women and children, according to Human Rights Watch.\n \n LRA combatants tied up villagers in the nation's remote Makombo area and hacked them to death with machetes or crushed their skulls with axes and heavy wooden sticks, the report said.\n \n Most of those killed were adult men, but at least 13 women and 23 children were among the dead -- including a 3-year-old girl who was burned to death, according to Human Rights Watch.\n \n The LRA also killed those they abducted who walked too slowly or tried to escape, Human Rights Watch said.\n \n According to those who managed to escape, children captured by the LRA were forced to kill other children who had disobeyed the LRA's rules, the report said. In numerous cases, children were ordered to surround the victim in a circle and take turns beating the child on the head with a large wooden stick until the child died, the report said.\n \n \"The Makombo massacre is one of the worst ever committed by the LRA in its bloody 23-year history, yet it has gone unreported for months,\" said Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. \"The four-day rampage demonstrates that the LRA remains a serious threat to civilians and is not a spent force, as the Ugandan and Congolese governments claim.\"\n \n CNN could not independently confirm the massacre.\n \n Human Rights Watch said that the roughly 1,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops in LRA-affected parts of northeastern Congo are insufficient to protect civilians. The peacekeeping force is considering removing some troops from the area under pressure from the Congolese government, a move Human Rights Watch warned against on Saturday.\n \n The U.N. Security Council is planning to visit Congo in mid-April to discuss the peacekeeping force's plans for withdrawal and the protection of civilians, Human Rights Watch said.\n \n The Congolese government denies that the LRA is still a serious threat in the country, which may have contributed to the absence of reports about the December massacre, Human Rights Watch said.\n \n \"We have been forgotten,\" an 80-year-old Congolese man whose son was killed during the massacre told Human Rights Watch. \"It's as if we don't exist.\"\n \n \"The government says the LRA are no longer a problem, but I know that's not true,\" he said. \"I beg of you, please talk to others about what has happened to us.\"\n \n The LRA is led by self-declared mystic and prophet Joseph Kony, who claims his insurgency -- which began in 1986 -- is aimed at replacing Uganda's government, led by President Yoweri Museveni, with a democracy based on the Bible's Ten Commandments.\n \n After being pushed out of Uganda in 2005, the LRA now operates in the remote border area between southern Sudan, Congo, and Central African Republic. In 2005, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for senior LRA leaders for crimes they committed in northern Uganda, but those indicted remain at large.\n \n The two commanders who perpetrated the December massacre report to one of those indicted leaders, according to Human Rights Watch.\n \n The Makombo massacre is the deadliest documented attack by the LRA since killing sprees around Christmas 2008 left scores of Congolese dead, but dozens of other attacks against civilians have been carried out in other areas in recent months, Human Rights Watch said.\n\n \n 300+ people savagely and senselessly murdered in a span of just four days. Either hacked to death or beaten to death.",

   "First off, for your pole.\n \n Is the Death Penalty murder? Why yes, yes it is.\n\n No actually, it's not. Murder is a legal definition. Is the death penalty \"killing\"...yes. Currently, the death penalty is lawful in the US, therefore it cannot be defined as murder.\n \n I don't normally use Wiki, but it clearly spells it out right in the first sentence. \n \n \nMurder, as defined in common law countries, is the unlawful killing of another human being with intent (or malice aforethought), and generally this state of mind distinguishes murder from other forms of unlawful homicide (such as manslaughter). \n Murder - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n \n \nHowever, I do believe for CERTAIN individuals (such as, and these are examples over time as these people are not alive any longer, Gilles de Rais, Richard Trenton Chase, Jeffrey Dahmer, Albert Fish ,Andrei Chikatilo, Joachim Kroll, Dennis Rader, John Haigh, Javed Iqbal, Ted Bundy, etc.*) that it cannot, and should not, be avoided.

   "So what would you suggest a ban on next?\n\n \n There doesn't have to be a logical chain of banning on things. I'm talking about firearms.\n \n \n \nThen don't use them unless you're fully prepared to kill if its necessary. These aren't toys you know.\n\n \n I know they are not toys, that's why I like to mention gang members, or more particularly, the elementary school boys Joseph D Phillips had mentioned earlier.\n \n \n \nAnd death by AIDS are more frequent and common than both.\n\n \n We die of all sorts of diseases. Sometimes we can't avoid the dramatic ending as with AIDS. We can avoid it concerning guns.\n \n \n \nIgnorance. First you admitted it was the people who did the killing, now you're saying that the people aren't a problem but instead their hardware is.\n\n \n I do not admit two contradictory things. This is what I have written:\n \n \nSimpy put: a dangerous man with a knife is less dangerous than a dangerous man with a gun. That's why I've focused on Japan, I thought it was a good exemple of a culture with its flaws but without the danger increased by the use of firearms. \n\n \n I have insisted on the fact that guns don't kill people by themselves. I know it's the people who do things. The problem I tried to focus on is the enhanced ways of killing.\n \n \n \nI'm really glad you said this. Now we've established (and you've admitted) that there are people in the world who would kill even if you took away their tools.\n\n \n Yes. Fortunately enough, we're not surrounded by psychopathic killers who would use anything to kill us.\n \n \nNow that we've got this point established, what exactly is your answer to them being in the general public? And how do we as citizens protect ourselves against them?\n\n \n Let's try to get an effective police, for instance.\n \n \n \nYou said you don't believe that the VPC would cheat, that they'd be honest about their agenda and not use trickery. And here we've got the head guy saying that because of a weapon's appearance, the public's interest can be exploited into support for a useless law.\n \n \n \n https://www.atfonline.gov/fflezcheck/fflSearch.do;jsessionid=0af8c08cce54f3090bd686e4e02bf6a9334c1c60cad.o75KqAfDmlaLaNuImlfA-BfMnk5N-ArJrxCNaN0Lcybtah0Iah8N-x4TawSLc3yInh9ymkiT-x4Kak4PchmKaxmK-wOSa30K8N4KnNyKb6PDn5XDmlaLaNuIo75KqAfDmlaLaNuImlfA-BfMnk5N-ArJrwaOah8Tb3iRahyxf2bAnALzsAbCnkbF8QfznA5Pp7ftolbGmkTy\n \n Right from the mouth of the ATF.\n\n \n I didn't click on your link, because I said I believed you already.\n \n \n \nYour attitude suggests naivety about the world and how it works. Theirs is an organization founded on fear and political agenda. They support gun bans, not gun ownership. The facts of the real world don't support their message of fear, so they have to come up with a load of BS to shape the figures into what they say they are.\n \n Take for example how they said 95% of all guns in Mexico came from the United States. What they'll never tell you is that 95% of the fraction that Mexico turned over for the ATF to trace came from the United States. But they refused to turn over most of the confiscated weapons for tracing purposes.\n\n \n \n \nThere's a difference between the Violence Policy Center and France. The VPC is actively calling for a ban on guns and using fear and trickery to try and further their message. And on the flipside they have an FFL license, which only applies to businesses that intend to sell guns.\n \n So why would they have a business license to deal in the buying and selling of guns, when they're calling for public support of more and more weapons restrictions? That would be like Obama wanting to see segregation brought back against black people.\n\n \n So they do sell guns and do call for weapon restricitions? What can I do about it? I already agreed we live in a world of contractions, and smme people take strange turns to sell what they have to sell.\n \n I guess I should have used another source for these figures...\n \n \n \nExcept for the fact that such isn't realistic or possible. If you've even got France in the business of the arms trade, playing an active role, then you're gonna be hard pressed to get any country to stop making and selling weapons.\n \n Even if you could, you'd never be able to find, confiscate and destroy them all. There's always going to be enough left that somebody will be able to make more based on existing specimens.\n\n \n I understand. It doesn't escape me that we live in a world of industrial reality, where markets rule, where ideas like \"eradicating nuclear weapons\" can sound naive. That's why I mentioned the french case, and that's why I mentioned the car market. But if we don't even engage in such ideas and think about the possibilities of at least reducing the casualties, we really surrender. \n \n \n \nGuns have been around since at least the 1500s and in continuous production, made by the millions since their creation by people in all manner of shops and locations either with or without regulation. And that's just the ones the governments know about.\n \n Let's see the car industry compare to that.\n\n \n That's exactly the kind of argument I don't support because weapons were created by man. Why shouldn't they be destroyed by them? No matter how long they've been around. I think the car example is still quite valid.\n \n \n \nThat's like the city of Chicago implementing their gun ban in hopes that other cities would follow their example. It simply doesn't work and it's pointless to make the attempt. It's a waste of time and resources that could be better spent focusing on dealing with the people most likely to offend.\n\n \n That's quite pessimistic.\n \n \n \n \nBecause France chose to surrender.\n\n \n Surrender to what?\n \n \n \n \nJust because things can change, doesn't mean that they should change. There's no reason to believe that we need to look for ways to implement a general gun ban of any sort.\n\n \n If a change can be made and if this change can reduce killings, then why shouldn't it be made?\n \n \n \n \nYou qualify as the crier of the discussion since you still support the mentality of \"If guns didn't exist.\"\n\n \n I don't understand how this makes me a \"crier\". Anyway, this is a silly point. It doesn't have anything to do with the topic of the discussion. Call me what you want, I will share my point of view with the same sincerity.\n \n \n \nThere's no such thing as legal murder, since murder is illegal by nature. Society is responsible for the death penalty, and society makes up the rules by which we're governed.\n\n \n That's the famous dividing line, and I still stand on the side where people think killing is murder, no matter what the circumstances are.",

There's absolutely no money to be had for upgrading the police force. In fact some cities are putting an end to their police force because they don't have a big enough budget to support them and their firefighters.\n \n Even if the police force could be made as effective as necessary it wouldn't make a bit of difference. Serious offenders are cut loose in the courts every single day, given a fraction of what they truly deserve, or absolutely nothing at all.\n \n Besides that fact, I don't know about you, but I wouldn't care much for living in a police state.\n \n \nI understand. It doesn't escape me that we live in a world of industrial reality, where markets rule, where ideas like \"eradicating nuclear weapons\" can sound naive.

It's akin to debating how to bring the Tasmanian Tiger back.\n \n If you want to have a serious discussion, then let's discuss the fact that police in Britain have been instructed to issue a \"caution\" in matters pertaining to sexual assault and assault with a deadly weapon, rather than simply making an arrest. That's no different than saying \"I'm not going to arrest you for using a knife to rob that person. But I don't want to come back out here so don't do it again or else.\"\n \n \nThat's exactly the kind of argument I don't support because weapons were created by man.\n\n \n So were laws and standards of order.\n \n \nWhy shouldn't they be destroyed by them?\n\n \n Because death and war has been around longer than man has existed.\n \n \nNo matter how long they've been around. I think the car example is still quite valid.\n\n \n Not many would agree with you.\n \n \nThat's quite pessimistic.\n\n \n Actually it's very realistic. I don't believe in miracles happening. I believe in what I can see and understand. I believe in what I've learned in my studies about human behavior.

However on the contrary there's considerable evidence that killing rates have gone up after supposedly effective gun laws were passed in an area. Look at DC for example. They were known as the Murder Capital for the entire United States during a time when nobody could have a gun.\n \n [QUOTE]\nBut now just imagine if those people who senselessly slaughtered these men, woman and children were given machine guns.\n\n \n And imagine how many people wouldn't have had to die if they could have effectively fought their attackers and killed a few of them.\n \n \nI still don't like the term but I have mentioned the concept of efficiency.

   "Regardless of the design or the intent the result is what you have been arguing, namely numbers. The numbers of people killed by firearms in America pale beside the number of deaths resulting from vehicles or falls. Regardless of the intent of the ladder it provides a means to reach a great height from which the theories of Sir Isaac Newton take over. Regardless of the intent of the vehicle more people are killed annually in automobile accidents. A child is more likely to drown in a backyard pool than be killed playing with a firearm but we do not consider banning backyard pools because they are somewhat less easy to demagogue.\n \n If we revisit your notion of intent you must needs consider that the firearm is just as capable of defense as it is offense. If you subtract the number of deaths resulting from the legal and proper use of a firearm in self defense you are left with a smaller number. If you subtract suicides (and indeed you must because those bent on self destruction have other means to an end, ladders for instance) the numbers dwindle further. Given the inherent and demonstrated dangers attendant to ladders and swimming pools and the fact that one may not easily use either as a means of self defense it should give one pause to consider in what direction the rhetoric should be directed.\n \n Quote:\n But to me it doesn't change the fact that when you give people more means to kill other people with efficiency, you will very likely observe an increasing murder rate, because of this gain of efficiency. Sorry for using this word, it's not very adapted, but you know what I mean.\n \n If I put a gun in your hand right now would you suddenly be more likely to become a murderer? If you cannot honestly answer yes then you cannot honestly pursue this argument. You can give a monkey a typewriter but that doesn't make him Shakespeare. Without telephones there would be no telemarketers. Maybe we should rid ourselves of phones?\n \n Quote:\n I know guns are a good tool for self-defense, but many other people use them for criminal purpose only.\n \n Hence the need for legal firearm possession. I know you honestly believe that if we simply make all firearms vanish the problem would be solved; however, this is about as realistic as preventing malaria by wishing away mosquitoes.\n \n Quote:\n I want to make clear that I don't forget that any object can be used as a mean of hurting or killing. A bus, a log, a chair,a dead turtle. But a gun is designed for this particular purpose, and is so much powerful than a knife or a billy.\n \n I noticed that you did not list ladder\n\n \n \nThe 2003 figures for Louisiana that I've mentioned earlier are to me a clear exemple of the incidence of guns on mortality. The crossed rates clearly indicate it.\n\n \n The data do not differentiate murders from self defense from suicides. It does not represent murders by firearms as you suggest. The data from Alaska for instance is highly skewed due the the inordinate amount of suicides by firearm (Alaska has a rather high rate of seasonal affective disorder and depression related suicide). Louisiana meanwhile has many factors which lead to its place on the list. Louisiana ranks among the worst States for education and economy. States like North Dakota and Montana have comparable numbers of gun owners and comparable firearms laws but do not have comparable firearms deaths. This would seem to argue against mere presence of firearms as the key indicator and more for environmental considerations such as poverty, crime rates, and gentrification.\n\n \n OK, so you're telling me that:\n \n Pools kill. Guns kill.\n \n Therefore pools and guns should receive the same treatment, but they don't because it's more politically correct to blame guns.\n \n This sounds like deductive fallacy.\n \n The idea is clearly: if we ban guns, why wouldn't we ban pools?\n \n I can also say: if we allow guns, why don't we allow bazookas?\n \n If you put a gun in my hand I may not become a murderer at once, but I could feel more secure and If on top of that I was a little stupid, I may say and do stupid things that could lead me to use the gun. For example I could feel safe enough to wander through a neighbourhood I was too scared to enter before I got the gun. Then I meet some guy who wants my money. I get nervous and I take my gun out of my pocket. But since anyone has the right to carry one, the other guy has his own, of course. You know the rest of this little scenario. Sorry, I wasn't born a good story-teller, I've tried to make it short!\n \n \n Glad you mentioned education concerning the Louisiana case. It would have interested JDPhilips, with whom I've begun this long series of posts.\n \n \n Another wiki page that I have used before:\n \n \nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, homicide rates surged in cities across the United States (see graphs at right). Handgun homicides accounted for nearly all of the overall increase in the homicide rate, from 1985 to 1993, while homicide rates involving other weapons declined during that time frame. The rising trend in homicide rates during the 1980s and early 1990s was most pronounced among youths and Hispanic and African American males in the United States, with the injury and death rates tripling for black males aged 13 through 17 and doubling for black males aged 18 through 24. The rise in crack cocaine use in cities across the United States is often cited as a factor for increased gun violence among youths during this time period.\n \n Homicide rates in the United States are two to four times higher than they are in countries that are economically and politically similar to it. Higher rates are found in developing countries and those with political instability\n\n \n Gun violence in the United States - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n I have read somewhere (is it true?)that if you took away the gun homicides from the US statistics, the US murder rate would still be higher than in european countries. But the fraction that is substracted is not negligible. We talk about human lives; if we can avoid this fraction of murder from happening, don't you think it's a good thing? To say it another way It seems that guns worsen things\n \n About the feasibility of guns eradication - I must admit I'm not as pessimistic as others can be.\n \n \n I wanted to gather other ideas and things but I don't have enough time. \n This led us to the gun control topic instead of digging the death penalty one but it's a good way of learning things anyway. Hope I can keep fueling this discussion soon. Thanks for reading.",

Even if you didn't have a gun, the guy after your money would still have one and you'd be on the short end of the stick, or on the mortician's slab.\n \n \nI have read somewhere (is it true?)that if you took away the gun homicides from the US statistics, the US murder rate would still be higher than in european countries. But the fraction that is substracted is not negligible. We talk about human lives; if we can avoid this fraction of murder from happening, don't you think it's a good thing?\n\n \n Simply put, no. Because what we're talking about are fundamental rights of the people. And you're not allowed to trade those rights for some degree of perceived security; especially when that perceived security isn't real.\n \n You could certainly stop a lot of racial hatred going on if you did away with the First Amendment's protection on free speech, but I'm sure a lot of people would say the cost is too much for what might be the achievable benefit.\n \n \nTo say it another way It seems that guns worsen things\n\n \n They also make things better. It depends on who you ask.\n \n \nAbout the feasibility of guns eradication - I must admit I'm not as pessimistic as others can be.\n\n \n Nor are you as realistic.",

Second of all, o dont care if one innocent person dies, as long as for evert dead innocent, 20 guilties go with the mother trucker.\n\n \n As a rule my only issue with the death penalty is allowing the government that kind of power (the power to execute). That said, this is a seriously a disturbing statement. What if the innocent is YOU? The idea is that if there is reasonable doubt, you are not proven guilty.
