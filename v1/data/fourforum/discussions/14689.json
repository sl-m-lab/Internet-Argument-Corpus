   "Well, now that we have student loans exceeding credit card debt is it time to reform student loans? \n \n The average student loan debt is over $30,000 when a student finishes their English degree from Middle Nowhere College. Now chances are if you have a degree that no one cares about (sorry art majors) and you managed to get a job in that field than you are making at best $30k a year but are more than likely unemployed or working in retail. Go ahead and plug those numbers into this calculator and you'll see it doesn't add up: Student loan repayment calculator\n \n You would need an average salary of around $51k to make it worth getting that major. In other words, you're going bankrupt. \n \n Turns out, this is true: Many More Students Are Defaulting Than Official Tallies Show - Government - The Chronicle of Higher Education\n \n If you are going to a for-profit like Univ. of Phoenix than you are basically admitting you won't pay the loan back. The rates for nonprofit are climbing like crazy too and are HIGHER than credit card default rates. \n \n So you have a student loan that has an interest rate of 5-6% yet defaults higher than a credit card who's interest rate is averaging 15-18%. On top of that the federal government has basically taken on all the student loans now (ended FFELP in favor of FDL) which means the federal government is taking a HUGE risk at taxpayers expense. \n \n So I ask, is it time to reform the student loan system and make it HARDER to get student loans? To me the answer is obvious. In fact, we are better off just giving more student grants than student loans...at least we know upfront the grant money ain't coming back.",

I decided to go with the Masters of Accountancy which made it better when taking the CPA exam. Frankly the Masters program was more \"real college\" than my undergrad which was a four year vacation. Think about, a vacation from High School. I didn't do a damn thing in high school.\n \n Oh and accounting is a business degree so don't lump us all together! Accounting, Finance, and maybe Economics are the only business degrees with any value (and in that order too). The later two should be limited.\n \n \nMy sister in law has a masters degree in music, $80,000 in student loan debt, and no marketable skills. \n \n Frankly, I would lump \"business\" in with the degrees you cite above as basically worthless.

Student loan debt have SURPASSED credit card debt. Can you even fathom that? While I'm not suggesting the Higher Ed bubble is about to burst, I think it should show up on people's radars soon. These debt levels are not sustainable and when people realize that we can't have everyone major in hobby or get paid off a federal research grant than maybe we can reform our system of education to a more productive one. \n \n It start in K12 education too. Why do we not teach more skills in high school? Sorry but Bubba who is driving his F150 to class and has an IQ of 90 might not be college material but probably can fix a broken transmission if taught. Frankly, we need people that do those things and I don't think it is any less valuable than what I do. As I've always said, if everyone is \"trained\" to be a CEO of a fortune 500 company than the janitor is the highest paid position.

It is almost like most of the professors teaching business administration have never administered a business because they are PROFESSORS, not administrators, and even if they are administrators at the college, trust me, that is not the same as being an administrator at a normal business somewhere else. \n \n \nI can see this but how do you change people's minds? That's always the problem. \n\n \n In this case the problem is changing peoples minds without having to resort to waiting for the whole thing to fall apart. It may not be possible. I do see some hopeful signs. If you look at the demographics of the unemployed, there are a lot more white collar types on the list than you would usually expect to see. We are also seeing a lot more direct executive involvement in hiring. This next one is strictly anecdotal, but 7 of the 9 companies I still do consulting for have started new programs to aggressively promote from within. In at least 4 cases those programs include requiring that a person who goes outside the company to fill a leadership role explain themselves.\n \n In this way the economic shakeup to date has been a GOOD thing. When everything was rolling along well there was no need to dig too deeply and really look at operations and search for ways to improve them. When things get rough we have to look around at what is going on and ask ourselves either how we can improve them or WHY they are not working. All too often the answer to the second is \"Because you have the wrong person in there\". \n \n Keep in mind that, as georged used to put it, I am an \"operations side guy\". I am not advocating taking somebody off your production floor and putting them in charge of your accounting department, or making them the CFO. The finance side of most companies is a specialized field that actually does, in most cases, require a college degree to have the knowledge required to do the job effectively. If, however, you make widgets, and there is a guy in your production shop that knows all the machines, knows all the process, and knows all about making widgets, I dont care if he dropped out of school in the 3rd grade. You are a widget maker, he is a widget making fool, it is a match made in heaven. Bringing some educated imbecile in who spent the last 6 years in an MBA program looking at Krispy Kremes AWESOME business model is foolish. He is not going to have any practical knowledge at all about making widgets.\n \n Dont even get me started on trying to teach business ethics in a classroom environment......",

Higher rates for riskier loans a good idea. It should probably be with a company that profits for it as well. Having the federal government on the hook only leads to market distortion of the actual risk of a given student.
