   "then there is this study, which results have also not been duplicated, but it gives another possible notion for the existiance of homophobia\n \n \n \n University study of homophobia:\n \n A study that appears to reveal a major cause of homophobia was completed at the University of Georgia in 1996. 3 It involved 64 white men, none of whom had engaged in homosexual acts during their lifetime. Their sexual fantasies involved only women. 35 of them were rated homophobic; 29 non-homophobic. For the purpose of this study, \"homophobia\" was defined as a negative emotional reaction (e.g., fear, anxiety, anger, discomfort) to homosexuality. It was measured by a questionnaire called the Index of Homophobia. Each was shown three types of X rated videotapes: heterosexual, lesbian and gay. A plethysmograph measuring device (affectionately called a \"peter meter\") measured the circumference of their penis as a gauge of sexual arousal.\n \n The two groups exhibited similar arousal when they viewed 4 minute samples taken from one heterosexual and one lesbian movie. But they responded differently to the male homosexual clip:\n Degree of Tumescence: Insignificant Moderate Definite\n Homophobic men 20% 26% 54%\n Non-homophobic men 66% 10% 24%\n \n The researchers concluded that these data are consistent with the belief that most homophobic men have repressed homosexual desires. An alternate, but much less likely, explanation is that the homophobic men's erections were caused by anxiety during the experiment.\n \n Further research is needed to clarify the results and to answer questions such as whether these results would generalize to homophobic women.\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_fuel2.htm\n \n \n and this one...(which is really a link to an article about a bunch of different studies)\n http://www.bibble.org/gay/phobia/roots_of_homophobia.html",

I hope not. I would not wish that on anyone. \n \n You say homophobic \"behavior\" may be genetic. OK For the sake of argument, let us assume it is. How many times have we heard YOU say that we gays should control our behavior, yet you seem unable to control YOUR'S!!!!!!!!!!! \n \n How should we each endevour to control our \"behavior\"? I have a suggestion: We both control our respective behaviors as to not harm the other. Sounds fair to me.\n \n 1) I haven't seen gay groups calling press conferences to demonize the religious right. I HAVE seen the opposite. \n 2) I won't deny you your religious rights if you wo'nt deny me my civil rights.\n 3) I won't have sex in public if you won't.

In fact, I am not interested in sex with anyone but Ron. Somehow, you seem to think that gay people have uncontrolable urges to have sex with anyone of the same sex. Where do you get such an idea? From your OWN urges to have sex with everyone of the opposite sex?\n \n You judge everyone based on your own feelings. Well, not everyone is \"jyoshu\" (thank God), and not everyone feels the same or reacts the same as \"jyoshu\". I guess you just can't grasp that concept. You are definately preoccupied with physical sex acts. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Marriage: You must feel very insecure if you feel threatened by (according to your assumption) less than 1% of the global population using the same word to describe their committed relationship as you use.

I hope not. I would not wish that on anyone.\n\n \n No; and I don't think you're being very honest at all when you portray what I do here as demonizing. It's not like my position is a strange one--it's held by most people in the world. I simply believe it is immoral behavior.\n \n Admittedly, I do probably spend more time in this forum than I should. There's a simple reason: I enjoy debate. And people in this forum tend to respond more than in other forums, for whatever reason. I have assumed that the reason for that is that other people here also enjoy debate. Besides, homosexuality is a pertinent, national, controversial topic, perfect for debate.\n \n \nYou say homophobic \"behavior\" may be genetic. OK For the sake of argument, let us assume it is. How many times have we heard YOU say that we gays should control our behavior, yet you seem unable to control YOUR'S!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n \n Why should I stop debating? \n \n \nHow should we each endevour to control our \"behavior\"? I have a suggestion: We both control our respective behaviors as to not harm the other. Sounds fair to me.\n\n \n I have no problem with that from the perspective of me debating here. There's no evidence I'm hurting anyone.\n \n \n1) I haven't seen gay groups calling press conferences to demonize the religious right. I HAVE seen the opposite. \n\n \n Gay rights lobbyists take any given opportunity to demonize the religious right when they can in the press. Have you been living under a rock???\n \n \n2) I won't deny you your religious rights if you wo'nt deny me my civil rights.\n\n \n I agree 100%, which is why I have consistently said you should get couples' benefits.\n \n \n3) I won't have sex in public if you won't. I won't hold hands in public with the one I love if you won't either. I won't kiss my partner in public if you won't kiss your partner in public too.\n\n \n You can do whatever you want in this regard. You don't have to answer to me. And I an free to feel it is immoral if I want. No one here is trying to prevent you from doing these things. It seems you have a problem separating the legal issue from the cultural/moral one. I'm not out to prevent you from doing these things. But that doesn't mean I can't disagree from a moral standpoint and it doesn't mean you get to say I can't disagree with you morally.\n \n \n4) I won't impose my religious beliefs on you if you won't impose your's on me.\n\n \n Of course.\n \n \nAs far as getting physically ill, the mere thought of having sex with ANY straight man does that to me.\n\n \n Then there is no reason you should not believe homophobia is genetic.\n \n \nMarriage: You must feel very insecure if you feel threatened by (according to your assumption) less than 1% of the global population using the same word to describe their committed relationship as you use. Since it IS THE SAME, why invent a new defintion for it?\n\n \n If it were the same, you'd be marrying an opposite-sex partner. Since you are not, it is clearly not the same. Why would you think my position has anything to do with insecurity? That's just your ad hominem nature talking.\n \n Now, let's get back to the topic of this thread.\n \n Do you have any reasons why homophobia would be anything other than genetic?
