When I was done, it only took about an hour for the sediment to settle completely with the densest sediment at the bottom and the least dense at the top.\n\n \n What does this prove - sediment settles in the presence of gravity. You say that this correlates with flood - sure fine atop coarse. But throughout the world there are many beds where we find this type of grading repeated in the stratigraphy, such as the upwards fining beds of the Tabernas basin in Spain, or the Upwards fining oolitic shoals of the Wessex-Weald basin. How are there numerous of these events? Were there thousands of floods in the past 6000 years?\n \n \n \nThis second point can also be explained by the Genesis flood. The waters were strong enough to churn everything so much that everything got completely mixed up.\n\n \n Hummocky cross stratification like most bed forms are not formed by a chaotic dumping or churning of sediment, but by a regular flow regime. In this case, hummocks are formed by the base of waves in the storm.washed part of the beach. The formation of bedforms is a well understood process, used commonly by the nice people in the oil industry to determine reservoir setting and hence to deduce oil reservoir porosity. You would NOT find them in a flood deposit. The flood is not a catch all explanation for any sedimentary structure you like. \n \n You assume a flood caused by the graduall accumulation of rainwater would be erosive and would churn up vast quantities of sediment? Why? I Would expect the only result of a huge body of standing water on the earths surface to be a thin, fine grained band of marine sediment, more or less free of any sedimentary structure, but full of a chaotic assemblage of both marine and terrestrial fauna, found across the world. \n \n Needless to say, we do not find this. \n \n Geological evidence for the Flood - none",
