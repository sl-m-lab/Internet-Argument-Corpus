   "On the religion forum there are various threads where theistic worldviews (religions) are accused of being responsible for great amounts of evil (ex, the crusades, 9/11). I'm not going to debate that because as has been pointed out time and again it is faulty reasoning to judge any worldview by those who contradict its teachings (in that followers of Islam indicate that the terrorist extremists go against the true teachings of Islam, Christians testify that the crusaders and KKK stood in defiance to the peaceful teachings of Jesus, etc.).\n Note: For those who will be immediately inclined to dispute that 9/11 was against Islamic teaching or that the crusades were antithetical to Christian doctrine, please establish your complaints in new threads on the religion forum. This thread is about naturalism, and I have presented this debate concerning theism only as an introduction--let's avoid getting sidetracked.\n \n So, coming to the point:\n I have heard it said that the holocaust and the other atrocities of Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin were perfectly consistent outworkings of a naturalistic worldview--not that these things were the NECESSARY consequence of holding that worldview, but that they are outworkings consistent with naturalism and acceptable within its framework. If true, this stands in radical contrast to the violences done in the name of various theistic groups which were not consistent with their worldview. Would any naturalists care to dispute this? If not, does it bother you?",

   "Good old Wikipedia provides a good starting point:\n \n \nNaturalism is any of several philosophical stances, typically those descended from materialism and pragmatism, that do not distinguish the supernatural from nature. Naturalism does not claim that phenomena or hypotheses commonly labeled as supernatural necessarily do not exist or are wrong, but insists that they are not inherently different from any other phenomena or hypotheses, and that all phenomena and hypotheses can be studied by the same methods.\n \n Any method of inquiry or investigation or any procedure for gaining knowledge that limits itself to natural, physical, and material approaches and explanations can be described as naturalistic.\n \n Distinctions are sometimes made between two approaches, the first being methodological naturalism or scientific naturalism, and the second ontological naturalism or metaphysical naturalism. The first approach underlies the application of the scientific method in science, which makes the methodological assumption that observable events in nature are explained only by natural causes without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural. The second approach refers to the metaphysical assumption that the natural world is all that exists.\n \n This distinction between approaches to the philosophy is particularly made by those involved in the creation-evolution controversy. Proponents of Creationism or intelligent design often refer to methodological naturalism as scientific materialism or as methodological materialism to distinguish it from their preferred approach of a revived natural philosophy which welcomes supernatural explanations for natural phenomena.\nAnd, of course, it is ickily complex.",
