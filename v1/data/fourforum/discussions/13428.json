   "An honest creationist, in the mold of Kurt Wise.\n\n \n Honest? It doesn't make sense. He's saying evolution is true, but he doesn't believe it. emoticon_confused\n \n Let's look at the whole thing;\n \n \n \n \nI hope this doesn't turn into a rant, but it might. You have been warned.\n \n Evolution is not a theory in crisis. It is not teetering on the verge of collapse. It has not failed as a scientific explanation. There is evidence for evolution, gobs and gobs of it. It is not just speculation or a faith choice or an assumption or a religion. It is a productive framework for lots of biological research, and it has amazing explanatory power. There is no conspiracy to hide the truth about the failure of evolution. There has really been no failure of evolution as a scientific theory. It works, and it works well. \n\n \n It's too bad he's not here. I'd like to ask him if he's talking about 'change over time', or if he's talking about 'common descent'. \n \n \nI say these things not because I'm crazy or because I've \"converted\" to evolution. I say these things because they are true. I'm motivated this morning by reading yet another clueless, well-meaning person pompously declaring that evolution is a failure. People who say that are either unacquainted with the inner workings of science or unacquainted with the evidence for evolution. (Technically, they could also be deluded or lying, but that seems rather uncharitable to say. Oops.) \n\n \n What if they say 'change over time' has more evidence than does godless 'common descent'? Too many evolutionists seem to begin a philosophy about common descent and call it 'evolution', then when called on it, switch to scientific facts about change over time. At least we can narrow them down further than he does in his evaluation. They're not well meaning, and they're not deluded. But they could be lying. emoticon_xangel\n \n \nCreationist students, listen to me very carefully: There is evidence for evolution, and evolution is an extremely successful scientific theory. That doesn't make it ultimately true, and it doesn't mean that there could not possibly be viable alternatives. \n\n \n He said it's \"true\" above, and here he says it's NOT \"ultimately true\". \n \n I think the word \"evidence\" is a commonly mis-used term. Evidence should transcend worldviews. If one worldview calls something 'evidence', and another worldview calls it 'opinion', or 'theory', its status as actual evidence is on shaky ground. \n \n \nIt is my own faith choice to reject evolution, because I believe the Bible reveals true information about the history of the earth that is fundamentally incompatible with evolution. \n\n \n Information vs evidence? Does one trump the other? Are they equal? \n \n \nI am motivated to understand God's creation from what I believe to be a biblical, creationist perspective. Evolution itself is not flawed or without evidence. Please don't be duped into thinking that somehow evolution itself is a failure. Please don't idolize your own ability to reason. Faith is enough. If God said it, that should settle it. Maybe that's not enough for your scoffing professor or your non-Christian friends, but it should be enough for you. \n\n \n So neither is a failure, and neither is ultimately true. emoticon_confused In reality, one is true and one is false. Faith isn't enough, when they clash politically. One will lose, and one will win. \n \n There is a huge gap in this persons reasoning. Why is it that atheists seem to have more respect for this type of creationist than they do for others - others who don't regard what atheists in science produce as unquestionable evidence? \n \n It seems to be the same for Kurt Wise. A quick google search turns up these Dawkins remarks about Mr. Wise;\n \n \n \nDawkins; \"Creation \"scientists\" have more need than most of us to parade their degrees and qualifications, but it pays to look closely at the institutions that awarded them and the subjects in which they were taken. Those vaunted Ph.D.s tend to be in subjects such as marine engineering or gas kinetics rather than in relevant disciplines like zoology or geology. And often they are earned not at real universities, but at little-known Bible colleges deep in Bush country.\" \n\n \n Deep in Bush country, okay. \n \n \nDawkins; \"There are, however, a few shining exceptions. Kurt Wise now makes his living at Bryan College (motto \"Christ Above All\") located in Dayton, Tennessee, home of the famed Scopes trial. And yet, he originally obtained an authentic degree in geophysics from the University of Chicago, followed by a Ph.D. in geology from Harvard, no less, where he studied under (the name is milked for all it is worth in creationist propaganda) Stephen Jay Gould. \" \n\n \n Yes, \"shining exceptions\", the University of Chicago, deep in Obama country!! That's where true science comes from, isn't it Dawkins? Politics has nothing to do with science, does it Dawkins? He goes on to say; \n \n \nWise stands out among young earth creationists not only for his impeccable education, but because he displays a modicum of scientific honesty and integrity. \n\n \n So there's no question he admires him more than he does a creationist like Henry Morris or Phillip Johnson. Further down though, he says this;\n \n \nKurt Wise doesn't need the challenge; he volunteers that, even if all the evidence in the universe flatly contradicted Scripture, and even if he had reached the point of admitting this to himself, he would still take his stand on Scripture and deny the evidence. This leaves me, as a scientist, speechless. I cannot imagine what it must be like to have a mind capable of such doublethink. \n\n \n Morris and Johnson don't have minds capable of such doublethink! Why does he say Wise displays \"honesty and integrity\"? Why do atheists admire creationists who make no sense? ",

Nobody pretends that any alternative provides a reasonable path of how life went unguided from simple chemicals to proteins to basic life forms. \n\n \n That's exactly right, there was an optimism for decades that Darwinism would completely destroy religion. Abiogenesis held the key - successful experimentation, just a step beyond the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment was thought to be just around the corner. Just so there's no doubt about what abiogenesis actually is, let's look at dictionary.com;\n \n \nAbiogenesis; the now discredited theory that living organisms can arise spontaneously from inanimate matter; spontaneous generation. \n\n \n There is no question that abiogenesis is about natural processes - the spontaneous origin of life through natural processes. Websters dictionary also defines it just that way. Yet we find this at talkorigins! \n \n \nAbiogenesis is a fact. Regardless of how you imagine it happened (note that creation is a theory of abiogenesis), it is a fact that there once was no life on earth and that now there is. Thus, even if evolution needs abiogenesis, it has it. \n\n \n I'm not noting that creation is a theory of abiogenesis, because it is not, at least not yet. What we have is an atheistic scientific community that is trying to redefine the word \"abiogenesis\", since it didn't work out for them. The claim that creation is a theory of abiogenesis is just as big of a LIE as saying evolution and abiogenesis don't have a thing to do with each other. \n \n This webpage explains it very neatly, though I think it's a little to polite to the liars at talkorigins. This paragraph is the most important I think;\n \n \nThe only explanation allowed in the evolutionary mindset is a natural one. So the very first creation of life, that first bit of genetic information, is very important in seeing where the naturalistic process of evolution can go, because if nature can produce the life code from the start, then that can give evidence that nature may also be able to produce more new genetic information to form the diverse kinds of living organisms on this planet. So the ideas of abiogenesis and evolution may not be as separate as the Talk Origins author would have us believe. And it is not so difficult to follow on from that and show from this that if nature cannot get genetic information started in the first place to form life, then it probably wouldn't have much chance or any chance at all of creating new information in the first living creatures evolution believes in to form the diversity in all of life today. \n\n \n That whole page is a good read, but the bottom line is this - the agenda in today's atheistic scientific community seems to be to claim that \"evolution can stand on its own\", all the while shouting from the rooftops that creation can also be considered abiogenesis, hoping to get a change in the definition of the word, so that \"abiogenesis\" can still be speculated on in science textbooks, in a godless way of course. All the while keeping ID out. It will be interesting to see if they can pull it off.",

Deeper than Sheol--what can you know? Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. ...These are indeed but the outskirts of His ways. How small a whisper do we hear of Him!

Rom 11.33\n Eternal\n God is eternal. He is OUTSIDE of time. He is free from \"duration\" or \"succession\" of time.\n \n God had no beginning. He is \"uncaused\" because He has always existed.\n \n God has no end. He can never cease to exist. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God. Ps 90.2\n \n Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever.

It denotes that *time* has NO applicability to God.] 2 Pet 3.8\n God is Spirit. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. John 4:24\n \n Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 2 Cor 3.17\n Invisible\n Since God is Spirit, He is invisible.\n \n However, God can *cause* Himself to be visible in any form He chooses. For examples, God appeared as...\n \n A man (Gen 18.1-2)\n A pillar of fire by night, and a pillar of cloud by day. (Exod 13.21)\n No one has seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.\n John 1.18\n \n Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. 1 Tim 1.17\n Immaterial\n Since God is Spirit, He does not have a material, physical body...\n \n Thus, God cannot be represented by an image of ANY shape.\n Neither can God be represented by any picture.\n You saw no form of any kind the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully, so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman, or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air, or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below. Deu 4.15-18\n \n [Jesus said...] a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see Me have. Lk 24.39b\n Incomprehensible\n We cannot fully comprehend the nature and being of the one God. This is true because, as shown in preceding panels...\n \n We are mortal whereas God is immortal\n We are finite whereas God is infinite\n We are temporal [bounded by time] whereas God is eternal [unbounded by time]\n We are physical beings whereas God is a Spirit\n We best understand that which we can see or portray. God cannot be seen. Neither can He be portrayed by any physical representation.\n Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; And His greatness is unsearchable. Ps 145.3\n \n \"My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,\" says the LORD. \"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.\" Isa 55.8-9\n \n O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how inscrutable His ways! For who has known the mind of the LORD? Or who has become His counselor? Rom 11.33-34\n \n God is not a man that He should lie, neither the son of man that He should repent. Has He said, and shall He not do it? Or has He spoken, and shall He not make it good? Num 23.19\n Reveals Himself\n Although God is beyond our total comprehension [for reasons given above], He has revealed Himself and His purposes to us, to the fullest degree that we are able to receive and understand them.\n \n Moreover, God has *equipped* us to recognize and relish the beauty and wonder of Himself and His creation. God reveals Himself in His creation\n The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork.

   "Because your \"definition\" was so long I have to split it into two posts. \nHaven't you said many times that you were raised in the christian faith and that you are very familiar with my protestant belief system as defined in the bible?\n\n I am familiar with many definitions of God. I needed you to give the one you completely agree with. The problem is that when you ask a theist to explain, identify or define God, they start off with a definition that, once it is disproven, immediately shifts it into another definition. Which is what you're going to be doing after I reply. \n \n I'm going to show you why your God, based on your rather exhaustive definition, doesn't exist. And you're going to have to refine your definition in apologetic defense. This could go on for infinity, but maybe you'll get the point. Or, I could have you rethink your definition and come up with something more precise, and we'll start from the beginning. Your call. \n \n But if you need Gods character and nature defined, here it is. This is who the God of the bible, the Creator is:\n [INDENT][SIZE=&quot;2&quot;][FONT=&quot;Georgia&quot;][COLOR=&quot;Navy&quot;]\n \n There is only 1 God\n He is the living God\n Source of all life\n Immortal\n Infinite\n Eternal\n \n Spirit\n Invisible\n Immaterial\n Incomprehensible\n He reveals Himself\n \n\n Ok, you say that God is incomprehensible, yet\n you attempt to explain his nature, and you say that he reveals himself. How can something that is impossible to understand be understood?\n \n \nGod is a person\n Immutable -- unchanging\n NOT impassible or unyielding\n Outgoing -- God WITH you\n Omnipresent: present everywhere\n Omnipotent: all-powerful\n Self-control\n Omniscient: all-knowing\n Wise\n Holy\n \n\n You say that God is a spirit, and that he is unchanging, then you say that he is a person. Self-contradictory. Either God can change from spirit to person, or he cannot. Pick one. \n \n \nONE God\n There is one God and ONLY one God.\n \n The doctrine of the Trinity of God does NOT mean that there are three Gods. No, no, never!\n \n The Bible is very clear that there is one God and ONLY one God.\n \n\n Actually the bible makes it clear that there were many gods, and at the point in time when Abraham selected Yahweh to be his God, he was aware of the existence of the many other gods that were worshiped in the surrounding regions. In fact, the bible never claims that Yahweh was the one and only god until deep in the new testament. Yeah, some israelites may have considered Yahweh their only god, but so did the canaanites of Baal, and so on. \n \n \n\n Who is God, except the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God? 2 Sam 22.32\n \n [God said...] Before Me there was no God formed, nor shall there be after Me. I, even I, am the LORD, and besides Me there is no savior. Isa 43.10b - 11\n \n [God said...] Is there a God besides Me? Indeed there is no other Rock; I know not one. Isa 44.8b\n \n [God said...] I am the LORD, and there is no other; There is no God besides Me. Isa 45.5a\n \n There is none other God but one. 1 Cor 8.4c\n \n God is one. Gal 3.20b\n God is living and true. You turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God 1 Thes 1.9b\n \n The LORD is the true God. He is the living God and the everlasting King. Jer 10.10a\n \n\n The idea of Yahweh being the one and only God evolved as time went on. Nobody was making these claims before the exodus period. In fact, on the way out of egypt the israelites themselves created and worshipped other gods after they got fed up of being led by moses. \n \nGod is life...\n \n God is the source of all life.\n God sustains the existence of His creation.\n It is ONLY by God's will that the Universe and its life forms continue to exist.\n All matter and all life consist IN God. That is, apart from God continually *remembering* His universe, it would instantly cease to exist.\n The LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into His nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being. Gen 2.7\n \n For by Him [Lord Jesus] all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist. Col 1.16-17\n \n For with You [God] is the fountain of life; in Your light we see light. Ps 36.9\n \n Nor is He [God] worshiped with men's hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things. Acts 17.25\n \n As the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself, and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man. John 5.26-27\n \n\n By this it can also be argued that God allows everything that lives to live, and everything that exists to exist, and everything that does everything to do everything. So God allows rapists and murderers to commit their crimes, and allows people to do whatever they want to do with no influence from himself. By occam's razor, such a God does not exist. \n \nImmortal\n God is immortal. He cannot die. He cannot cease to exist. Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.\n 1 Tim 1.17\n \n God alone has immortality, dwelling in light which cannot be approached, whom no one of men have seen, nor can see; to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen. 1 Tim 6.16\n Infinite\n God is infinite in being and perfection. Will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold! The heaven and the heavens of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this house which I have built? 1 Kings 8.27\n \n Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty? It is higher than heaven--what can you do? Deeper than Sheol--what can you know? Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. ...These are indeed but the outskirts of His ways. How small a whisper do we hear of Him! But the thunder of His power who can understand? Job 11.7-9, 26.14\n \n\n Again, not only are you claiming that God cannot be understood, but that he exists without a beginning or an end. So how can these things be known and at the same time cannot be known? Quite self contradictory.",

The bible is a book, written by people. And the bible is what tells us that the bible is true. If, based on what the bible says, we are to accept that God revealed (not reveals) himself, then why not, based on what any other book says about any other story, or any other unidentifiable supernatural being revealing itself, and claiming in that very book that its true, should we also believe that those other written things are just as true? I have a serious problem with the idea that the only possible source of evidence that God reveals himself comes from the very ancient and reinterpreted and retranslated hand-me-down stories of people who had no clue about the true nature of the world. And worse, these revelations seems to have ceased (or so goes the claim) beyond the writing of the bible. So the bible makes itself the exclusive source for evidence of God's revelation, yet other books that talk about the revelation of the naturee of, say, vampires, elves and dragons, should be discredited as myths, because the only evidence we have of the revelations of these things are books, written by people. Hmmmm.....\n \n \nNow given this description of Gods character, attributes and nature which is supported by His word as confirmation of my claims, prove to me that this definition is false or that God doesn't exist and that He doesn't represent this description of Him.

You simply cut and pasted an entire webpage of vague and sefl-contradictory attributes (which I expected), which doesn't do a good job of precisely defining God, but moreso only confuses the situation because of all the discrepancies and impossibilities of such a \"definition\". \n \n So now make with the apologetics, recants, clarifications and revisions, if you want.",

And not only do your stupid and rhetorical questions not disprove Him, but you cannot prove He doesn't exist. And if you consider anything you have said here evidence of anything, then that explains why you accept the so called evidence for evolution and accept it as rational since your threshold for evidence is so incredibly low so as to be nonexistent.\n \n \nI'm going to show you why your God, based on your rather exhaustive definition, doesn't exist. And you're going to have to refine your definition in apologetic defense. This could go on for infinity, but maybe you'll get the point. Or, I could have you rethink your definition and come up with something more precise, and we'll start from the beginning. Your call.\n\n \n I'm here to tell you that nothing in this post is evidence of anything regarding your alleged non-existence of God.\n \n \n Ok, you say that God is incomprehensible, yet\n you attempt to explain his nature, and you say that he reveals himself. How can something that is impossible to understand be understood?\n\n \n God can be understood according to the limits of our ability to comprehend Him. But we can't fully comprehend Him and we have no issue with admitting and acknowledging that. And I marvel at your simplistic confusion since you will not hesitate to explain the big bang to me as if it, an event which allegedly occurred between 14 and 20 billion years ago, happened only yesterday. And when I question its reality, you have no qualms about doubting my intellectual capacity. \n \n Why do you so easily accept something offered by men but deny that which is declared to be Gods own word? \n \n \nYou say that God is a spirit, and that he is unchanging, then you say that he is a person. Self-contradictory. Either God can change from spirit to person, or he cannot. Pick one.\n\n \n \n Not contradictory at all. I can say the exact same thing about you and I will be just as right since you were created in Gods image. How sad that you don't even understand that you are also both spirit and flesh just as the God who made you is. And what about your ignorant responses to my definition of God is evidence of anything which disproves His existence? Since when is spewing your atheistic denials evidence of anything at all?\n \n \n Actually the bible makes it clear that there were many gods, and at the point in time when Abraham selected Yahweh to be his God, he was aware of the existence of the many other gods that were worshiped in the surrounding regions. In fact, the bible never claims that Yahweh was the one and only god until deep in the new testament. Yeah, some israelites may have considered Yahweh their only god, but so did the canaanites of Baal, and so on. \n\n \n Ahh, more lies and distortions of the truth, I see. The bible is clear that there are many false gods, idols and man made images of nonexistent gods which men bow before. And Yahweh, the one true God has stated over and over how much He hates idolatry and the worship of false gods. But I challenge you to quote the bible ever attributing Baal for example, with equal status or power of Yahweh as a living God. \n \n The reality is that baal is in fact satan, the god of this world with none of the powers or attributes of God as described in my definition. \n \n \nThe idea of Yahweh being the one and only God evolved as time went on. Nobody was making these claims before the exodus period. In fact, on the way out of egypt the israelites themselves created and worshipped other gods after they got fed up of being led by moses.\n\n \n Really? Wasn't Abraham before Moses? And the whole Genesis account of God revealing Himself to Abraham when He made the covenant with the chosen people through him? Doesn't the history of and survival of this dispersed and persecuted people say anything to you about that covenant and Gods hand which has preserved them in spite of the persecutions they have suffered throughout history? \n \n Also, since when, when discussing if God is real or not do we refer to the worst among us as evidence that He doesn't exist as you do by referring to the faithless jews who made a golden calf after 400 years of egyptian slavery? Have you no appreciation that they were returning to the beliefs of their roots after living in a pagan land for 400 years? So how does that prove that God didn't or doesn't exist? Really paulie, if this is the depth of your reasoning, no wonder you can't see that God is real since your rational and critical mind is seriously lacking.\n \n \n By this it can also be argued that God allows everything that lives to live, and everything that exists to exist, and everything that does everything to do everything. So God allows rapists and murderers to commit their crimes, and allows people to do whatever they want to do with no influence from himself. By occam's razor, such a God does not exist.\n\n \n Balderdash on all counts. You say that because God truly honors us be allowing us the free will He created us with is evidence that He doesn't exist? So one of the character attributes which defines who God is and who He says He is, is evidence that He doesn't exist to you? And that in your mind is rational and convincing evidence that He is nonexistent? I thought you were going to offer actual evidence that God doesn't exist paulie? I supported every single attribute I applied to Him with scriptural support as evidence of who God is and all I get from you are atheistic talking points and juvenile denials which criticize the very in depth explanation of who God is which I posted? Please paulie, come back when you have spiritual insights which can see past your shallow world view.\n \n \n Again, not only are you claiming that God cannot be understood, but that he exists without a beginning or an end. So how can these things be known and at the same time cannot be known? Quite self contradictory.\n\n \n I can know these things without being able to comprehend them in their fulness just like you claim to know the origins and evolution of life on earth without being able to see past your own time on earth. The only difference between us is that my faith is in the living God of all Creation and your faith is in Man, His creation. That you can't see how misplaced your faith is, is your greatest error in life and will be your eternal downfall if God is unable to reach you before your life ends here in this flesh. And I say this flesh because that spirit you are so ignorant of will most assuredly live for ever and a day. WHERE is up to you paulie. All I can do is warn you of the dead end road you are traveling down. emoticon_xangel",

   "Abiogensis is a fact. There was one time on the planet earth that there wasn't life, and now there is. Some people believe that this abiogenesis event happened because an imaginary deity blew air into dirt to make man. \n\n \n Abiogenesis is not defined as \"the origin of life on earth no matter how it happened\". It is defined as an unguided chemical process over a long period of time that caused life to spontaneously appear with no guidance. It is a naturalistic process. I know you and Q don't believe me, so let's have a look at some sources;\n \n Merriam Webster;\n \n \"the supposed spontaneous origination of living organisms directly from lifeless matter.\"\n \n abiogenesis - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary\n \n Now lets look at what Merriam Webster says about the word spontaneous;\n \n \"...acting or activated without deliberation - developing or occurring without apparent external influence, force, cause, or treatment\"\n \n spontaneous - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary\n \n Dictionary.com - abiogenesis;\n \"the now discredited theory that living organisms can arise spontaneously from inanimate matter; spontaneous generation.\"\n \n I'll admit, it's questionable that it's now discredited. But it's not questionable that it means spontaneous. From Dictionary.com's other sources;\n \n American Heritage;\n \"The supposed development of living organisms from nonliving matter. Also called autogenesis, spontaneous generation.\"\n \n Medical dictionary;\n \"the supposed spontaneous origination of livingorganisms directly from lifeless matter called also spontaneous generation.\"\n \n Encyclopedia Britannica\n \"the hypothetical process by which living organisms develop from nonliving matter; also, the archaic theory that utilizes this process to explain the origin of life. Pieces of cheese and bread wrapped in rags and left in a dark corner, for example, were thus thought to produce mice, according to this theory, because after several weeks, there were mice in the rags. Many believed in spontaneous generation because it explained such occurrences as the appearance of maggots on decaying meat.\"\n \n Life being supernaturally created by a process above and beyond human understanding  is not an abiogenesis event. Talkorigins says, \"(note that creation is a theory of abiogenesis) Why should I note it? All indications are that they pulled that statement out of thin air - they obviously didn't check what the word actually means. They don't \"note\" any assertions by religious people or ID proponents, why should anyone \"note\" their assertions? What makes them superior? \n \n \nOther look at the evidence, and see that self replicating organic molecules can occur in the kind of environment that it appears that the early earth had, and have come to conclusions based on that. \n\n \n I know they do, but it's atheism, not science. \n \n \nFirst, there was the simple fact of the tremendous amount of supposition involved in the original Miller-Urey experiments. Yes, the experiment successfully produced some amino acids, but it did so only as a result of the use of an atmosphere specifically engineered to yield amino acids, since simple molecules containing all the needed atoms were conveniently provided. Evolutionists justify the use of this atmosphere on the basis of their claim that the \"early earth\" had a reducing atmosphere (one lacking oxygen or other oxidising agents). Yet, the sole reason that this reducing atmosphere is proposed is so that they can then use it to justify their theories! Instead of searching for evidence and then revising their theories to the data, they were (and are) engineering the (proposed) conditions to yield the data they desired. The \"reducing atmosphere\" of the early earth is completely an evolutionist construct. Evolutionists themselves will make the circular argument that the earth must have had an early reducing atmosphere, since we know that chemical evolution happened, and chemical evolution could only happen in a reducing atmosphere2! In point of fact, there is absolutely no evidence that the earth has ever had a reducing atmosphere at any time, and the available evidence suggests the opposite3. Even the oldest rock layers in the geologic column, those said by evolutionary geologists to predate the formation of life on earth, all show evidence that the earth had an oxidising atmosphere at the time of their formation, due to the presence of oxidised minerals and metals contained in those rocks. \n\n \n The Myth of Abiogenesis\n \n I know you and Q can poison the well, but can you refute what this says about a reducing atmosphere? \n \n \nWhile it is not 'proof' by any means, it certainly has more evidence that this supernatural being waving his imaginary hands to 'create' life.\n\n \n It sure isn't proof, and as long as ID is politically blocked as science, abiogenesis is equally not science.",

The material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully, and critically considered.\"\n \n Tame, when compared to the abiogenesis title headings in textbooks that I showed.

That'd be a first.\n \n \nI know you won&#8217;t be bothered, because you suspect that if a deep, thorough scientific study were done on early earth conditions, with widely publicized results, an oxidizing atmosphere on the early earth would make more scientific sense than a reducing one.\n\n I won't be bothered because, as usual, you offer no evidence to support your assertions.

When instead of offering proof for their position, they attempt to tear down their opponents position. I have yet to see you post positive evidence in support of creationism. Instead, you try to equate evolution with atheism in order to put it in the same playing field as religion, and you attempt to tie it to an hypothesis in order to make it seem unsupported. \n \n \nAS IS INTELLIGENT DESIGN.\n\n So ID has research under way? Good to hear! Where is it?\n \n \nOnly unlike abiogenesis, it hasn't been going backwards recently as new scientific facts are discovered.\n\n You've stated this multiple times. Where are these \"new scientific facts\" that have been discovered that are crushing abiogenesis research?\n \n \nIt&#8217;s an interesting avenue of research to non-atheists.\n\n Which would be true, if there were research being done. There isn't. It's a PR campaign.\n \n \nIf It is not science, then abiogenesis is not science.\n\n How do you figure that? One is thoroughly grounded in materialism, research is being done, results are recorded, and hypotheses are reworked to take into account the experimental data. The other says \"goddidit!\" and issues press releases complaining of bias.\n \n \nIf ID is not allowed to be science simply because it&#8217;s interesting, then abiogenesis shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to be science simply because it&#8216;s interesting.\n\n Are you for real?\n \n \nDo you know what the words &#8220;double standard&#8221; mean?\n\n Yes, but I'm beginning to wonder if you know what any of the words we've been discussing mean.\n \n And the rest of the post is the usual-Weaseling, insults, and avoidance.

   "Then as I said, email them. \n\n \n Well, THIS is where the discussion forum is. TO does not have a provision for ongoing debate, and it wouldn't matter much if they did, since this forum has a far larger variety of evolutionists, every once in a while, we even find an honest one here. Not often though. And I'm not exactly surrounded by them now. \n \n \nI know this has been explained to you numerous times. Spontaneous generation was the idea that maggots arose from rotting meat, mold from bread, etc. This is in no way similar to the hypothesis of abiogenesis. \n\n \n This was explained very thoroughly in post #60. The way you want things to be does not automatically trump what's actually shown in dictionary definitions, or how words are actually used in society. \n \n \nQuestionable as in \"There is evidence that the early earth atmosphere was not reducing\", or questionable as in \"I don't believe it to be true!\"? \n\n \n The first one - \"there is evidence that the early earth atmosphere was not reducing\". Actual science should equally weigh ALL evidence, not toss out whatever doesn't fit an atheist worldview. \n \n \nHow is it you and Archie consistently are incapable of recognizing references? \n\n \n Is a long list of biased evolutionist titles & names supposed to be impressive? \n \n \nThey have detail? That'd be a first. \n\n \n I've no doubt that there's a vast difference between what actually exists vs what you notice.\n \n \nI won't be bothered because, as usual, you offer no evidence to support your assertions. If you want to use ICR and AiG as support, go hard, but their idea of \"evidence\" is to say \"and that's the way it must have been, 'cuz the bible sez so!\" \n\n \n See above - there's more detail to what they say than you give them credit for. \n \n \nYou know how you can tell when someone has a weak position Marc? \n\n \n Yes, when they declare something is not worth their time and they're not coming back, yet they keep coming back, more and more angry every time. \n \n \n When instead of offering proof for their position, they attempt to tear down their opponents position. \n\n \n Like this? \n \n \n Originally posted by tq] How is it you and Archie consistently are incapable of recognizing references? \n\n \n \n I have yet to see you post positive evidence in support of creationism. \n\n \n I don't claim to support scientific creationism. I claim to support scientific ID, and I've posted plenty of positive evidence for it. In recent threads from only a few weeks ago, to older threads from a couple of years ago. \n \n \nInstead, you try to equate evolution with atheism in order to put it in the same playing field as religion, and you attempt to tie it to an hypothesis in order to make it seem unsupported. \n\n \n Evolution is used as a weapon against religion, so it is on the same playing field as religion. Evolution IS tied to abiogenesis. They both involve the slow process of increased order over long periods of time, and they are taught side by side in science textbooks, as I've shown. Evolution requires basic life to be in place at its beginning, and that basic life goes with godless abiogenesis far better than it goes with any religion that's relevant to western society. \n \n \nSo ID has research under way? Good to hear! Where is it? \n \n You've stated this multiple times. Where are these \"new scientific facts\" that have been discovered that are crushing abiogenesis research? \n\n \n Yes, I've stated it multiple times - the increasing discoveries of new complexity in the simplest forms of life. Why do you keep asking? \n \n \nWhich would be true, if there were research being done. There isn't. It's a PR campaign. \n\n \n It's been politically blocked from the public scientific realm. It can't possibly do research, and publish it, at the quantity sufficient to meet an arbitrarily set quantity required by the 95% atheist scientific community. They do some research - not all of it is laid before rabid atheists for political attack. The claim that ID is 100% PR and 0% research is false. \n \n \nHow do you figure that? One is thoroughly grounded in materialism, research is being done, results are recorded, and hypotheses are reworked to take into account the experimental data. \n\n \n That's strange - above, you said this;\n \n \nOriginally posted by tq] Abiogenesis is an hypothesis at this point-it's an interesting avenue of research. That's it, that's all.\n\n \n WHICH IS IT? \n \n \n \n The other says \"goddidit!\" and issues press releases complaining of bias. \n\n \n Is the scientific community not updating these boring put-downs of ID? \n \n \nSo contemporary arguments for intelligent design in both biology and the physical sciences are not only testable; they make predictions and are falsifiable in principle. Of course, if the arguments are true, then they are falsifiable only in principle, but not in fact (hardly a weakness in a scientific theory). We have given only two examples here. There are many other design arguments in biology, origin-of-life studies, and paleontology that are also empirically testable and that make predictions. Therefore, honest commentators should stop claiming that ID is empirically untestable, or that it makes no predictions. The claim itself has been tested and falsified. It's time to move on to other and more pertinent aspects of the debate over intelligent design. \n\n \n Evolution News & Views: Intelligent Design is Empirically Testable and Makes Predictions\n \n \nAre you for real? \n\n \n Yes, I'll ask again, is abiogenesis \"interesting, that's it, that's all\", or is \"research being done, with results recorded, and experimental data noted? \n \n Research, results, hypothesis, experiments are comparable in abiogenesis vs ID. Only one of them being done in the public realm by the scientific community, doesn't mean they aren't comparable. \n \n \nYes, but I'm beginning to wonder if you know what any of the words we've been discussing mean. \n \n And the rest of the post is the usual-Weaseling, insults, and avoidance. Actually, that was the whole post. \n\n \n Again, pot, meet kettle. \n \n \nHey Admin-this is why your membership consists of the lunatic fringe.

The way you want things to be does not automatically trump what&#8217;s actually shown in dictionary definitions, or how words are actually used in society. \n\n Interesting point, since you are the one trying to redefine abiogenesis. Are you honestly going to state that the modern research into abiogenesis is identical to the discredited idea that organisms spring fully formed from inanimate matter in the manner I stated?\n \n \nThe first one &#8211; &#8220;there is evidence that the early earth atmosphere was not reducing&#8221;.
