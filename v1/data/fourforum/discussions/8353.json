It looked as good at 54,000 miles when I sold it as when it came off the showroom floor at with 4 miles on the odometer. Was like a comfortable old shoe that just felt better every time I drove it. I would buy another if they still made them. And I've owned 52 vehicles in my lifetime. But it was my favorite by far. A perfect gem.",
