I have seen many gang shootings, turf shootings, rival drug dealer shootings etc., and they all have one thing in common. People with a warped sense of value where \"showing respect\" is more important than respecting life. The fact that these are rappers is really inconsequential. Here in Philly we have gang and drug shootings all of the time...for the same reason. They just don't get the same media coverage...because the local drug dealers are not rich or famous. \n \n Personally, I could care less if a group of rappers, drug dealers, gang members or whatever want to grab a bunch of guns and shoot it out. If someone is willing to shoot someone over \"respect\", I don't want to share my oxygen with them anyway. I just wish they could have a forum to do it in, say perhaps a large bulletproof room. Nothing Pi$$e$ me off more than a young child or some other innocent bystander getting caught in the crossfire. Unfortunately, it happens far too often.",
