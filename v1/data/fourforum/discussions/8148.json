   "If those that were so gung-ho pro-life actually CARED about the life they are rallying to see grown to term, I might not be so bitter.\n \n But the majority of those that whine and complain and denounce pro-choice movements as evil and barbaric and cruel to the wittle babies rarely stick around to help the mothers care for their newly liberated spawn. It seems to me that once the baby is born, the pro-life considers their job down and it's off to save the next expectant teenage mother from making a horrible mistake and adding a few more chips to the \"Hell\" side of the scale. Afterall, pro-lifers don't just save unwanted bundles of human genetic matieral with no memories, interests, bonds, personalities, etc... literally everything that distinguishes us from people in severre vegetative states.... why no! They also are saving souls!\n \n Except, what about fetus A, now baby A, who is wasting away in his teenage mother's crack hotel and abandoned in his play pen 18 hours a day because mommy is out hustling? I don't see these same pro-life groups rallying to protect and enrich the lives of the newly born, especially when the newly born in this scenario are those that exist solely as the result of \"peer pressure\" and the \"mother\" in question doesn't want the child to begin with....\n \n Knowing that, why aren't more pro-life groups interested in the fate of these unborn children once they are born? Too old? They lose that mystic caul or feathery dusting of snow-white lanugo, and what, they lose their charm?\n \n :xbanghead ALERT! The born who aren't wanted need just as much help, if not more, than the unborn that aren't wanted. These babies need to be rocked, held, cooed to, form early attachments, learn to feel loved...\n \n But wait, that's the mother's responsibility, right? So how come when it was the mother's responsibility to decide her own fate, so many pro-lifers decide they must interfere, but afterwards most of them seem more than content to let week old junior sink or swim of his own accord?\n \n If pro-lifers really cared about life and the QUALITY of life they were advocating I might have more respect for the general movement. And I am sure there are a few select individuals that do get involved and foster or adopt the unwanted children they helped bring into the world. But not enough do this, as indicated by ever growing rates of child abuse, neglect and abandonment.\n \n Tell me something, die hard pro-lifers. emoticon_xdonno Is it really more kind to bring a child into the world so that it can die of thirst in its crib a week before it's first birthday, as opposed to being terminated in the first month, before the basic pain receptors were even fully functioning?\n \n You tell me.\n \n AAW",

   "Let's clear up some things. Master Shake, I didn't say all Pro-Lifers didn't give a damn about born children (or non-Americans). I said most. And that, of course, is of the majority I have personally met, which you can not refute for the simple fact of being unnable to claim meeting the same people as I have.\n \n MOST.\n \n In short, if the parent doesn't want the unborn and you rally to keep it alive, you are in short the catalyst that brings that piece of tissue into the world and allows it to grow into a human being. It is your responsibility. Don't like that? Stop meddling in other people's affaris then.\n \n I use terms like \"spawn\" because they are accurate. I have found that many people on these boards don't seem to own dictionaries. :xbanghead There is nothing cruel or cold hearted about using scientific terms accurately. Here is the dictionary defintion of spawn *sighs*:\n \n entries found for spawn.\n spawn ( P ) Pronunciation Key (sp\u00f4n)\n n. \n The eggs of aquatic animals such as bivalve mollusks, fishes, and amphibians. \n Offspring occurring in numbers; brood. \n A person who is the issue of a parent or family. \n The source of something; a germ or seed. \n A product or an outcome. \n Mycelia of mushrooms or other fungi grown in specially prepared organic matter for planting in beds. \n \n v. spawned, spawn\u00b7ing, spawns \n v. intr.\n To deposit eggs; produce spawn. \n To produce offspring in large numbers. \n \n v. tr.\n To produce or deposit (spawn). \n To produce in large numbers. \n To give rise to; engender: tyranny that spawned revolt. \n To cause to spawn; bring forth; produce: a family that had spawned a monster. \n To plant with mycelia grown in specially prepared organic matter. \n \n ______________\n So you see, \"spawn\" is perfectly appropriate. It is even more appropriate in relation to the Dugger family.\n \n When I use terms like \"wittle babies\" I am trying to highlight the idiopcy of referring to first trimester embryos as \"children\" (most abortions are first trimester, after all, and no matter how many tragic third trimester partial abortion photos are posted doesn't change this fact).... first trimester embryos have about as much sensation and perception of pain as goldfish. By referring to them as wittle babies, I was trying to be ironic.\n \n At any rate, I think I have said it before, but I AM NOT MALE. I am FEMALE. That means I have two X chromosomes instead of an X and a Y, and because I have two X chromosomes I have slightly more genetic material which protects me from a lot of sex-related disorders (like hemophilia, which isn't exclusive to males but much more likely in males, ALD and countless other disorders).\n \n Be careful pointing fingers about lack of compassion. I am pro abortion. That does not mean I am not compassionate and to insinuate as much is disingenuous. I give blood every 56 days, am a volunteer to clean up natural biomes that have been destroyed by thoughtless humans, care for an abused cat that was going to be put to death (who is doing well, thanks), sponsor children overseas even though I am on disability and live on less than most people's car payments (after bills and rent), mentor at-risk youth and have allowed my body to be used be medical science in the search for a cervical cancer vaccine, which, while apparently harmless, could also have unexpected side effects (which is why I am called a human test subject). I don't get paid for any of the above. I do it because I want to make the world a better place. As far as I know, I dedicate about 80% of my waking hours, when I am not in college, working on philanthropic projects or projects to help non-human animals or the world. I wonder how much time the average pro-lifer gives to causes outside his immidiate church's urging, or those that aren't inspired by searching for cures (such as diabetes walks) because the pro-lifer in question has diabetes. I have met a lot of pro-lifers in my time who accuse me of lacking compassion, but when it comes to risking their health, safety and comfort to benefit someone else they have never met and probably never will meet, most, in MY experience, back out. Slap a pro-life sticker on the door, and go to bed feeling morally superior.\n \n So unless you're doing quite a bit more than me to relieve suffering and better the world, I'd be careful with the insinuations.\n \n Master Shake: I never said ALL pro-lifers behave as I earlier described. I said most, and, given that this is my personal opinion and not a scientific essay based on stats, those \"most\" reflect the pro-lifers I have met and gotten to know throughout my life. So don't take offense. If it doesn't apply to you, forget it.\n \n As for the person who commented that no children die of thirst in America. *laughs* Children die of neglect all the time, and one of the first things to kill a small child is lack of water.\n \n Besides that, I am not American. I tend to look at things a little more globally, instead of focusing on only \"my\" country. Countries are fictional. They do not exist in reality. Humans divide up the land and fight and wage wars, because we are territorial animals, but the actual divisions are fairly arbitrary. Maybe when you grow up, you'll realize that.\n \n Peace emoticon_xkill",

As I'm sure you would proudly proclaim, every woman has a choice in the matter, so the only catalysts for anything that happens to that child are the mother and father.\n It's tissue when it's brought into the world?

It is even more appropriate in relation to the Dugger family.\n\n I know it was technically accurate. I'm not 5 years old. You didn't use it because it was technically accurate. You used it for it's connotation. There are all sorts of terms you could have used that would have been accurate that don't have the same connotation. The only time the word \"spawn\" is really used in relation to humans is in phrases like \"Satan's spawn\" and the like. You knew how you were using it. I'm not going to assume you're an idiot, don't assume I am either. Let's not play games here.\n And why is \"spawn\" more appropriate with the Dugger family? Because they choose to have many children, their children are supposed to be reffered to as \"spawn\"?\n \nWhen I use terms like \"wittle babies\" I am trying to highlight the idiopcy of referring to first trimester embryos as \"children\" (most abortions are first trimester, after all, and no matter how many tragic third trimester partial abortion photos are posted doesn't change this fact).... first trimester embryos have about as much sensation and perception of pain as goldfish. By referring to them as wittle babies, I was trying to be ironic.\n\n I can't even begin to explain how poetic it is that you had a typo when trying to write \"idiocy.\" Thank you. You made my day. :) \n True pro-lifers oppose abortion on principle, so saying that discussing third trimester abortions doesn't relate to first trimester abortions misses the point entirely\n And, by the way, I knew you were trying to be ironic. I suppose \"trying\" would be the key word here because it failed.\n \nAt any rate, I think I have said it before, but I AM NOT MALE. I am FEMALE. That means I have two X chromosomes instead of an X and a Y, and because I have two X chromosomes I have slightly more genetic material which protects me from a lot of sex-related disorders (like hemophilia, which isn't exclusive to males but much more likely in males, ALD and countless other disorders).\n\n I never said I thought you were male. I never said I thought you were female. I never said or even implied anything about your gender, so I have no idea what this is a reaction to exactly.\n What does you being less likely to have hemophelia have to with anything?\n \nBe careful pointing fingers about lack of compassion.
