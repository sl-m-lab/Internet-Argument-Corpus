   "Turban Durbin\n \n Has Dick Durbin any shame? Though he repeatedly claims that he does not want Supreme Court nominee, John Roberts, to tell the world in explicit terms that he would negate Roe v Wade, he stated that he wants to know how Roberts feels about a Constitutional \"right to privacy\" and peripheral issues of the Roe decision. I am not sure which end of the jackass I was watching on this particular edition of Meet the Press. While Durbin and the liberal hordes would call for a public lynching of any conservative politician that supported a litmus test on abortion for judicial nominees, they have their own. Hypocrisy is alive and well in Washington.\n \n If you have time, visit Cobbtown Political Forum",
