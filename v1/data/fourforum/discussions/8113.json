Most are blue collar types, and most are not going to be winning any awards for cognative ability (if you know what I mean). I am not saying that you HAVE to be an ignorant redneck to support Bush, just that it helps enormously. \n \n Serously, what kind of XXXXX supports a president who has 200,000 US troops fighting to support a government that is hostile to us?

I've been physically threatened on two for pointing out administration failures. It gives the impression of taunting mad dogs behind a fence.\n\n \n Personally I avoid such forums for just that reason. I used to post on a lot of forums but have cut back significantly. I still enjoy posting here, and at one or two other politically oriented forums, and I was posting over at Whistle stopper, mostly slapping Missouri Mule around. I am currently banned from here for 2 days for calling him \"the dumbest vertebrate on the planet\". Personally, I think I should have been given the chance to prove it before being banned. If the contention is factual, it is not a personal attack. I will probably not return there. A large number of their posters seem to be 4forums rejects like scummyD, Bassman, and some of the other less intelligent members that have wandered through here and are Now gone.\n \n I actually still like it here. There are still people that I commonly disagree with, JimsTrucking and JPSarte to name a couple, but they are not stupid, just misguided sometimes :) \n \n If you want to kick at mad dogs behind a fence, find yourself one of the hard right religious rapture type forums and visit their political section. You know the type....the ones full of people who cannot wait for the end of the world so they can be with JESUS and they worry about things like whether or not their kids will be raptured away with them next year when JESUS comes back.\n \n I actually read a post at one of those the other day that warned people that they needed to be careful not to WORSHIP Bush because while, at times, he may SEEM godlike, it would be a sin to actually worship him. Your want to see religious fruitcakes foam at the mouth, that is a pretty good place to start. Most of those folks seem to be rednecks and white trash. Of course you can never win a debate with them because they are absolute lunatics, but it can enliven a rainy Saturday to watch a bunch of Jesus freak nutjobs work themselves into a frenzy defending the biggest XXXXX to ever sit in the oval office.",

I prefer to keep those mad dogs behind a fence. This forum has that in some subjects, abortion, creation and religion in particular, but a few educated, knowledgeable posters keep them in line by making their posts rather foolish when they refuse to concede to scientific discovery, socioeconomic reality and logic.
