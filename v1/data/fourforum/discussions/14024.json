   "\"[I]t is an evil almost common to all to trust in their riches. Yet this doctrine is highly useful to all: to the rich, that being warned of their danger they may be on their guard, and to the poor, that being satisfied with their lot they may not so eagerly desire what would bring more damage than gain. It is true, indeed, that riches do not, in their own nature, hinder us from following God, but in consequence of the depravity of the human mind it is scarcely possible for those who have a great abundance to avoid being intoxicated by them.\"\n\n My goodness, John Calvin almost redeems himself.\n \n Calvin and Wealth: Part 5 The Calvin 500 Blog",

Anybody worth his salt recovered some of the beating that s/he received under Carter when the Reagan Recovery took place and he cut tax rates.\n And the only jobs that Clinton created were government jobs, teaching and cops. And after a few years, most of the teaching and police jobs disappeared when Federal assistance dried up and the states would no longer fund them. \n As for Bush II. Don't forget that after 9-11, the stock market took a dump, Clinton's dot com bubble burst and finally Clinton's \"mortgages for everyone\" tanked us all. None of that can be placed on Bush II. He had his bout of spending like a drunken sailor, but the major woes in the economy were not of his making.",
