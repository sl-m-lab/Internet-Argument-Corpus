   "If you want to read about an actual famous philosophical atheist turned theist, read his short book (which is a response to the challenge of his atheist colleagues to justify his theism) here: http://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/orthodoxy.iii.html It's a brilliant work, even if your hell-bent against theism. If you read it, post a response to it here, maybe someone else then will, too (shamefully, works like this aren't taught by our colleges' liberal professors).",

   "Errr... the author (Chesterton) of that piece was never an atheist as far as I know. He later converted to Roman-Catholisism, but that doesn`t mean he was an atheist prior to his conversion you know ;)\n \n Edit: I`ve also read some of it, but not all, and I can`t say I find it interesting at all. Very eloquently written and as a piece of litterature, somewhat intersting, but as an argument for theism, it`s rather bland and uninspiring. To be honest, I can`t be arsed to spend more time on reading it. I`d actually rather read my Marx again (and that`s saying something ;) )",

   "Doctor of Physics, and Philosophy, Stanley L. Jaki wrote in his book Chesterton: A Seer Of Science that \"my first encounter with Chesterton was around 1951, shortly after my arrival in the United States. Somebody gave me a copy of Orthodoxy, in which I got hardly beyond the second chapter.\" So, you are not unique in your disinterest with the beginning of the book. This writer later came to be one of his greatest post-mortem biographers. If you want to appreciate the book, you'll have to at least get through first three or four chapters (the chapter \"The Ethics Of Elfland\" is quite famous in and of itself, as are several of those more towards the \"center\" of the book).\n \n As far as his conversion is concerned, I suppose that it is not well known that, during his studies in philosophy, he struggled greatly with every major philosophical theory. He became essentially an atheist at this point in his life, and, later, made his conclusion. By the way, Chesterton discusses Marx several times in this, and other books; perhaps that will add a bit of interest.",
