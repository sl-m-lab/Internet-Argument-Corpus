   "CJOnline / The Topeka Capital-Journal - Planning under way for Obama holiday\n From there:\n \nThe Capital-Journal\n Published Sunday, November 09, 2008\n \n Plans are being made to promote a national holiday for Barack Obama, who will become the nation's 44th president when he takes the oath of office Jan. 20.\n \n \"Yes We Can\" planning rallies will be at 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. every Tuesday at the downtown McDonald's restaurant, 1100 Kansas Ave., until Jan. 13. The goals are to secure a national holiday in Obama's honor, to organize celebrations around his inauguration and to celebrate the 200th birthday of President Abraham Lincoln, who was born on Feb. 12 1809. \n \n\n \n Good Grief.\n \n He already has a day...just like all the others. President's Day, Washington's birthday.\n \n People should probably wait until Obama actually does something before wanting a special day in his honor...which would place him above all other presidents.\n \n I guess if they do give him one it could be October 25 (I think it was), which was declared \"National Orgasms for Obama Day\". emoticon_xbangheadxbangheademoticon_rolleyesemoticon_xbangheadxbanghead",

   "Ala. county sets 'Barack Obama Day' as new holiday\n \n \n MARION, Ala. (AP) - A small central Alabama county whose mainly black residents gave Barack Obama more than 70 percent of the vote on Election Day has created an annual holiday in honor of the president-elect.\n \n The Perry County Commission voted 4 to 1 to observe the second Monday in November as \"The Barack Obama Day.\" County offices will close and its roughly 40 workers will get a paid holiday.\n \n The sponsoring commissioner, Albert Turner Jr., said the holiday is meant to highlight the Democratic president-elect's victory as a way to give people faith that difficult goals can be achieved.\n \n The majority of the county's 12,000 residents are black.\n \n The county commission's three black members and one of its two white members voted for the resolution.\n \n Commissioner Brett Harrison said Wednesday he voted against the resolution because of the holiday costs to the county, which has a $2.2 million annual payroll and is one of the poorest in the state. He said closing the courthouse would also idle some state employees.\n \n \"I'm a Democrat, but just in these financial times, it's not using the county's money wisely,\" Harrison told The Associated Press by phone Wednesday. \"The recognition is certainly well-founded.\"\n \n Turner said copies of the resolution, adopted at a Nov. 25 meeting, have been mailed to Obama and his transition team.\n \n An Associated Press exit poll found black voters in Alabama almost universally supported Obama while more than eight in 10 whites backed Republican John McCain. McCain carried the state with 60 percent of the vote. \n \n http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D94RBG180&show_article=1",

   "\n Once again, Obamas been saying throughout his entire campaign that he wants to set a ceiling for your success. Do you think he was kidding? It started out at 250k. Then 150. Then 120. It has its way of dropping. Thanks to your idol, the United States is no longer a country that allows one to grow rich. And in any case, if one did become rich, you'd accuse them of being greedy. .\n\n \n And just what is your problem with this?\n \n Unless you are already rich, your chances of becoming so, and mine as well, are NIL.\n \n It never ceases to amaze me how many folks who are not rich turn themselves into SHONDAS for those who are. Those who think as you do must really be envious. Why else would they toady up to the rich while simultaneously tugging at their forelocks.\n \n For me, I will have no more Gordon Geckos, \"Kenny Boy\" Lays, Rigases, Kozlowskis or any of the other fat cats.\n \n The tax code is a marvelous tool of social justice, and I expect that President Obama and the Democratic Congress will use it for just such a purpose.",

You might think that a coal miner's job is difficult. In truth, it is. It's a hard and dangerous job. But when a coal miner finishes his shift, he leaves work, goes home, watches the ball game, and goes to sleep. Coal miners don't really have to do anything except mining. This is difficult, but once his shift is over, he can let all of his troubles melt away. A CEO, however, will lose some sleep. My brother was once a manager of a small Sheetz gas station. He said that he could not afford to miss a single day of work, he worked 16 hour shifts, he had to watch some of the lazy ones like a hawk, and his wife left him because he didn't spend enough time with her. Yeah, being the manager may pay well, but I would personally be happier having a grunt job. I could imagine the stress the CEO of Sheetz must take.\n \n \nPennsylvania = Philadelphia on one end, Pittsburgh on the other, and Alabama in the middle.\n\n \n This doesn't make sense.

   "A Modern Parable\n \n A Japanese company ( Toyota) and an American company (Ford Motors) decided to have a canoe race on the Missouri River. Both teams practiced long and hard to reach their peak performance before the race.\n \n On the big day, the Japanese won by a mile.\n \n The Americans, very discouraged and depressed, decided to investigate the reason for the crushing defeat. A management team made up of senior management was formed to investigate and recommend appropriate action.\n \n Their conclusion was the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the American team had 7 people steering and 2 people rowing.\n \n Feeling a deeper study was in order, American management hired a consulting company and paid them a large amount of money for a second opinion.\n \n They advised, of course, that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing.\n \n Not sure of how to utilize that information, but wanting to prevent another loss to the Japanese, the rowing team's management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 2 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering manager.\n \n They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 2 people rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. It was called the 'Rowing Team Quality First Program,' with meetings, dinners and free pens for the rowers. There was discussion of getting new paddles, canoes and other equipment, extra vacation days for practices and bonuses. The pension program was trimmed to 'equal the competition' and some of the resultant savings were channeled into morale-boosting programs and teamwork posters.\n \n The next year the Japanese won by two miles.\n \n Humiliated, the American management laid off one rower, halted development of a new canoe, sold all the paddles, and canceled all capital investments for new equipment. The money saved was distributed to the Senior Executives as bonuses. \n \n The next year, try as he might, the lone designated rower was unable to even finish the race (having no paddles,) so he was laid off for unacceptable performance, all canoe equipment was sold and the next year's racing team was out-sourced to India.\n \n Sadly, the End.\n \n Here's something else to think about<b></b>: Ford has spent the last thirty years moving all its factories out of the US, claiming they can't make money paying American wages.\n \n TOYOTA has spent the last thirty years building more than a dozen plants inside the US. The last quarter's results:\n \n TOYOTA makes 4 billion in profits while Ford racked up 9 billion in losses.\n \n Ford folks are still scratching their heads, and collecting bonuses... and asking for a 'bail-out'...\n \n IF THIS WEREN'T SO TRUE IT MIGHT BE FUNNY",

Maybe the starting wage for janitors at the plant is $17.00. That might be considered high in some areas.\n \n I don't blame the workers at all. I blame the unions that convinced the workers to pay union dues so the unions could build up strike funds to be able to force the companies to pay excess wages and benefits for low productivity. Of course the higher wages enabled the unions to raise their dues and line the pockets of union officials.\n \n ..and their pension plans enable a surviving spouse to collect the benefits long after the worker is dead. Next thing you know, the unions will be hounding the big three to pass the pensions on in wills to generation after generation of one workers offspring. Just how stupid can we get?\n \n The unions have raped the auto industry. They have impeded the airline industry with exception of a few companies whose employees refused to vote them in.\n \n Screw the unions.\n \n The workers should be able to compete for jobs based on what the market can afford (and it will pay all that it can afford) instead of some wage established by a greedy union. Let the unions continue to have their way and there won't be an industry to strike against.\n \n Screw the unions.\n \n If it weren't for all the fallout that will result from failure of the big three car makers, I'd welcome a collapse of the whole thing just to get rid of the UAW.\n \n Screw the unions.\n \n We have laws to protect workers that we did not have when the unions came along to help us get rid of child labor and virtual slavery. Non-union companies seem to work more productively and in doing so still pay their people a living wage. You sound as if you think the auto workers should each become rich for installing lugnuts and wiper blades.\n \n Screw the unions.\n \n The Japanese law regarding the salaries of management is ridiculous also. I see no problem with executive salaries being governed by the market for their skills.
