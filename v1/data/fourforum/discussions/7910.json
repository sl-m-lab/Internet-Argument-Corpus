   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/07/science/07punish.html\n \n April 7, 2006\n Study Links Punishment to an Ability to Profit \n By BENEDICT CAREY\n Sociologists have long known that communes and other cooperative groups usually collapse into bickering and disband if they do not have clear methods of punishing members who become selfish or exploitative. \n \n Now an experiment by a team of German economists has found one reason punishment is so important: Groups that allow it can be more profitable than those that do not.\n \n Given a choice, most people playing an investment game created by the researchers initially decided to join a group that did not penalize its members. But almost all of them quickly switched to a punitive community when they saw that the change could profit them personally. \n \n The study, appearing today in the journal Science, suggests that groups with few rules attract many exploitative people who quickly undermine cooperation. By contrast, communities that allow punishment, and in which power is distributed equally, are more likely to draw people who, even at their own cost, are willing to stand up to miscreants.\n \n An expert not involved in the study, Elinor Ostrom, co-director of the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University, said it helped clarify the conditions under which people will penalize others to promote cooperation. . . .In the experiment, investigators at the University of Erfurt in Germany enrolled 84 students in the investment game and gave them 20 tokens apiece to start. In each round of the game, every participant decided whether to hold on to the tokens or invest some of them in a fund whose guaranteed profit was distributed equally among all members of the group, including the \"free riders\" who sat on their money. Because the profit was determined by a multiple of the tokens invested, each participant who contributed to the fund enjoyed less of a return than if the free riders had done so as well.\n \n The tokens could be redeemed for real money at the end of the experiment.\n \n About two-thirds of the students initially chose to play in a group that did not permit punishment. In the other group, the students had the option in each round of penalizing other players; it cost one token to dock another player three tokens. All participants could see who was contributing what as the game progressed, and could choose to switch groups before each round. \n \n By the fifth round, about half of those who began the study in the no-penalty group had switched to the punitive one. A smaller number of students migrated in the other direction, but by Round 20 most had come back and the punishment-free community was a virtual ghost town. . . .",

   "I heard of this some time back and the spin that was put on it then was that there are spoil sports who just can't stand to see others 'win'. Even willing to hurt themselves some if they can hurt the other more. Thus the I lose one and you lose three thing being common as 'punishment to the winner'.\n \n It also is supported in reality some when you hear many bitch and moan about the Bill Gates types and how 'they should do more for XXXX.'\n \n Now if you'll excuse me, I have some more mansions to go fire bomb...\n \n I mean cheaters to penalize. emoticon_xangel",

   "What I found to be most interesting is that, after experiencing a bit of both kinds of societies, the society that discarded rules and enforcing rules was abandoned in favor of the more civil society where rules of ethical conduct were in force, not to mention enforced.\n \n I think it offers a concrete history lesson in how morality and ethics was societally constructed. Ruleless societies did not survive, the survival of the fittest society you might say, not the survival of the strongest and most ruthless individuals.\n \n Gad, to be able to recapture the dialogue of those times. What did individuals in a particular society communicate to each other? How did they decide what the rules were?\n \n The Bible is somewhat a codification of those rules. Mohammed's Koran is a very comprehensive collection of societal rules.\n \n The Barons of England ganging up on King John to force him to sign the Magna Carta.",
