Others who support your notions aren't nearly as forthcoming with what they want because it's become political suicide to take such a position.\n \n Just don't come crying if your position comes back to bite you when there's a push to also repeal the Fourth Amendment, or maybe even the Sixth Amendment. Trying to read something out of the Constitution simply because you don't like it can have drastic consequences.\n \n \nLOLOLOL. Absolute BS. If you and others like you weren't so caught up and attached to \"white privilege\", in which, you being \"born white\", completely out of your control, means something ridiculous like \"you're superior to others\", or something. We won't get into specifics such as chattal slavery, stealing the land from Native Americans, all of the various and sundry imperialistic wars ,you, collectively, have gotten us into, Jim Crow, lynchings, voter intimidation, and a skewed justice system, to name but a few.\n\n \n I didn't start this thread to give credit to the concept of white privilege. I don't even believe that such a standard exists. I started this thread to get to the bottom of some important questions. Blacks and women are often portrayed as the victims of gun violence and widespread gun ownership, and some try and use us as a cause to argue for restrictions on gun rights because they present them as a method of protecting us. That is what's absolute BS here.\n \n I really find something to be quite interesting in your racially motivated rants Poet. I'm assuming you're a black man by the way you've been addressing me. Your take a stance of complete disarmament. Why this is I can't understand. You spoke of Jim Crow laws as being part of the evil that whites have committed in this country. Are you aware that Jim Crow laws also included prohibitions against blacks and other colored from being armed?\n \n Tell me something Poet. How can a black man support the concept of disarmament when such a concept was used to keep past blacks from being armed in the first place? Isn't that the same as saying the racists were correct?\n \n \nOh that's easy. Most men equate guns with phalluses. The smaller the penis the more enthusiastic the gun enthusiast...because firepower is a metaphor for sexual prowess. Don't you get it?\n\n \n No I really don't get it. Besides Dr. Joyce Brothers what other psychiatrists support this mistaken belief? Who has peer reviewed this opinion and considered it viable in nature? Simply because somebody claims there's a sexual connection to gun ownership that doesn't mean they're correct in their personal beliefs. I'm not buying this notion until there's sufficient scientific study to prove that this is a legitimate position to argue.\n \n \nAnd yeah, a woman having gun would tend to make you think twice about forcing yourself into a compromising situation. Lorena Bobbitt is a name that strikes fear into the groin of most straight men. Women benefit from firearms to deal with criminals and Neanderthals.\n \n \n Lorena Bobbitt you say? She was tried in a court of law and found by a jury to be not guilty for her actions due to everything her husband had put her through. Meanwhile John Bobbitt went on to have numerous other run ins with the law, including several arrests and even convictions for domestic battery because he apparently didn't learn from the last time. So exactly what are you hoping to yield from bringing her name into the discussion? Are you making jokes about the fact that women are physically weak compared to men and might need assistance in protecting themselves from victimization?\n \n \nI don't want 'em. I just don't want you to have 'em. Or anybody for that matter. What do you thing video games are for? Or are you just violent as a rule of thumb?\n\n \n Despite whatever you might be trying to suggest, gun ownership isn't a direct result of violent tendencies and a desire to destroy stuff. Do you choose to deny the fact that this is a dangerous world filled with dangerous people who will kill you because you were in the wrong place at the wrong time?\n \n That would certainly be an interesting topic of discussion. I'd like to see you try and make a coherent case for the argument that people don't own guns because they want to protect themselves, but rather to act upon violent impulses to a sufficient degree.\n \n \nYou like guns? Never grew out of cowboys and indians, eh? Or you like playing soldiers?\n\n \n See now this is the type of rhetoric I was talking about at the beginning of the thread. This is the kind of nonsense you can't deploy against women in trying to make your case against gun ownership. Playing games like soldier, or cowboys and indians, wasn't something that a great many of us engaged in as kids. You can't shame us out of gun ownership with mentally deficient rhetoric such as that. Ask any woman that's been raped and chose to be armed in order to be a victim no more.",

Brady favors insults of sexual inadequacy for gun owners and one sentence trolling positions, while Simone enjoys injecting race into every subject under the sun. Neither of which is conductive of honest and open debate.\n\n \n ...and there's the answer to the question posed by Charlie XT: \n \n \nSo how exactly do supporters of gun control respond when the opponent they have to confront is a woman? \n\n \n \n The fact that you fall into a demographic inconsistent with the premeditated sound-bite of an answer will be completely ignored like every other fact they are confronted with. You will be treated with the same loathing disgust and disdainful superiority they treat any other stereotyped, red-neck, uneducated, fat, pasty, old, hick white-guy with.\n \n But, it's best not to accuse them all of falling into the same category. That would be stereotyping. The only things exempt from this are labels commonly applied to all gun owners such as \"penis compensation\", \"red-neck\", \"uneducated\", \"overweight\", \"white\", and \"male\". Any other demographic is irrellevant because everyone knows that all gun owners fall into only these categories, therefore, it is perfectly acceptable to stereotype them.

I have no interest in watching you tilt at windmills. All I ask is that you answer my questions, if at all, by addressing them to me as opposed to some fictional &#8220;white man&#8221; with a sexual dysfunction, a false superiority complex, and who has the time to parade around as a jingoist American imperialist warmonger because his living is made on the backs of slaves he owns who work for him on the land he stole from Native Americans.\n\n \n Guns and penises - Camille Paglia - Salon.com\n \n \"The gun as mutant penis: Men or women who abuse guns are equally sexually dysfunctional. The first question that popped into my mind about the Columbine killers was, \"What was their sex life like?\" It's very difficult to be a man in today's post-industrial culture, with its bland service-sector jobs and endless paper-shuffling deskwork. All you have before you is eternal tethering -- to parents, teachers, boss, wife. There's little room for genuine masculine adventure and achievement. And there are few men to admire -- which is why violent video games and action-adventure films have been thriving.\n \n You males whose courage, energy and ingenuity turned the global wilderness into civilization (and allowed women to emerge from the servitude of reproductive biology to become self-determining individuals) are not honored by the clichid ideologies of our time. From feminism to therapy, the ruling premise is the Sensitive Male, as talky as a woman as he gets in touch with his banal feelings. Natural, robust, assertive masculinity is defined as a disease from which society must be cured.\n \n You tartly cite Harvard psychoanalyst William Pollack, whose bestselling book, \"Real Boys,\" has been tirelessly promoted by Oprah Winfrey in her ever-lengthening chain of white male gurus and black earth mothers. I know from the testimony of friends that Pollack is a superb therapist. But I'm afraid I must agree with your skepticism about his approach to current social issues. His bookish milieu has little understanding of either athletics or war -- which are crucial to any historical analysis of masculinity.\"\n \n And I'm sorry if my analysis hit way too close to home. Many whites are precisely as I described them : sexually dysfunctional, operating with fantastic senses of entitlement and notions of superiority, are caught up in gun culture (a sure sign of immaturity and stunted development), who profitted from the labor of enslaved blacks, after stealing America from the indigenous peoples.

   "...and there's the answer to the question posed by Charlie XT: \n \n \n \n \n The fact that you fall into a demographic inconsistent with the premeditated sound-bite of an answer will be completely ignored like every other fact they are confronted with. You will be treated with the same loathing disgust and disdainful superiority they treat any other stereotyped, red-neck, uneducated, fat, pasty, old, hick white-guy with.\n \n But, it's best not to accuse them all of falling into the same category. That would be stereotyping. The only things exempt from this are labels commonly applied to all gun owners such as \"penis compensation\", \"red-neck\", \"uneducated\", \"overweight\", \"white\", and \"male\". Any other demographic is irrellevant because everyone knows that all gun owners fall into only these categories, therefore, it is perfectly acceptable to stereotype them.

Annoyance and being disturbed is part of the price for living in a free society.\n \n \n BS. You can stick your objections. \n \n This is a simple fact and I've never claimed otherwise. Guns are lethal weapons and must be handled with respect or somebody can wind up dead. That's their purpose, that's the intent of their design. We don't live in a society where only non-harmful things are allowed to be owned by the people, we don't need to apologize for having a potentially lethal tool at our disposal.\n \n Oh, please. You sound like a commercial for the NRA. Apparently you never grew up. \n So why exactly should we extend to you the courtesy of trust when you refuse to trust anyone that you don't know? You expect us to give you more than you yourself are willing to give?\n \n \n Illogical fallacy. I'm against all guns. Period. They should be banned. Anyone caught with one ought to go to jail, or be shot on sight. Are you peeved yet?\n \n I don't believe that guns and matches are a proper comparison to make. I've felt the same way with those that try and compare guns and marijuana.\n \n  I give a rat's booty what you believe. Did I ask you to comment. No, you just volunteered. Am I supposed to be moved by your words? I'm not. \n And such shootings usually occur where the law forbids gun possession or ownership. Look at how many people have been murdered in the handgun-free city of Chicago. I pointed out those statistics in pointing out Brady's hypocrisy.\n \n I'm from Chicago. What?\n Guns and penises - Camille Paglia - Salon.com\n \n That's quite an individual you've chosen to cite. Unfortunately Camille Paglia isn't very noteworthy nor authoritative. Camille Paglia is little more than a school teacher who's highly critical of society. She has absolutely no credentials as a psychiatrist or a psychologist, instead she works for an art university. A good majority of the article you link is devoted to the topic of circumcision. The whole sexual obsession thing is quite tiring. When all else things you resort to talk of sex as if it's an acceptable excuse for your position.\n \n Illogical fallacy. Your opinion counts for nothing with me. \n Please explain exactly what you mean by sexually dysfunctional. Do you mean impotent? Do you mean sterile? That's an awful broad term to be throwing around so freely and readily. Maybe you could qualify as sexually dysfunctional because you believe everything is sexually related.\n \n I must have hit a nerve. Why are you worried? \n Perhaps sexual dysfunction isn't the proper term to be using. Perhaps sexually obsessive is. Maybe to you and others like you everything has a phallic explanation because you're incapable of seeing otherwise. Perhaps while in school Sigmund Freud was beaten into you to the point you don't know anything else.\n \n \n Perhaps your stereotype of me, has gotten the best of you. \n Better to be thought a fool, than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt. \n And what do you say about black gun owners? Why the silence on that topic?\n \n I didn't make any distinction concerning race. I said \"all guns\". Race-baiting, much? \n As for the founding of America and what happened to those that were here before us that's simply too bad. In war you're either the victor or the loser and that's just how it is. There are no innocents in war except the civilians who are stuck in the location of the two fighting factions.\n \n Spoken like a true believer of the white man's manifest destiny. \n White people aren't exclusive in committing atrocious acts against others. We don't have a corner market on killing people that probably didn't deserve it. Take the Rwanda Genocide for example.\n\n \n Right. He's doing it, so what's the matter with me doing it, right? I'll take the Rwanda Genocide and raise you a Holocaust and a My Lai.",

   "War? Aren't you being a little melodramatic? And who are you to tell me what is justification and what isn't? I have just as much right to my views, no matter how extreme, as you have to yours.\n\n \n Melodrama is defined as performance characterized by exaggerated proportions and over the top delivery. My statement of war is certainly an acceptable comparison. In Heller and again in McDonald the Supreme Court ruled that gun ownership is a constitutionally recognized and protected right that belongs to the people. That means your position is an assault against the Constitution itself. In other words war. It doesn't matter if you don't agree with that analysis, that doesn't change the fact that you want to banish something that the Supreme Court said can't be banished.\n \n \nBS. You can't stick your objections.\n\n \n It's not BS. You claim your brother had a twisted obsession with handguns but you didn't elaborate on it in any way. I personally don't see disturbance as grounds for anything that involves altering the Constitution and enacting wide ranging and extreme changes.\n \n \nOh, please. You sound like a commercial for the NRA. Apparently you never grew up.\n\n \n You accuse me of never growing up when what I say is the simple truth? You accuse me of not growing up because I say that guns aren't toys and shouldn't be played with? How is that not a sign of maturity exactly? Can you elaborate on that or are you simply going to run away because you can't address the shortcomings in your own logic?\n \n \nIllogical fallacy. I'm against all guns. Period. They should be banned. Anyone caught with one ought to go to jail, or be shot on sight. Are you peeved yet?\n\n \n Rosie O'Donnell had a very similar position, except she didn't endorse the wholesale murder of people for simply exercising their constitutional rights. You on the other hand are doing just that. That hardly sounds like a member of the liberal party.\n \n You don't like that the people can freely own guns in a legal manner. That's simply too bad for you and people who share your views. It's not going to change regardless of the minute public outcry you try and generate. That would be like trying to repeal the 14th Amendment because racists didn't like the idea of blacks having equal rights under the law.\n \n \nI give a rat's booty what you believe. Did I ask you to comment. No, you just volunteered. Am I supposed to be moved by your words? I'm not.\n\n \n I don't care whether or not you're swayed by the opposition's opinion. Those who are committed to being wrong will fight to the death for the sake of maintaining their incorrect position because they know nothing else and can't comprehend the possibility of everything they were raised to believe as being nothing more than a lie.\n \n \nI'm from Chicago. What?\n\n \n Well that actually explains a lot.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/425502-post25.html\n \n Illinois Crime Rates 1960 - 2009\n \n HOMICIDE\n \n 2007: 752\n 2008: 790\n 2009: 773\n \n Total: 2,315\n \n Crime in Chicago - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n HOMICIDE\n \n 2007: 442\n 2008: 510\n 2009: 458\n \n Total: 1,410\n \n Chicago accounts for approximately 25 percent of the total population of Illinois, but they're responsible for about 60 percent of the murders that occur in the state.\n \n \nIllogical fallacy. Your opinion counts for nothing with me.\n\n \n I don't care what your opinion of my opinion is. The facts about Camille Paglia speak for themselves. At least Galileo had history professors to cite for his nonsense but you don't even have that. Camille Paglia is little more than an art teacher, she has no credentials for determining what has a Freudian connection and what doesn't. She's no more an expert on the topic than an automotive mechanic would be. You might as well ask the school janitor for his opinion.\n \n Perhaps you should come back when you have an established and certified psychiatrist who is fully willing to support your position. Then I'll tear them down and discredit their arguments as well.\n \n \nI must have hit a nerve. Why are you worried?\n\n \n I have no need to worry, I simply wish for those I do battle with to be as specific as possible as it makes my job of dismantling them that much easier. Otherwise I have to elaborate on the different ways that their broad statement can be dismantled or misinterpreted and how they weren't on their game when they made the statement that they did.\n \n But even without you elaborating I can tell you this. There are too many gun owners who have children for your claim to have any basis in fact. Sexual dysfunction and parenthood don't go together as one prevents the other from occurring.\n \n \nPerhaps your stereotype of me, has gotten the best of you.\n Better to be thought a fool, than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt.\n\n \n You proved you were a fool when you started talking about \"white privilege\" when the question presented was how gun control rhetoric doesn't work on female gun owners. You used this thread as a base of operations for your racially motivated fallacies. You could have instead focused on how insults and crudeness doesn't work when addressing women but you didn't do that.\n \n \nI didn't make any distinction concerning race. I said \"all guns\". Race-baiting, much?\n\n \n I'm not the one who introduced race into the equation. Rather that one was your own fault and yours exclusively.\n \n \nSpoken like a true believer of the white man's manifest destiny.\n\n \n What \"white man's destiny\" are you referring to exactly? \n \n \nRight. He's doing it, so what's the matter with me doing it, right? I'll take the Rwanda Genocide and raise you a Holocaust and a My Lai.\n\n \n Do you really want to play this game Poet? Do you really want to be compiling lists of atrocities carried out by various ethnic groups to see what skin color is responsible for the most violence and evil in recorded history? Is it really going to come down to sheer body count here?

   "Guns and penises - Camille Paglia - Salon.com\n \n \"The gun as mutant penis: Men or women who abuse guns are equally sexually dysfunctional. The first question that popped into my mind about the Columbine killers was, \"What was their sex life like?\" It's very difficult to be a man in today's post-industrial culture, with its bland service-sector jobs and endless paper-shuffling deskwork. All you have before you is eternal tethering -- to parents, teachers, boss, wife. There's little room for genuine masculine adventure and achievement. And there are few men to admire -- which is why violent video games and action-adventure films have been thriving.\n \n You males whose courage, energy and ingenuity turned the global wilderness into civilization (and allowed women to emerge from the servitude of reproductive biology to become self-determining individuals) are not honored by the clichid ideologies of our time. From feminism to therapy, the ruling premise is the Sensitive Male, as talky as a woman as he gets in touch with his banal feelings. Natural, robust, assertive masculinity is defined as a disease from which society must be cured.\n \n You tartly cite Harvard psychoanalyst William Pollack, whose bestselling book, \"Real Boys,\" has been tirelessly promoted by Oprah Winfrey in her ever-lengthening chain of white male gurus and black earth mothers. I know from the testimony of friends that Pollack is a superb therapist. But I'm afraid I must agree with your skepticism about his approach to current social issues. His bookish milieu has little understanding of either athletics or war -- which are crucial to any historical analysis of masculinity.\"\n \n And I'm sorry if my analysis hit way too close to home. Many whites are precisely as I described them : sexually dysfunctional, operating with fantastic senses of entitlement and notions of superiority, are caught up in gun culture (a sure sign of immaturity and stunted development), who profitted from the labor of enslaved blacks, after stealing America from the indigenous peoples.

   "According to ACCT ,(association to control and confiscate tools), over 90% of all sledgehammers originate in the U.S. and call for stricter controls over straw purchasers who buy and sell these tools to unregistered and illegal buyers.\n \n \"...there must be something done to stop these deadly weapons from being used in the wrong hands\" said a spokesman for ACCT. \"We can do more to make it harder for these deadly tools to wind up in the wrong hands\" he said.\n \n \"First a strong registration scheme and a new agency to enforce and punish those who use them in criminal acts\", he continued, \"these deadly screwdrivers, icepicks and blunt instruments, especially sledgehammers must be more strictly controlled and only in the hands of qualified people such as the police and military.\"\n \n \"We have proof these tools have been used by cartels and criminals not only in home invasions and other crimes and homocide but can be concealed easily and these powerful assault tools are only used for destruction and should be limited to military and SWAT teams since their main purpose is to rapidly kill large numbers of people.\"\n \n \"...recall in Rwanda handled hoes, knives and clubs were used with government permission in a large act of genocide and these implements of violence must be removed from civilian hands unless they are trained and have a license to use them\", he continued. \"License and registration are key to safety of the children as are laws requiring people to lock them up when not in use and also not to loan them out to people who are unlicensed and kalifornia has a law we need to look at that requires penalties for not reporting stolen tools and requiring sold tools to individuals to be conducted in a licensed tool store and re-registered so we will know where they are\".\n \n \n Open carry will not be allowed and only concealed carry with strict background checks repeated yearly will be required. \"It is time for America to take tool safety seriously\", he said. \"Hammer abuse causes sexual impotence amoung frequent users\", he continued. \"It is like a phallic symbol people want to own to compensate for small sex organs and diminished desire\".\n \n Lock up those hammers and tools America chanted Sarah and Diane who agreed that complete confiscation was their goal; it is time for some common sense tool control in America and I would confiscate every hammer if I could said Diane. \"Imagine what would happen if we allowed these deadly tools in schools\", piped Sarah.\n ACCT is a for profit organization dedicated to disinfranchising every American and extorting fees and any rights possible to join today and get at the top of the ponzi scheme. emoticon_xhoho emoticon_xgood",

Wouldn't these violent acts also be less harmful without the inanimate objects used to commit them? Of course, none of them are a tool that ignites a powder causing compression to force a metal object quickly out of a tube. THOSE tools get special consideration. There is some wierd supernatural force that imbues only THOSE with their own moral personification (Unless one posesses a shiny metal disk issued by the government.)\n \n Choke someone to death....you're a strangler.\n Beat someone to death....you're a bludgeoner.\n Slip some arsenic into a person's coffee...you're a poisoner.\n \n Shoot someone......THEY WERE A VICTIM OF GUN VIOLENCE! The evil GUN did it! Or, according to Freedom, they're somehow more dead than the previous victims. After all, having a cord wrapped around one's neck and tightened until the brain is starved of oxygen....how does it go?......\"wouldn't be as bad\". \n \n Yeah. Getting killed with the thousands of other items like candle sticks, lead pipes, lawnmower blades, cyanide, anti-freeze, BEING LIT ON FIRE WHILE ASLEEP, tree branches, telephone cord, and the uncountable other mundane items humans use to inflict violence on each other gets pushed to the back burner.....\n \n ....there's a special place reserved for folks who get a hole poked in them by a fast moving chunk of metal.",

So maybe, just maybe you could be wrong in your stereotyping. Please don't overlook the fact that you are painting a huge number of law-abiding people with that offensive brush. This is, after all, an Inalienable, constitutionally recognized as protected right that you are walking all over. \n \n The purpose of a car is not to kill, and yet it kills far more often than guns do.

   "Well that's a big 10-4, but when you say weapons you mean guns?Because we all know that getting hacked up is more preferable.emoticon_idea\n\n No I mean weapons. A weapon is defined as a tool used for violence, so if one was claiming that guns were innately dangerous because they made attacks more effective that standard would apply to all tools which do so.\n \n A bronze sword is hardly a match for a gun, but back when it was invented it allowed soldiers and travelers to kill prospective attackers who used only clubs and bare hands. Instead of an increase in violence civilization began to spread. There was violence in these civilizations of course but compared to the tribal wars that persisted for a hundred thousand years and would in places persist up to present day it was a peaceful day at the beach.\n \n One must note there are two very distinct camps on weapon control. The first are pacifist, they rue the day people made the first real weapons (weapons which were so powerful their intended purpose was military conflict). The second are people who accept weapons as necessary, they just think the army should be the only ones who use them.\n \n The second camp has won out more often than not because if the army of a nation keeps it's citizens safe they tend not to feel the need for weapons in any case. Some notable exceptions are cultures in which the army is seen as a civic responsibility and not just the sole realm of professionals paid for by the state. Ancient greece is an excellent example.\n \n \nIf you had an education, IF, you would know that RIGHTS are not subject to majority opinion...nor even a vote. Rights are pre-existing and are not even subject to gov't approval and would exist even if they were not so protected and acknowledged in the Constitution.\n\n Bravo!\n \n \nCreep?

You're another gun crazie, who thinks like Charleton Heston...the only way they'll get your gun is to pry it from your cold hands.\n It's clear you're anti-government and pro-militia....the original intent of the \n 2nd amendment.....not valid anymore. Fascist.\n\n Rofl! You advocate the removal of all military power to the government but your not the fascist?\n \n \n.....maybe you could then tell me why police officers insist on carrying the violent objects?\n\n Soldiers use weapons because their job is primarily the use of physical force.\n \n \nAccording to your point above, it would be to intentionally promote violence.\n\n Just because one has a hammer in one's belt does it mean one intends to nail something. A weapon does not promote violence but it's only purpose is violence, in this case to be prepared for the violence of an attack.\n \n \nYou are also continuing the object blame.\n\n I was pointing out that I haven't ever seen anyone sane blame the weapon itself (poet is not sane).\n \n \nThe violence wouldn't be as bad wihout weapons? Define weapon.\n\n any instrument or device for use in attack or defense in combat, fighting, or war, as a sword, rifle, or cannon. \n \n \nMost stabbings would be less harmful without knives.\n\n Stabbings would be impossible without knives but that doesn't mean a knife is necessarily a weapon.\n \n \nBeatings would be a heckuva lot less lethal without blunt objects.\n \n Stranglings wouldn't be as easy to accomplish without cordlike material.\n\n This is the confusion I was worried you were having. You are confusing weapons and non-weapons on the criteria that non-weapons can be re-purposed to violence. That doesn't mean that is what they were designed for and it is no contradiction for someone to advocate the removal of weapons without advocating anything that could be used as a weapon.\n \n \nYet, I almost always see the person blamed for their criminal activity using these objects. Wouldn't these violent acts also be less harmful without the inanimate objects used to commit them? Of course, none of them are a tool that ignites a powder causing compression to force a metal object quickly out of a tube. THOSE tools get special consideration.\n\n Actually it's more like the most advanced weapon an average person can afford at the time seems to be the pattern. It depends on the cultures idea about the highest military power. In a country where the military uses bows and arrows to great effect people try to control those. In a country like Rome where swords and shields but not so much spears and knives were considered the best weapons it was the swords and shields that were suspicious in the hands of plebeians (well before the Marian reforms).\n \n \nOr, according to Freedom, they're somehow more dead than the previous victims. After all, having a cord wrapped around one's neck and tightened until the brain is starved of oxygen....how does it go?......\"wouldn't be as bad\". \n\n That is an intentional and very directed gap in imagination and you know it. If two guys get into a fight and they start beating each other up but the moment of rage passes and they stop the damage has been far less than if in the moment of rage one guy shoots the other in the chest.\n \n It's what people are doing when they aren't thinking rationally not the other way around that scares anti-gun people.\n \n For instance I know someone who had a gun aimed at them by someone who was very mad at the traffic (apparently in his enraged mind it was the car in front of him that did it not the parking lot that extended to the horizon).\n \n A person who threatens an innocent civilian for no purpose is not securing themselves, they are using the vastly superior military strength of a firearm to scare another person half to death. What if he had a panty hose instead? She could have just rolled up the window.\n \n So I am talking about 'more dead', more people dead.\n \n I am not against people owning weapons, but you shouldn't engage in sophistry to defend that. You must admit that any weapon is orders of magnitude more effective as a weapon than an object that was not designed to be a weapon and that modern firearms are the pinnacle of that truth.\n \n \nLook at the Holocaust you cited earlier, carried out by the ruling government at the time.\n\n He's immune to those analogies, apparently he doesn't share enough genetic material with the master race to absorb their guilt through the collective consciousness.\n \n \nAnd you're nothing more than a troll who cares less about honest debate and more about hurling sexual insults because of your own inadequacies. I'll bet your supposed victimization back in 1977 was you shooting yourself in the foot.\n\n Sexual insults, racial insults, political insults... in fact I haven't seen much more than insults period.\n \n \nDon't even try and bring nuclear material into this discussion. Anybody who could look at a handgun and a nuclear warhead and say they see no difference obviously isn't interested in the truth.\n\n There is a difference, a nuclear weapon is very very powerful in comparison to a hand gun.\n \n With it you might be able to defend yourself from an entire army and not just a mugger.",

   "Sorry Charlie, Poet has hijacked the thread and I am as guilty as anyone here for encouraging it. I apologize for doing so once again. \n \n \n If repeal of the 2nd amendment is up for vote, you best believe I'm voting in the affirmative. \n \n \n Thankfully none of our rights are on the ballot: \n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.\n \n \n the original intent of the 2nd amendment.....not valid anymore. \n \n \n You have not said what you believe the original intent was. I believe the individual right to keep and bear arms pre-existed my Constitution. I believe the original intent behind the 2nd. Amendment was to recognize and protect this preexisting individual right. \n \n If you disagree, then tell me and we can discuss whose theory has the greater weight of political history, judicial precedent, common sense, and more competent spokesman.\n \n \n By that logic, what's wrong with everyone having nuclear weapons? After all it's not the nuclear weapons we have to fear, but the careless hands of the imbeciles who have them. \n \n \n No right is absolute, and you cannot read the 2nd. Amendment any more absolutely than the other rights it helps protect. The First Amendment reads freedom of \"speech,\" but this does not equate to freedom to commit libel, slander, or false advertising. Likewise, \"religion\" is also not defined in the First but this does not create a license to engage in human sacrifice. For the same reason \"arms\" cannot be read in the Second Amendment to mean \"nukes.\" If you have read Heller and McDonald  then you know neither case has held this. See also, for example, the following case that long predates them:\n \n \"At the outset we reject the view that freedom of speech and association (N. A. A. C. P. v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460), as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, are \"absolutes,\" not only in the undoubted sense that where the constitutional protection exists it must prevail, but also in the sense that the scope of that protection must be gathered solely from a literal reading of the First Amendment. (FN10)\n \n (FN10) \"That view, which of course cannot be reconciled with the law relating to libel, slander, misrepresentation, obscenity, perjury, false advertising, solicitation of crime, complicity by encouragement, conspiracy, and the like, is said to be compelled by the fact that the commands of the First Amendment are stated in unqualified terms: \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble . . . .\" But as Mr. Justice Holmes once said: \"[T]he provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form; they are organic living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.\" Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 610. In this connection also compare the equally unqualified command of the Second Amendment: \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" And see United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174.\" Konigsberg v. States Bar, 366 U.S. 36, 49 (1961)\n \n \n I'm against all guns. Period. They should be banned. Anyone caught with one ought to go to jail, or be shot on sight. \n \n \n A simple question....How will these commands be carried out? After all, if all guns are banned, then what will we be shot with? I doubt you mean crossbows, so I must assume you mean to have a government monopoly on firearms.\n \n \"An armed republic submits less easily to the rule of one of its citizens than a republic armed by foreign forces. Rome and Sparta were for many centuries well-armed and free. The Swiss are well-armed and enjoy great freedom. . . .Among other evils caused by being disarmed, it renders you contemptible. . . . It is not reasonable to suppose that one who is armed will obey willingly one who is unarmed; or that any unarmed man will remain safe among armed servants.\" Machiavelli, The Prince, pp. 73 & 81 (L. Ricci, trans. 1952)\n \n But let me return to being serious. It seems that you believe capital punishment is still constitutional under the Eighth Amendment. But imprisonment and execution without trial? This is where you lose all credibility with me, Poet.\n \n Must you also trample the rights protected in the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to gain your way? What a reckless disregard for fundamental rights you have. I guess now would be the time for me to express my thanks once again to my Founding Fathers for putting these rights beyond the your reach. \n \n \"William Roper: So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law! \n Sir Thomas Moore: Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? \n William Roper: Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do that! \n Sir Thomas Moore: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!\" From Robert Bolt's play \"A Man for All Seasons\" \n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\"--Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (Brandeis, dissenting).\n \n I mean really, Poet. If this is an attempt to apply for a position as a person who wants to be taken seriously, then I have to tell you the interview is not going so well. How can you expect to be taken seriously when you say your opponents should be shot on sight? Was this a very poor attempt at sarcasm? \n \n \n Anybody else here, with the intellect and the smarts to engage me? \n \n \n Molon Labe.",

For the same reason \"arms\" cannot be read in the Second Amendment to mean \"nukes.\" If you have read Heller and McDonald  then you know neither case has held this. See also, for example, the following case that long predates them:\n \n\n If no right is absolute then no right is inalienable. All are subject to the subjective reinterpretation of contemporary political forces. A nuclear weapon is a weapon.\n \n By saying a nuclear weapon is not protected but a gun is you imply you have drawn a line somewhere in between those two. A battleship? A tank? Fully automatic? It doesn't matter, that you have drawn the line means you have already admitted the right you appeal to as objective and not subject to public opinion.... is subject to your opinion. You cannot object to anyone even so mad a person as poet drawing the line somewhere else.\n \n Even if you have clear an unmistakable criteria for that line, and even if it is unarbitrary in relation to society; it will be arbitrary in relation to the constitution you reference; which defined no line or limit to the type of weapons permitted.",

   "No I would not equate \"inalienable\" with \"absolute.\" \"Absolute\" defines the scope of the right-what conduct and arms it covers. \"Inalienable\" is a term that defines the origin of the right. \"Inalienable\" is another term for a \"natural\" right which does not depend on governmental approval for its existence. These rights, to quote the Declaration of Independence, draw their authority from the \"Law of Nature and Nature's God.\" They are \"self-evident\" and they exist independently of any government. We can forfeit these rights by our own misconduct, but absent this no government has the legitimate authority to deprive us of these rights. I would consider the RKBA one of these rights. In contrast, we also have \"statutory\" rights which governments create and governments can modify at will. These rights fall within the legitimate power of the government. An example would be a right to appeal a criminal conviction that expires 30 days after the conviction. This right can be modified at any time. \n \n I understand the argument, though. If an inalienable right is not absolute then its scope is in danger of becoming elastic. That scope can expand or contract depending on who controls SCOTUS, and conceivably the judicial contraction of the scope of the right could be great enough to effectively deny the right altogether. \n \n But we have to deal with the reality of our form of government, and that reality contains a warning. Like it or not the battle over the scope of the right will be settled by SCOTUS, and because of its jurisdictional limitations the process will be by incremental decisions. The Brady Campaign understands this, and we need to as well. Heller did not declare the RKBA to be absolute in scope, and SCOTUS will never do so. Heller also only defined the scope of the right as broadly as necessary to decide the case. \n \n For me, Heller is the starting point of defining the scope of the right. For the Brady Campaign, Heller should be the end point.

This supposed standard of \"weapons that would be useful to a militia\" is this a term that has to be viewed differently as the times change to compensate for new development in firearms technology? Because while some might find revolvers and lever action rifles to work as viable defense weapons I'm not sure how useful they would be to militia purposes, what with all the recent developments in the last 20 or so years. Even though a lever action rifle can easily be made to use armor piercing ammunition, as can certain revolvers, that doesn't mean they're suitable for fighting an enemy that might possess the AKS-74U or other similar weaponry being used by the insurgents in Iraq.\n \n So we must consider the existence of these particular firearms when considering all the other standards. If they don't have a modern suitability for fighting a defined enemy like the Taliban would that mean they can be banned and restricted while new modern weaponry couldn't be? If this is so then doesn't the standard of \"useful ina militia\" basically criminalize current attempts to outlaw and restrict modern weaponry under the guise of \"assault weapons\" and \"high capacity ammo clips\"?",

   "Lol, and when they are outlawed they will be less common. \n\n Brilliant statement. The truth of which, hit me like a ton of bricks. It seems that We the People have to not only fight just about all governments from encroachment, but also the courts to include the Supreme Court&#8217;s too. \n \n We the People fixed this with the 14th Amendment, and the will of the people is known. However, all of government, many courts, and to include the S.C. said, Uh, Yeah, We will take that under advisement. Dork Wads. We&#8217;ll get back to you on that. Don&#8217;t wait up nights for that though! We will incorporate YOUR Rights that bind us, when we get around to it. Yeah that&#8217;s the scam!

Where did they get the power to wait and incorporate our rights when they saw fit? Did We the People, or their elected representatives give them instructions to incorporate? Or did they throw a hissy fit and come up with this as a delaying tactic, and in many cases a denying tactic, on their own? \n \n Also, if the Supreme Court actually obeyed the LAW, and I mean directly after the 14th was ratified, what would the 2nd Amendment look like today? \n \n Why did we have to wait 150 years for the 2nd to be recognized? Who, exactly, authorized that? \n \n The whole darn thing reeks with illegality, and some serious mistakes and power grabbing needs to be addressed. Well, that is, if we are really talking about being law-abiding, and being Constitutional, and all! Which IS, the only law that really matters. The Constitution is the Supreme law of the Land, and this miscarriage of justice, has to be adressed.

   "So I joined the board to take part in the debate that seems to permeate everything and one of the areas I was always curious about was in this section. I've always had a question that I wanted to see asked but nobody ever brought it up so I'm going to.\n \n Supporters of gun control are accustomed to a specific type of opponent in their arguments, specifically white men. White guys are the easiest to attack and blame for everything due to history painting them as the ultimate evil, and collectively the white culture has been forced to simply roll over and take it for fear of being called racist all over again. However in becoming accustomed to doing battle with this specific group supporters of gun control have become typecast in their arguments and can't easily adapt to confronting other people of different heritages.\n \n \n I am so incensed by the OP, and your crying of \"foul\", as it relates to white men, that I feel I need to address it \"anew\". It's not like you, as white men, have ever done anything wrong, correct? You've been \"saints\", and the predominant culture, which happens to be \"white culture\", seeing that you're in most positions of power and authority and \"white privilege\" affords you skewed protection of your inherent sense of entitlement by simply being born white...and it doesn't matter if you're uneducated, classless, poor, criminal, racist, doofus, atheist, abusers, misogynistic, anarchists, or whatever, your white skin will give you the carte blanche that will trump any non-whites, regardless of their superior qualities. How the hell is that equitable or fair? \n If you're a friggin racist, or misogynist, or criminal...own it. It's what you are. Why pretend to be what you are not, if only for appearances' sake?\n You already own almost every g.d. thing, and still it's not enough. And heaven forbid someone take away your security blankets....your guns...because without them, you're not real men. Which is why I alluded earlier to guns being phallus symbols. If you were \"swingin', you wouldn't need firepower to back you up. Truth of the matter is that a gun doesn't make up for a teeny tiny member, no matter how much you fantasize....and everyone knows, size is what women think that they want..when the truth lies in \"the motion of the ocean\". Surprising I know so much about women....and I do. Not all gay men are \"inexperienced\", contrary to popular belief. And despite being in a committed gay relationship for 10 years, I'm still propositioned by women. Eat your hearts out. \n So how exactly do supporters of gun control respond when the opponent they have to confront is a woman? How does their rhetoric and fear mongering and hyperbole work when they've gotta deal with members of the female side of the population who don't buy into their arguments? How exactly do you sell disarmament to women who don't believe in being unarmed and helpless as an answer?\n \n I never believed that any attempt to take away my gun or restrict my ability to use it when I'm out late would do anything to prevent me from being mugged, raped or murdered by whatever lowlife of society has yet to be locked up because they chose to not obey the rules of said society. Nor do I believe that requiring me to obtain a permit to buy a gun would do anything to prevent me from becoming a victim of domestic violence simply because the same law might prevent my abuser from becoming armed.\n \n So what do they have? When they encounter someone who can't be assaulted with claims of racist nature, or insults of sexual dysfunction, or mockery of compensation for lacking something, etc. what is the course of action that's to be taken next?\n\n \n Of course anything can be explained away or supported to promote one's own agenda. I think that the premise of the OP is misogynistic.",

Fear of the unknown, the media's liberal slant, socially engineered gender stereotypes, intimidation, etc. any one of them a potentially lengthy explanation of why women are less likely to carry a gun than a man even though they're more likely to be victimized.\n \n Currently too many women stay with their abusive spouses and even defend them from the authorities despite knowing full well that the abuse is just going to continue until one of them is dead. Despite access to sufficient knowledge that would tell them this is a bad idea they still willingly choose to do so. What's the logic in it? I honestly don't know the answer to that, but I do believe it serves as a good comparison and contrast with gun ownership or the lack thereof amongst women.\n \n \nYou say \"girls like guns too\", but they in fact don't as a group.\n\n \n I really don't put much stock into that. All the evidence you have to go on is answers concerning a random telephone survey. If you randomly call people up and supply them with information that can't be verified you don't really expect a great deal of honesty to be extended do you? Conduct a random telephone survey and ask participants how many of them like kinky sex of questionable legality and you'd probably get a lot of hang ups, cursed at and told where to stick your survey.\n \n \nI support certain regulations but have no desire to disarm any law-abiding citizen, man or woman.\n\n \n Certainly a wise decision.",

   "Interesting. If all true natural rights derive from the single absolute right of liberty, then how do we define this unlimited right to \"liberty\"?\n\n The right to control one's body, to choose without coercion one's actions; to hold complete ownership over the products of one's efforts so long as one does not violate these same conditions in others.\n \n Anyone who has done a venn diagram can understand the concept of mutual exclusion, it is not contradictory as some insane people (not you) have claimed to reference the definition within the definition.\n \n If you choose to buy a gun you have not violated any one's rights regardless of the proposed risk of you doing so.\n \n So more blabbing by me on the subject:\n http://www.4forums.com/political/formal-open-debate/14447-society-based-volition-ideal-one.html#post407234\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/formal-open-debate/14447-society-based-volition-ideal-one.html#post407901\n \n \nIf the right is held by the individual, then can the individual voluntarily surrender some of this natural absolute liberty by agreeing with his fellow man to form a government? \n\n He can in so far he can pretend it doesn't exist. However in reality it does exist and he cannot surrender it.\n \n By the very act of consenting you do not destroy your right to give consent or not.\n \n \nWhat other rights in the Bill of Rights should be considered natural rights of absolute scope?\n\n Actually most are derivations of liberty, some are not natural but constructed rights like the ones on the legal system.\n \n In all my years of defining the rights of man for people I have never had to go to such particular levels, people should be able to apply a principle. If you don't have the right to coerce someone to do something of course you cannot coerce a reporter to shut up nor can it be a crime to do anything but violate some one's rights.\n \n\n On the mechanism of forfeiture you and I are in complete agreement. I do not claim, and I do not imply, that my actions could cause the forfeiture of anyone else's rights. This is of course the modus operandi for gun control-where one person's criminal misuse of the RKBA forms the basis for taking the same right from everyone else under the guise that they can no longer be \"trusted\" with the right.\n\n Yes, I have tried many times to get people to see the pattern which is clear as day to me behind such 'modus operandi'. The pattern is thinking about humanity as groups; it is dealing with the collective as the unit of humanity. The simple fallacy of composition carried out on a grand scale has far too many names sometimes condemned sometimes not.\n \n It's called stereotyping, racism, classism, social equality etc..\n \n When you try to make laws about groups you are always in the wrong, laws about gun owners cannot speak to any individual action except owning a gun but it is justified with the actions of other individuals because to the people who are thinking this way, consciously or unconsciously they are assigning criminal actions to the collective not to the individual.\n \n Most evil in the modern world while claimed to be separate issues are the results of this single evil called collectivism.",

   "Charlie_XT. I hope you don't mind. Because of what this thread has morphed into, I think these articles belong here. \n   Second Amendment Foundation Challenges Interstate Handgun Sales Ban \n The Second Amendment Foundation today filed suit in U.S. District Court in Virginia challenging the constitutionality of federal and Virginia provisions barring handgun sales to non-residents.\n \n SAF is joined in the lawsuit by Michelle Lane, a District of Columbia resident who cannot legally purchase handguns because there are no retail firearms dealers inside the District.\n \n SAF and Lane are represented by attorney Alan Gura of Gura & Possessky, PLLC, who won both the Heller ruling and last year's Supreme Court victory in McDonald v. City of Chicago. Named as defendants are Attorney General Eric Holder and W. Steven Flaherty, superintendent of the Virginia State Police.\n \n \"This is an important issue in the era of the national instant background check,\" said SAF Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb. \"The NICS check should allow law-abiding citizens like Miss Lane to exercise their Second Amendment rights regardless their place of residence.\"\n \n \"Americans don't check their constitutional rights at the state line,\" said Gura. \"And since Michelle Lane is legally entitled to possess firearms, forcing her to seek a non-existing D.C. dealer to buy a handgun is pointless when perfectly legitimate options exist minutes across the Potomac River.\"\n \n \"The Supreme Court has ruled that District residents have an individual right, protected by the Constitution, to have a handgun in their home,\" Gottlieb noted. \"The high court has also ruled that the Second Amendment applies to the states. Existing state and federal statutes violate both the spirit and letter of recent court rulings and the Constitution, and our lawsuit seeks to remedy that situation.\"\n\n \n  Boarding? Denied. Lock and Loading? Sure. \n .... proposing that the attorney general be given authority to block gun sales to those on the list, \n \n Deny people their 2nd Amendment Rights without their 14th Amendment due process Right. What about the ill advised president this sets? I guess the correct question is, do you want a Bill of Rights or not? Should the government be restrained from acting in certain areas or not? \n \n About this article, Kurt Hoffman says:\n  247 on 'terror watch list' buy guns, terrorize no one with them \n What the editorial doesn't bother to mention is that the NY Times can find, among those 247 \"suspected terrorist\" gun buyers, precisely zero incidents of terrorism or violent crime. In fact, according to Fox News, this lack of \"gun crime\" among \"suspected terrorist\" gun buyers is something of a tradition, going back at least as far as 2004:\n \n The NY Times article claims \"careful guidelines\" in the proposed \"terror loophole\" laws would protect prospective gun buyers from the obvious, enormous potential to abuse a law that grants one unelected official (the Attorney General--just the guy gun owners and the rest of America should trust) the power to unilaterally deny the Constitutionally guaranteed, fundamental human right of the individual to keep and bear arms--without a conviction, without an indictment, without even an arrest or formal charges. You see, a would-be gun buyer who is blocked from buying guns can appeal the \"suspected terrorist\" ruling. The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) describess gun owners' concerns about this proposed gaping hole in due process as \"conspiracy theories.\"\n\n \n   The Cafe Constitution: #2, Firearms \n The Constitution of the United States is not a caf\u00e9 where one may pick and choose which items on the menu one prefers. The Constitution is what it is. These days it is popular to call it a \"living\" document. Which means it is subject to the whims of political correctness, a judiciary and executive branch overstepping the bounds of the separation of powers, goofy world wide trends, and a statist belief that the individual is no longer capable of making decisions without the strong arm of the federal government pointing the way. The matter of the Second Amendment and its interpretation is a case in point. It is a matter of whether or not the intent of the founders is valid any longer. The question is raised whether or not the people of the United States are about to have part of the Bill of Rights discarded because of political correctness and a perilous desire to leave defense of the self in the hands of government.\n ....\n \n The Federalist Papers, which describe the evolution of the Constitution by the Founders, speak to the issues in the Bill of Rights including those raised by today's crop of statists, collectivists, and the left. The intent of the founders is clear. But with regard to the Second Amendment the statists on the left don't care; they no longer consider the Constitution as it was written as relevant to the times.\n ....\n Each and every part of the Bill of Rights depends on the other for legitimacy. The Constitution may be amended but it may not be ignored. But no matter how many arguments there are about the legitimacy and meaning of the Second Amendment, collectivist-statists come up with a reason why it no longer applies.\n \n The integrity of the entire document and its affect on our rights and liberties is called into question. That includes the First Amendment which guarantees freedom of the press, speech and religion. Because if the Second Amendment, or the Fourth, or any other is made irrelevant for what may be perceived as a transitory good of the state, then the whole becomes subject to the same attacks.\n \n The rest of the liberties, as enumerated in the document, may eventually become irrelevant because they offend someone. For the perceived good of the collective state, the liberty of the individual is diminished.\n",

For something to be considered a viable defensive strategy is has to be capable of being realistically deployed within a matter of days at the very most. And martial arts simply isn't capable of doing that.\n\n Well if we are talking about the moment of attack it needs to be deployed in seconds, so that means you need to prepare to defend yourself. Buying a gun is a preparative step just as much as learning martial arts would be. Remember I never claimed learning martial arts was faster, cheaper, easier than buying a gun.\n \n \nNobody who ever suggests learning martial arts for protection is a woman.

Men who by default are the physically strongest and most capable of the species. They never have to worry about being smaller, weaker or more scared than anybody else.\n\n You caught me. Don't think all males are Arnold Schwarzenegger though. You can have no hope as a weak or old male too. I suggest and I stand by my suggestion that if you intend to fight to defend yourself that if you are going to risk getting your attacker angry you had better go the whole mile. You can turn a perp who just wanted your purse into a murderer or worse if you lose.\n \n The modern soldier is the embodiment of the military philosophy and knowledge of mankind, if they are concerned with the possibility of a melee fight; you should be too.\n \n \nIf you can come up with something that will render guns completely obsolete for personal protection\n\n Working on it.\n \n \nthen be sure you tell it to the military and the police and the Secret Service first. Let them give up their guns and bombs and stuff for this new alternative you're so favorable of. Let them prove that it's effective and works the way you claim it does.\n\n Knowing how to fight with your body is not exclusive to knowing how to fight with a gun. Even if it's just the ability to put enough distance between you and your opponent to pull your gun it may be necessary.\n \n \nYou are referring to trained soldiers which is a completely different thing from a woman who goes to ' self defence' lessons once or twice a week and is told that the techniques learned will protect her from an assault by a fully grown man.\n If you are recommending that women who want to learn how to protect themselves from a potential attack from a man should join the forces and become a combat soldier then I have no comment to make on this point.\n \n As said I cannot comment on gun owneship in the US but I can comment and do know that most of the self defence lessons given to women is useless guff taken out of context with a real life situation.\n\n Agreed",
