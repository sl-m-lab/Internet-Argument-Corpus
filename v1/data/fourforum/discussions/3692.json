   "... we first have to hunt down and kill all the dissenters?\nYou misconstrue the intent of U.S. offensive military action when you assume we seek to kill all dissenters. It's not mere dissent that inhibits Iraq's reconstruction and democratization.\n \n Indeed, the post-Saddam era bears witness to a tolerance of dissent in Iraq. The Iraqi press is freer than ever before, evidenced by the dozens of newspapers operating in a far more open atmostphere than any journalist did before Saddam.

Rather, they are insurgents in violent revolt, and their tactic of slaughtering the innocent with car bombings and beheadings makes them little different from murderous thugs.\n \n No civil society can stand aside indefinitely while a part of the nation is unwillingly subjected to a Taliban-like theocracy. The people of Fallujah didn't sign up for these Islamic extremists to impose their own rule. Just as the residents of Najaf rejoiced when Al-Sadr's Mehdi Army was expelled from that holy city, so too will the majority of Fallujah's residents rejoice if the rule of law should take root in their city.

The Iraqi press is freer than ever before, evidenced by the dozens of newspapers operating in a far more open atmostphere than any journalist did before Saddam. Dissent is alive in Iraq and for the most part broadly tolerated.\n\n \n And yet Al Jazeera, inarguably the most \"western\" Arab media outlet at the time, was banned from Iraq for refusing to fall in line. They were accused of inciting violence, largely because they were reporting that prisoners in US custody were being tortured (which we later found to be true). \n \n \nWhat the Iraqi government authority will not tolerate is genuine incitement to violence. This standard holds true in Western countries as well, where incitement to violence is generally held to be illegal. The people we're trying to capture or kill are not mere dissenters voicing a difference of opinion. Rather, they are insurgents in violent revolt, and their tactic of slaughtering the innocent with car bombings and beheadings makes them little different from murderous thugs.\n\n \n And yet our founding fathers (ameica) felt that the ability for the common man to throw his leaders up against the wall and shoot them was important enough to ensure we would always have it, by including a right to arms in the bill of rights. they wrote almost exhaustively about the right of free men to revolt against a tyranical government. The insurgents in Iraq are facing a government that was not elected, instead having been hand picked by a foreign nation and imposed on the Iraqi people at the end of a gun. \n \n \nThat to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Such has been the patient Sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the Necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.\n\n \n That is from our own declaration of independance, the document we sent just before the colonists in America turned into murderous thugs and started killing his majesties loyal subjects. \n \n Violent revolt is the way things get done. The history of mankind is a history of bloodshed and slaughter. You look at what is going on in Iraq and suggest that noviolent means are the way to get results. If that is the case, why do we have so many tanks there? The reality of the situation is that you meet force with like force, or at elast as close as you can come. \n \n While it is certainly nice that we are letting some newspapers publish without censorship (or at least with only manageble levels of it) we need to keep in mind that we are still throwing Iraqis in prison for attending demonstrations. \n \n It seems that waht you have in Iraq is a farily large group of people hwo are more than a little unhappy with the dictator we have appointed. What gives him any more legitimacy than rebels like Al Sadar? Because we said so and are willing to kill those who disagree with us? How, then, can we possibly oppose others who say differently and are willing to kill anybody who disagrees with them and still take the moral high ground on this one? Is it simply because we feel our values and ideologies are superior to theirs? \n \n \n \nDaewoo, since you find it disconcerting that we use military force to end the insurgency, what alternative course of action will you propose so as not to feel so ruffled?\n\n \n Tough call. It seems to me that we are in the same situation in Iraq and Afghanistan. We had the elections in Afghanistan, but 90% of the country is outside the control of the afghani government and huge numbers of people were not included int he election due to security concerns. The only guy who was allowed to do any real electioneering was \"our guy\". It seems that people in many parts of Afghanistan have some pretty serious doubts as to the legitimacy of the government there, and understandably so.\n \n It certainly seems that we are doing the same in Iraq. There is now a constitution, written by our hand picked guys, around which the new government will be formed. We have hand picked a prime minister for them, and it seems that we will likely be pushing hime for election in the first term of the new government. \n \n If you were an Iraqi citizen, how could you possibly see this new government as legitimate? We claim we are instilling democracy, yet thus far everybody who has been important to the \"democratic process\" has been hand picked by us, or at least our approval was required. While it seems that we have learned something from vietnam (when you are sure your guy is going to loose, don't cancel the elections, rig them).\n \n What would make me more comfortable??? Hmmm, first, quit killing off the opposition. There have only been a half dozen attacks in Fallujah in the last month (there have been 80-90 per day in Iraq, the majority of them in and around baghdad). This si likely becuase there have been no US troops in Fallujah in the last couple months. They have been ringing the city, according to the news, an apparently not been real effective at that (since apparently the majority of the insurgents have already left Fallujah).\n \n Then, if we are going to do this democracy thing, do it. Allow the people of Iraq to elect delegates to attend a constitutional convention and draft a constitution. Let the PEOPLE decide who they want, as opposed to having a handful of our buddies do it, many of whom had not been in Iraq prior to the war for years.\n \n THEN, have the PEOPLE ratify the constitution. Let them elect whoever THEY think can best lead their country, not the guy that we hand pick. In fact, we may want to disqualify our guy so there is no question of one cnaidate being at an unfair advantage due to foreign backing (I know we certainly wouldn't wnat foreign powers meddling in our elections).\n \n I keep hearing \"we can't move forward with democracy as long as there is violence in Iraq\". didn't we hold elections here, in the US, in 1864? Weren't we at that time in the middle of a civil war? Did Lincoln proclaim that we could not hold an election until there was peace in the country? I don't believe he did, nor did anybody else. \n \n What we are doing in Fallujah and other areas held by militants is not ensuring that democracy gets a toehold, we are simply wiping out the opposition to ensure that our guy wins.",

   "On a national basis [the Sunnis are] in the minority, which prevents little threat or enhancement to Shia dominated politics or US security.\nI disagree that the minority status of Sunnis is sufficient reason to think they present little threat to Iraq's political integrity or to U.S. security. The fact that they're a minority is irrelevant with respect to security, since security is a BIG concern in Iraq and can't be blithely dismissed as an inconsequential threat. The Sunni insurgency is a threat not only to U.S. forces but to anyone working to rebuild Iraq and alleviate the long years of wideapread suffering under Saddam's regime. Consider the impact of the security threat on international and humanitarian organizations. Lack of security is the reason Kofi Annan hasn't restored the UN mission to Iraq more than a year after its headquarters in Baghdad was bombed, killing 23 people including the head of the mission. Lack of security is the reason CARE International suspended operations in Iraq when the director was abducted. Ditto for numerous groups that might otherwise pitch in and help the Iraqi people in countless ways. \n \n I also note an inconsistent view regarding your approach to Iraqi minority groups. In the recent thread you started on Iraq's Kurdish minority, you argued that the existence of a Shiite majority warranted an immediate resolution of the Kurd situation, so that it didn't become a fast burning fuse leading to problems we're not capable of resolving.\n \n On the other hand you oppose U.S. action in Fallujah. Thus in your view, the fact of a Shiite majority is a compelling reason to immediately resolve the Kurd situation AND immediately leave the Sunnis alone. That view seems even more peculiar when one considers the Kurdish autonomous region is a peaceful zone, whereas the Sunni province is the very heart of a violent insurgency.\n \n \n \n...the sensible plan would be in leaving [the Sunnis] alone while waiting for Iraqi internal security to reach acceptable mass and handle the problem.\nHow long might your 'sensible plan' take until Iraqi security forces reach 'acceptable mass'? Meanwhile, the thuggish insurgency imposes harsh rule and sham courts on the Sunni cities in their grip, and their violence is not confined to Anbar province but reaches into Baghdad and other cities like Mosul and Kirkuk. The Sunni insurgents can't be simply left alone as an open sore festering in the body politic of the nation. The status quo is untenable. If U.S. forces are going to remain in Iraq for the time being, then let them get the job done. Else, call it quits and bring them home. But let's not order them to stand down and remain idle in the face of persistent car bombings, mortar attacks, abductions, etc.\n \n \n \nIf Sunnic clerics do boycott or embrace the elections after we've leveled yet another Iraqi city, the existing problem will still be compounded\nWhether it's boycott or embracement, it appears by your reckoning that elections will only make matters worse. Why do you think that a Sunni embrace of elections will compound existing problems? Considering that you belittled the Afghan elections as well, at least you're consistent in finding little or no merit in democratic elections.",

   "Daewoo, you said all dissenters are being hunted down and killed, which is why I provided the link listing the dozens of newspapers and wide range of viewpoints flourishing in the new Iraqi press, including liberals, Arab socialists, communists, Islamic groups, political parties, union workers, and so on. Your commentary on al-Jazeera's problem does not change the fact that the Iraqi press is freer than ever before.\n \n I think the interim government's one-month closure of al-Jazeera's Baghdad office was misguided, though the network didn't help their cause by ignoring the government's legitimate concerns and continuing to operate in open defiance of the ban. Your statement that the ban was largely due al-Jazeera's reporting on prisoner abuse is simply wrong. Have a field day with your opinions, but take better care to be accurate with facts. Al-Jazeera of course is not a constituent of the Iraqi press, since it is owned and subsidized by the Qatar government. Its political independence and sensationalized reporting is the reason it has been a thorn in the side of many. Even here in the states the NYSE banned al-Jazeera from its trading floor, allegedly for security reasons. Go figure.\n \n It's not only hawks like Rumsfeld who feel al-Jazeera works in concert with terrorists. Colin Powell acknowledged he had frank discussions with the Qatari government about al-Jazeera's reporting standards. The criticisms may be having an incremental effect. Al-Jazeera will no doubt continue its pro-Arab slant but may also now consider more earnestly its distortions of fact. This summer it created a new code of ethics to keep its journalists within certain boundaries of honesty and to ensure more balanced and sensitive reporting.\n \n Turning now to your commentary on the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence: \nAnd yet our founding fathers (ameica) felt that the ability for the common man to throw his leaders up against the wall and shoot them was important enough to ensure we would always have it, by including a right to arms in the bill of rights.\nLet the founding fathers speak for themselves, and spare me your embellished depiction of the 2nd amendment. The right to keep and bear arms is not an unbridled permit to throw leaders against the wall and shoot them. Regarding the American revolution, the most fundamental issue seems to have escaped your understanding. The colonists rebelled to establish representative government, not tyranny. Discerning the difference comes easy to most people.\n \n I suspect you know better than to depict the interim Iraqi government as tyrannical, and the American soldiers as murderous thugs, so I'm not quite sure your reason for portraying the situation backwards. Perhaps you're seeking some sort of shock value. If, however, you sincerely subscribe to the unconventional view that there is moral equivalence between tyrannical government and representative government, then no wonder you uphold the 'right' of insurgents to impose their will forcefully, while you denigrate the interim government's endeavor to establish representative democracy.\n \n \n \nThe insurgents in Iraq are facing a government that was not elected, instead having been hand picked\nSo this justifies the insurgency, in your view? You're playing the role of apologist for an insurgency that's grieving for the good old days when freedom was a distant dream. The current government is already far more 'elected' than anything the insurgency aspires to. If some people had to be initially hand-picked, so what? You have to start somewhere! You can't just stand there with clay feet. Enough with your moping that the initial government wasn't elected. Instantaneous national elections were never possible. Iraq is in a transitional period. What's so hard to understand about that? \n \n Let's recap the last two years. Iraqi sovereignty was held by Saddam and his Baathist party. The U.S.-led coalition overthrew him, and an occupation government was installed. Paul Bremer, the administrator for the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), had an office that was part of the Defense Dept, and he reported directly to Rumsfeld. A month or so later, the CPA appointed a special Iraq Interim Governing Council made up of prominent Iraqis from various sectors of Iraqi society--political, religious, and tribal. The Council's ethnic and religious breakdown was representative of the larger Iraqi society: 13 Shiites, five Sunni Arabs, five Kurds (also Sunnis), one ethnic Turk and an Assyrian Christian. The Council's mission was to provide transitional leadership to an eventual democratic state. The Council was recognized by the Arab League, which agreed to seat its representative in Iraq's chair at its meetings. Perhaps the Council's greatest achievement was drafting and approving the interim constitution that would come into effect upon the dissolution of the CPA.\n \n The next major phase was in June this year when both the Council and the CPA were dissolved and replaced by the Interim Iraqi Government (IIG). The Council, in dissolving itself, appointed Allawi as interim PM. The interim constitution also came into effect at this time. The dissolution of the CPA and simultaneous creation of the IIG constituted a transfer of sovereign power back to the Iraqi people. Some may argue that the continued presence of U.S. soldiers constitutes a de facto occupation, but the fact remains that the U.S., the UN, the Arab League and other countries recognize the IIG as being the sovereign government of Iraq. This caretaker government will continue to govern until elections take place. The transition is a process that's still unfolding. \n \n The history of mankind is more than the picture of bloodshed and slaughter you paint. Your universal rule--that violent revolt is the way things get done--is hardly as sweeping as you think. Nor did I suggest, as you seem to imply, that nonviolence is the only right way to get results. It appears you see the world as only black or white. Sometimes force is necessary, but sometimes compromise, negotiation, and persuasion are sufficient.\n \n Frankly, ploughing through your rhetoric quickly become tedious: We appointed 'our guy' as dictator. We kill anyone who disagrees with us. Blah, blah, blah.\n \n Regarding your paragraph on Afghanistan, you didn't include a single sentence without error. There were not huge numbers of people left out of the election, all the candidates and parties were allowed to campaign, and no Afghan leader of consequence questions the legitimacy of Karzai's government. Please feel free to show otherwise.\n \n I smile at your closing statement about how best to proceed in Iraq:\n \n \n... if we are going to do this democracy thing... Allow the people of Iraq to elect delegates to attend a constitutional convention and draft a constitution... THEN, have the PEOPLE ratify the constitution... Let them elect whoever THEY think can best lead their country\nI smile, of course, because you have apparently unknowingly laid out the very course charted by the CPA and Interim Iraqi Governing Council before those two entities dissolved themselves. Notwithstanding your extravagant rhetoric, when all is said and done you are found to be proposing the same path that Iraq is embarked on already.\n \n The only part you seem to have a real problem with is the interim period from the overthrow of Saddam to the present situation. You seem to think the interim period was avoidable, as if direct national elections could he held shortly after Saddam's fall. The interruption of sovereignty that occurred with Saddam's overthrow created a void. Something had to fill it. Democracy requires a civil society to function effectively and hold honest elections. Iraq had no recent history of democracy, and one-party rule had left the country ill-qualified to function as one, so it has technically been very difficult to arrange for national elections. In any event, the Iraqis have arrived at the phase of the plan that you like. The creation of an elected National Assembly is next. The target date is Jan 31. The phases to follow the election of the National Assembly are not a secret, so I'm not sure why you weren't aware of them sooner, but better late than never. If it makes you feel better, you might even consider that the Iraqis are following the DAEWOO transition plan, since you seem to have arrived at the same plan independently. Welcome aboard!",

   "Democracy comes from within or it's just another session of special interests nation building on the taxpayer nickel.\nDemocracy ultimately needs to sustain itself from within, but recent history gives example of thriving democracies that initially arose under outside influence, even coercion. My wife went to high school in Okinawa when it was still under U.S. occupation, which lasted for 27 years after WW2 ended. One could argue Japan's democracy sprang from both within and without. I'm not sure why people today are so impatient for results. Perhaps it's the conditioning from a culture geared to the instant gratification that's so intimate a part of Western materialism.\n \n Not one of the 22 members of the Arab League is yet a democracy, so perhaps Iraq and the rest of the Arab world will prove to be democratically-challenged, incapable of sustaining a form of government where power lies with a voting citizenry. Still, why be so quick to dismiss the possibility of success?\n \n You offer us two choices for involvement in Iraq: 1) occupy the oil industry while withholding our help, or 2) turn it into a police state ruled by the autocrat of our choice. Such inspiration! You neglect a third choice--doing what we reasonably can to nurture democracy. If we fail, so be it, but not to even try is to consign that troubled country to civil war or a return to autocracy. \n \n \n \nBut don't tell me democracy is the will of the people. Not when we're engaged in killing off those who disagree with us.\nPeople disagree with us everyday without being killed, but when they insist on imposing a Taliban-like rule, sure we're gonna kill them. And make no apology about it. These insurgents who busy themselves abducting humanitarians, beheading engineers, executing prisoners in mass, targeting civilians with suicide bombs, etc etc -- they have shown an unwillingness to live side by side with their neighbor in peace. They'll kill you in a heartbeat, unless you kill them first. \n \n The Islamofascists in Iraq today are a bit like the Nazis on the verge of defeat at the end of WW2. They planned the resistance movement named Wehrwolf and used guerilla attacks against Allies in occupied Germany. Wehrwolf tactics included sniping, arson, sabotage, assassination, and civilian massacres. In the end they were too disorganized to present a significant impediment to the occupiers, though the general consensus is that they delayed economic reconstruction and democratization by three or four years. Don't tell me these people weren't given a choice, and don't tell me that being forced to kill them precludes democracy. \n \n \n \nAnyone who considers Afghan elections as free and the will of the people is into serious denial.\nBy your reckoning millions of Afghans are in denial. But what do they know, they merely live there. To be sure, the country remains poor, and serious problems loom.

Fact is, there's no current interest, nor is any interest anticipated in the near term, which kind of leaves your military deployment rationale hanging out to dry.

Seriously, the pipeline is a pipedream perhaps in some distant future. Though it would be a terrific boon to the economy, Afghanistan's economic prospects are sadly quite bleak, and even moreso with the opium trade accounting for half its GDP.\n\n \n You might find this interesting if you consider 2002 the future: \n \n http://www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/REG/tar_stu_36488.pdf\n \n The financing syndication is committed, has been since 2003 and the\n constructor identified. Regional stability is still the primary fly in the ointment and now another feasibility study has been ordered by the syndicator regarding the US Dollar. Afghanistan has little to gain from the project, as when Russia attempted to stabilize that country, other than right-of-way fees to whatever government happens to be in power. The Taliban refused to grant permissions even though they had reduced opium production to negligible amounts prior to the US invasion. We, the US, were of course paying the Taliban to reduce opium production, which is now back to record levels supporting not only farmers, but transportation, protection networks and consumer goods merchants. Our money to the Taliban never filtered down to the farmers or the distribution network. \n \n Anyone can expound on humanitarian ideals, but money always says the right words. As it will in Iraq.",

   "Daewoo, you said all dissenters are being hunted down and killed, which is why I provided the link listing the dozens of newspapers and wide range of viewpoints flourishing in the new Iraqi press, including liberals, Arab socialists, communists, Islamic groups, political parties, union workers, and so on. Your commentary on al-Jazeera's problem does not change the fact that the Iraqi press is freer than ever before.\n\n \n My apologies, all dissenteres are not being killed, just those who disagree enough to dig in their heels and say \"not going to do it\"\n \n \nI think the interim government's one-month closure of al-Jazeera's Baghdad office was misguided, though the network didn't help their cause by ignoring the government's legitimate concerns and continuing to operate in open defiance of the ban. Your statement that the ban was largely due al-Jazeera's reporting on prisoner abuse is simply wrong. Have a field day with your opinions, but take better care to be accurate with facts. Al-Jazeera of course is not a constituent of the Iraqi press, since it is owned and subsidized by the Qatar government. Its political independence and sensationalized reporting is the reason it has been a thorn in the side of many. Even here in the states the NYSE banned al-Jazeera from its trading floor, allegedly for security reasons. Go figure.\n\n \n Oddly enoughm, their headline story for 2 days before their ban was the torture of prisoners. Al Aryabias lead story was muslim leaders in Iraq calling for Jihad, including airing the actual speeches being made by these men, including directions to their fighters as far as how attacks should be carried out and what kind of targets are legitimate. Yet, it was AJ which was kicked out. You really think that there were legitimate security risks to the NYSE due to AJ's presence? I sincerely hope you are joking here. that was a rather obvious punishment for failing to follow the line that the whitehouse was putting out. As I have reminded people before, this is the same news station that was commended by Pres Bush during the war in afghanistan for their impartiality. \n \n The problem is that AJ has numbers that make most American news networks look like they are brought to you by your local community college. Even the BBC, which has a fairly large international following, can not touch the nunbers that AJ turns out on a regular basis. So, there is a news station out there, with an enormous following, and they are reporting things that we prefer nto to be reported. \n \n BTW, AJ is not owned by the government of quatar. It is owned by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the emir of qatar. Al Jazeera wa started following the collapse of BBC arabia. The Emir bought BBC arabia, from trashcans to anchor contracts, and moved the operation to quatar. I think it is pretty funny thst so many of these \"dangerous\" stories are being done not by islamic fundamentalist, but by former BBC reproters, to many of whom arabic is a second language. \n \n \nIt's not only hawks like Rumsfeld who feel al-Jazeera works in concert with terrorists. Colin Powell acknowledged he had frank discussions with the Qatari government about al-Jazeera's reporting standards. The criticisms may be having an incremental effect. Al-Jazeera will no doubt continue its pro-Arab slant but may also now consider more earnestly its distortions of fact. This summer it created a new code of ethics to keep its journalists within certain boundaries of honesty and to ensure more balanced and sensitive reporting.\n\n \n Bad news, they are now reporting the same things, but when they take flak about reports which are not complimentary to the US government, they point to their code of ethics and say \"we are required to report the facts\".\n \n \n \nTurning now to your commentary on the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence: Let the founding fathers speak for themselves, and spare me your embellished depiction of the 2nd amendment. The right to keep and bear arms is not an unbridled permit to throw leaders against the wall and shoot them. Regarding the American revolution, the most fundamental issue seems to have escaped your understanding. The colonists rebelled to establish representative government, not tyranny. Discerning the difference comes easy to most people.\n\n \n No, but the right to keep and bear arms does insure that, should it become necessary (the throwing of our leaders against the wall for the purpose of shooting them) wa, as citizens, are expected to have to tools at hand. \n \n No, they did not rebel to form a representative government. They rebelled in the name of freedom and liberty. They believed that a representative government was pivitol to this. Freedom means the right to persue your goals with as limited an amount of interference as possible. Liberty means the right to have the wrong goals.\n \n \nI suspect you know better than to depict the interim Iraqi government as tyrannical, and the American soldiers as murderous thugs, so I'm not quite sure your reason for portraying the situation backwards. Perhaps you're seeking some sort of shock value. If, however, you sincerely subscribe to the unconventional view that there is moral equivalence between tyrannical government and representative government, then no wonder you uphold the 'right' of insurgents to impose their will forcefully, while you denigrate the interim government's endeavor to establish representative democracy.\n\n \n I don't know if the Iraqi government is tyrannical or not. Currently, they have the US to do their doriuty work. The test would be what they do without the US there. I do know they haven't stopped the US from tossing people in prison without charges or trial. That is pretty tyranical (some would say the very definition of tyrannical). \n \n The fact that a government is representative does not necessarily preclude the possibility of being tyrannical. Hitler was elected, as was Hussein. \n \n \nSo this justifies the insurgency, in your view? You're playing the role of apologist for an insurgency that's grieving for the good old days when freedom was a distant dream. The current government is already far more 'elected' than anything the insurgency aspires to. If some people had to be initially hand-picked, so what? You have to start somewhere! You can't just stand there with clay feet. Enough with your moping that the initial government wasn't elected. Instantaneous national elections were never possible. Iraq is in a transitional period. What's so hard to understand about that? \n \n \n Apologist for the insurgency? Why? They need no apologies. They are fighting an unelected government imposed upon them by a foreign nation. No further excuse or apology is needed. \n \n Maybe you are a \"walk all over me\" type of guy. You will take whatever is thrown at you without question or complaint. I am not. I can say with absolute certianty that if my position was that of the Iraqi peoples, I would be out there on the front line with an AK and an RPG-7 blowing up US troops until the moment the self rightous bastards took me down. \n \n I am not moping. I am pointing out the the fact that there are apparently, and will continue to be, plenty of folks in Iraq who think the same way I do. This is a non-legitimate government, basically formed by a foreign power, and it has no authority to rule. \n \n \n \n \nLet's recap the last two years. Iraqi sovereignty was held by Saddam and his Baathist party. The U.S.-led coalition overthrew him, and an occupation government was installed. Paul Bremer, the administrator for the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), had an office that was part of the Defense Dept, and he reported directly to Rumsfeld. A month or so later, the CPA appointed a special Iraq Interim Governing Council made up of prominent Iraqis from various sectors of Iraqi society--political, religious, and tribal. The Council's ethnic and religious breakdown was representative of the larger Iraqi society: 13 Shiites, five Sunni Arabs, five Kurds (also Sunnis), one ethnic Turk and an Assyrian Christian. The Council's mission was to provide transitional leadership to an eventual democratic state. The Council was recognized by the Arab League, which agreed to seat its representative in Iraq's chair at its meetings. Perhaps the Council's greatest achievement was drafting and approving the interim constitution that would come into effect upon the dissolution of the CPA.\n'\n \n Yes, all correct, and you are proving my point for me. This was the foundation of the Iraqi government to come (unless of course we loose) and it was composed of a bunch of guys that we hand picked. And we wonder why many people in Iraq are having trouble seeing this government as legitimate.\n \n \nThe next major phase was in June this year when both the Council and the CPA were dissolved and replaced by the Interim Iraqi Government (IIG). The Council, in dissolving itself, appointed Allawi as interim PM. The interim constitution also came into effect at this time. The dissolution of the CPA and simultaneous creation of the IIG constituted a transfer of sovereign power back to the Iraqi people. Some may argue that the continued presence of U.S. soldiers constitutes a de facto occupation, but the fact remains that the U.S., the UN, the Arab League and other countries recognize the IIG as being the sovereign government of Iraq. This caretaker government will continue to govern until elections take place. The transition is a process that's still unfolding. \n \n \n The question is not whether the UN will accept the new government, or other nations. The question is whether or not the Iraqi people will accept the new government. Whether the UN or any other foreign body accept the inerim government is a triviality.\n \n \nThe history of mankind is more than the picture of bloodshed and slaughter you paint. Your universal rule--that violent revolt is the way things get done--is hardly as sweeping as you think. Nor did I suggest, as you seem to imply, that nonviolence is the only right way to get results. It appears you see the world as only black or white. Sometimes force is necessary, but sometimes compromise, negotiation, and persuasion are sufficient.\n\n \n Generally, when ther are tanks in your streets, the time for peaceful protest has passed. When they are tossing demonstrators into prison for interrogation, the time for peaceful protest has DEFINATLY passed.\n \n \nFrankly, ploughing through your rhetoric quickly become tedious: We appointed 'our guy' as dictator. We kill anyone who disagrees with us. Blah, blah, blah.\n\n \n As does sorting through yours. Your logic in this (mostly \"we are right becasue we say we are right\") reminds me so much of that of the Bush administration that I can't help but wonder if you actually understand the issues and have examined them critically, or are you simply reiterating rhetoric you have heard along the way?\n \n \nRegarding your paragraph on Afghanistan, you didn't include a single sentence without error. There were not huge numbers of people left out of the election, all the candidates and parties were allowed to campaign, and no Afghan leader of consequence questions the legitimacy of Karzai's government. Please feel free to show otherwise.\n\n \n If the legitimacy of the government is not being questioned, why does the govertnment only control a relatively small area of Afghanistan? IF their authority to government is above reproach, why do we still have so many troops there.\n \n \nI smile, of course, because you have apparently unknowingly laid out the very course charted by the CPA and Interim Iraqi Governing Council before those two entities dissolved themselves. Notwithstanding your extravagant rhetoric, when all is said and done you are found to be proposing the same path that Iraq is embarked on already.\n\n \n I didn't unknowingly lay a course for anything. The course I suggested and that upon which Iraq is currently on are radically differnt. Mine did not start with a bunch of individuals appointed by a foreign nation. \n \n \n \nThe only part you seem to have a real problem with is the interim period from the overthrow of Saddam to the present situation. You seem to think the interim period was avoidable, as if direct national elections could he held shortly after Saddam's fall. The interruption of sovereignty that occurred with Saddam's overthrow created a void. Something had to fill it. Democracy requires a civil society to function effectively and hold honest elections. \n \n \n While it is, of course, an impossibility that leaders could have been elected immeditly (since our goal was a constitutional government, and the country had no constitution, how could you possibly have elected leaders?), there was no barrier to the election of representatives to a constitutional convention. Instead, we appointed \"prominent iraqis\" from the various ethnic groups. I know a lot of \"prominent\" americans, and a lot of them are scumbags. If somebody appointed a bunch of \"prominent americans\" to draft a new constitution, I would not be overjoyed, neither would much of the remainder of the nation.\n \n Saddams overthrow didn't create a void. US troops moved right in there and kept fair to decent control of the country for a while. It is even (I think) fair to say that the majority of the Iraqi people were consenting to our presence. It was only as time wore on, and the Iraqis started to question our intentions there, that the violence picked up. \n \n \nIraq had no recent history of democracy, and one-party rule had left the country ill-qualified to function as one, so it has technically been very difficult to arrange for national elections. In any event, the Iraqis have arrived at the phase of the plan that you like. The creation of an elected National Assembly is next. The target date is Jan 31. The phases to follow the election of the National Assembly are not a secret, so I'm not sure why you weren't aware of them sooner, but better late than never. If it makes you feel better, you might even consider that the Iraqis are following the DAEWOO transition plan, since you seem to have arrived at the same plan independently. Welcome aboard!\n\n \n Iraq had election offices in most major cities. Tehre were elections held under saddam, they were sham elections, but there WERE elections. The conscept of voting was not new to the Iraqi people. What we were allegedly offering was the opportunity to vote for whomever they wanted. Then we started appointing people to build the basis of their government, basically creating self government, but only within the parameters which we set.",

Surely you know that 2002 is the past, so your reference URL serves to prove my original point-that your rationale about our Afghan military units being deployed to secure a pipeline route is left hanging out to dry.

No, you would have gone straight to your proof. You must think I just fell off the turnip truck.\n \n The leaders of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan can sign agreements all day long inviting international tenders to help launch the project, but it's all to no avail if there's no company or consortium able and willing to step up to the plate. Unocal, one of the world's leading energy resource and project development companies, refuses to get involved again, even though they did the original feasibility study and led the consortium that in 1997 flew Taliban leaders to Texas for discussions. \n \n You have not shown there's a credible syndicate committed to financing a pipeline across Afghanistan, nor have you shown the identity of the constructor who will build it.

My point was that US payments to the Taliban approximately equaled what they (Taliban) were receiving in taxation ($45mm) on opium production/transportation/smuggling prior to the Afghanistan's clerical edict of opium production being unIslamic, coinciding with the beginning of US payments. They had every reason to continue production curtailment had not the US invaded Afghanistan and taken them out of power. Remaining opium inventories merely responded as any commodity would; when potential supply is cut demand drives pricing. At the time of US invasion, Taliban forces controlled 90% of Afghanistan, versus the 10% currently controlled by the US dictated 'democratic' government. That control was facilitated by Taliban ability to negotiate levels of tax sharing acceptable to the various Afghan tribes and regional tribal affiliations who actually control Afghanistan, not a 'popular' vote. \n \n Your posts on our foreign intervention parallel current administration policy releases, in some cases almost word for word.
