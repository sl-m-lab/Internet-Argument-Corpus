Why are you here?\n\n To produce non-viable arguments.\n \n \nActually, as a scientist, I have never seen anything that Accipter has posted with which I can take exception. On the other hand, it seems that you rely more on insult than argument. As a result, rather than answer his argument, you claim that his argument isn't \"viable.\" And yet, I am not aware of any \"viable' argument that you have ever presented.\n\n You are no scientist.\n \n \nif you think you understand quantum physics, you dont understand quantum physics.\n\n \nthats not my point. its a quote from Richard Feynman who rightly thinks that quantum theory is exceptionally difficult to understand, and therefore no one truly gets it.\n\n Well if all this talk of what is or is not science I say something one cannot understand cannot be science :p\n \n \nSpace expanding is also an idea I have a problem with because its hard to conceive an empty area that is not empty space that empty space needs to expand into and fill.\n\n Yes, that is a contradiction one that accipter and pandion failed to resolve when I brought it to their attention in another thread, although they did accomplish the record for calling me ignorant in the same thread. (Oh and we are all very tired of redshifting, did you know it relates to making smoothies too?)",

Deism, pantheism, there are lots of options.

Respectfully submitting the words of Archbishop Desmond Tutu: \n \n \nTutu says he still reads the Bible everyday but recommends that people don't believe everything it teaches. \n \n \"You have to understand is that the bible is really a library of books and it has different categories of material,\" he said. \n \n \"There are certain parts which you have to say no to. The Bible accepted slavery. St Paul said women should not speak in church at all and there are people who have used that to say women should not be ordained. There are many things that you shouldn't accept.\" \n http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/12/15/ctw.tutu.climate.interv iew/index.html\n\n \n I also like the book of Ecclesiastes, its skepticism & pessimism speak to the breadth of the Jewish religious tradition, the wanderers & the wonderers.\n \n Spinoza too.",
