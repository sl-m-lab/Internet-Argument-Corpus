   "That is an interesting question.\n \n I can see a few possibilities.\n \n 1)The *****easiest**** (in relative terms) would be to subtly change the earths climate. Cool the climate and lock up a portion of the water in glaciers. This is basically what you have during an ice age. The mean sea level then lowers and sea floor effectively \"rises\" opening up new land to use. This land has the advantage of being very fertile from all the organic activity present during time of higher sea level.\n \n 2)Another approach would be to redirect magma from hotspots in the pacific to create new islands. Now, this will happens naturally, but with some direction lava can be \"shaped\" into more usable and less mountainous terrain.\n \n 3)Then there is messing with the mantle, as mentioned earlier. This would pose an avalanche of problems from inertia imbalances to global weather catastrophes. But, putting aside fears o radical global change a large enough concentration of nuclear charge on a pre-existing hotspot could \"open\" the already weakened crust allowing high pressure magma to gush out. The premise here is basically to create large scale basaltic flows, which are natural and have happened before during the earths history. This would just be speeding one up. You may know them as sheet basalt or whatever, but the point would be to create new islands in shallow marine environments from large scale basalt flows.\n \n 4)If you just want to raise up the entire ocean, you cold also take the approach of heating the earth up to a point where water completely vaporizes. This could be possible with enough effort put into greenhouse gases, but you are stuck with a very warm world where humans would have difficulty living (but it would still be possible). And I don't like humid heat.\n \n If I had to choose, I would go with option 1.",
