   "The Origins of \"Racism\": The Curious Beginnings of a Useless Word\n \n According to the second edition (1989) of the OED, the earliest known usage of the word \"racism\" in English occurred in a 1936 book by the American \"fascist,\" Lawrence Dennis, The Coming American Fascism. The second usage of the term in English that the OED records is in the title of a book originally written in German in 1933 and 1934 but translated into English and first published in 1938 - \"Racism\" by Magnus Hirschfeld.\n \n Who was Magnus Hirschfeld and what did he have to tell us about \"racism\"?\n \n Magnus Hirschfeld (1868-1935) was a German-Jewish medical scientist whose major work was in the field of what came to be known as \"sexology\"-the scientific study of sex. Like Havelock Ellis in England and Alfred Kinsey in the United States, Hirschfeld was not only among the first to collect systematic information about sexuality but also was an apostle of sexual \"liberation.\"\n \n It is fair to say that his works were intended to send a message-that traditional Christian and bourgeois sexual morality was repressive, irrational, and hypocritical, and that emancipation would be a major step forward. Long before the \"sexual revolution\" of the 1960s, Magnus Hirschfeld was crusading for the \"normalization\" of homosexuality and other abnormal sexual behavior.\n \n Full essay:\n \n http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=251\n \n \n \n .",

   "Do you know the origin of the word \"window\"? It was first used by a norweigan tribesman somewhere around 800 AD and refered to an opening in the roof. Since most people don`t have openings in their roofs anymore (unless they have a fireplace, in which they call it a chimney) the word window is completly pointless and redundant. Right?\n \n EDIT: Oh and btw, I see you have put Teutoburg, Germany in your location. I have never seen a german treat the name of their country in the way you do (typing DE). It seems like a very American thing to do. Are you German, or is it just whishful thinking from your part?",

   "Some More Insights into the Hollow Terms \"Racism\" and \"Racist\"\n \n The French writer Guillaume Faye describes \"racism\" as a bomb that exploded in the 1960s, but for the English-speaking world noxious weed would be a better metaphor. In American English \"racism\" began small and obscure during the 1930s, but it spread widely in the decades that followed, eventually growing into a perverse moral system that instructs Whites that the pursuit (or even the mere defense) of their own group interests is a terrible crime.\n \n We should try, as a brief thought-experiment, to cast our minds back to the era before the arrival of \"racism.\" If in 1920 someone had claimed that prohibiting non-White immigration into White nations was \"racist,\" no one would have had any idea what he meant, because the label \"racism\" had not yet come into existence.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=4530\n \n \n \n .",
