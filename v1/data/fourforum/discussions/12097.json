   "Here's an interesting thing that happened to me. I went to see my doctor on Thurs. I am on a low (5 mg) but typical dose of a blood pressure medication but my blood pressure is running just a bit high. The doctor decided to increase (but not double) my dose, saying that I should take 1 1/2 pills each day. If my blood pressure came down too low, I should go back to 1 / day. So I took my prescription for 45 pills for 30 days to the pharmacy. The insurance company for my Medicare Part D Rx plan rejected the prescription. The reason they gave was that it exceeded the number of pills for my plan.\n \n Not the dosage but the number of pills. I could have 30 pills for the month - not 45. I could have 30 5 mg. pills or 30 10 mg. pills. In fact, I could have 100 10 mg. pills if the doctor wrote that. I just couldn't have 45 5 mg. pills - there is a pill limit on 5 mg. pills. I specifically asked what the dosage limit was and the answer was that there isn't any dosage limit, only a pill limit.\n \n I got the 30 pills and will get 15 more \"sample\" pills from the doctor. I will also get a new Part D insurance carrier. I already checked with BC/BS and they don't count pills and I won't end up paying any more in the long run.\n \n I cancelled Aetna Part D Rx Plan. They have rejected at least 4 prescriptions in the last couple of months, requiring that I call the doctor to try to get something else.",
