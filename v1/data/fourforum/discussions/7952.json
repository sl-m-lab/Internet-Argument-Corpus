   "Well I know I've been looking around for a different forum because of some of the same reasons DamEtel cited, i.e. \"Just about every time I log in I have a new Private Message from Admin warning me about my conduct, and saying that I am going to be banned.\" I don't get quite that many warnings, but if a group who hates the message of Christ and those who bring it flood Admin with enough complaints about every little thing, then the warnings come regardless. \n\n Pete!\n \n emoticon_wow \n \n \n I have been reading most of your post since way back at USA Today and NYTimes . . . 2001. \n \n I remember the unlevel playing field from day one. God as my witness, some how, some one/bot even got in a few very profane words through the filter at me at one of those forums, which I will not name. I know they were not cursing at me. God in me really enraged someone, no doubt. \n \n Orion9 was kind enough to direct me over here from another forum I saw him/her? (said they weren't Frank) posting on. If you leave out of here I hope I can catch up with you on another board . . . You do have my email addy still? \n \n It has been a difficult debate to follow none the less. But noone promised this would be easy.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Just the same, Happy belated Easter, bro! \n \n :)",

   "Sounds awful. If I wanted a slagging match I could go down the local boozer on a Friday and have a row about politics with some p*ssed up lout there.\n \n Personally I prefer things with a little more decorum.\nI too prefer civilized dialog, debate and open discussion...gentlemanly behavior, so to speak. However, there are many educated ruffians in this world who deserve to be heard and responded to despite their lack of manners. In doing so, it is 'polite' to let them know that their foul language and personal attacks are expected and shall be returned in kind so that they fully understand their equal standing amongst the valued participants. There are also occasions where lessons are slowly absorbed by those 'crude' people and their language gradually changes for the better. Banning them only makes them more angry.\n \n In the world of 'treat me as you want to be treated', I swing back with a heavy stick at those who dare curse me.\n \n DamEtel can't hold a candle to some who have been banned from here for relentless non-sense. His attitude is somewhat irritating at times and I seldom bother to verify his quoted scripture as I am aware that the Bible can be used to justify both sides of many controversial questions. While he hasn't totally avoided name calling and appears to have an endless supply of needling questions, some of which seem meant to be so, he should be welcome to speak his mind, feeble as it may be. Each time he does, his opponents garner more respect from me for putting up with his :xcensored !",

To simply complain about something is not argument. \n \n Religion is a hotbutton issue for many. Attacks on people are simply unacceptable. Argument that is solid argument is what this site is about. I to, have been warned about my conduct for things also not worthy, in my opinion.
