   "Today the Republican/Tea party Majority in the House voted unanimously to Repeal the Obama Health Care Plan. \n \n House GOP Repeals Health Care Law In Symbolic Vote\n \n Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said he will not even bring it to the floor in the Senate, so apparently the Repeal is dead on arrival. \n \n I find this hilarious. The New House Majority is Now claiming That they have Kept their Promise to their Voting Public by passing this in the House. They knew full well that actually repealing this Bill would be an impossible task, yet they are wasting time to keep an Empty Promise. It doesn't matter that the Health Care does have some problems, the point is they KNEW they couldn't do anything about it but they made the Promise anyway and whats worse is that people actually fell for it and believed they would get this done.\n \n I guess it's a fair trade off for them for when they are forced to break their promise of No Compromise. Next up they will have to Vote on a Budget, and they will have to vote on raising the debt ceiling. They will in reality have no choice but to raise the ceiling, or face a Government shut down. Along with this will come , of course, increased spending, which Both sides of the Aisle campaigned against last year. \n \n What gets me is that they will waste all this time trying to repeal the health care reform, yet they offer no reform or program to replace it. They're not talking about how they are going to fix anything, no all they are worried about is un doing anything and everything Obama has done< good or Bad< and all the while the American Middle Class and the Poor are suffering .",

Fixing the economy is necessary before even beginning to 'fix health care', because we can't afford to fix health care without fixing the economy. Obamacare is a case of misplaced priorities.

The GOP now wants to tell millions of Americans that Now have Insurance \" Sorry, but you lose again, \".. And what's even more funny is that The Health Care reform is largely based on Republican Ideas. They don't like it because Obama got it passed , that's the Only reason they are repealing.

   "That seems hypocritical considering that one of their main complaints when they were in the minority was that the Democrats spent way too much time on health care reform- time that could have been better spent on other issues. \n\n \n That's not Hypocritical. Republicans and Democrats both campaigned in 2008 on the issue of Health Care Reform.. The Repubs as Usual did not have anything to Offer, so the Democrats got it pushed through. Yeah the Re-pubs will say it was a waste of time but the fact that Health Care reform was Accomplished is not as waste of time. If they have a better Plan and want to try to push it through then so be it, but going backwards is ridiculous. 2 years ago we had 60 million Americans without any type of Medical Coverage, Today that Number is halved... Would you like to tell 30 million people that the insurance they now have because of Obamacare is going away, and they will be back to no coverage because the insurance companies will once again be in full control of who gets insurance and who don't?... the GOP doesn't mind telling people that, but they will come 2012 when The Voters show them the Doors again....",

   "Um no; the reason its unpopular is because professionals actually IN healthcare (who would know) say it will worsen care for patients. Read it for yourself.\n This very well might be the biggest disaster of Obama's administration.\n\n \n So Doctors who are the ones administering the Health Care are admitting that the quality of Health care will go down?.. That makes about as much sense as Sara Palin going to M.I.T. \n \n The fact that more people are able to buy insurance has nothing to do with the quality of care. Insurance companies are threatening to pay less, Doctors are going to make less money, and that would be the only reason they would be against any bill that concerns their pockets.\n \n I agree there are some bad elements to the Bill, but There are Good ones too and I don't consider it a disaster. It's funny though that this Bill, including the part that the GOP hates the most which is the Mandate to force people to buy insurance was originally a republican Idea. They tried to pass such a bill in 94 when Clinton was trying to reform health Care. Now when Obama copies their Ideas and gets it passed they suddenly decide it's bad for America..lol.. \n \n Love it or hate it, doesn't matter. The Bill passed and has been made into Law, the only way it will ever be repealed now is if the Supreme Court finds the Mandate unconstitutional. And I'm not so sure they will any time soon, you know how long they take to even see a case.",
