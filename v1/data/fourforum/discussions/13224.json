Apparently, you're a hate group if they hate you.\n \n  SPLC Hatewatch Headlines \nOath Keepers Gather Strength in Montana \n\n \n Oath Keepers have vowed to uphold the Constitution, which includes refusing to obey orders to disarm the population. So it's not them trying to render people of color defenseless--it's the left, that is, you national socialists (own it, Mac--that's what you are). And I know it causes outrage among hard core leftists when non-Caucasians don't toe the collectivist line, but the ones I know in Oath Keepers find being portrayed as racist haters ironic, offensive and wrong-headed, to say the least.\n \n I'll leave you with two statements from Oath Keepers' \"What We Are Not\" statement:\n \"We are Not advocating or promoting violence towards any organization, group or person,\" and \"We are Not advocating or promoting any act or acts of aggression against any organization or person for any reason including, but not limited to; race, religion, national origin, political affiliation, gender or sexual orientation.\"\n\n I did not post this because of any pertinent relevance, but this statement FINALLY Clears it all up!

   "Sinjin, From what I know, the Oathkeepers are nonpartisan. They believe that both the Democrats and the Republicans have culpability. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely! \n \n Does everyone agree with everyone in every org? Nope. Maybe you do, or don't agree with Van Jones, and that is your prerogative, but does that negate any good he may have done? Should we, just because he is a crack pot? Is he therefore dangerous to America? I can officially say, not now that he is our of power. \n \n Because of him, should we therefore demonize every Democrat because of his statements? How about Jack and Bobbie Kennedy? Should we demonize everyone in America? How about everything in America as well, to include the U.N., which means every country in the world? Howe'd that be! emoticon_rolleyes \n \n That is what YOU hope to do with your post! \n \n I am not per se in the Oathkeepers, but, and nevertheless, we, and if I remember correctly, also you, took an oath to defend the Constitution from enemies both foreign and domestic. That is all they are saying. If you are a D or an R or an I or any other affiliation, they have a problem with you if you become an enemy of our Constitution. After all, they took an oath and an oath is supposed to be a serious thing. \n \n There are plenty of correct ways to change laws, and even (but especially) our Constitution, if it becomes burdensome. Use the correct methods to change laws, and constitutionally authorized method for changing our Constitution, is what they would say. If you don't, what is to distinguish you from other criminals? Both break the law, and when it comes to the Constitution, the SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND, so one should be considered a Super Duper Criminal, because it is a crime against all of us. No? \n \n Why do they try to change what our Constitution means, without going through the constitutionally accepted method? That answer is simple! It is a HUGE hurtle to overcome, and they don't have anywhere near the votes, so they have to develop constitutionally dangerous scams. \n Link   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \nThat is what the Oathkeppers see as well.\n \n That constitutionally huge hurtle was designed that way on purpose! It was designed to be purposefully Hard! \n   U.S. Constitution - Article 5 -- Amendment \nThe Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\n",

   "There ARE good reasons to \n \"Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel.\" -- \n\n The Obama Administration is, in fact, hostile to our Right to Keep and Bear Arms. Are they hostel to other other Constitutionally Recognized as Inalienable Rights protected by the Bill of Rights? Some think so! \n   EDITORIAL: Sunstein flunks gun rights test  \n A videotape has surfaced of a lecture Mr. Sunstein gave on Oct. 23, 2007. Here is what he said: \"My coming view is that the individual right to bear arms reflects the success of an extremely aggressive and resourceful social movement and has much less to do with good standard legal arguments than [it] appears.\" Discussing the anti-gun laws in the District of Columbia, he said a critic of such strict gun control would say that a \"trigger lock interferes with his efforts at self-defense against criminals. What on Earth does that have to do with the Second Amendment as originally understood?\" \n \n Later in the lecture, Mr. Sunstein said, \"My tentative suggestion is that the individual right to have guns as it's being conceptualized now is best taken as a contemporary creation and a reflection of current fears - not a reading of civic-centered founding debates.\" \n \n Mr. Sunstein's overt hostility to the idea that the Constitution protects an individual right to bear arms, including for purposes of self-defense, is not something that should be welcomed from somebody whose job might entail weighing in on the value of anti-gun regulations. It also makes his more recent assurances that he is a Second Amendment stalwart seem rather disingenuous, at the very least. \n\n \n Gun writer Jeff Soyer says:   Obama Nominee Cass Sunstein on Gun Rights \n I don't really think there was any debate back then about the right to own firearm. There was debate about whether to specify that right in the Bill of Rights, but not the idea itself:\n \n [The Constitution preserves] \"the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation. . . (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.\"\n \n - James Madison- The Federalist, No. 46\n \"Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property. . . Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.\"\n \n - Thomas Paine - Thoughts On Defensive War, 1775\n \"...who are the militia, if they be not the people of this country...? I ask, who are the militia? They consist of now of the whole people, except a few public officers.\"\n \n - George Mason\n \"The great object is, that every man be armed.\"\n \n -Thomas Paine\n \"Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possesion and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?\"\n \n - Patrick Henry\n \"... of the liberty of conscience in matters of religious faith, of speech and of the press; of the trail by jury of the vicinage in civil and criminal cases; of the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus; of the right to keep and bear arms.... If these rights are well defined, and secured against encroachment, it is impossible that government should ever degenerate into tyranny.\"\n \n - James Monroe\n \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\" and\n \"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\"\n \n -Thomas Jefferson\n \"Arms in the hands of citizens (may) be used at individual discretion...in private self-defense...\"\n \n -John Adams -A Defense of the Constitution of the Government of the USA\n \"No free government was ever founded or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for the defense of the state.... Such are a well regulated militia, composed of the freeholders, citizen and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen.\"\n \n - State Gazette (Charleston), September 8, 1788\n \"Laws that forbid the carrying of arms. . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.\"\n \n -Thomas Jefferson -Commonplace Book 1774\n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed....\" -Noah Webster -An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution 1787\n \n \"The few cases wherein these things (proposed Bill of Rights) may do evil, cannot be weighed against the multitude where the want of them will do evil...I hope therefore a bill of rights will be formed to guard the people against the federal government...\"\n \n -Thomas Jefferson - in a letter to James Madison, 1788\n \"They [proposed Bill of Rights] relate 1st. to private rights....the great object in view is to limit and qualify the powers of government...\"\n -James Madison- The Papers of James Madison \n",

   "Oh That's silly. No one would ever try and seize your guns! You guys are just Loons! \n   Feds investigate NOPD four years after Katrina; gun seizures should play into case  \n Four years after Hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc on the City of New Orleans, leaving anarchy in its wake, the Department of Justice is reportedly putting on a full court press investigation of the police in that city, with the main focus being on two shooting incidents that left three people dead.XX \n \n Let's be up front about this: Since the Second Amendment Foundation and National Rifle Association (and nobody else!) stepped to file a landmark federal lawsuit to stop authorities in New Orleans from illegally seizing firearms in the hurricane's aftermath, nobody has been held accountable for that treachery. Now would be a good time for Barack Obama and Eric Holder to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that they respect the Second Amendment by ordering the FBI to find out who issued the confiscation order, and bring them to justice, along with the individual officers who behaved like goons. TheirXtactics reflected on the thousands of good and decent police officers and sheriff's deputies all over the country who would never dream of acting without warrant and abusing their authority, no matter what the emergency, and it created a distrust of law enforcement at times of emergency that lingers today.\n \n\n \n   Video The Untold Story of Gun Confiscation After Katrina ",
