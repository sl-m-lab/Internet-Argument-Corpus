   "Ok, I was looking around for Bible contradictions (it was a project I did once) and this guy said this was a contradiction.\n \n He said \"Insects do NOT have four feet\n \n --True, and here are the verse he brings up to try and show a mistake.\n \n LEVITICUS 11:21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;\n \n LEVITICUS 11:22 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.\n \n LEVITICUS 11:23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.\n \n Did you see the error he made?\n \n Before I go into this, I've seen people try to dismiss the Bible, for it is not scientifically accurate. Some people say it is, and some bring up verses and claim them to be true. The other people say that they aren't nearly detailed or often mentioned enough to say the Bible is true simply because it had ONE correct fact in it about Science. But then, some turn around and then try to dismiss the entire Bible as being untrue because of a scientifical error. Can you see the bias in such things?\n \n Now, for those who didn't see it, I'll explain it.\n \n --Insects don't have four feet. That is true, but the man was so foolish and so heated to find an error that he didn't realize that his own refrences merely proved the fact that insects DO indeed have more than four feet. There is nothing here to contradict or say other wise.\n \n \n Look at this verse. LEVITICUS 11:21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;\n \n Right there! Obviously it isn't trying to say that you can only choose an insect that has a leg as well as a foot. If you didn't have a leg above your foot, you would be imobile and your foot would serve no use.\n \n The legs above their feet are the task legs. Most insects, like the ones mentioned, often use all six legs to crawl, but more often two are used for 1. Creating noise, 2. Mating, 3. Eating and 4. cleaning themselves. This man, so foolish to try and find a mistake merely proved a scientific fact, trying to pronounce the entire Bible as untrue for making a little mistake which would never convince him had it been true at face-point.
