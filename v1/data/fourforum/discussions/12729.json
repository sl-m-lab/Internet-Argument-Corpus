Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal &#8220;scholarship&#8221; or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today&#8217;s liberal elitists. \n \n The genesis of today&#8217;s liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and &#8220;free-love,&#8221; illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. \n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. &#8220;Right and wrong,&#8221; and &#8220;good and evil&#8221; were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it &#8220;feels good, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their &#8220;progressive&#8221; mindset was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone \"over 30,\" and now they're over 30 and say, \"Trust us, and what we teach!\" Thank you, FOXNews.com - University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News Ward Churchill. \n \n One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is &#8220;equality.&#8221; The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to elevate women via the degradation of men, promote (so-called) racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other people&#8217;s money, rather than relying on one&#8217;s own personal initiative and work ethic), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal &#8220;tolerance.&#8221; However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. \n \n Rather than truly embrace &#8220;freedom,&#8221; liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV&#8217;s, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via &#8220;hate-speech&#8221; laws (note Canada), and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. \n \n Ii is certainly arguable, then, that &#8220;progressive&#8221; liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence. &#8211; Author Unknown",

Reporting its existence isn't the same as promoting it. The Bible hasn't been rewritten to show that God frowns on slavery, it shows it, and it always has. That he allowed it, or even promoted it in some areas of the Old Testament for certain purposes doesn't mean it's a good thing permanently.\n\n I never said the bible \"promotes\" slavery.\n However, to elaborate on the bible's position, it does have explicit guidance on how Jewish people are to enslave (or be slaves) for other Jewish people.\n It has separate documentation on enslaving of other races.\n One example:\n  However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way. (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)\n \n Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed. If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts. Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them. (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)\n There are other examples as well, of enslaving nations as a consequence of war. \n \n But regardless, the point is regarding how the Biblical God, in the traditional interpretation, did not see slavery as an evil. It was explicitly allowable.\n The point is more towards people who claim the bible verses themselves would make slavery an evil. If such a conclusion is come to secularly (or if both an evolving bible and an evolving constitution view is held), obviously there is no contradiction then.\n \n \n \nIn todays U.S. secular society, yes, within Christian denominations that are conservative enough to have a lot of originalist constitutionalists, not so much. No women preachers in my Christian denomination. emoticon_xangel\n\n The bible stretches farther than just female preachers, into establishing clear male dominated pattern.\n But regardless, as you discussed with a \"secular\" and \"evolving\" approach, other practices are observed.\n \n \n \nI'm afraid it is. Romans chapter three. \n\n I don't understand the objection.\n The bible establishes that \"faith\" is a means to avoid judgment, but it in no way voids the commandments.\n The traditional biblical interpration would be to follow the commands as best possible, but that the inherent failure to do so doesn't result in divine condemnation.\n \n But that still means the commands are followed.\n To quote the final verse...\n Romans 3:31 Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.\n \n \n \nNot a complete elimination, it can be a blend, according to the circumstances of each persons life. \n\n I don't see how that can be justified by a \"strict traditionalist\" interpretation of the bible.\n I acknowledge that an \"evolving\" approach may lead in that direction, but I am referring to a \"strict traditionalist\" interpretation in such an assessment.\n \n While I admit there is obvious biblical evidence of the \"food\" commands being voided in the New Testament, such actions would be explicitly restricted to just food commands being voided, under a \"strict traditionalist\" analysis.\n As a traditionalist constitutionalist would put it, there is no evidence that such a liberal view was ever intended in the original documentation. As such, it should be rejected.\n \n From a more \"evolving\" stand-point, there is obviously more room for interpretation.\n \n \n \nIt's controversial, one of the main reasons there are so many Christian denominations. Of course, some militant atheists want to have their say on it as well. While those atheists intentions may be good for society, they're often not good for Christianity. Christians who agree with them about controversial things should take that into consideration. \n\n Yes. There are many Christian denominations.\n But I know only a select few which still employ the standards I spoke of.\n There are sects which do things like prohibit blood transfusion out of an interpretation of \"ingesting blood\".\n There are also those isolationary sects like the Amish that exclude themselves from societal comforts like electricity and make their own clothes, with a more rigid traditional interpretation.\n \n My point isn't about getting them to change, but rather wondering how some who are resistant to change in the constitution, but accepting of change in their religious standards reconcile the contradiction.\n \n \n \nNot when religion isn't established in government. I personally don't have any desire to work on Sunday, but that doesn't mean I'd want 'no Sunday work' established in government in any way.\n\n That doesn't really address my point, as I am asking why some Christians take an \"evolving\" stance on the bible, but demand a \"traditional\" interpretation for the Constitution.\n \n But that does bring some ideas of overlap, as the people I am thinking of (okay, naming a couple examples of Jyoshu and Steeeeve) are explicitly FOR more establishment of religious presence in the government.\n Such an action would blur the line between \"religion\" and \"government\" even further, providing even an even smaller capability to defend the hypocrisy of \"evolving bible\" / \"traditional constitution\" approach.",

He's also the one who inspires all scripture, which includes Romans 1:26-27 and I Corinthians 6:9-10. Jesus is the same God, then, who helps create life in a mother's womb (Psalm 139:13) that the liberals love to refer to the abortionist for termination, rather than be responsible. Jesus is the one who defines sin, of which many liberals say doesn't exist. Jesus is the one who grants salvation that others think they can earn by their own perceived goodness. Jesus is the one who said a man shall reap what he sows, as opposed to the liberal's redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other people's money) where people reap what others sow. And Jesus is the one who, in the end, will bring judgment (vs. the liberal's endless windjamming at the U.N.) on the ungodly in the Book of Revelation.

If such a conclusion is come to secularly (or if both an evolving bible and an evolving constitution view is held), obviously there is no contradiction then. \n\n \n I believe an overall look at what the New Testament says clearly shows that slavery would be evil in the world today - there's no justification for it. Yet there was justification for it in the early days of Israel, and there could be a justification for it again in the future. We can't imagine what turmoil might lay ahead. \n \n \nThe bible stretches farther than just female preachers, into establishing clear male dominated pattern.\n But regardless, as you discussed with a \"secular\" and \"evolving\" approach, other practices are observed. \n\n \n I think secularism has invoked a \"male dominated\" thought pattern that has clouded the relationship that God/Christianity intends between men and women. It's a relationship, a companionship, not a domination. Women shouldn't seek equality, they should seek a relationship to men, as dictated by the circumstances of their personal lives. Women are capable of doing some things better than men. \n \n Out of time tonight. More later.",

   "Hmm...\n Nah. \n \n These sort of attempts to fit Jesus and his context/culture onto modern paradigms of \"conservatism\" and \"liberalism\" always makes me chuckle. It was SUCH a different situation that neither can be applied. There's not proportionality as so many issues across the board were completely different. Yet everybody, liberals and conservatives--and everyone else it seems--always wants to own Jesus(TM).\n \n One thing that made Jesus stand out (and STILL stand out) was that He was, in fact, OUTSIDE the whole liberal / conservative spectrum. This is why he can appeal to people of BOTH ends of the spectrum. He couldn't be pegged with either one and his teachings were and are applicable to either one. At the same time, both fall short of His teachings. His religious/moralistic teaching demanded forgiveness, YET repentance [Jn 8]. His social teaching required connection with God, not just mankind [Mt 5-7]. He was no conservative OR liberal. He couldn't be pegged as either. Or one could rather say it was both.",
