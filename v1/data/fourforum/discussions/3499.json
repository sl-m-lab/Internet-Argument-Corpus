The phrase \"survival of the fittest\" does not appear once in this 30 page article. :p\n\n \n America is VERY religious when compared to other industrialized nations, so I've heard. Why religious people reject evolution, but accept most other scientific theories without protest generally falls into one of these two categories:\n \n Their faith tells them the claims of evolution must be false, so they adopt that belief. Then they examine the earth is round claims...and since their faith doesn't reject that, they can then use reason to agree. They can hide their belief in god as reason by claiming irrational things, then making it all nice and tidy. This would be for thinkers who just so happen to be religious (specifically with faiths that object to evolution).\n \n OR\n \n They don't rely heavily on reason AT ALL for deeper understanding of the world around them. They start with faith (same as above), but when it comes time for some deep thinking, they rely on other people to tell them what's true and what is not. Evolution? The other members reject it? It contradicts the bible OK, I reject it!! Continental drift..hrmm...anyone object to it? \"no\"... \"nuh uh\"....\"nope\"...OK, it must be OK to believe it then.\n \n Most people I'd guess fall into the last category, which is scary. A mob mentality is always capable of doing some crazy things...like denying what is real and what is not.\n \n I think given the short lifespan of humans right now, it won't have need to change much. It can take 20-30 years to get a person to the point where they can reason soundly, and with limited time on earth you'd have to have some SERIOUS incentive to get those that understand, to waste their time trying to convince people who are too intellectually lazy to find knowledge for themselves.\n \n -Mach",

   "An important point that seems to have been missed is that the poll in question was not done by National Geographic. It was a Gallup poll that was apparently reported in NG. Gallup has been repeating these polls in essentially the same form every few years for decades. In spite of advances of science in those years, creationists seem to be as entrenched in their ignorance as ever.\n \n Other polls have arrived at similar conclusions. You have to suscribe to the Gallup site to see the results of their polls but they are reported elsewhere. Here is a discussion of the most recent Gallup poll, from 2001. This report is not comprehensive. Gallup asks more questions and then shows certain correlations between the data. George Gallup was himself a fundamentalist Christian and he expressed some disappointment with what the data showed.\n \n All of the polls showed that the more educated a responder was, the less likely they were to be a creationist. Besides being less educated, creationists also tend to be less affluent (understandable when one considers education), older, southern, more rural and female. I certainly hope that all of you are sophisticated enough to realize that data correlations do not necessarily indicate a causitive influence. Nevertheless, it was these correlations that caused Gallup himself to comment.\n \n Polls have also shown that about 95% of those holding a degree in science accept evolution rather than young earth creationism. The numbers are even higher, at about 99%, for biologists and geologists. Chemists have the highest number of creationists among their ranks, approaching 6%. I seem to recall that astronomers are next. I'm not sure how many of them are \"creationists\" as opposed to \"young earth creationists.\" The bottom line is that the lists of \"scientists\" who accept creationism that have been put forward by creationist ministries are laughable. Few of the creationist scientists are biologists, and others hold law degrees, sociology degrees, hydrolics degrees, and the like. In answer, the National Center for Science Education began a list of evolutionary scientists named Steve - in honor of the then recently deceased Dr. Stephen Jay Gould. About 1% of the human population is named \"Steve\" in some form. Currently the Steve Project has 489 scientists with Ph.D. degrees in biology, geology, paleontology, or a related scientific field who suscribe to the statement (see below). The list includes Stephen Hawking, even though he is more a cosmologist than a biologist. How could the application of one of the greatest scientific minds of our day be refused?\n \n All of these scientists suscribe to the following statement:\n \nEvolution is a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences, and the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that all living things share a common ancestry. Although there are legitimate debates about the patterns and processes of evolution, there is no serious scientific doubt that evolution occurred or that natural selection is a major mechanism in its occurrence. It is scientifically inappropriate and pedagogically irresponsible for creationist pseudoscience, including but not limited to \"intelligent design,\" to be introduced into the science curricula of our nation's public schools.\n\n \n Waxy has pointed out some theories that are arrived at by inductive rather than deductive logic. He left out the theory of gravitation. We observe the effects of gravity but we have no idea why it works.",

   "Good points Pandion.\n \n I did mention that the poll was a Gallup poll conducted on behalf of NG, and that the same poll has been conducted regularly over the last 20 years.\n \n Anyhoo,\n \n I have seen the stats regarding education vs. \"fundamentalist\" Christian beliefs in the past, and to me, the correlation/causation is undeniable. However, it tends to be a real hot potato in any debate so I generally try to steer clear of it. That said, I was genuinely surprised that the level of education was so low in the USA to result in the number of YECs being so high.\n \n I'd like to see the actual wording of the poll questions, and I'd like to see the results of the poll in some other G7 countries, especially Canada. \n \n I happen to fall into the category where 99%+ believe in evolution, I'm a geologist.\n \n Waxy",
