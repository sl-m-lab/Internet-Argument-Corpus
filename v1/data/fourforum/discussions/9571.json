   "I wrestle with the question of whether or not there is a God. It seems like I can prove it both ways and disprove it both ways. Does the universe need a creator to exist? Or is this just an idea inside man-made theology? Man yearns for the eternal. He wants to live forever and be strong forever. He is the only animal as far as we know which builds churches and contemplates the infinite. This in itself may be an indication that immortality resides in a soul of some kind.

   "Hmph... I cannot argue the existence of God from an ethical point of view, but I can very well endeavor an explaination from a circumstantial one. \n \n Every religion has its own perception of God; or (solely in my opinion), its own story which developed somewhere along the way. We started out as an uneducated primitive specie; the human race did not have the knowledge - the scientific knowledge - to explain the world around them. I think that God, although I have previously had towering experiences not explainable by science, is just a mere creation of human mind. God is for man's own sake and satisfaction; giving a man purpose and light into the future. \n \n Man most often forgets the purpose of life itself by zelously attempting to find the meaning of God. In the end, we all die and are relieved of all connections to God. What purpose does God serve then? (yes, I do not believe in afterlife). Holy Books tell the story of God, God is the story itself, we are the readers of this ingenious fiction. Lets not blame our predecessors, they simply didn't have the tools. :)",

   "The idea of the Christian God seems illogical. It seems hard to believe that theres a guy up there playing little games with us, saying \"If you don't do everything I say, you'll burn in hell for eternity\". It also seems hard to believe that he is so anthropomorphized. I've read the Christian bible. God seems too much like a man. The way he thinks, how he acts. Why would this God have a desire to force his morals on us, and punish us if we don't abide by them? That sounds like something man would do, the desire to reward and punish. Not a God. And furthermore, why would he rely on our \"faith\" if he has given us no solid evidence of his existence? We don't know any better, he hasn't shown us anything except a 2000 year old book written by 4 ancient men that, for all we know, could be a complete fib. I'm sort of agnostic, however the only evidence of a God I can see, is everything around us. Where did it come from? From a scientific standpoint, Lavoisier's law of conservation of mass and energy states that matter and energy can't be created nor destroyed. The big bang did happen, theres no question about that. But, who created the big bang?\n \n It would logically be a God or another life form that we are unaware of. And even if it was another life form that created the universe as we know it, who created them?\n \n My conclusion, is that there is obviously no Christian God, or Judge God that uses man as his plaything, thats obviously mythology. However, it would seem logical to conclude that there is a higher power somewhere out there. However, I highly doubt it cares about the behaviors of man. It is not for me to ponder, and my philosophy is to just make the best of your life.\n \n The afterlife is a whole different story, but I'm probably boring you people, so I'll stop here.",

Jesus says things to the effect of, you have to never have a lustful thought, EVER, or else, that's basically adultery. You can't never be angry at someone else--it's really murder to do that.

I suspect he has a more complicated theory of Christian ethics which his adversaries wish to distort in order to score cheap points in a tone of relentless hostility. (That's my impression in this and other threads). \n \n The sacred texts of Judaism are the foundation of Christianity, but the mission of Jesus Christ represents a new era in God's dealing with humanity - so much of the extensive body of Jewish law was/is no longer relevant. The Old Testament was revealed only to Israel; the New Testament is a revelation to all of mankind.\n \n Some evangelical scholars interpret the law embodied in the Mosaic Covenant by emphasizing the distinctions between moral, civil, and ceremonial imperatives. But this approach is sometimes arbitrary and tends to ignore the narrative context. It also fails to fully reflect the significant implications of the change from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant of salvation inaugurated by Jesus Christ.\n \n An alternative approach seeks universal principles in the Old Testament moral laws and legal codes which can be adopted by Christian believers today. In other words, we should filter the universal principle through the New Testament teaching regarding that principle, or regarding the specific law being studied. This allows Christians to see that all scripture is \"useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness\". (2 Tim. 3:16)\n \n Old Testament Law can be understood as an ancient deposit of timeless ethical and theological principles, and the interpreter therefore must strive to discover the unchanging truth beneath its cultural carapace.\n \n James.",

Is it still in force?\n\n \n If I may* ...\n \n Though it may seem subtle, I think you are conflating two very different things here. One of the things that changed with Christ is that of issues related to punishment. The passage you are referring to is about a punishment; it is not the sort of law that says \"thou shalt not\" do so-and-so. So no, this is not really an example of a \"moral law\" in the sense of moral-versus-ceremonial. It is an instruction about punishment (albeit very severe in this case). The admonition for a son to respect his father and mother IS still in place.\n \n To our 21st century eyes, in western culture, the idea of a son getting stoned for this seems incredibly harsh, but probably not so to the semitic culture a few thousand years ago. And so, this sort of thing has changed. However, the key point is that the law that demands children to obey their parents is indeed still in place, and it is the moral law here. It's just that we are to longer respond to the breaking of that law in the way prescribed in the passage you quote. THAT'S what has changed.\n \n \n \n \n \n * with hesitation, because my experience is that these sorts of cultural differences are sometimes used by the critics of religion as a means to an end to vilify God and the religion at issue, with little regard to the complexity of Biblical interpretation and cultural differences.

However, many pro-life call abortion genocide. How do you reconcil this problem?\n\n \n It's not a problem for me, it's a problem for you and others. Infanticide is still butchery when it comes to abortion.\n \n \n While you may not believe it to be so, others do and that is my point.\n\n \n Take it up with them, then. Go run an add or take a survey.\n \n \n\n What you inherently believe is really not important. It is the general concens of pro-life beliefs. You seem incapable of underestanding such a basic, elementry, pedestrian point.\n\n \n <flush<<sic<\n \n \n\n \n God is irrevelant. The Invisible Pretty Pink Unicorn says that abortion is okay. I can fabricate divinic support for any argument. Only XXXXXX believe that such backing has any merit.\n\n \n Nonsense. \n \n \n\n My point still stands. Abortion is not murder by definition and as it seems, abortion detractors are all too willing to change definitions at whim to suit their needs despite being correct as the correct definition, which again leads evidence to deliberate ignorance.\n\n \n That's your opinion. I think it's steeped in folly.\n \n \nNo, your arrogance is astounding. You cast your beliefs as the beliefs of all pro-life. That is beyond arrogance. Deal with my point or shutup. \n\n \n So far you're batting zero again. My beliefs are my own. You want to talk to someone else have at it. Maybe you should take a break and have a hot dog or something?\n \n \n\n You fail to address the problem of invitro\n\n \n Nope. I answered that. Go back and reread what I wrote. \n \n \n, You fail to address the problem of definitions, you fail to address the problems of rape/incest, you fail to address basically everything I have said and in your astounding arrogance pretend that all pro-life beliefs are the same as your's.\n\n \n Wrong again. And I can only speak for myself. You apparently want me to speak for the whole pro-life crowd, who undoubedtly don't agree on everything anymore than all homosexuals agree on gay marriage. So, go hold an assembly and quite bothering me with this tripe.\n \n \nDoesn't matter. Unless it is explicity stated in the Consitution, it doesn't exist. Don't you hate strict consitutionalism? I'm flushing you down the toliet.\n\n \n I think you just flushed yourself instead. Or have you never read, \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's?\" Why do you have such a hard time understanding Biblical concepts and principles? \n \n \nThis proves another point. Abortion foes pretend they are aganist consitutional activism yet wholehardly support it themselves. Contridictions are abound in your beliefs, but that's pretty damn obvious to everyone.\n\n \n I think abortion foes are mostly against liberal Judicial activism of the sort that would turn this country into a Canaanite cesspool, complete with sacrificing babies on the altars of their politically correct goddesses. \n \n \n\n No, your statement was absurd as it ignores the beliefs of everyone else and fallacious assumes everything believes the same thing as you. Does God look kindly upon people who have arrogance comming out of ever pore? You seemed to have failed to learn the lesson of humility. I guess the more you talk about Christ the less you have to act like him? Wouldn't you know this all too well EZ?\n\n \n Even Christ rebuked or corrected those who were full of folly. Why shouldn't I?\n \n \nThe baby doesn't have rights. I asked you to show me where in the Consitution a baby does. you failed as you always do.\n\n \n First answer the question you dodged and never really answered before: Psalm 139:13, Jeremiah 1:5, etc., say that God is instrumental in some way in the creation process of babies in their mother's wombs. What divine insight do you people think you have where you can butcher what God is then somehow instrumental in creating? Answer the question?\n \n \nAnyone with a brain knows that basising a argument like this one off of something unproven is futile. But then again....you are EZ. I know you have severe ADD, but this is not a discussion as to whether or not abortion is right or wrong, merely the examination of the reasoning and logic behind the arguments.\n\n \n Like I said before, if you want to post this in the religion forum and run with the big dogs then go bone up on your Biblical doctrines and principles. And even if I did have ADD, which I don't, I would still be much better off than having your philosophical outlook. \n \n What do all pro-choicers have in common? Their mother's all chose life!! ",

   "Nothing above effectively counters the points I raised. Just more blather.\n\n \n Deliberate ignorance anyone? I'm not debating whether or not abortion is right or wrong, I'm debating as you stated which of the arguments are more reasoned. You clearly are trying to back out of this initial assertion and turn it into a debate on whether or not abortion is right or wrong. You can do that somewhere else. Stay on topic, and there are drugs for ADD.\n \n \nIt's not a problem for me, it's a problem for you and others. Infanticide is still butchery when it comes to abortion.\n\n \n Since when did your pro-life beliefs become everyone's pro-life beliefs?\n \n Your arrogance is astounding. I stated this before: \n \n \"What you inherently believe is really not important. It is the general concens of pro-life beliefs. You seem incapable of underestanding such a basic, elementry, pedestrian point.\"\n \n Again, I never intended to debate if abortion is right or wrong, just the reasoning as to the arguments. You claimed that pro-life had more reasoned arguments. You now are refusing to debate this. My original post clearly stated what I was after, which was to examine the reasoning. \n \n Why you now are refusing to do what you claimed is suggestive that you know your arguments are not reasoned.\n \n \nTake it up with them, then. Go run an add or take a survey.\n\n \n Yet you stated the following:\n \n \nIf there were a way I'd love to match up the Pro-Lifer IQ's and reasoning ability to your group and watch this argument go quickly down the drain. It's nonsense.\n\n \n Why is you are now saying you won't do just this? Was I not correct in predicting you'd run away from a honest debate? Are you now not doing just that? \n \n You said that the reasoning ability of pro-life was better then pro-choice. Either admit your claim was false or defend it. Or at least amend that the reasoning ability of YOUR beliefs and not the entirity of pro-life is better then pro-choice. Either way you need to make a choice. \n \n \n<flush<<sic<\n\n \n We're not arguing the rights or wrongs or abortion, well I'm trying not to, I'm arguing the reason and the logic behind the arguments, and EZ obviously does not want to do this despite his opening posts as you can see by his refusal to actually address my points and instead attempting to turn it into a abortion right vs. wrong argument. I suspected this was his plan in the first place.\n \n Perhaps I am a prophet? \n \n \nNonsense.\n\n \n That's a idiot's answer as well as solution. Just ignore it. Explain to me how your divinic basis of reasoning is better then my divinic basis of reasoning when neither of the two can even be proven to exist. Like I said, only a XXXXX thinks that line of support is useful. \n \n \nThat's your opinion. I think it's steeped in folly.\n\n \n Perhaps you recall this threadwhere pro-lifers were doing just that? What is folly to you is reality to others, especially when they can cite examples of what they say is true, unlike you.\n \n \nSo far you're batting zero again. My beliefs are my own. You want to talk to someone else have at it. Maybe you should take a break and have a hot dog or something?\n\n \n So you admit your initial claim was false?\n \n \nIf there were a way I'd love to match up the Pro-Lifer IQ's and reasoning ability to your group and watch this argument go quickly down the drain. It's nonsense.\n\n \n Did you not say that? I take by your statement that you nullify your claim that pro-life has a greater reasoning ability then Pro-choice. Perhaps you should remember your statements in the past before making statements in the future, you apparently seem to have a problem remembering what you claimed to be true. \n \n \nNope. I answered that. Go back and reread what I wrote.\n\n \n On the contrary, you stated your beliefs, which are not the beliefs of pro-life as a whole. Furthermore, you never stated that you are entirely aganist invitro nor have stated whether or not you think the practice should be banned. So no, you did not answer. \n \n \nWrong again. And I can only speak for myself. You apparently want me to speak for the whole pro-life crowd, who undoubedtly don't agree on everything anymore than all homosexuals agree on gay marriage. So, go hold an assembly and quite bothering me with this tripe.\n\n \n You stated you would do just that, speak for the whole pro-life crowd!\n \n \nIf there were a way I'd love to match up the Pro-Lifer IQ's and reasoning ability to your group and watch this argument go quickly down the drain. It's nonsense.\n\n \n So apparently you're now rejecting your initial assertion. Now, if there is someone else who is willing to meet my initial assertion, which is as follows:\n \n \"Pro-Lifers to me usually seem pretty ignorant and haven't thoughout their arguments.\"\n \n \nI think you just flushed yourself instead. Or have you never read, \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's?\" Why do you have such a hard time understanding Biblical concepts and principles?\n\n \n Why do you have such a hard time accepting the most basic of legal processes and statements?\n \n \nI think abortion foes are mostly against liberal Judicial activism of the sort that would turn this country into a Canaanite cesspool, complete with sacrificing babies on the altars of their politically correct goddesses.\n\n \n You do have a talent for massive exaggeration. \n \n \nEven Christ rebuked or corrected those who were full of folly. Why shouldn't I?\n\n \n because you're a terrible christian and you seem to have bad memory. I already provided the quote of you saying you could argue that the reasoning of pro-life was better then pro-choice. You now have at least in this thread, rejected this claim yourself 2 or 3 times. \n \n \nFirst answer the question you dodged and never really answered before: Psalm 139:13, Jeremiah 1:5, etc., say that God is instrumental in some way in the creation process of babies in their mother's wombs. What divine insight do you people think you have where you can butcher what God is then somehow instrumental in creating? Answer the question?\n\n \n What divine insight do you have in proving God exists? You are entirely relying \n upon unprovable asserations as well as begging the question. For that argument to even be taken seriously, God must be proven to exist, and then that God must be proven to be one that actually does anything. Divinic support is outside of arguing about the nature of God itself, worthless. Only a idiot would rely upon faith foundations for a house, and likewise, only a idiot would rely upon faith foundations for a secular argument.\n \n \nLike I said before, if you want to post this in the religion forum and run with the big dogs then go bone up on your Biblical doctrines and principles.\n\n \n You think anyone here thinks you're nothing but a clown? \n \n As you have clearly stated you cannot meet your promise, my asseration of ignorance and unthoughtoutness of Pro-Life stands.",

I must've missed it. \n \n I didn't describe God. I described 'nothing.' I deliberately stated that nothing doesn't need the powers attributed to God by humans. Calling the beginning of the universe God seems little more than a way to protect one of the last of the gaps. \n \n It is easier for me to believe that nothing can exist outside of time and reality than to think that something can. I repeat, I can believe that nothing can exist outside of everything than believe that something can. Worrying about what came seems to be thinking forward, and not backward, as you advised I do.\n \n Does God explain it? It posits unnecessary things as well. Goddidit is not an explanation, but it does cause relief in human minds since it has similarities of an explanation. Unfortunately, we truly can't comprehend nothing, and a magical entity at least has properties.\n \n It doesn't mean much to me that Hebrews chose that as the word for their god. There are an estimated 4000 religions today (who knows how many in our history) and I'm sure many pondered upon the beginning of the universe while making up their gods.\n \n What happened before there was a before? What is north of the north pole? Was there something before there ever was something?\n \n \n Stephen Hawking may not be a self respecting cosmologist, but I'm not religious enough to pass judgement.

(although I am not perfect at doing that.)\n\n \n \n God might be the answer to questions such as \"What happened before there was a before?\" or \"What happened when there was nothing to happen?\" Maybe if the question doesn't seem loaded, irrational or imaginary, people will want a defined \"real\" answer. We know the answer to the fake question doesn't exist. But that may not be satisfactory.\n A person may demand a defined answer, because they don't know that \"What does a square-circle look like?\" has no real, rational answer. \"What existed before existence?\" In this case, if people cannot see what's wrong with the question in the first place, I guess God is a suitable answer for them. It's imaginary, still says nothing, but at least has the illusion of an answer to an irrational question. It also helped ancient man throughout history, so there may be an evolutionary reason many of us are still tied to this answer.\n \n You are ignoring the other alleged possibilities. If you demand a defined answer (albeit irrational) to an unreal loaded question, you are ignoring other irrational possibilities.\n There is no way to deduce god, since it's an entity that necessary \"exists\" in the world of the imaginary.

The issue is that matter and energy did not always exist. The data for the big bang makes it pretty clear that once upon a time, this stuff was not there. Further, the data does not support a big crunch for the current universe (the idea that the universe is expanding and will one day collapse back on itself to form a crunch with a subsequent big bang.) Without the big crunch and then the following big bang again there would be no \"series of matter and energy conversions\" that you suppose. Your answer is a possibility, but the current data do not support it and in fact contradict it. Hawkings says that the universe is bounded and infinite or it is finite and unbounded. These two scenarios say that there is something other than the series you imply. They support the something from nothing idea.\n \n the order found in chaos and the something from nothing imply something intelligent behind it, much like the clearly square or circle field shapes one sees when flying to a vacation spot. One can see intelligent intervention in the design. There is no such thing as \"random order\". This is an oxymoron. \n \n I see God as a distinct possibility and our razer simply does not apply. You ASSUME that because God is not directly in contact with you. There is most certainly evidence for God and you choose to ignore it. The problem with occams is that you cannot use it on every piece of evidence and then deny the whole. That is a slippery slope. The whole of the evidence, taken together certainly does imply the possibility of God and that would actually be the SIMPLEST explanation, as opposed to some incredible cosmic mechanism (which the data do not support) or that something came from nothing and we just cannot explain it. God actually is more likely if we use your logic.\n \n Thanks for the debate.\n \n Huck",

Our old life we shared with the Animals our new life we share with God. So humanity takes on the divinity of Christ and the diginity and worth of Almighty God...so all human beings become one with Christ and share in the sacredness of almighty God and so we are given a new dignity a divine dignity, our dignity is ressurected and brought to a new life in Christ and so what we do to the least of our brothers (humanity) we do unto Christ himself and so in Christ we share in such dignity and so to sin we scandalize Christ and degrade ourselves, we abandon our divine dignity and are reduced to animalistic human nature which leads to the degrading of fellow human beings and a reduction of humanity once again to animal like status. When we embrace Christ our human nature is humbled before God and we are raised up to a divine nature with Christ a new life. \n \n A Christian does not discriminate or persecute or reduce people to a less status of divine dignity, we recognise their worth as divine but do they themselves recognise that in themselves?\n \n For example a Christian does not reduce a mna who is attracted to other men to a less status of divine dignity and if he embraces Christ he humbles his human nature before God and shares in the divine dignity of God. But the man who rejects Christ and embraces his human nature in his sin he abandons the dignity God wishes to grant to him and is given over to animalistic behaviour and becomes an enemy of God and of divine human dignity.\n \n A woman Caught in lust for another man other than her husband who embraces Christ humbles her human nature before God shares in his divine dignity, but the woman who rejects god fails to recognise her divine dignity is enflamed with passion and is given over to animalistic behaviour which leads her to her becoming an enemy of God and divine human dignity. Just as sexual act carried out in accord with Christ and with divine human dignity often becomes manifest in the flesh with the birth of a loved Child, so too the sexual act carried out in rejection of Christ and rejection of divine dignity often becomes manifest in the flesh with the abortion of a unwanted Child.\n \n All these human beings the Man with an attraction to another man, the woman with lust for another man other than her husband and the unborn Child all share in the dignity of Christ, just as You and I too share in this divine dignity but not everyone recognises their own dignity or the dignity of others, I recognise my own dignity in Christ and I recognise in others their divine dignity in Christ and I want to help others discover their divine dignity and defend those who for whatever reason are not being granted their divine dignity by others.\n \n \n We were raised to a new life in Christ, he breathed a new life into us \"he breathed on the and said recieve the holy spirit\" he came so we could have life and life abundently, a divine life with him that leads to a culture of life\n \n those who reject it do not have a new life and seek to destroy the life that is in others that leads to a culture of death.\n \n Points of reflection:\n \n Think of a world where all mankind share in the dignity of god and recognise that \n \n Then Think about the consiquences of mankind embracing sin... of mankind without divine dignity\n \n For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. \n \n Satan was a lier and a murderer from the begining\n \n each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desires. 15 Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death. \n \n GOD SENT HIS ONLY SON NOT TO CONDEMN THE WORLD BUT TO SAVE THE WORLD THROUGH HIM",

   "thats because the words are spiritual and metaphorical, I am not using them to be deliberatly obtuse. I am using biblical/spiritual language trying tp put them into a earthly/physical context to help you understand them.\n \n For example.\n \n We were raised to a new life in Christ, he breathed a new life into us \"he breathed on the and said recieve the holy spirit\" he came so we could have life and life abundently, a divine life with him that leads to a culture of life.\n \n This translates as best I can.\n \n Human beings in light of Christian understanding are not insignificant creatures. The christian understanding of Man is that because of Jesus Christ we are all Godlike and each one of us are deserving to the respect that throughout history has been atributed to God...\"We were raised to a new life.\" obviously such revereance for humanity leads to a \"culture of life\" \n \n Of course this is only one side of Christianity that stems from faith in the other side the spiritual the heavenly. we are raised also to a new spiritual eternal life and we have actually recieved the Holy Spirit.\n \n Just as Jesus is both God & Man, So Christianity is both heavenly & Earthly\n \n Just as Jesus was God & man from his conception in Our ladies womb - This duality has also been a facit of Christianity since our very conception.\n \n In fact many of the early converts to Christianity were rebuked by the apostles for ignoring/denying the spiritual aspects of Christianity.\n \n 1 Cor 15\n \n \"How can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised...... If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men. \"\n \n Today the Church is urging the layity on in regards to the earthly side of Christianity because Christianity has over recent year has in part somewhat abandoned that facit of Christianity and our hope in Christ is not just in the next life but is also in this life. We have come full circle from the early christians, the circa 1500AD Idea of \"faith alone\" had to pull away from the earhtly aspect of Christianity... just as God became Man and Christianity is both Heavenly and Earthly so is salvation both Faith in the next life and Good works in this life...

The point is, YOU CANNOT SHOW IT NOR CAN THEY.\n \n The only difference in the two possibilities is that one is \"impersonal\" (the universe) and the other is personal (God).\n\n \n There are many more differences. One exists within reality, one exists within imagination as a necessity. No matter how much people know about reality, \"God\" is purported to be just outside of the limit of knowledge. How people believe they can know what by definition they can't know is irrational.\n \n \n \n \n \n Some have a preference of one over the other. It is interesting to note, psychologically speaking, that those who choose the impersonal one typically are very controlling and unwilling to submit to the authority of others. They tend to own their own business because \"I can never work for anyone but myself\" and other such things. \n\n \n It's interesting to note that those who believe in fantasy find it easy to believe blind assertions. Maybe it's the fact that they need no evidence or proof at all to believe what they want. Maybe this makes it easy for them to come up with generalizations that also aren't based on evidence or proof.\n \n \n\n The personal God makes people responsible for things. An impersonal universe allows for such things as \"relative ethics\" or \"situational ethics\". Meaning that it is okay to steal if you really need something etc. A personal God means that there is a \"relationship\" that must be dealt with instead of something cold and impersonal where \"no harm\" comes. \"Impersonalism\" as a world view leads to such things as \"I can do whatever I want as long as it does not hurt anyone else\" or \"I can do whatever I want as long as I don't get caught.\" \n\n \n The personal \"god\" doesn't make people responsible because the personal god doesn't do anything. Everything you attributed to an \"impersonal universe\" (as if there is another kind) can be said about religion or superstition. Religious leaders molest, steal, and murder because their god makes it okay. This doesn't apply to all religions, of course. However, in the Bible, you could find guidelines of what to do with child female captives, a passage about Jesus stealing animals, and how murder is promoted so frequently within a religion of love. (Often murder is the punishment for other crimes, such as for a virgin who was raped but didn't cry out or tell anyone about it.)\n \n \n \n\n The problem with both of those is that people ALWAYS live in relationship with others. (Unless you have hidden in a cave all your life and even then your family might have something to say about that.) There is no such thing as a victimless crime. Just doing pot for example. Many think this is victimless, but if you look at the toll on the family and the cost to local health officials, one can find the harm it does to others.\n\n \n \n What is wrong with doing anything you want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone? This doesn't address that. What this does is assert that it's impossible to do anything you want without hurting someone else. All one has to do is propose a situation in which no one else is affected. (What if there is no family, what if the person's health remains intact or the person is wealthy enough to cover all costs?)\n So what is wrong with a person deciding to do something *you* don't agree with, if it affects no one else? I doubt you can answer the question. I presume that you will state that no one on the planet can do something without affecting another person. \n Believing in things without any basis in reality has made it hard for you to separate fantasy from the real world. There may be nothing inherently wrong with some things, but in your imagination there is--so you believe there is in reality as well. Maybe you can't see how this makes it hard to have a rational discussion. Unavoidably, there will be things about reality that you either ignore or imagine; either way, it will be true to you.\n BTW, doing pot isn't a crime in certain places. If it is, it's because of the local government, not because of a personal god.\n \n \n I am not anti-religion, even though believing in the supernatural isn't rational. However, I agree that some people (seemingly like you) need to believe in a personal god to make them behave morally. Some people cannot be trusted to behave as decent human beings if they don't have a fear of something infinitely powerful, a boogie man \"that must be dealt with.\" I know that some people function better with their delusions than without (and some cannot function even poorly). I do not feel these people need to think rationally -- vs irrationally--as long as they aren't hurting anyone else by doing so. (oh no! impersonalism!)",

I merely point out that saying the universe was self existent has as much support in the equations as God is self existent. Especially given that human beings no so incredibly little about either at the beginning of the universe. My point is that there is evidence that the universe did not exist at one time. Something must have caused its existence. Or it came from nothing. No one is actually arguing that something came from nothing.

Their whole universe of observation extends exclusively over the surface of the sphere. Are these beings able to regard the geometry of their universe as being plane geometry and their rods withal as the realisation of \"distance\"? They cannot do this. For if they attempt to realise a straight line, they will obtain a curve, which we \"three-dimensional beings\" designate as a great circle, i.e. a self-contained line of definite finite length, which can be measured up by means of a measuring-rod. Similarly, this universe has a finite area, that can be compared with the area of asquare constructed with rods. The great charm resulting from this consideration lies in the recognition of the fact that the universe of these beings is finite and yet has no limits.\n",

It sound like your just getting condescending now. \n\n You seem to have detected a patronizing tone where none was intended. \n \nAnyway, you still haven't answered the question. \n IF you are going to go with those three assumptions, why does a creator get to be excused from having its own prior cause? Who says there must be a first one?\n\n I gave my answer: I said that unless a Creator is the self-existent Final Cause, we are left with an infinite series of prior causes. \n \nFirst, Einstein's explanation of the \"religious inclination\" explains merely that: why we create religion.\n\n Einstein wasn't giving an explanation of religious inclination per se, he was answering a question about why he had settled into a deism based on what he called the \"spirit manifest in the laws of the universe\" and a sincere belief in a \"God who reveals Himself in the harmony of all that exists.\" \n \nWe seem to agree that some things are not yet explainable.

My point is this is tantamount to believing in something because it's nice to believe it. It makes us feel better.

Einstein and I (see earlier link http://www.bartleby.com/173/31.html) were referring to a different kind of boundary:\n\n \n The problem with this that you did not read far enough:\n \n \n Perhaps the reader will wonder why we have placed our \"beings\" on a sphere rather than on another closed surface. But this choice has its justification in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, the sphere is unique in possessing the property that all points on it are equivalent. I admit that the ratio of the circumference c of a circle to its radius r depends on r, but for a given value of r it is the same for all points of the \"world-sphere\"; in other words, the \"world-sphere\" is a \"surface of constant curvature.\" 6 \n To this two-dimensional sphere-universe there is a three-dimensional analogy, namely, the three-dimensional spherical space which was discovered by Riemann. Its points are likewise all equivalent. It possesses a finite volume, which is determined by its \"radius\" (22R3). Is it possible to imagine a spherical space? To imagine a space means nothing else than that we imagine an epitome of our \"space\" experience, i.e. of experience that we can have in the movement of \"rigid\" bodies. In this sense we can imagine a spherical space. \n \n \n \n Currently the data are endicating something similar to a sphere but not really a sphere (in one possibility) and also a horned representation. (See the PDS discussions available on the web). Einstein wrote general relativity in 1920 I believe. His specific spherical argument is not to show the infinite possibilities of a sphere but rather to show that the universe has the possibility of being finite and bounded or infinite and unbounded as stated by Hawkings in Brief History of Time. I think I already alluded to this.\n \n What you call a misrepresentation was not a misrepresentation. It was a mistake. I fully intended to say what you said. I made an error, so sue me. Why is it so incredibly important for you to hound the idea?\n \n Einstein uses a sphere and makes an assumption from the two dimensional to a three dimensional.

X,y, and z represent the axes of cartesian coordinate space. I could post equations that are in polar coordinates or in cylindrical coordinates but then one starts using greek letters and those are just a pain to me to post.\n \n a,b,c represent variable that further define the specific location of the center of the sphere in cartesian coordinate space. Other common representations are h,j, and k. the capital A,B, and C are non zero numbers and are all equal. One could leave them out (it is a generic form used for any conic section in analytic geometry) and simply wrap them into r (and in fact, I probably should have done that to be more precise). r is indeed the radius of the sphere. \n \n These are not equations for surface area or volume as we were discussing boundaries not area. Area is also finite. boundaries clearly exist for the sphere.\n \n However, the issue of spherical space does not describe a sphere as one would normaly think of it. It describes \"spherical\" meaning like a sphere but there are some oddities inlcuding lensing effects and tunnels and tails. In particular in Einstein's equations there is the possibility of a horned space which Einstein did not specify in his general theory article but was later clarified by another physicist whose name escapes me at the moment.
