   "I read the entire article you posted, SparkleSocks.\n \n I felt that some aspects of the article were convincing- such as the claim that the testimony of the child in question was given under the influence of a powerful narcotic. \n \n Hwever, other aspects of the article are less convincing. Why spend all that space vilifying the lawyer and accuser? That smacks of ad hominem. I don't car what the guy did in college, the question is, are the allegations of molestation true or false?\n \n Further, the quotes from Ralph Underwager are less than convincing. He is protrayed as a \"psychologist\" and \"expert\" in the field of child abuse. Nothing could be further from the truth. He is actually an outspoken supporter of pedophilia and pedophiles. He worked with the so-called \"False Memory Foundation\", an organization of adults accused of child molestation- regardless of the basis for the accusation. His 48% unfounded statistic is misleading- child sexual assault, like adult sexual assault, is hard to prove in court. Therefore the 48% statistic represents those cases where there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute- not where the accusation is untrue. \n \n \nPaedophiles can boldly and courageously affirm what they choose. They can say that what they want is to find the best way to love. . . . Paedophiles can make the assertion that the pursuit of intimacy and love is what they choose. With boldness they can say, \"I believe this is in fact part of God's will.\n --Dr. Ralph Underwager in this interview with Paidika, \n a European pro-pedophile publication\n \n I think that if people want to make the case that Jackson is innocent, they'd be better off not using someone like Underwager for support.",

   "Was Wacko Jacko framed? It is hard to be \"framed\" for something when you go onto national television and yourself cast a shadow over yourself by saying that you share your bed with children, especially after paying a 20M dollar settlement to the other child who accused you ten years ago. Regardless of the outcome of his case, I am glad that his behavior was brought to public scrutiny, and perhaps if any misconduct was occuring, it is stopped...for now.",

   "Pedophiles create an atmosphere that entices children. Michael Jackson has certainly done that in his Neverland. He doesn't seem to have so called \"normal\" relationships with women. I don't think he was framed and someday he won't be able to buy himself out of his escapades.",
