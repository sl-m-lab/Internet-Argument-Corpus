   "Evidence from healthcare in other countries suggests that if the US spent as much as it currently does but publicly rather than privately, you'd probably get better care at the same cost. The US spends 13.5% of GDP (last I checked, it may be higher now the way premiums have been going) on healthcare. The UK spends barely half that and achieves a universal system which results in comparable outcomes, if a little slower for non-urgent cases. Cuba spends $500 per person and still gets similar life expectancy and infant mortality.\n \n Generally I'd prefer to wait a few weeks for a hernia operation than pay the thousands of pounds it would cost to have it done privately. And all but the super-rich in this country make the same choice.\n \n Edit: just checked some figures, as of 2004 the US was on 15.3%, the UK last year was on around 9%, Canada was on around 10% in 2004\n http://www.civitas.org.uk/nhs/download/NHSfinances.pdf\n So what has been missing from a lot of the debates on healthcare is the fact that the US spends vastly more (probably twice as much per capita once GDPppp is taken into account) than other developed countries, so any areas where the US currently offer faster treatment are likely a result of throwing more money at it, not any great efficiencies of the private system (the admin costs of the US HMOs would seem to bear that out).",
