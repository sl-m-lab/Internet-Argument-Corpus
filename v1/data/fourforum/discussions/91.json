   "Actually, I think the tax cut is being repealed as part of Bush's tax cut plan that was expedited by his economic stimulus plan. Of course, its a good idea. \n \n Interestingly enough this topic ties into the progressive income tax topic, as it also falls under that category. It is also interesting to note that Marx also called for the abolition of all right of inheritance. Why have these progressive income taxes gone under the radar for so long? The answer lies in the fact that the United States took a turn to the left during the Great Depression. If it weren't for rapid industrialization generated by the war effort, Roosevelt's policies surely would have damned this nation. Since, our economy is so strong it is taking more time to strangulate it than it took for the socialists of Mexico to suffocate theirs. Give it time, and you will find that socialistic policies are bad for economies. Keep asking for more socialism and you will effectively destroy America's edge. In the wake of Enron, Tyco, and Worldcom people have been demanding more government regulation in the markets. They have been calling for government safety nets. I fear these scandals coupled with a waek economy will drive the population to the left economically, and deliver the death blow to what was once an economic powerhouse. Just ask California, governor Gray Davis has helped decimate the economy of a state that would be the 6th largest in the world if it were to stand on its own. Moving to the left economically is always a poor idea, as history has proved assertion time and time again. Stealing inheritance is rooted in Marxism which is as far left as one can get. Therefore, the answer to the question is quite obvious.",

Even if that's not the case, what's your point? \n \n I think you've got the underlined sentece all wrong, the state welfare program does indeed punish people for being successful. Once you reach a certain level of success, you must pay for those on welfare who have not reached that level. Abolishing welfare programs would reward those who are successful by no longer requiring them to pay for those that aren't successful.\n \n One of, if not THE main reason people work hard is to make a better life for their children. My wife's parents came here as a young adults from Italy. They both worked incredibly hard, establishing roots and building their fortune (you can hardly call it that) so that they could put their kids through school and pass on enough wealth to them that they wouldn't have to face the same hardships.

Are Bill Gate's children going to be aristocratic? \n \n So then, did Bill gates get off his arse and make himself and his family part of the aristocracy?\n \n How many people has Bill Gates created jobs for?

I think you see someone who's dad has more money than your dad and you're jealous.

Businesses can only form in groups with one of these individuals present, and these individuals usually become the executives of the business.\n\n \n Is wealth really concentrated in the hands of the few?\n \n First off, define wealth. Are we talking salary, net assets, your family's net assets? What's the mark that makes you wealthy, 1 million, 10 million, 100 million, do you have to be a billionaire?\n \n I think you're a little misguided as to how businesses form and as to how executives become executives. That's one of the reasons I asked the question a few posts back that you've avoided. \n \n VERY FEW people are born into executive positions, and countless businesses that generate wealth are started by people who didn't have a silver spoon in their mouths. I don't see the Rockefellers and Rothschilds as the model for modern American business. Very little in corporate America resembles the days of the robber barons. The economy has become international, and very few business are privately owned. \n \n You become an executive by first obtaining the education required. Ivy League helps, but it isn't required. EVERYONE can accomplish this step if they have the drive and mental ability. The next step is showing enough business sense and intelligence to work your way to the top. Again, you don't need to be rich to advance at this point. You do need the innate ability, a proper education, a work ethic, and social skills.\n \n You want proof? Come to Calgary, I'll introduce you to 10's, if not 100's of people from largely poor agricultural backgrounds that are now millionaires/multi-millionaires and executives.\n \n Furthermore, as Whistler has stated, not everyone can be the CEO, simply put, not everyone is capable, nor does everyone have the desire. \n \n \nIn the equal-starting-capital system, a group of people wanting to start a business will likely have relatively equal wealth (the younger they are, the more this is true.)

To suggest that it could happen on the scale of say, 100 or 1000 employees investing tremendous capital to \"buy a factory\" for all of them to work in is a little far fetched IMHO.\n \n I also don't like the idea of everyone having to join a union or group in order to succeed. I realize that no one has to technically, but it would seem to me that your system would seriously hamstring the individual in favour of the group. I don't like group mentalities.\n \n \nDoes this make sense?\n\n \n Philosophically *maybe*, practically, not a chance IMHO.\n \n I was hoping for a more detailed explanation when I asked for an example using a particular industry, we've pretty much been through the vagaries of your plan.\n \n Waxy",
