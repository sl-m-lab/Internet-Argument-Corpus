   "More reason why the US should NOT follow Canada's lead in SSM . . .\n \n \"Canada has \"hate\" speech/crimes laws and regulations and Canadian Christians, along with other people of faith, are being vehemently persecuted for speaking out publicly against the acceptance and promotion of homosexuality within their own country. I was told by Rev. Tristan NOT to bring most of our resources on homosexuality, for going through the Canadian border, they might get seized and I could possibly be denied entry into Canada. I was able to bring several hundred of SBM's tracts for the attendees, \"I Was Gay\" and \"The Traditional American Family.\" \n \n Although Chris Kempling was unable to speak freely, I told him, \"Brother, I will be your voice tonight.\" I spoke for nearly an hour - openly and freely as an American. I shared my personal story, the truth about homosexuality, the difference between individuals struggling with homosexuality and the militant, intolerant homosexual activist movement. I also shared the logical consequences of legalized homosexual \"marriage\" on society - and eventually, on our children. \"I will not be silenced by any individual or government from speaking the truth. The truth is NOT hate speech. Let them come in here now and arrest me. \n \n At the end of my speech, I held in one hand a coffee creamer from our dinner table. I read the simple wording on the label to the attentive audience: \"100% REAL CREAM - ALL NATURAL.\" That is all the label said. In my other hand, I held another coffee creamer. Yet this one was very different. It was a sealed paper packet that had a drawing of a farm, sitting on rolling hills. The sun was setting in the background, the picture very beautiful and peaceful. I read the label to the audience: \"Wholesome Farms - NON-DAIRY CREAMER. Ingredients: Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean and/or Canola Oils, Sodium Caseinate (A Milk Derivative), Dipotassium Phosphate, Mono and Diglyceerides, Artificial Colors, Silicon Dioxide, Lechtin, Artificial Flavors.\" You see, one coffee creamer was \"REAL\" - and the other was \"ARTIFICIAL.\" I said, \"As a former homosexual, I stand here before you today and say to you first hand, THIS is the difference between the God ordained institution of marriage between one man and one woman - and so-called homosexual \"marriage.\" \n \n As I left the stage to a standing ovation and cheering (I truly say that with humility,) I was told by a Canadian man, \"I can't even begin to tell you how you've impacted this audience tonight. Canadians are extremely reserved - and what you are seeing right now rarely happens here. You don't know what this means.\" \n \n http://www.taxtyranny.ca/images/HTML/GayWatch/GayWatch33.html",

God doesn't recognize these so called \"gay\" marriages. They are an abomination to Him and a putrid stench in His nostrils.

   "Matthew S, I disagree that those who speak against gay rights should be put in jail. It is true that their words are causing harm to many, but they are only harmful because we live in a democracy, where people's opinions affect other people's rights. They are harmful because of the system of government we have chosen to live by. And in choosing a representative democracy, we must grant the majority its power, or the reason we chose a representative democracy in the first place is no more.\n \n This means that we cannot lock people up for speaking their opinion of what our laws should be. If we do that, then it will have been government officials that have removed the power of the people, and the balance between those powers will be no more. This will lead to government tyranny.\n \n It is true that in the case of same-sex marriage, the people you would lock up are wrong, and they are causing harm. But on another issue, that might not be the case. If the government locks people up for speaking their opinion, then social change, progress in civil rights, will be impossible. Those people who oppose gay rights should not stop speaking against them because our government forces them to, they should stop because they are causing harm and it is morally evil to continue.\n \n Jyoshu, I disagree that Matthew has \"been listening to too much propaganda from gay lobby groups\", for those groups would agree with me on this in virtually every case. Instead, I believe that he is unhappy that so many are being hurt by our laws denying gay rights, and he wants to see those who caused that harm see justice. This is a noble reason, but it's effects would harm more people than it would help.",

We hear the fundamentalists the loudest, and it is their message that is mistakenly applied to the rest of the people, and that translates into mistrust and intolerance of what is perceived to be an intolerant institution.\n\n \n Well, I don't think religion is really in much danger. One only needs to look at the multitudes that came to Rome when the new Pope was selected to realize that most people in the world are religious, and a great many of them are Christian. The reason, IMO, that religion is not taken as seriously in north america as it once was is due to secularism and the modern lifestyle (which is quite fast-paced). I don't think it has much to do with the fact that these religions have fundamentalist sects. And the reality is, compared to some places in Europe, north America is still a lot more religious in general (which I think is a good thing). And even more religious is Latin American, where Catholicism and protestantism is exploding and florishing. \n \n At the same time, that doesn't excuse Canada's culture for being intolerant of religion. It just so happens that in Canada right now, the PC thing to do is to support gay rights and not support religion. \n \n I also think it is important to point out that in our time, Christian fundamentalism is really quite benign in comparison to other fundamentalist groups in other religions, esp. Islam. Christianity does not have suicide bombers or jihads. They do have indignation over moral issues in our society and a few isolated people can sometimes take that too far, but that's much different than a jihad where many people take up assualt rifles and try to wage war, or blow themselves up in crowded places. IMO Christian fundamentalism doesn't really belong in the same context as Islamic fundamentalism. They happen to share the same word (\"fundamentalist\"), but this is a case where our language's limitations shows up by not demonstrating the nuances and differences. I think some people look at Islamic fundamentalists (or at least the media's portrayal of them) and automatically think \"oh, violence is associated with fundamentalism no matter what it's flavor, or any strong religious belief in something.\" But Christian fundamentalism for the most part proves this wrong, as most Christian fundamentalists are not violent at all.",
