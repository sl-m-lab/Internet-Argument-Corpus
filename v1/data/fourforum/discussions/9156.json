   "I'm not selling for Garmin, but the StreetPilot is one of the handiest devices I have seen in a long time. I recently purchased one and took off on a 1200 mile trip from Atlanta to Boston. That little dude told me (in a sexy female way) every turn and \"bare-off\" to take from door to door. Just key in the desired street address and follow the purple line. The map detail is amazing compared to what I had in the Lowrance and it will show the map flat or in 3D.\n \n ...well worth the six C notes I paid for it.\n \n Incidently, for the first and last time in my 50 or so years of driving, I drove 1200 miles in 24 hours...non-stop, except for a 10 minute \"eye resting\" at a Pennsylvania Rest Stop.",

   "Doesn't anyone know how to read a map anymore?\nSure! it's just easier and more convenient to have the upcoming turn instructions read to you as the map orients itself (in 3-D) track-up right before your very eyes and shows you exactly where you are at all times. It beats stopping to read a map, eliminates wondering how far it is to the next turn...and you can't get a map to calculate the shortest or the fastest route to an address.",
