The question is, how could he do it?\n \n He could do it because &#8211; as it now appears &#8211; he was a licensed firearm owner; he kept his weapons and ammunition at home legally. Cumbria police were quiet about the firearms for a while &#8211; no doubt while they trawled their firearms-ownership database. Now they have acknowledged Bird was a gun owner. The issues then become fairly simple, the incident utterly preventable. If firearm owners were not permitted to store guns and ammunition at home, the incident could not have happened.\n \n After Dunblane, Lord Cullen's report recommended that guns should not be kept at home (the shooting lobby fought that recommendation tooth and nail, claiming it would destroy the sport). In the event, a massive wave of public outrage saw handguns banned entirely. My argument now is that we could go back to the Cullen recommendation &#8211; we could even allow the guns at home (although that is where they are most at risk; that is where they are most misused; that is where they are easiest to steal).\n\n \n You already have ==<  The &#8220;Unregulated&#8221; Gun  \n &#8220;Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate guns&#8212;more than 88,000 words.

Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n But you Anti-gun NUTS will never be satisfied until you destroy our Bill of Rights.

Ignorance and misapplication of the Bill of Rights literally are slaughtering Americans every single day. Guns in 1776 were not the rapid fire killing machines of 2011.\n\n Really? Criminals commit crime, not the law-abiding gun owners. All we are doing is protecting ourselves from the vicious predatory scum that you would have us cower down to. \n \n The police can't be everywhere, and they are surly not charged to protect every citizen, just the community at large. Only a fool believes that even if you ban all guns from this continent, that the Criminal Drug Dealers won't import the other criminals guns in with their drugs. You know, just another illegal product.\n \n Besides, who commits crime and murder? Is it the average citizen as Peter V, Brady and their Ilk want you to believe? \n \n Gun Violence and Constitutional Issues \n The FBI statistics reveal that 75 percent of all violent crimes for any locality are committed by six percent of hardened criminals and repeat offenders.18 Violent crimes continue to be a problem in the inner cities with gangs involved in the drug trade.\n\n \n  Study done by the University of Tennessee Med school \nLooking only to official criminal records, data over the past thirty years consistently show that the mythology of murderers as ordinary citizens does not hold true. Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records, and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests. These studies also found that when the murder occurred [a]bout 11% of murder arrestees [were] actually on pre-trial release--that is, they were awaiting trial for another offense. \n \n The fact that only 75% of murderers have adult crime records should not be misunderstood as implying that the remaining 25% of murderers are non-criminals. The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n \n   Violence in America - Effective Solutions \n more than two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are involved with drug trafficking or have evidence of ante-mortem illicit drug use.\n \n Not only do the data show that acquaintance and domestic homicide are a minority of homicides,[26] but the FBI's definition of acquaintance and domestic homicide requires only that the murderer knew or was related to the decedent. That dueling drug dealers are acquainted does not make them \"friends.\" Over three-quarters of murderers have long histories of violence against not only their enemies and other \"acquaintances,\" but also against their relatives.\n \n The gun control advocacy literature from the \"medical community\" shows that fully two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are, in fact, drug dealers and their customers who wreak tremendous human and economic havoc upon society. In failing to account for this, the medical literature cannot and does not honestly assess these deaths.&#8221; \n\n \n   FBI: Burgeoning gangs behind up to 80% of U.S. crime ",

   "PeterV this is my first meeting with you to the best of my knowledge. I've looked over your previous posts for research purposes and in the majority of them you seem to take the position of \"more powerful\" for the reasoning of your arguments. In fact \"more powerful\" seems to be the cornerstone of your entire posting strategy here. You claim modern guns are \"more powerful\" than the guns of out ancestors during colonial days and use that as reason for why they should be more strictly regulated, but you always seem to leave it at that and never elaborate properly.\n \n I'm going to have fun dissecting your post and tearing about your basis of argument.\n \n \nI think the Founding Fathers would be editing the Second Amendment the minute we dug them up if they could see what the moronic gun lobby has made of it. The NRA is truly evil. Ignorance and misapplication of the Bill of Rights literally are slaughtering Americans every single day. Guns in 1776 were not the rapid fire killing machines of 2011.\n\n \n As I've said before I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a scholar trained in the matter of constitutional interpretation. I'm not a historian and can say with any degree of certainty what might or might not have happened under specific circumstances. My interpretation is no more valid than that of anyone else around today to argue any point that comes about.\n \n However I do believe that it's a matter of absurdity to claim that if the Founding Fathers could see what's become of their country today that they would actually rewrite the Bill of Rights in a manner that would recognize less legal rights than they attempted to take note of back during the ratification period. For such a claim to be true they would have to look at the actions of the federal government and actually state that they see nothing objectionable taking place, meaning they would actually give a thumbs up to the existence of Guantanamo Bay, the Patriot Act, the Gun Control Act of 1968 and countless other laws that have been enacted within the last 50+ years.\n \n You claim that the NRA is truly evil. Where exactly is your proof of this erroneous position? Where exactly is the NRA filing a brief in favor of Jared Loughner as he stands trial for murdering six people in Arizona on January 8th? Have they contributed any money to his defense fund or hired a top dollar attorney to aid in his defense? Where exactly are they saying that the number of shooting deaths in the country are just too bad and the people should just suck it up and get over it? Where exactly have they proclaimed that there is a right to murder others?\n \n If you're going to make foolish claims then you should be prepared to provide evidence to support them instead of just running away like you committed a hit and run assault on a pedestrian.\n \n Misapplication of the Bill of Rights? And how exactly do you defend that nonsense. Those with felony convictions have no Second Amendment rights and can't legally be armed. The same goes for the mentally ill and illegal aliens. By law none of these people have any recognized right to be armed for any reason, not even to protect their lives against others that would see them dead. What misapplication of the Bill of Rights do you speak of? \n \n And then we come to the epitome of stupidity for your post. The claim that modern guns deserve no constitutional recognition because they aren't the same as those that existed around 1776. The level of mental deficiency that one would need to be in possession of to even consider this as a possibility boggles the mind. \n \n I may not have a degree in historical analysis or anything else along those lines, but I truly believe it's foolish to claim that the Founding Fathers intended for the constitutional protections enshrined in the Bill of Rights to literally be frozen in time and suddenly become null and void once technological developments exceeded their degree of comprehension. For that to be true the Fourth Amendment would have to offer absolutely no protection to digital based documents that are intangible and have no physical basis of existence. Of that the First Amendment was never intended for those who choose to practice Buddhism or Shintoism since such religions were unknown of at the time.\n \n I see absolutely no reason to believe that the Founding Fathers would object to the citizenry owning the arms of today simply because they're better than what were consider the epitome of technological development back in the 1700s.\n \n The Supreme Court actually covered this fact when they issued their ruling in the Heller case.\n \n Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 849 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 35-36 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.\n \n And then we come to the historical facts regarding the arms that were in existence around the time of the Founding Fathers. It wasn't just muskets like some would want to believe but rather a whole variety of deadly weapons.\n \n Early muskets were developed during the time of armored knights. In fact they were designed in a manner that would enable them to defeat iron and steel armor which brought about the decline of full body armor used by knights. It only stands to reason that the Founding Fathers not only had knowledge of armor penetrating capabilities they actually saw the usefulness in such weaponry. There was a reason for why the Brown Bess was a .75 caliber weapon for the duration of its existence. \n \n Then we come to the existence of the puckle gun, designed back in 1718. Puckle gun - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia It had the ability to fire at a rate of nine rounds a minute; that's three times faster than the average soldier could fire a smoothbore musket. And nine times faster than the average soldier could fire a rifle of the era.\n \n Another example is the nock gun which came about long before the time of drafting or ratification of the constitution. Nock gun - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Seven barrels that were capable of being discharged all at once. Quite a devastating weapon really.\n \n Grenades were also another weapon in existence at the time. Actually the grenades date back to the 10th century or even earlier.\n \n Let us not forget about the existence of cannons during the colonial era. Nobody is going to be able to argue that something capable of hurling 12 pounds of lead in your direction at speeds either approaching or exceeding the speed of sound is less powerful than the modern day weaponry available to the general public.\n \n And then let's look at the small arms of the era. The Brown Bess was the main military weapon of the British empire for a very long time. It fired a chunk of lead that was 3/4\" in size and weighed well over an ounce. Being hit in the limb by something of this magnitude wouldn't just break your support bones it would actually shatter the bone completely, leaving surgeons of the time with little choice but complete amputation of the affected limb, which would likely lead to infection-related death. There are accounts of this occurring during the Civil War with weapons of considerably smaller caliber such as the 1861 Springfield which was .58 caliber.\n \n And let us not forget the Pennsylvania long rifle, a largely American creation during the colonial era. This was actually one of the first widespread rifle designs to be used for war purposes rather than just hunting. In the hands of a trained marksmen it had a range 400 yards of more, which greatly exceeded the 75-100 yard maximum range of the Brown Bess at the time. Red coats would easily be killed long before they were ever able to get into range where they would actually pose a threat. In the Siege of Boonesborough Daniel Boone reportedly killed an enemy soldier at 250 yards with such a rifle with a single shot to the head. Think on that one for a minute and let it sink in.\n \n Now that this little history lesson is concluded please engage your brain to think before you engage your mouth to speak the next time you feel like making a post and resorting to your discredited \"more powerful\" argument again.",

   "Galileo I've read a great deal of your posts in my reconnaissance gathering here. Of those I've read you've made some wild and insane claims before and I admit there were times when I thought I had seen the epitome of your foolishness. But today I read this post you made and I feel like you've just raised the bar on that standard and blown all of your other foolish claims out of the water.\n \n \nIt sounds like their AK-47s are of limited usefulness:\n\n \n Limited usefulness you say? This is highly contradictory with previous statements you've made over the years. Let's have a little refresher course.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/351637-post13.html\n \n \n\"Until recently drug traffickers' 'weapon of choice' had been .38 caliber handguns. However, they now have developed a preference for more powerful weapons, such as the .233 semi-automatic rifle, the AK-47 variant rifle, 5.57 caliber pistols, and .50 caliber rifles\n\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/359726-post12.html\n \n \nModern day military forces own much more powerful weapons compared to the average gun owner.\n\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/353596-post1.html\n \n \n\"Koper and Roth report very modest effects on homicide from the ban; their best estimate is a statistically insignificant 6.7 percent decline in the year immediately following the ban. Gary Kleck argues that even this figure is an overestimate and that the assault weapons ban could have at most led to a reduction of two homicides annually.\"\n Evaluating Gun Policy, page 141\n \n So it likely didn't have much of an effect on crime overall. However, it could have saved a few lives so some people might reasonably claim that it was worth it. Think of Poplawski gunning down three police officers with an AK-47. Would you have supported the ban if you had known it could have saved the lives of three police officers? Or would you rather have let these officers die? How did Poplawski gun down three armed police officers so easily with a weapon that according to the gun lobby only differed from other firearms in its scary looks? Could it be that the gun lobby has been misleading people about the powerfulness of these weapons? Even a semiautomatic version of an assault rifle can be fired at an amazingly rapid rate. I have seen a few of these semiautomatic weapons being fired in online videos. I saw one video on youtube. The gun in the video was fired so rapidly that I would have mistaken the weapon for a machine gun if I had not been informed before that the weapon was semiautomatic. \n \n \"Even semiautomatic assault weapons can be fired with extraordinary speed. When San Jose, California, police test-fired an Uzi, a 30-round magazine was emptied in slightly less than two seconds on full automatic, while the same magazine was emptied in just five seconds on semiautomatic.\"\n Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/258331-post9.html\n \n [Galileo;258331]Yes, the flow of illegal guns may go both ways. But the article says that 90% of illegal guns seized by Mexican authorities come from the US. And these assault weapons are easily converted into machine gunsemoticon_xkill . Gadgets that accomplish such a purpose are sold at gun shows. From the previously quoted article:\n \n \"When asked if he had any of the deadlier automatics, he led a reporter to a nearby table. \n \n \"There, James Ramey of Little Rock, Ark., was selling Hellfire and Autoburst trigger activation devices, $30 gadgets that turn any assault rifle into a rat-a-tatting machine gun.\" \n \n I think much of the problem could be solved by extending the Brady background check to all gun sales. It doesn't make sense not to. It's kind of like the law requiring people to get a doctor's prescription to purchase certain kinds of drugs but then having a \"drug show\" where people can purchase any kind of prescription drug without a doctor's prescription.\n\n \n So when it comes to possession by Mexico's drug cartels and street criminals, and their use against the police and honest citizens you portray AK-47s and other \"assault weapons\" as ludicrously powerful and too extreme to be allowed for legal ownership. But when it comes to their use against the military of a foreign nation these deadly weapons are somehow considered insufficient and regarded in the same light as BB guns. That's quite contradictory of you Galileo. How exactly do you sell those two points? How do you justify switching between one standard and the other at the drop of a hat when it fits your argument of choice?\n \n You can't claim that something like the AK-47 is of limited usefulness if it's supposedly a highly dangerous and deadly weapon in other areas of debate.\n \n Limited usefulness. I call bull on that claim. Are you even aware of how prolific the AK-47 platform is? How many countries are officially licensed to produce variants of it? How many others are engaged in the illicit manufacture? Official armies and guerrilla forces all around the world have adopted the AK-47 as their weapon of choice.

It's service life sure doesn't seem to suggest there's anything inadequate about it.\n \n \n\"Kala(voice-over): Professional soldiers are struggling to teach them the basics. Now there are retired people with experience who are beginning to lead these guys, to organize them, says Captain Mohammed (ph), formerly in the Libyan Special Forces, because it's impossible to attack artillery with a Kalashnikov.\n \n \"It's a lesson these men, young and not so young, are learning the hard way.\"\n RealClearPolitics - Politics - Mar 07, 2011 - Battle for Control in Libya; 'Freedom Project'; U.S.-Korean Military\n\n \n Except AK-47s work great against individual soldiers and squads who are outside of their vehicles.

Some think Obama should help by supplying the rebels with arms.\n\n \n What arms should America be supplying the Libyan rebels if the AK-47 is supposedly insufficient for fighting Gaddafi's soldiers? What should we send them, M16s, M4s? M134 miniguns? M72 LAWs? AT4s? Satchel charges? Thermite grenades? Barrett rifles? What can we ship them that they don't already have.

I don't think most citizens would be able to afford such weaponry.\n\n \n Then why are you opposed to reintroduction of machine guns for civilian ownership if you don't think it would make any difference?

We just need to know how to disable the tanks and their crews. And considering how many vehicles have fallen victim to roadside bombings in downtown Baghdad and various other third world countries of Middle Eastern origin I'd say that it wouldn't be hard to pull of something like that. You just need to plan out a big enough boom to shatter the transmission and then that tank will be going nowhere.\n \n The crews are even more vulnerable than the tank itself. No matter how good the tank armoring is there's always going to be open slots for the purpose of ventilation and observation of the surrounding territory. If you take a piece of paper and wrap it around a mix of black powder, rubber bands, shredded ping pong balls and dog hair, light it on fire and shove it through one of these vents then they're in for one of the nastiest surprises ever to be experienced. Besides the intense heat and fire that will be generated the noxious smoke and fumes will likely force an immediate evacuation of the crew, at which point they can be captured or eliminated and the tank can be hijacked for other purposes.\n \n Simply because Gaddafi's forces have tanks doesn't mean they can't be beaten, or that it will take superior weaponry to stop them. Ask any Iraqi war veteran who fell victim to a roadside bombing. Superior intelligence and trickery can do much to defeat superior technology.\n \n \nI think I can serve my country better by promoting gun control.\n\n \n First you suggest that American gun owners should be deported to Libya in a manner befitting illegal aliens, for the purpose of fighting in a conflict that isn't out war to begin with.\n \n Then when I ask you what you've done for the cause and you claim that you can be of more use at home in America, lobbying for more restrictive gun control laws and infringements on the Constitution that soldiers fight to defend.\n \n If anyone should face deportation to foreign nations then it should really be people like you Galileo. Those who would lobby congress to infringe the Constitution should have to earn your citizenship back by contributing productively in causes such as this. Show that you deserve American citizenship. Thousands of immigrants have to show why they're the best candidates for citizenship status, maybe we should apply the same standards to dissidents like you.

He can't lobby congress nor anything else, all he can do is promote anti constitutional propaganda with his handlers. I doubt he can button his own shirt nor zip his own pants while we in Texas can button Levi jeans. He is about the same level as raulito and probably share the same experiences in a basement :) If it came to being sharp, I would bet on the turkey every time, the wild variety of course. Every post he makes here is from talking points you can get from modifying the url and get the membership and time worn goals and instructions to people like him who has no original ideas.\n \n Now that their plans have fallen into disgrace and unpopularity with the courts and executive branch who doesn't want to turn into a gadhaffi...yet.. they are in disarray and grasping for any stick to hold onto in the flood of falling gun control agenda and laws. He doesn't have a prayer and knows it but it is about all he is able to do absent getting an honest job :)",

   "  Former sheriff puts the constitution first \n \"Folks, I told you I would give you a solution today to reduce the risk of tyranny,\" Mack said. \"America's liberty and freedom is protected by state sovereignty. That is the solution. It is behind us. It is our constitution, our Bill of Rights. The solution is here once the local and state governments have enough guts to put the constitution first.\"\n \n \"We the people and the states have the authority and responsibility to tell them (federal government) what to do or, if they have gone too far, it is our responsibility to stop them -- put the stop light on it,\" Mack said. \"I believe with all my heart we are supposed to uphold and preserve the U.S. Constitution.\"\n \n I decided I was a liar and a hypocrite as a police officer, and that I was going to keep the constitution with me and I would read that constitution,\" Mack said. \"I had sworn to uphold and defend the (U.S.) constitution in an oath I had taken. I have a moral responsibility to keep my dedication to the United States. But I have to oppose any law that is against the constitution. The spirit of freedom equals the spirit of God; they are one and the same. The U.S. Constitution guarantees our God-given right to live free.\"\n \n Clapping and verbal praise periodically broke into Mack's presentation, as those attending listened to his plea for state's rights, people's rights to freedom and to live without interference. \n\n The above reminds me of this.\n \nThe constitution was written to limit the power of gov't and to ensure all rights to the people. Government does not possess 'rights' but 'enumerated powers' and only those enumerated. The theory that gov't possess 'rights' and then can curtail or ration those rights to the people as they deem necessary for their own security is ludicrous to say the least! Indeed, it is the citizen's duty to aid the police and not the other way around. Each citizen is charged with the \"preservation\" of the Constitution and individual police power to promote and defend the Constitution, himself, and the legitimate powers of the State. \n\n \n Now, who can argue with that!",
