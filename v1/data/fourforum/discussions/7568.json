   "Ok everyone. I live in California. We subjects here in California have to follow certain rules given to us by our almighty legislature(exagerating here) about gun control. As you know. AW's (so called \"assault weapons\") are regulated heavily here. Recently, thanks to a court ruling (Harrot Vs County of Kings, we lowley subjects in Cali were able to purchase certain receivers( the part of the gun that is considered a \"firearm\") that would other wise be illegal (like ak-47 or ar-15) to buy. Oh I forgot to mention, the doj (department of justice) TOLD us it was legal to buy them!!! There is letter being circulated around the net. \n \n Now You are probably wondering how we are being threaten...well the doj is simply trying to make their own laws regarding possession of these receivers..They are so damn left winged on gun control they have threaten us with confiscation, jail time, and the \"58 District Attorneys might charge us\" all for what? For doing something LEGALLY! The DOJ is currently run by a very anti-gun democrat (Bill Lockyer) and his \"assistants\" of same thought. They have gone so far as to confiscate legally held firearms, just because of minor infraction. They have threaten sellers with the \"58 DA's\" thing and have made life for certain FFL's (Federal Firearms Licensees) a living hell. They have no consideration of the current law and you bet your sweet cheeks that they will be taken to court on all these things. Some people do their jobs...but the doj enjoys it so much they make their own laws..(I will explain this later)\n \n Just recently they posted a memo on their web page on their intent...\n \n http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/forms/pdf/ar15notice.pdf\n \n What they are saying is we can't put the \"evil features\" on our legally bought rifles once registered?? California law is so clear on this...once an \"assault weapon\" it doesn't matter what we put on it.. whether its a flash hider, folding stock etc...but they think they have the power to manipulate it that way. Not only that..they would invalidate any registration if we put any feature on our firearms!! They have been given no such power by the weak sb23 legislation!!!\n \n My point is...gun control laws are so stupid.. they can easily be circumvented. SB23, our handgun \"safety\" test (by the way only 2 children below 5 die due to handgun accidents even BEFORE these laws came into effect) all so stupid and easily refuted...yet our legislators keep passing more laws for the \"children.\" I'm sick of their pathetic rhetoric and lies they are fed by the VPC and the Brady Campaign! Thanks to all the gerrymandering here, we will never see reasonable legislators. HELL even the .50caliber ban is useless! NOW there is even a rifle being sold to Californians that has a BIGGER bullet (the .510 DTC!) I'm telling you.. California should just sink to the bottom of the ocean...it is just ridiculously stupid here..:xbanghead \n \n Ok rant off.emoticon_xdonno",
