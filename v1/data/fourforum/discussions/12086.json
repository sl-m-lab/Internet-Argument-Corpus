   "Shocked and Horrified\n by Larry Mosqueda\n September 18, 2001\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Like all Americans, on Tuesday, 9-11, I was shocked and horrified to watch the WTC Twin Towers attacked by hijacked planes and collapse, resulting in the deaths of perhaps up to 10,000 innocent people. \n \n I had not been that shocked and horrified since January 16, 1991, when then President Bush attacked Baghdad, and the rest of Iraq and began killing 200,000 people during that \"war\" (slaughter). This includes the infamous \"highway of death\" in the last days of the slaughter when U.S. pilots literally shot in the back retreating Iraqi civilians and soldiers. I continue to be horrified by the sanctions on Iraq, which have resulted in the death of over 1,000,000 Iraqis, including over 500,000 children, about whom former Secretary of State Madeline Allbright has stated that their deaths \"are worth the cost\". \n \n Over the course of my life I have been shocked and horrified by a variety of U.S. governmental actions, such as the U.S. sponsored coup against democracy in Guatemala in 1954 which resulted in the deaths of over 120,000 Guatemalan peasants by U.S. installed dictatorships over the course of four decades. \n \n Last Tuesday's events reminded me of the horror I felt when the U.S. overthrew the governments of the Dominican Republic in 1965 and helped to murder 3,000 people. And it reminded me of the shock I felt in 1973, when the U.S. sponsored a coup in Chile against the democratic government of Salvador Allende and helped to murder another 30,000 people, including U.S. citizens. \n \n Last Tuesday's events reminded me of the shock and horror I felt in 1965 when the U.S. sponsored a coup in Indonesia that resulted in the murder of over 800,000 people, and the subsequent slaughter in 1975 of over 250,000 innocent people in East Timor by the Indonesian regime with the direct complicity of President Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissenger. \n \n I was reminded of the shock and horror I felt during the U.S. sponsored terrorist contra war (the World Court declared the U.S. government a war criminal in 1984 for the mining of the harbors) against Nicaragua in the 1980s which resulted in the deaths of over 30,000 innocent people (or as the U.S. government used to call them before the term \"collateral damage\" was invented--\"soft targets\"). \n \n I was reminded of being horrified by the U. S. war against the people of El Salvador in the 1980s, which resulted in the brutal deaths of over 80,000 people, or \"soft targets\". \n \n I was reminded of the shock and horror I felt during the U.S. sponsored terror war against the peoples of southern Africa (especially Angola) that began in the 1970's and continues to this day and has resulted in the deaths and mutilations of over 1,000,000. I was reminded of the shock and horror I felt as the U.S. invaded Panama over the Christmas season of 1989 and killed over 8,000 in an attempt to capture George H. Bush's CIA partner, now turned enemy, Manual Noriega. \n \n I was reminded of the horror I felt when I learned about how the Shah of Iran was installed in a U.S. sponsored brutal coup that resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 Iranians from 1952-1979. And the continuing shock as I learned that the Ayatollah Khomani, who overthrew the Shah in 1979, and who was the U.S. public enemy for decade of the 1980s, was also on the CIA payroll, while he was in exile in Paris in the 1970s. \n \n I was reminded of the shock and horror that I felt as I learned about the how the U.S. has \"manufactured consent\" since 1948 for its support of Israel, to the exclusion of virtually any rights for the Palestinians in their native lands resulting in ever worsening day-to-day conditions for the people of Palestine. I was shocked as I learned about the hundreds of towns and villages that were literally wiped off the face of the earth in the early days of Israeli colonization. I was horrified in 1982 as the villagers of Sabra and Shatila were massacred by Israeli allies with direct Israeli complicity and direction. The untold thousands who died on that day match the scene of horror that we saw last Tuesday. But those scenes were not repeated over and over again on the national media to inflame the American public. \n \n The events and images of last Tuesday have been appropriately compared to the horrific events and images of Lebanon in the 1980s with resulted in the deaths of tens of thousand of people, with no reference to the fact that the country that inflicted the terror on Lebanon was Israel, with U.S. backing. I still continue to be shocked at how mainstream commentators refer to \"Israeli settlers\" in the \"occupied territories\" with no sense of irony as they report on who are the aggressors in the region. \n \n Of course, the largest and most shocking war crime of the second half of the 20th century was the U.S. assault on Indochina from 1954-1975, especially Vietnam, where over 4,000,000 people were bombed, napalmed, crushed, shot and individually \"hands on\" murdered in the \"Phoenix Program\" (this is where Oliver North got his start). Many U.S. Vietnam veterans were also victimized by this war and had the best of intentions, but the policy makers themselves knew the criminality of their actions and policies as revealed in their own words in \"The Pentagon Papers,\" released by Daniel Ellsberg of the RAND Corporation. In 1974 Ellsberg noted that our Presidents from Truman to Nixon continually lied to the U.S. public about the purpose and conduct of the war. He has stated that, \"It is a tribute to the American people that our leaders perceived that they had to lie to us, it is not a tribute to us that we were so easily misled.\" \n \n I was continually shocked and horrified as the U.S. attacked and bombed with impunity the nation of Libya in the 1980s, including killing the infant daughter of Khadafi. I was shocked as the U.S. bombed and invaded Grenada in 1983. I was horrified by U.S. military and CIA actions in Somalia, Haiti, Afghanistan, Sudan, Brazil, Argentina, and Yugoslavia. The deaths in these actions ran into the hundreds of thousands. \n \n The above list is by no means complete or comprehensive. It is merely a list that is easily accessible and not unknown, especially to the economic and intellectual elites. It has just been conveniently eliminated from the public discourse and public consciousness. And for the most part, the analysis that the U.S. actions have resulted in the deaths of primarily civilians (over 90%) is not unknown to these elites and policy makers. A conservative number for those who have been killed by U.S. terror and military action since World War II is 8,000,000 people. Repeat--8,000,000 people. This does not include the wounded, the imprisoned, the displaced, the refugees, etc. Martin Luther King, Jr. stated in 1967, during the Vietnam War, \"My government is the world's leading purveyor of violence.\" Shocking and horrifying. \n \n Nothing that I have written is meant to disparage or disrespect those who were victims and those who suffered death or the loss of a loved one during this week's events. It is not meant to \"justify\" any action by those who bombed the Twin Towers or the Pentagon. It is meant to put it in a context. If we believe that the actions were those of \"madmen\", they are \"madmen\" who are able to keep a secret for 2 years or more among over 100 people, as they trained to execute a complex plan. While not the acts of madmen, they are apparently the acts of \"fanatics\" who, depending on who they really are, can find real grievances, but whose actions are illegitimate. \n \n Osama Bin Laden at this point has been accused by the media and the government of being the mastermind of Tuesday's bombings. Given the government's track record on lying to the America people, that should not be accepted as fact at this time. If indeed Bin Laden is the mastermind of this action, he is responsible for the deaths of perhaps 10,000 people-a shocking and horrible crime. Ed Herman in his book The Real Terror Network: Terrorism in Fact and Propaganda does not justify any terrorism but points out that states often engage in \"wholesale\" terror, while those whom governments define as \"terrorist\" engage is \"retail\" terrorism. While qualitatively the results are the same for the individual victims of terrorism, there is a clear quantitative difference. And as Herman and others point out, the seeds, the roots, of much of the \"retail\" terror are in fact found in the \"wholesale\" terror of states. Again this is not to justify, in any way, the actions of last Tuesday, but to put them in a context and suggest an explanation. \n \n Perhaps most shocking and horrific, if indeed Bin Laden is the mastermind of Tuesday's actions; he has clearly had significant training in logistics, armaments, and military training, etc. by competent and expert military personnel. And indeed he has. During the 1980s, he was recruited, trained and funded by the CIA in Afghanistan to fight against the Russians. As long as he visited his terror on Russians and his enemies in Afghanistan, he was \"our man\" in that country. \n \n The same is true of Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who was a CIA asset in Iraq during the 1980s. Hussein could gas his own people, repress the population, and invade his neighbor (Iran) as long as he did it with U.S. approval. \n \n The same was true of Manuel Noriega of Panama, who was a contemporary and CIA partner of George H. Bush in the 1980s. Noriega's main crime for Bush, the father, was not that he dealt drugs (he did, but the U.S. and Bush knew this before 1989), but that Noriega was no longer going to cooperate in the ongoing U.S. terrorist contra war against Nicaragua. This information is not unknown or really controversial among elite policy makers. To repeat, this not to justify any of the actions of last Tuesday, but to put it in its horrifying context. \n \n As shocking as the events of last Tuesday were, they are likely to generate even more horrific actions by the U.S. government that will add significantly to the 8,000,000 figure stated above. This response may well be qualitatively and quantitatively worst than the events of Tuesday. The New York Times headline of 9/14/01 states that, \"Bush And Top Aides Proclaim Policy Of Ending States That Back Terror\" as if that was a rationale, measured, or even sane option. States that have been identified for possible elimination are \"a number of Asian and African countries, like Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, and even Pakistan.\" This is beyond shocking and horrific-it is just as potentially suicidal, homicidal, and more insane than the hijackers themselves. \n \n Also, qualitatively, these actions will be even worse than the original bombers if one accepts the mainstream premise that those involved are \"madmen\", \"religious fanatics\", or a \"terrorist group.\" If so, they are acting as either individuals or as a small group. The U.S. actions may continue the homicidal policies of a few thousand elites for the past 50 years, involving both political parties. \n \n The retail terror is that of desperate and sometime fanatical small groups and individuals who often have legitimate grievances, but engage in individual criminal and illegitimate activities; the wholesale terror is that of \"rational\" educated men where the pain, suffering, and deaths of millions of people are contemplated, planned, and too often, executed, for the purpose of furthering a nebulous concept called the \"national interest\". Space does not allow a full explanation of the elites Orwellian concept of the \"national interest\", but it can be summarized as the protection and expansion of hegemony and an imperial empire. \n \n The American public is being prepared for war while being fed a continuous stream of shocking and horrific repeated images of Tuesday's events and heartfelt stories from the survivors and the loved ones of those who lost family members. These stories are real and should not be diminished. In fact, those who lost family members can be considered a representative sample of humanity of the 8,000,000 who have been lost previously. If we multiply by 800-1000 times the amount of pain, angst, and anger being currently felt by the American public, we might begin to understand how much of the rest of the world feels as they are continually victimized. \n \n Some particularly poignant images are the heart wrenching public stories that we are seeing and hearing of family members with pictures and flyers searching for their loved ones. These images are virtually the same as those of the \"Mothers of the Disappeared\" who searched for their (primarily) adult children in places such as Argentina, where over 11,000 were \"disappeared\" in 1976-1982, again with U.S. approval. Just as the mothers of Argentina deserved our respect and compassion, so do the relatives of those who are searching for their relatives now. However we should not allow ourselves to be manipulated by the media and U.S. government into turning real grief and anger into a national policy of wholesale terror and genocide against innocent civilians in Asia and Africa. What we are seeing in military terms is called \"softening the target.\" The target here is the American public and we are being ideologically and emotionally prepared for the slaughter that may commence soon. \n \n None of the previously identified Asian and African countries are democracies, which means that the people of these countries have virtually no impact on developing the policies of their governments, even if we assume that these governments are complicit in Tuesday's actions. When one examines the recent history of these countries, one will find that the American government had direct and indirect influences on creating the conditions for the existence of some of these governments. This is especially true of the Taliban government of Afghanistan itself. \n \n The New York Metropolitan Area has about 21,000,000 people or about 8 % of the U.S. population. Almost everyone in America knows someone who has been killed, injured or traumatized by the events of Tuesday. I know that I do. Many people are calling for \"revenge\" or \"vengeance\" and comments such as \"kill them all\" have been circulated on the TV, radio, and email. A few more potentially benign comments have called for \"justice.\" This is only potentially benign since that term may be defined by people such as Bush and Colin Powell. Powell is an unrepentant participant in the Vietnam War, the terrorist contra war against Nicaragua, and the Gulf war, at each level becoming more responsible for the planning and execution of the policies. \n \n Those affected, all of us, must do everything in our power to prevent a wider war and even greater atrocity, do everything possible to stop the genocide if it starts, and hold those responsible for their potential war crimes during and after the war. If there is a great war in 2001 and it is not catastrophic (a real possibility), the crimes of that war will be revisited upon the U.S. over the next generation. That is not some kind of religious prophecy or threat, it is merely a straightforward political analysis. If indeed it is Bin Laden, the world must not deal only with him as an individual criminal, but eliminate the conditions that create the injustices and war crimes that will inevitably lead to more of these types of attacks in the future. The phrase \"No Justice, No Peace\" is more than a slogan used in a march, it is an observable historical fact. It is time to end the horror. \n \n Larry Mosqueda [Lawrence J.

Its gone.\n \n UPDATE II- Obama says he will hold himself to a new standard of openness:\n \n YouTube - Obama's first week The POTUS tells a hilarious joke\n \n List of Documents Obama Won't release:\n \n His Medical Records (funny how the press always harps on Republicans to release theirs).\n \n His official papers as an Illinois State Senator.\n \n His official correspondence from the Illinois State Senate.\n \n His appointment calender and list of official activities as a state senator.\n \n His college records from Occidental or Columbia University or Harvard.\n \n His client list from when he practiced law or his billing records so we can see who paid him.\n \n His Senior Thesis from Columbia University titled, \"Soviet Nuclear Disarmament\".\n \n His application to the Illinois State Bar. \n \n Refuses to release the list of donors to his campaign who gave under $200.00 (there is evidence that some of this money was in the form of illegal multiple donations from overseas).\n \n ****Original Story****\n \n Politico.com :\n \n A growing media frustration with Barack Obama spilled into the open at Thursday&#8217;s briefing, with reporters accusing the White House of stifling access and giving Obama&#8217;s first interview as president to a multi-million dollar inauguration sponsor. \n \n Veteran CBS newsman Bill Plante was one of the most vocal critics, questioning the White House&#8217;s handling of Wednesday night&#8217;s second swearing in &#8211; which was covered by just a four-reporter print pool that didn&#8217;t include a news photographer or TV correspondent. \n \n He also asked new press secretary Robert Gibbs why ABC, which paid millions to host the DC Neighborhood Ball, was granted the only inauguration day interview with President Obama &#8211; a move he equated to &#8220;pay to play.&#8221;\n &#8220;We have a tradition here of covering the president,&#8221; said Plante, who is covering his fourth administration.\n \n Gibbs defended the White House&#8217;s moves, insisting aides acted in a &#8220;way that was upfront and transparent&#8221; in allowing the standard pool into the swearing-in. And Obama himself seemed mindful of making a good impression, paying a surprise visit to the White House pressroom a few hours after the briefing.\n It&#8217;s been a bumpy 24 hours for Gibbs and company, as members of the White House press corps have publicly expressed frustration with an administration promising openness and transparency.\n \n At the same time, some members of the Obama administration&#8217;s press team have signaled that they plan to shake up some of the old traditions of White House coverage, some of the longest-standing &#8211; and most jealously guarded &#8211; in town.\n \n In recent weeks, New York Times editors complained that its White House team hadn&#8217;t gotten a sit-down with Obama during the transition, breaking an unofficial tradition whereby recent president-elects have free-wheeling exchanges with the Gray Lady before the inauguration.\n \n In the case of the second swearing-in, however, it seemed to give reporters a chance to lay down an early marker on questioning whether Obama would live up to one of his key campaign pledges, at least when it comes to the media.\n \n &#8220;It is ironic, the same day that the president is talking about transparency, we were not let in,&#8221; CNN&#8217;s Ed Henry said on the air Wednesday night after news of the second swearing-in broke. \n \n Henry&#8217;s main gripe was that television reporters weren&#8217;t permitted to cover a historic moment, when Obama once again raised his right hand and took the oath before Justice John Roberts. The only images came from White House photographer Pete Souza.\n \n Three wire services &#8212; The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse &#8211; refused to move those images, in protest of the White House&#8217;s handling of the event.\n \n The wire services&#8217; photographers were also denied access to photograph Obama sitting in the Oval Office on the first day, and similarly refused to move the White House approved photos.\n",

Yet his first and most important bill is rife with it. Didn't he campaign on never having a lobbyist on his staff? He has 27 of them at last count. Didn't he campaign on a new standard of openness with the American people? He is already limiting access and hiding his true agenda. Didn't he campaign on putting an honest and trustworthy cabinet together? Already 3 cabinet members have had to withdraw their nominations due to either ongoing Federal investigations or because of proven and admitted wrong doing.\n \n These are the same people who called Joe the Plumber un-american because he was paying only 2000.00 in back taxes via a payment program, as they go years without paying much larger sums. So tell me smiley, what do I owe anyone an apology for? And since when am I supposed to trust a guy at face value who has never run anything before.

   "More Corruption for Smiley:\n \n Obama/Democrats Reverse Themselves on Lobbyists - Banks Who Recieved Billions in Bailout Dollars Spending Millions to Lobby Politicians for More. The Cycle of Curruption Continues.\n \n January 25, 2009 - iusbvision \n \n Remember when the Obama campaign said that lobbyists were bad and criticized Mccain for having former lobbyists working on his campaign, all the while having ACTIVE lobbyists working on theirs?\n \n Remember these statements and promises from the campaign: \n YouTube - Obama's \"Lobbyists\" ad\n YouTube - Keep The Change Ad: Lobbyists\n \n \n And now the reversal.....\n \n That was then, this is now - NYT:\n \n \nCitigroup, recipient of another $45 billion, made the opposite call. While trying to keep a low profile, the company is still fielding an army of Washington lobbyists working on a host of issues, including the bailout. In the fourth quarter, it spent $1.77 million on lobbying fees, according to its lobbyists' filings.\n \n The different approaches from the two banks that have received the most money underscores the growing dilemma facing private companies, which increasingly deal with the federal government not only as rule-maker but also as shareholder, lender and trading partner.\n \n Pressing federal policy makers risks the appearance of recycling public money to advance a private agenda, while staying on the sidelines could put a company at a comparative disadvantage.\n \n Citigroup and Bank of America are hardly the only two financial firms to confront the issue. During the last three months of 2008, at least seven other firms receiving bailout funds - American Express, Capital One, Goldman Sachs, KeyCorp, Morgan Stanley, PNC and Bank of New York Mellon - all lobbied the government about the bailout, according to a review of their most recent disclosure reports.\n\n \n \n Lobbyists work with PAC's - they raise money, bundle money and spread it around. Remember when Lehmen Brothers and Fannie Mae in the mortgage industry spread $200 Million in partisan giveaways with Obama getting the second most in the Senate?\n \n ABC News: Democratic Leader - I like Lobbyists and Obama does too....\n \n \nIn his historic speech Tuesday morning, President Barack Obama said the era of \"protecting narrow interests\" is over - an echo of his campaign promise that lobbyists and special interests would lose their clout in his White House. But lobbyists still have defenders in Washington D.C., including one of Obama's most powerful allies, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada).\n \n Reid invited top lobbyists to join him and his supporters for an inaugural brunch Monday where he told ABC News that he will still do plenty of business with them.\n \n \"And there's nothing wrong with that,\" said Reid. \"And Obama will be meeting with them too.\" When asked to clarify his remarks, given Obama's promises to change that part of Capitol culture, Reid responded that lobbyists are part and parcel of the job.\n \n \"People should understand that lobbyists, per se, are someone's father, mother, son, daughter,\" said Reid. \"They work for a living.\" The Democratic leader's sons and a son-in-law have worked as lobbyists.\n",

The back taxes involved unreported consulting fees, questionable charitable contributions and a car and driver provided by Democratic Party donor Leo Hindery Jr., a founder of the private equity firm InterMedia Advisors, according to a confidential draft report prepared by the Senate Finance Committee, the Washington Post reported.\n \n No wonder Obama does not want to prosecute the Bush Administration for their wrong doings!

Cutting the dividend tax rate by more than half-from 39.6% to 15%-increased dividend tax receipts by 35% from 2002 to 2004. And corporate tax receipts have nearly tripled since 2003, reaching $250 billion for the past nine months, 26% higher than the same period last year. (WSJ July 25, 2006) \n\n \n \n \nWASHINGTON - The federal deficit in the budget year that just ended fell to a four-year low of $247.7 billion _ a figure President Bush touted Wednesday as \"proof that pro-growth policies work.\" The deficit for the budget year that ended Sept. 30 was 22.3 percent lower than the $318.7 billion imbalance for 2005, handing Bush a welcome economic talking point as Republicans battle to hold onto control of Congress in the midterm elections. (AP Oct. 11, 2006) \n\n \n \n \n \nOne place it has come from are corporations, whose tax collections have climbed by 76% over the past two years thanks to greater profitability. Personal income tax payments are up by 30.3% since 2004 too, despite the fact that the highest tax rate is down to 35% from 39.6%. The IRS tax-return data just released last month indicates that a near-record 37% of those income tax payments are received from the top 1% of earners - \"the rich,\" who are derided regularly in Washington for not paying their \"fair share.\" (WSJ Oct. 6 2006) - The rich are paying more in real dollars since the tax cuts.\n\n \n \n \nUS Treasury Sets New 1-Day Tax Receipt Record Of $85.8 Billion\n Tuesday September 19th, 2006 / 0h04 \n \n WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. government recorded record-high overall and corporate tax receipts on Sept. 15, which was a quarterly deadline for tax payments, the Treasury said Monday. \n \n Total tax receipts were $85.8 billion on Friday, compared with the previous one-day record of $71 billion on Sept. 15 of last year, the Treasury said. \n Within the overall figure, corporate tax receipts Friday were $71.8 billion, up from $63 billion in September of last year.\n \n Treasury Undersecretary for Domestic Finance Randal Quarles said Friday's numbers provided a \"continuing demonstration of the strength of the U.S. economy.\" \n \n \"In fact, Friday's gross receipts were the largest in a single day in the nation's history - 20% higher than receipts on the same quarterly tax payment date last year,\" Quarles said in a statement.\n\n \n \nOctober 27, 2006 at 10:30 pm e \n Laffer's Victory - July 10, 2006 - The New York Sun\n July 10, 2006 Edition\n Laffer's Victory\n New York Sun Staff Editorial\n July 10, 2006\n \n It's official - Arthur Laffer wins. New data show federal revenues surged in the first three quarters of the current fiscal year. Corporate tax receipts are up more than 26% over the same period last year, ringing in at $250 billion. Individual income tax collections, at $791 billion, are up 14% over the first nine months of fiscal 2005. The Congressional Budget Office projects corporate tax receipts will total $330 billion by the end of the fiscal year. As a result, the deficit for the year is expected to be about $300 billion, down from $318 billion last year and $412 billion the year before.\n \n What, you ask, has led to this miraculous event? A tax cut, it turns out. Or rather, an array of tax cuts, on corporate income, personal income, and capital gains. These tax cuts, passed in 2001 and 2003, appear to be having the desired effect of spurring economic growth by creating addition incentives for work and entrepreneurship. The latest numbers, moreover, offer some hard data to challenge some of the charges leveled against President Bush and congressional Republicans in respect of tax cuts. These tax cuts haven't exactly benefited \"the rich.\" A third of those higher income-tax revenues came from the highest-earning 1% of households, according to the New York Times.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBudget Deficit Drops $296B Under Estimate\n Jul 11, 11:01 AM (ET)\n By ANDREW TAYLOR\n My Way\n WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush touted new deficit figures Tuesday showing considerable improvement upon earlier administration predictions, saying it shows the wisdom of his tax cuts.\n \n Bush himself announced the figures - a task that for the most part has been left to lower-ranking administration officials in the past. The new figures show the deficit for the budget year ending Sept. 30 will be $296 billion - much better than the $423 billion that Bush predicted in February and a slight improvement over 2005.\n\n \n \n \nOctober 27, 2006 at 10:33 pm e \n Surprising Jump in Tax Revenues Is Curbing Deficit - New York Times\n By EDMUND L. ANDREWS\n Published: July 9, 2006\n \n WASHINGTON, July 8 - An unexpectedly steep rise in tax revenues from corporations and the wealthy is driving down the projected budget deficit this year, even though spending has climbed sharply because of the war in Iraq and the cost of hurricane relief.\n \n Graphic: Mixed Signals On Tuesday, White House officials are expected to announce that the tax receipts will be about $250 billion above last year's levels and that the deficit will be about $100 billion less than what they projected six months ago. The rising tide in tax payments has been building for months, but the increased scale is surprising even seasoned budget analysts and making it easier for both the administration and Congress to finesse the big run-up in spending over the past year. \n \n Tax revenues are climbing twice as fast as the administration predicted in February, so fast that the budget deficit could actually decline this year.\n\n \n \n \nA flood of income tax payments pushed up government receipts to the second-highest level in history in April, giving the country a sizable surplus for the month. In its monthly accounting of the government's books, the Treasury Department said Wednesday that revenue for the month totaled $315.1 billion as Americans filed their tax returns by the April deadline. The gusher of tax revenue pushed total receipts up by 13.4 percent from April 2005.

   "Okay, let's take a quick look at Halliburton.\n \n Here is the wiki link. To quote just a few of the charges leveled against them.\n \n \nIn the early 1990s Halliburton was found to be in violation of federal trade barriers in Iraq and Libya, having sold these countries dual-use oil drilling equipment and, through its former subsidiary, Halliburton Logging Services, sending six pulse neutron generators to Libya. After having pleaded guilty, the company was fined $1.2 million, with another $2.61 million in penalties.\n\n That one's pre-Cheney.\n \n \nIn 2002, Judicial Watch, a public action law firm, filed suit on behalf of shareholders against Halliburton, its current and former directors, and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP and Arthur Andersen Worldwide, for alleged accounting irregularities, said to be profit inflation by accounting for cost overruns as revenue. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the same issue. Halliburton counters that the practice was approved by its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, and conforms to generally accepted accounting practices. In August, 2004, Halliburton paid a $7.5 million fine to settle the issue. \n\n What was your challenge again? How about you show me a court ruling that says that Halliburton knowing tried to fraud the governemnt since Cheney's service there?\n \n Well, it's a law suit, post-Cheney, ahh but it's not fraud against the government. So close. Congrats on wording your challenge so carefully.\n \n \nFrom 1995-2002, Halliburton Brown & Root Services Corp was awarded at least $2.5 billion but has spent considerably less to construct and run military bases, some in secret locations, as part of the Army's Logistics Civil Augmentation Program. This contract was a cost plus 13% contract and BRS employees were trained on how to pass GAO audits to ensure maximum profits were attained. It was also grounds for termination in the Balkans if any BRS employee spoke of Dick Cheney being CEO. BRS was awarded and re-awarded contracts termed \"non-competitive\" due to BRS being the only company capable to pull off the missions. DYNACORP actually won the competitively let 2nd contract but never received any work orders in the Balkans.\n\n No-one allowed to mention Cheney being CEO. Sounds dodgy to me. But then what would I know.\n \n \nIn November 2002, KBR was tasked to plan oil well firefighting in Iraq, and in February 2003 was issued a contract to conduct the work. Critics contend that it was a no-bid contract, awarded due to Dick Cheney's position as Vice President. Concern was also expressed that the contract could allow KBR to pump and distribute Iraqi oil.[16] Others contend, however, that this was not strictly a no-bid contract, and was invoked under a contract that KBR won \"in a competitive bid process.\"[17] The contract, referred to as LOGCAP, is a contingency-based contract that is invoked at the convenience of the Army. Because the contract is essentially a retainer, specific orders are not competitively bid (as the overall contract was). \n\n Then we get onto the no-bid contracts (whoops LOGCAP). Nothing dodgy there, right.\n \n \nIn May 2003, Halliburton revealed in SEC filings that its KBR subsidiary had paid a Nigerian official $2.4 million in bribes in order to receive favorable tax treatment.\n\n Naughty naughty.\n \n \nAs of 2003, Halliburton was still operating in Iran. CNN, in a report entitled \"US companies are operating in Iran despite sanctions,\" reported that a Halliburton spokesperson told the news agency that HPS helps Iran build large oil rigs in the country's south. \n\n Ooh! More sanctions ignored.\n \n \nIn November 2006, Halliburton started off-loading its stake in the KBR subsidiary. By February 2007, Halliburton had completely sold off the subsidiary. This came after it was indicted of \"overcharging\" by Pentagon audit reports.\n\n This one must count. Indicted for \"overcharging\" by the Pentagon. eh? eh? EH?\n \n So, Halliburton wins hands down.\n \n But let's get back to another of your dodgy statements.\n \n You claimed\n \n \nBush was in office just a few weeks when 9/11 happened. Clinton passed up on over 10 chances to get bin-laden. \n\n \n A few weeks? Obama's been in office a couple of weeks and were nowhere near September yet. Isn't the president always inaugurated in January. Was Bush inaugurated in July or August perhaps?\n \n I can tell you one thing that did happen just a few weeks after Bush got into office. He started planning an invasion of Iraq. Days after 9/11 he was demanding that there be found a link between 9/11 and Iraq, because he wanted an excuse to invade. He had been looking for an excuse for months. Note that, MONTHS not WEEKS.\n \n But what truly amuses me is that you would try and compare the intellects of Bush and Obama. I don't know how you can keep a straight face. Bush was a complete clown. He couldn't have looked more so if he'd worn a baggy trousers, a red nose and a green wig.\n \n Here's another quote for your enjoyment.\n \n \n\"I'm telling you there's an enemy that would like to attack America, Americans, again. There just is. That's the reality of the world. And I wish him all the very best.\"-Washington, D.C., Jan. 12, 2009\n\n Aah, isn't he a nice chap?",

   "Wikipedia is not a good source but lets take them one at a time shall we??\n \n The Arthur Anderson thing. If you had done any research at all you will see that they screwed the other companies they worked for as well. Enron being one of the famous ones. It was because of what Arthur Anderson was doing was why the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed. Almost everyone who used Arthur Anderson was screwed by them and that is certainly well known.\n \n \nIn November 2002, KBR was tasked to plan oil well firefighting in Iraq, and in February 2003 was issued a contract to conduct the work.

Nothing dodgy there, right. \n\n \n \n There is nothing dodgy, and this is why Wikipedia is bulls^^^. The LOGCAP program is kicked in when there is either no time to do a competitive bid process, or there is a shooting situation or a hostile theatre of operations. That is exactly what the LOGCAP program is for. Companies go through a long process to qualify for LOGCAP and Halliburton qualitfied in position one for that five year term. It had nothing to do with Dick Cheney having formerly worked there. That process is not only totally legit, but it worked axactly how the LOGCAP program was intended. Those who claim \"no bid\" chicanery when LOGCAP is kicked in are counting on the fact that dopes like you don't know what LOGCAP is for (exactly what I warned you of in my earlier post and you STILL fell for it).\n \n \n \nIn May 2003, Halliburton revealed in SEC filings that its KBR subsidiary had paid a Nigerian official $2.4 million in bribes in order to receive favorable tax treatment. \n \n Naughty naughty.\n\n \n \n Wrong again. In third world countries paying bribes is standard faire and expected. At Indiana University the student government wanted to bring in a musical group from Mexico. The student government had to approve a $1500 appropriation to bribe Mexican offcials so the proper Visa's could be granted.\n \n Happens all the time, once again you don't know what you are talking about. \n \n \nAs of 2003, Halliburton was still operating in Iran. CNN, in a report entitled \"US companies are operating in Iran despite sanctions,\" reported that a Halliburton spokesperson told the news agency that HPS helps Iran build large oil rigs in the country's south. \n \n Ooh! More sanctions ignored.\n\n \n Wrong again, Halliburton had a foreign subsidiary that did business there. The subsidiary is a foreign company. Halliburton just happened to own most of its stock. The article itself said that there was nothing illegal about this at all - hmm maybe you should have read your own link. - \n U.S. companies are operating in Iran despite sanctions - May. 29, 2003\n \n \n \nIn November 2006, Halliburton started off-loading its stake in the KBR subsidiary. By February 2007, Halliburton had completely sold off the subsidiary. This came after it was indicted of &#8220;overcharging&#8221; by Pentagon audit reports. \n \n This one must count. Indicted for \"overcharging\" by the Pentagon. eh? eh? EH?\n\n \n Another reason why wikipedia is bullcr**. Halliburton ran an operation the size of an entire COUNTRY. The Pentagon and the company both have Inspector General auditors to find mistakes, overcharges, undercharges etc etc. The fact that the auditors found this and it was fixed meant that people are doing their jobs. \n \n Wikipedia uses the word \"indictment\" - ummm Grand Juries issue indictments, not an IG. That language was put in by a dolt like you to make it seem inflamatory. \n \n The Dept. of Education under Clinton lost 1 BILLION dollars and have no idea where it went. The fact that Halliburton did the work they did saved the United States billions of dollars. Private companies are just much more efficient and they are better at finding and dealing with accounting mistakes. \n \n By the way, this is exactly what I said in my first post challenging you on this. \n \n So once again the evidence that YOU found and YOU posted varified exactly what I told you originally. \n \n The United States was fortunate to enjoy Halliburtons service in Iraq and Kuwait. That is why Al Gore gave them a good government award.\n \n Smiley are you sure that you are not posting your nonsense just to make me look good?",

   "Halliburton - Paradigm for fraud\n \n Let's take a look at a few extracts from this article\n \n \nJust days before Waxman's report was released in June, Judicial Watch released e-mails from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, that it had acquired through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, showing that the oil reconstruction contract (known as RIO, for Restore Iraqi Oil) that Halliburton was awarded just before the U.S. invasion of Iraq, was coordinated with the Office of the Vice President, contrary to the assertions of Cheney himself, as well as numerous other Bush Administration and Pentagon officials.\n\n Cheney denies involvement, evidence says otherwise. And also make note that this contract was awarded before the invasion of Iraq, so no LOGCAP there.\n \n \nAccording to the report, Hurricane Katrina provides a case study of how the exemptions have been stretched to the breaking point. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, it made sense to award contracts non-competitively in order to meet urgent needs. In the month after Katrina, 51% of contract dollars awarded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency were awarded non-competitively. One would expect that that percentage would decline after that; however, in October of 2005, that percentage zoomed up to 93%, and was still at 57% in December\n\n Surely, you can't plead LOGCAP on this one. \n \n \nSo far, prosecutions of those involved in this corruption have resulted in 13 convictions, guilty pleas, or indictments of various government officials, and employees of Halliburton. The most famous case, so far, is that of former Rep. Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham (R-Calif.) who pleaded guilty last November, to accepting $2.4 million in bribes from two military contractors. The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, Stuart Bowen, reports that there are 70 corruption investigations underway in Iraq, 23 of which involve allegations of contract fraud, overcharging, product substitution, or false claims. Another 50 cases have been brought by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act, alleging fraud by contractors operating in Iraq. One of those cases has resulted in a conviction, but the Department of Justice is blocking the remaining cases from going forward by delaying the decision whether or not to participate in these cases. Hurricane Katrina has opened up an even bigger can of worms, with a reported 785 cases of criminal activity, including procurement fraud and abuse, currently under investigation\n\n Convictions, convictions everywhere. Contract fraud, overcharging, product substitution, and false claims. No, nothing dodgy there either.\n \n Keep the excuses coming Historian, but cutting the insults would be appreciated.",

   "\n \n Poor dears, only half a mil for running their companies so far into the ground that they have to come groveling in their private jets to the government for help.\n \n \n\n \n Read this carefully, you will learn a lot.\n \n UAW&#8217;s &#8216;legacy&#8217; at GM\n By Ralph R. Reiland\n \n \nGeneral Motors lost $10.6 billion in 2006. GM lost another $38.7 billion in 2007, the largest annual loss in automotive history. Through the third quarter of 2008, GM lost another $21.2 billion.\n \n On Sept. 24, 2007, a year during which GM lost an average of $3.2 billion per month, the United Auto Workers launched a national strike against the company, ordering the shutdown of 80 GM plants in the United States. More than 73,000 UAW-represented factory workers walked off the job and hit the picket lines.\n \n The UAW said that GM had failed to address job security issues during negotiations.\n \n &#8220;No one wants to see GM go down the tubes,&#8221; said picketing Jim Brown. &#8220;But we have to keep our standard of living, and GM is going to have to cooperate.&#8221;\n \n GM&#8217;s labor cost for a factory worker at the time was $71 per hour, with $27 per hour going to current workers and the remainder made up of costs for pensions and health care for retirees. If archaic work rules and other contract mandates reduced productivity at GM&#8217;s plants by half, the company&#8217;s real labor costs were $142 per hour of work counting retiree costs and $54 per hour for current labor.\n \n On Feb. 26, 2008, a UAW strike at five American Axle plants, a key GM supplier and the sole axle supplier for the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, stopped or slowed production at 30 of GM&#8217;s North American factories and crippled GM&#8217;s pickup truck and SUV production throughout the United States.\n \n &#8220;The American Axle strike cost GM $800 million in the first three months of the year and 100,000 vehicles of lost production, which GM said was mostly felt in fleet sales to commercial customers,&#8221; reported the Detroit News on May 12, 2008. &#8220;The automaker on Thursday pledged up to $200 million to American Axle to help end the dispute. The money would be used to pay for buyouts, early retirement and cash incentives to get workers who stay to accept lower wages.&#8221;\n \n That&#8217;s a billion dollars, extracted out of GM to buy labor peace at a plant they didn&#8217;t own.\n \n Seven weeks later, on April 17, a UAW-ordered work stoppage over a work rule dispute at GM&#8217;s Lansing Delta plant in Michigan halted production of the Saturn Outlook, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave.\n \n Less than three weeks later, on May 5, 2008, workers walked off the job at GM&#8217;s Kansas City plant over work rules and seniority disputes. &#8220;The United Auto Workers union struck &#8212; literally &#8212; General Motors where it hurt the most, at the automaker&#8217;s Kansas City factory that builds the fast-selling Chevrolet Malibu, already in tight supply,&#8221; reported Edmunds AutoObserver.\n \n With the Kansas City plant handling the bulk of Malibu production, the UAW strike was called four months after Malibu won the North American Car of the Year award at the North American International Auto Show.\n \n As one of GM&#8217;s few success stories in recent decades, the 2008 sales of Malibu in January, February and March were 110 percent greater than in the same quarter in 2007, with Malibu cutting into the market shares of Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.\n \n General Motors, in short, had finally produced a car that the public really wanted and the guys walked out.\n \n Stopping production of a hot-selling, profitable model at a time of declining auto sales and rising levels of red ink is &#8220;stupidity of the highest order&#8221; on the part of the UAW, said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research.\n \n On July 16, 2008, the UAW called a strike against a Johnson Controls plant in Tennessee that supplies GM with consoles and seats for the Chevrolet Traverse crossover vehicle. &#8220;The strike has the potential to disrupt production of the Traverse, one of the new vehicles GM is counting on to offset declining sales of its full-size trucks and SUVs,&#8221; explained Reuters reporter Kevin Krolicki.\n \n &#8220;We want a flawless launch for this vehicle,&#8221; UAW Local 1853 President Mike O&#8217;Rourke told Reuters, &#8220;but it&#8217;s going to be with union seats and union consoles.&#8221;\n \n And so, at last count, GM has lost $70 billion since 2004, the number of UAW members has been cut in half since 2004 at GM, Chrysler and Ford, from 300,000 to 150,000, and the rest of us are now stuck with the tab for the rescue.\n \n UAW's 'legacy' at GM - Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\n",

Yale University suspended him for drunken pranks, then kicked him out entirely before he could complete his freshman year. At 22 he caused a car accident that almost killed him and injured five members of one family, who won a large legal settlement.

Reiland\n \n Quote:\n General Motors lost $10.6 billion in 2006. GM lost another $38.7 billion in 2007, the largest annual loss in automotive history. Through the third quarter of 2008, GM lost another $21.2 billion.\n \n On Sept. 24, 2007, a year during which GM lost an average of $3.2 billion per month, the United Auto Workers launched a national strike against the company, ordering the shutdown of 80 GM plants in the United States. More than 73,000 UAW-represented factory workers walked off the job and hit the picket lines.\n \n The UAW said that GM had failed to address job security issues during negotiations.\n \n \"No one wants to see GM go down the tubes,\" said picketing Jim Brown. \"But we have to keep our standard of living, and GM is going to have to cooperate.\"\n \n GM's labor cost for a factory worker at the time was $71 per hour, with $27 per hour going to current workers and the remainder made up of costs for pensions and health care for retirees. If archaic work rules and other contract mandates reduced productivity at GM's plants by half, the company's real labor costs were $142 per hour of work counting retiree costs and $54 per hour for current labor.\n \n On Feb. 26, 2008, a UAW strike at five American Axle plants, a key GM supplier and the sole axle supplier for the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, stopped or slowed production at 30 of GM's North American factories and crippled GM's pickup truck and SUV production throughout the United States.\n \n \"The American Axle strike cost GM $800 million in the first three months of the year and 100,000 vehicles of lost production, which GM said was mostly felt in fleet sales to commercial customers,\" reported the Detroit News on May 12, 2008. \"The automaker on Thursday pledged up to $200 million to American Axle to help end the dispute. The money would be used to pay for buyouts, early retirement and cash incentives to get workers who stay to accept lower wages.\"\n \n That's a billion dollars, extracted out of GM to buy labor peace at a plant they didn't own.\n \n Seven weeks later, on April 17, a UAW-ordered work stoppage over a work rule dispute at GM's Lansing Delta plant in Michigan halted production of the Saturn Outlook, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave.\n \n Less than three weeks later, on May 5, 2008, workers walked off the job at GM's Kansas City plant over work rules and seniority disputes. \"The United Auto Workers union struck - literally - General Motors where it hurt the most, at the automaker's Kansas City factory that builds the fast-selling Chevrolet Malibu, already in tight supply,\" reported Edmunds AutoObserver.\n \n With the Kansas City plant handling the bulk of Malibu production, the UAW strike was called four months after Malibu won the North American Car of the Year award at the North American International Auto Show.\n \n As one of GM's few success stories in recent decades, the 2008 sales of Malibu in January, February and March were 110 percent greater than in the same quarter in 2007, with Malibu cutting into the market shares of Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.\n \n General Motors, in short, had finally produced a car that the public really wanted and the guys walked out.\n \n Stopping production of a hot-selling, profitable model at a time of declining auto sales and rising levels of red ink is \"stupidity of the highest order\" on the part of the UAW, said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research.\n \n On July 16, 2008, the UAW called a strike against a Johnson Controls plant in Tennessee that supplies GM with consoles and seats for the Chevrolet Traverse crossover vehicle. \"The strike has the potential to disrupt production of the Traverse, one of the new vehicles GM is counting on to offset declining sales of its full-size trucks and SUVs,\" explained Reuters reporter Kevin Krolicki.\n \n \"We want a flawless launch for this vehicle,\" UAW Local 1853 President Mike O'Rourke told Reuters, \"but it's going to be with union seats and union consoles.\"\n \n And so, at last count, GM has lost $70 billion since 2004, the number of UAW members has been cut in half since 2004 at GM, Chrysler and Ford, from 300,000 to 150,000, and the rest of us are now stuck with the tab for the rescue.UAW's 'legacy' at GM - Pittsburgh Tribune-Review",
