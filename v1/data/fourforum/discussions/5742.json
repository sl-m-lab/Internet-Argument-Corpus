   "Roughly 24 states in the U.S.-predominantly western-have a system of initiative or referendum amendments on their books which allow voters to vote on a variety of issues in a straight up or down matter, often during general elections. These have become wildly popular of late, it seems to me anyway, and it is difficult to find any criticism of the practice in the media. I would like to offer some here.\n \n Of course, it is our right to have this power, and it is enumerated in many of our states' Constitutions. My contention is that we're exercising it too vigorously.\n \n I have been guided by a simple principle in government: If a thing is good for the stability of the government, I'm for it. If it tends to disrupt the stability I'm against it. You could say I'm a Big-Stability-in-Government guy. Initiatives and Referenda (IR) tend to disrupt stability in a huge way, IMO.\n \n We are a Constitutional Republic, not a democracy, and I believe we should act accordingly. We elect our representatives to vote in our interests, and it is this removal and critical distance from the clash and spark of politics which has allowed us to outfit a strong keel on our ship of state. \n \n Some people, maddened by slow or non-existent \"progress\" attempt to take matters into their own hands and so submit an idea for an IR, garnering signatures on petitions in an always populist fashion, doing an end-run around our politicians. In this way, modern America is beginning to resemble Athenian democracy, sheer mob rule.\n \n I think it's a sorry turn of events. I would like to hear what you think.",

   "I used to live in San Francisco. Both SF and Claifornia have initiative procedures. It works, poorly. Many laws get approved by the people, and then the state is forced, by law, to spend millions fighting the law in court because it's unconstitutional. Other times, stupid laws get passed. One such law states that property taxes will only be reassesed when some buys property. As long as you hold onto your place, your property taxes won't go up. However, schools are funded largely by property taxes. School expences went up with inflation, property taxes didn't, and the California public school system went from being one of the best in the country to one of the worst. \n \n Law isn't easy. Writing good law is something that takes skill, knowledge, and practice. That's what we hire politicians to do. Asking \"the people\" if a law is good or not makes about as much sense as polling your neighbors as to what open heart procedure you should get. We should let politicians do their jobs, and if we don't like what they do we should vote them out. Trying to get average people to decide if a given piece of legislature is a good law or not simply doesn't work most of the time. We're not politicians, we're not lawyers, we simply don't have the knowledge or experience to decide.",

I would like to hear what you think.\n\n \n Referenda exhibit a form of direct democracy only in which, it can be argued, is the sovereign power of the people exercised effectively. In a representative democracy, the electorate has little power to influence politics except that provided by an election. This influence quickly wanes and the representative often behaves like a \"free agent\" unwilling , or unable, to make good on promises that were made to the electorate. Political frustration can build up which a referendum might usefully release.\n \n Generally, the indirect system of representation permits the emergence of \"experts\" at key positions in government - who may be answerable to the people but who are not merely puppets of the people. Usually, the superiority of this system of government may be allowed; but the possibility of the people \"speaking directly\" through a referendum is a useful check on those governments who through insouciance and hubris turn a deaf ear to the pressing concerns of the people.",

Joe: Not until they pry my cold dead fingers off my...\n \n You know, we consider it great sport to lambaste our politicians here in the U.S. You probably enjoy much the same pastime.
