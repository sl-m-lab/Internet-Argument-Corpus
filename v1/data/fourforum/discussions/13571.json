Robert Corrales, a spokesman for Gov. Jon Corzine, said the governor - who strongly backed the one-handgun-a-month law - supports the recommendations.\n State Police Lt. Col. Christopher Andreychak, a task force member, said the law is currently too tough on retailers.\n \"You couldn't run a used car business if you can only buy and sell one used car a month,\" he said. \"They have to have an exemption or we'll put them out of business.\"\n \n N.J. law limiting handgun purchases unfair to retailers, says task force chief | New Jersey Real-Time News - - NJ.com \n",
