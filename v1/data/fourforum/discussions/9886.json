The only reason gay-exclusive services exist, be it bars, discos, travel agencies or online dating services, etc., is not because gays really want to exclude straight people; it's because straight services and accommodations frequently refuse to cater to openly gay couples, or it's simply unsafe for openly gay couples to patronise them. If anti-gay discrimination weren't pervasive, separate services wouldn't really be as necessary; neither would they be as controversial where they did exist. It's interesting and legitimate to ask why an online dating service should exclude gays, when it is so easy simply to provide separate web pages for each class of clientele.\n \n A second factor is that gay people are a fairly small minority, and it often helps to provide social environments where it's easier for them to meet each other. That's what would keep some gay-majority services such as gay bars and clubs in business. It's much harder to see why an online service would want to maintain a no-gays policy, though.",

It's interesting and legitimate to ask why an online dating service should exclude gays, when it is so easy simply to provide separate web pages for each class of clientele.\n\n \n Certainly, you can ask all you want. No one is saying you can't ask. But the fact of the matter is, there are many, many aspects of our culture happen to not mention gays either. Businesses cater to certain segments all the time. There are men's clothing stores. There are women's clothing stores. Certainly, each could be more equality-oriented and cater to both, but they choose not to do that. And how many products out there are made and designed with only right-handed people in mind, such as handles on things and the ergonomics industry? That's catering to righties. So on that basis alone, we can argue that eHarmony chooses to cater to people in straight relationships. You have to remember that this service is really a business, just like a men's clothing store is a business--to make money--there is wide latitude given in terms of who businesses decide to cater to.\n \n And for that matter, it may be business simply in terms of numbers. As you yourself point out gays are a small minority. This is simply a matter of business--putting up a full section alongside the heterosexual relationship section catering to only a single-digits-worth of percentage of people out there, possibly under 5%, doesn't seem to me to be a very good use of marketing resources. More likely their most return would be in putting those resources, or at least most of them, toward reaching the vast majority of people. That is unless this business wants to enter into niche marketing. But that may not be the direction they want to go.\n \n Another aspect to this is that eHarmony exists (as a pay service) to help people find a marriage partner, from what I can tell. Given that gay marriage barely exists in this country (in only one state, and hotly contested there), I find it not so surprising from a business standpoint that they would not bother pouring resources into catering to a group that can't even get married, for the most part. Other services out there (that do cater to gays) focus more on dating, and so they are less concerned with the marriage issue. And then there's the article itself where a rep. from eHarmony openly says they have a lot of conservative-religious types that use their service, and don't want to drive business away. So there you have it. It is more than likely business that drives who they cater to.\n \n \nAgreed! That's what we've been telling you all along. If straight people don't want same sex marriages, they don't have to marry someone of the same sex!\n\n \n And they don't, as far as I can tell. (shrug)",

I've also seen people in a goth bar I occasionally frequent refused to be served because they aren't \"alternative\" enough.\n\n \n Fair enough, some bars and clubs are thematic, and obviously anyone who conspicuously doesn't fit in with the program isn't going to be made welcome, because they interfere with the enjoyment of the rest. (E.g. A model railway club isn't going to be very welcoming to someone with an exclusive interest in bird spotting!) Gay people (like any minority) do need their own spaces where they can socialise without fear of hostility from anti-gay bigots. Still, although I have been in some, uhh, specialised gay bars that I would never dream of taking a straight friend to, the large majority have been places which are welcoming to anyone who is gay-friendly, even if they are admitted heterosexuals. That there may be gay patrons who are prejudiced against straight people is possible, I have met a tiny handful gays like that, but the management usually don't care much about the sexual orientation of the guys buying the beer. They might draw the line at straight snogging, I suppose, because of a possible negative reaction from the rest of their clientele, but I've seen straights get away with that, too.",

All gay people who come to accept their sexuality as the gift it is have to take such a journey, away from the lies preached by religious bigots and towards the truth of the real world. You should attempt it as well, because the rewards are great.\n \n Perhaps you do not have a homophobic bone in your body, but if not, you've been led astray into condoning and even promoting homophobia with your extremist language and denial of the human rights of gay people. There is no salvation or redemption in the path you have chosen, only ever more hatred. Step off it while you can.",

   "Wow! You really do think you're God! Who are you to make any kind of judgment on what anyone's truth is? You may know what your particular brand of sin you have in your soul, but you cannot make that call for others.\n\n \n No davenport, I don't think I'm God at all. You just have no clue as to the authority you have in judging what is right and wrong in life. I do. You seem to believe that everyone can have their own truth in life and that is just fine in your opinion. I understand that their is ABSOLUTE TRUTH and that we are all accountable for that which we take into our minds and souls. \n \n By your way of thinking God has a different standard for every different person as to what is sin and isn't sin. That makes NO sense and is totally inconsistent with common sense and rational thinking. The same spiritual laws exist for all of us, only some of us actually recognize them and submit to them while the rest of us create our own moral codes to live by according to our personal comfort zones. This type of person and rationale for life is a dead end and leads only to personal destruction. Their is no hope for such a person who lives their whole life under such false personal delusions.\n \n \nI don't wish you any harm, and I certainly hope that some day, you too can find it in yourself to come into the light and out of your darkness. All gay people who come to accept their sexuality as the gift it is have to take such a journey, away from the lies preached by religious bigots and towards the truth of the real world.

There is no salvation or redemption in the path you have chosen, only ever more hatred. Step off it while you can.\n\n \n I don't have a homophobic bone in my body. It isn't gay people I stand against, it's the lifestyle I know will destroy them in the end. So my rejection of the lifestyle isn't founded in any kind of hatred at all but is motivated in love for those whom I know will ultimately be destroyed by this destructive lifestyle.\n \n And nothing anyone says to me determines my stance lesz. It is the truth in the bible that motivates me to speak against it and those who promote it.\n \n New King James Version \n \n 1Cr 6:9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals,[fn1] nor sodomites, \n 1Cr 6:10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. \n 1Cr 6:11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. \n \n Note the bolded: First, the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God.\n \n Note the underlined: Secondly, He mentions fornicators and adulterers, as well as homosexuals and sodomites in the same sentance as all being equally in rebellion against Gods truths.\n \n Note the red highlited: And thirdly, He shows that members of each of these communities of sins of the flesh were there at the time of this letter being written and that they were washed, sanctified and justified in the name of Jesus and by the power of the Holy Spirit. Which means they were healed of these spiritual afflictions of the flesh and found victory in Jesus.\n \n This is why I constantly say that gays are NOT condemned or beyond salvation. But just as the adulterer and fornicator, gays too must be healed of their sinful lusts of the flesh that hold them in bondage to homosexuality. So lesz, I implore you to seek the LIGHT and come out of your DARKNESS that holds you in bondage to the prison of your sin and the sure destruction that comes with it. Jesus can heal you just as He healed, and continues to heal me of the many sins that have controlled my life.",

And for you mental giants out there in la-la land, the word homosexual didn't exist in the 17th century english which explains why it wasn't found in the bible.
