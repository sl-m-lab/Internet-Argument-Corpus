   "A Monroe Circuit Court judge has ruled Florida's 31-year-old gay adoption ban ''unconstitutional'' in an order that allows an openly gay Key West foster parent to adopt a teenage boy he has raised since 2001.\n \n Declaring the adoption to be in the boy's ''best interest,'' Circuit Judge David J. Audlin Jr. said the Florida law forbidding gay people from adopting children is contrary to the state Constitution because it singles out a group for punishment.\n \n Florida is one of only two states -- the other is Mississippi -- that forbids gay people from adopting.\n \n Circuit judges in Florida have found the statute unconstitutional twice before, both in 1991, but both challenges stalled. A Miami case expected to be heard next month may provide an additional challenge to the law.\n \n ....\n In the ruling, the judge noted that the statute was passed by lawmakers in 1977 amid a politically charged campaign to, as one lawmaker at the time put it, send gay people ''back into the closet.'' Audin said the law violates the Constitution's separation of powers by preventing family court and child welfare judges from deciding case-by-case what is best for a child.http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2008/09/monroe-circuit.html\n \n One annoyance I have is how the \"anti-gay\" side, like the racists, often try to hide their prejudice and lie about it. It occurs in a variety of ways, but this example revolves around how they claim ONE interest, but it's obviously false.\n Sometimes, like in this case, they do or say something that explicitly demonstrates the falseness of their claim.\n The law has NO basis \"in the best interest of the child\". ALL the research shows that gays are just as good parents. There is NO research that demonstrates otherwise.\n \n Where is the wisdom in \"best interest of the child\" in FORBIDDING a viable parent, just because he/she is gay? ESPECIALLY when there is a shortage of parents...\n In a hypothetical world where there are \"too many adoptive parents\", then they could pretend that the restricted gay parent could be hypothetically replaced by a straight couple.\n But in the REAL world, where the orphans significantly outnumber the parents, the situation is instead that they are giving the orphan NO replacement, raising the risk that the child will NEVER be adopted.\n HOW is that in the \"best interest of the child\"???",
