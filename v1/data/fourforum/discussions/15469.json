   "The mother is within the child (by way of her genes). That's actually a pretty good analogy... it's not saying that the child is the mother, but a product of it, made of the same things. You wouldn't say that the mother did something when it was the child, but you might say that an accomplishment of the child is an accomplishment of the family. The cosmos is just the family in this case. The other examples you made weren't good analogies... the fish just lives in the ocean, but the fish isn't made from the ocean. Saying the ocean knows itself wouldn't make any sense, since as you said, it's not \"within\" any conscious being. \n \n The cosmos is the system of the universe. And as I said earlier, just as a sensor in a robot does something that may not be related to the rest of the robot, you still could say that the robot performs that action. \n \n I don't get why you think a scientist, who is trying to explain the wonders of science, needs to be so absolutely explicit and explain everything in extreme detail. What he said was simple and easy to understand. You are the one coming up with the religious connotations, and trying to read into his implications, when it was perfectly clear. It's no different than referring to objects made from trees in a way that reflects their origins (like calling the cross in Christianity a 'tree.') No we aren't the entire cosmos, but we are a part of it, and what makes the cosmos also makes us. Just as a camera is a way for a drone to see, or a headlight is a way for a car to cast out light, or a meatball is a way for a spaghetti sauce to be delicious, humans are a way for the cosmos to be conscious. None of the components are themselves the whole, but they are all part of something bigger, and referred to in that way.\n \n It's kind of like a 'circle of life' thing, where a living thing gets eaten, processed and exposed of, and becomes fertilizer to bring up more life...\n\n \n The mother is NOT within the fetus.\n Her genes are within her own body.The genes of the fetus are within the fetus. An apple tree is not within the apple because the apple has SIMILAR genes to the apple tree\n The fish IS made from material in the ocean just as we are made from material in the universe...the analogy stands.\n The analogy of the robot is poor..the analogy of the fish in the ocean is more apt.\n The cross in Christianity is just a symbol . The material of the cross is immaterial.\n \n My awareness of the universe has no effect and has relationship to a rock on Jupiter wheras you analogy of robots concerns a machine designed by a human for a specific purpose..there is no comparison.\n We can appreciate the wonders of the universe without making mystical pronouncements ie Patrick Moore.",

If it was in a scientific paper, I'm sure he would have used technical terms, but it was in a popular science television series and showing the wonder of our innate relationship to the cosmos (like a cell in a human body).

They evolved from earlier living creatures, going back to when the first forms of life evolved (whether that was in a 'primordial soup' or wherever... and even still it required external energy.)\n \n By taking it as completely literally, despite knowing that it wasn't meant to be taken that way (as in the entire universe being conscious), you are just being obtuse and purposely missing the point for the sake of arguing.
