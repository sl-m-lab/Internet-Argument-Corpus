   "It seems to me that if the founding fathers of this country were very bright, and I think they were, then their intentions to form a \"Christian Nation\" would be clearly evident in our founding documents. I mean, aside from their private writings where no indication of such intent can be found, wouldn't such intent be clear in the very documents that declared and established this country?\n \n To that end, I have examined some of the early documents, written by these founding fathers, upon which this nation was founded. First, there is the Declaration of Independence. While the view of the founding fathers was that the Declaration did not found a new nation, but rather returned the power to govern to the source, i.e., the people, this document is often cited as evidence of a \"Christian Nation\" by advocates of a repressive theocracy. The Declaration of Independence left the 13 Colonies without a legislative body and without law. As the founding fathers expressed at the time, the people were returned to the state of nature.\n \n Second, I have examined the eleven constitutions, written concurrently with or immediately after the Declaration in 1776 and 1777, which reestablished governments in ten of the newly independent states, and also established the independent Republic of New Connecticut (now known as Vermont) from the disputed territories that were claimed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York. Three colonies (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) didn't draft and adopt constitutions until later and instead reverted to a previous charter.\n \n Third, I examined the Articles of Confederation, the initial founding document of The United States of America, The Constitution itself, and the Bill of Rights.\n \n So here are some questions about these documents. Keep in mind that the intent of the founding fathers to form a \"Christian Nation\" should be quite clear in these documents, if that were their intent.\n \n 1. The Declaration shows the intention to form a \"Christian Nation\" in that it mentions Jesus Christ how many times?\n a. zero, b. one, c. three, d. five.\n 2. The Declaration shows the intention to form a \"Christian Nation\" in that it mentions God how many times?\n a. zero, b. one, c. three, d. five.\n 3. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is Jesus mentioned?\n a. zero, b. one, c. five, d. eleven.\n 4. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is the word \"Christian\" used?\n a. zero, b. three, c. six, d. nine\n 5. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is there a reference to the \"Creator?\"\n a. zero, b. four, c. eight, d. twelve\n \n 6. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is there a reference to \"God?\"\n a. zero, b. eight, c. eighteen, d. twenty-eight.\n \n 7. In how many of the 13 original states plus the Republic of Vermont were members of the clergy allowed to sit in the legislature?\n a. fourteen, b. nine, c. five, d. three.\n 8. How many total times did the Articles of Confederation mention God, Jesus, Christian, Creator, or religion?\n a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven\n 9. How many times does the Constitution of the United States mention God, Jesus, Creator, or Christian?\n a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven.\n 10. How many times does the Constitution of the United States make any reference to religion?\n a. zero, b. one, c. two, d. three.\n 11. How many times does the Bill of Rights mention God, Jesus, Creator, Christian, or make any reference to religion?\n a. zero, b. one, c. two, d. three.\n 12. How many of the 13 original colonies had an established religion at one time or another in their history?\n a. thirteen, b. twelve, c. eight, d. five.\n 13. \"Christian Nation\" advocates claim that they are correct because most of the people of the 13 colonies were Christians. In reality, according to historians, what percentage of the people actually attended any church at around the time of the Revolution?\n a. 75-90%, b. 50-75%, c. 20-50%, d. 5-20%\n 14. True or false. The Constitution of the United States does not mention the separation of church and state.\n \n 15. How many of the first 7 Presidents of the United States were Christians?\n a. zero, b. two, c. four, d. six.",

   "To satisfy the curiosity of those who care, here are the answers to the quiz, as promised.\n \n 1. The Declaration shows the intention to form a \"Christian Nation\" in that it mentions Jesus Christ how many times?\n a. zero, b. one, c. three, d. five.\n Of course, everyone knows the answer. This initial document of the United States mentions Jesus exactly zero times. A bit peculiar upon the founding of a \"Christian Nation,\" don't you think?\n \n 2. The Declaration shows the intention to form a \"Christian Nation\" in that it mentions God how many times?\n a. zero, b. one, c. three, d. five.\n I'm sure you all got this right too. God is mentioned one time. Sadly for the \"Christian Nation\" crowd, \"Nature and Nature's God\" is an expression typical of deism, written by Thomas Jefferson, an undisputed deist. The deity was typically mentioned as the \"Creator,\" or \"Divine Providence\" (also in the Declaration). The idea was that nature was established by the deity who then had no further part in the course of events - thus, \"Nature's God.\"\n \n 3. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is Jesus mentioned?\n a. zero, b. one, c. five, d. eleven.\n A hint. It's more than zero. It's true. Even at the state level, in founding Christian governments, the drafters of the state constitutions failed to mention Jesus Christ more than a single time, specified in the oath taken by the legislators in a single state, Delaware. While it may not have been a Christian Nation, at least in Delaware only Christians and liars could be members of the legislature.\n \n 4. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is the word \"Christian\" used?\n a. zero, b. three, c. six, d. nine\n Bet you thought you had this one too. The correct answer is six times in three of the 11 constitutions. But that isn't necessarily a good thing for the \"Christian Nation\" advocates. Let's consider New York first. Article XXXV of the Constitution of New York of April, 1777 states in part, \"That all such parts of...common law, and...statutes and acts...as may be construed to establish or maintain any particular denomination of Christians or their ministers, ...are repugnant to this constitution,...and they hereby are, abrogated and rejected.\"\n \n The Constitution of Virginia of June 1776 states in Sec 16 of the Bill of Rights, \"That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator...can be directed only by reason and conviction...and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\" That isn't really establishing a \"Christian\" government but an encouragement to the people to respect the right of each person to practice religion as he sees fit.\n \n Finally, there is the Maryland Constitution of November, 1776. Christianity is mentioned twice in Article XXXIII where it states that every man has the right and duty to worship God any such a manner as seems most acceptable to him. It mentions Christians when it specifically extends the same right to those \"professing the Christian religion.\" In that same article, the legislature is authorized to levy taxes for the support of religion. However, control of where that money is to be spent is retained by the citizen rather than being given to the established state religion. Further on, in Articles XXXV and again in Article LV, a belief in the \"Christian Religion,\" along with requirements to reject the sovereignty of the King and to swear allegiance to the state, is specified as a requirement to hold elective or appointive office. It also states that no further religious test is required. It is interesting to note that the Supreme Court found a similar provision in the Maryland Constitution unconstitutional when a man appointed as a notary public was denied that commission by a court clerk because he refused to declare his belief in God. (Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961))\n \n At any rate, here in the Constitution of Maryland we do find intent to form a \"Christian Nation.\" However, I don't think that two of the 13 states that we have found so far are enough to ascribe that view to the founding fathers from all states.\n \n 5. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is there a reference to the \"Creator?\"\n a. zero, b. four, c. eight, d. twelve\n Did you take a lucky guess and say eight? Then you are wrong because it is four. In the Constitution of New York of April, 1777 the Declaration of Independence is quoted, all of it. Thus, just as the Declaration contains one reference to the Creator, so does the Constitution of New York.\n \n In the Constitution of Pennsylvania of September, 1776, the form of the oath to be taken by members of the state assembly contains the word \"Creator.\" \"I do believe in one God, the creator and governor of the universe, the rewarder of the good and the punisher of the wicked. And I do acknowledge the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by Divine inspiration.\" It goes on to state that there should be no further religious test. Here was the perfect place to specify a \"Christian Nation\" (or at least a Christian State) and it misses the mark. It doesn't require a belief in Christianity and thus, even deists could be members of the state assembly. Thus, Benjamin Franklin was not only a member, but the President of the Executive Council.\n \n Since the Constitution of Vermont of July, 1777 was an almost verbatim copy of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, it contains one reference to a \"Creator\" in the oath sworn by members of the state legislature.\n \n The single mention of a \"Creator\" in the Constitution of Virginia has already been mentioned in question 4. Remember that it was in reference to the duty to practice religion and that every man is free to do so as he sees fit.\n \n Also remember that use of \"Creator\" for the deity was typical of deists, and apparently acceptable for Christians.\n \n 6. How many times in the 11 state constitutions of 1776 & 1777 is there a reference to \"God?\"\n a. zero, b. eight, c. eighteen, d. twenty-eight.\n Of course, the mention of God is not an indication that one is a Christian. Such a claim would be silly in the extreme. However, the 11 state constitutions mention God a total of twenty eight times. Delaware = 2 - both times in the profession of faith for legislators. Georgia = 4 - in all cases as \"so help me God\" in the form of the oaths for various offices. Maryland = 1 - in the previously mentioned (in question 4) statement of freedom of religion from Article XXXIII. New Jersey = 1 - in a rather forceful statement of religious freedom in Article XVIII. New York = 2 - the first being the previously mentioned quote of the entire Declaration of Independence and the second being in Article XXXIX, where it prohibits ministers of religion from holding any state office. Peculiar if the intent was to establish a \"Christian Nation.\" North Carolina = 2 - once in a weak statement of religious freedom, and once in Article XXXII, where denial of God or the Protestant faith prohibits service in any state office. (So that makes 3 \"Christian Nations.\") Pennsylvania = 3 - twice in Article II, a forceful statement of religious freedom, and once in Sect. 10, in the oath taken by legislators. South Carolina = 1 - in the oath taken by legislators. Vermont = 12 - 9 are in the form of various oaths, and 3 are in the statement of religious freedom.\n \n 7. In how many of the 13 original states plus the Republic of Vermont were members of the clergy allowed to sit in the legislature?\n a. fourteen, b. nine, c. five, d. three.\n I presume that the answer is five, since nine states expressly forbade members of the clergy from being elected to the legislature. Some were more strict than others and prohibited clergy members from holding any office in government or commission in the militia. The states were Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, New York, South Carolina, and New Hampshire.\n \n 8. How many total times did the Articles of Confederation mention God, Jesus, Christian, Creator, or religion?\n a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven\n You're getting the hang of this by now, aren't you? Yes, it's true. The initial founding document of the United States of America, the Articles of Confederation, contained references to any of the above zero times. Wouldn't it be more logical that if it were the intent of the men who wrote the Articles of Confederation to establish a \"Christian Nation\" there would be some mention of Jesus, God, or religion?\n \n 9. How many times does the Constitution of the United States mention God, Jesus, Creator, or Christian?\n a. zero, b. three, c. five, d. seven.\n I'm sure you got this one right too. Again, the answer is zero times. It's a peculiar state of affairs for a document that is purported to establish a \"Christian Nation.\"\n \n 10. How many times does the Constitution of the United States make any reference to religion?\n a. zero, b. one, c. two, d. three.\n I know that it seems strange for a \"Christian Nation,\" but the answer is once, in 3. of Article VI. \"but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\"\n \n 11. How many times does the Bill of Rights mention God, Jesus, Creator, Christian, or make any reference to religion?\n a. zero, b. one, c. two, d. three.\n You all got this one too, right? The answer is, of course, one time in the First Amendment. \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;\" Again, strange if the purpose was the establishment of a \"Christian Nation.\"\n \n 12. How many of the 13 original colonies had an established religion at one time or another in their history?\n a. thirteen, b. twelve, c. eight, d. five.\n Every one of them with the exception of Rhode Island. One of the final works of James Madison before he left for the Continental Convention of 1787 was to defeat a bill that would have paid \"teachers of Christian religion\" from taxes, and then to reintroduce Jefferson's religious freedom bill that essentially disestablished the Anglican church in Virginia. The last state to have an established church was the Congregational church of Massachusetts. There is a letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Adams congratulating Adams on the occasion.\n \n 13. \"Christian Nation\" advocates claim that they are correct because most of the people of the 13 colonies were Christians. In reality, according to historians, what percentage of the people actually attended any church at around the time of the Revolution?\n a. 75-90%, b. 50-75%, c. 20-50%, d. 5-20%.\n Did you guess d? Right. For example, Lynn R. Buzzard, executive director of the Christian Legal Society states that not only were a good many of the revolutionary leaders deists, but that perhaps as little as 5% of the populace were church members. Other sources (I have 5 more) place the number as low as 4% up to 10-15%.\n \n 14. True or false. The Constitution of the United States does not mention the separation of church and state.\n \n A big talking point with the \"Christian Nation\" crowd, it is true. But our Constitution is based on the principle that any power not granted to the federal government by the Constitution is reserved to the people and the states. Thus, since no religious powers are granted, the federal government has no right to legislate in religious matters. At least this is what was argued at the time of the ratification of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the First Amendment formalized the restriction on the Congress. It was actually Thomas Jefferson who stated that the purpose of the First Amendment was to erect a \"wall of separation\" between church and state.\n \n And isn't it funny that \"Christian Nation\" advocates think that it is meaningful that the separation of church and state isn't specifically mentioned, and yet have no problem with the fact that God, Jesus, and Christian Nation aren't mentioned either?\n \n 15. How many of the first 7 Presidents of the United States were Christians?\n a. zero, b. two, c. four, d. six.\n According to the Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, \"among all our presidents from Washington downward, not one was a professor of religion.\" Rev. Wilson, in the same sermon in 1831 asserted that the founders of our nation were nearly all Infidels, and that of the presidents who had to that time been elected, not a one had professed a belief in Christianity. Those Presidents were Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, J.Q. Adams, and Jackson.\n \n It seems to me that if it was the intention to found a \"Christian Nation\" that their intent would be quite clear. The founding fathers of at least three states had no problem in making their intentions known. To participate in those governments a citizen had to be a Christian. In others, it seems that deism would also have been acceptable. But in our \"Christian Nation\" matters of religion are dealt with only in the form of restrictions on the part of the government to interfere with the free practice of any religion. To me the intent to form a secular nation is quite clear.",

   "\n \n According to the Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, &#8220;among all our presidents from Washington downward, not one was a professor of religion.&#8221; Rev. Wilson, in the same sermon in 1831 asserted that the founders of our nation were nearly all Infidels, and that of the presidents who had to that time been elected, not a one had professed a belief in Christianity. Those Presidents were Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, J.Q. Adams, and Jackson.\n\n \n That's a load of horse manure.\n \n Was George Washington a Christian?\n \n This is a question often asked today, and it arises from the efforts of those who seek to impeach Washington's character by portraying him as irreligious. Interestingly, Washington's own contemporaries did not question his Christianity but were thoroughly convinced of his devout faith--a fact made evident in the first-ever compilation of the The Writings of George Washington, published in the 1830s.\n \n That compilation of Washington's writings was prepared and published by Jared Sparks (1789-1866), a noted writer and historian. Sparks' herculean historical productions included not only the writings of George Washington (12 volumes) but also Benjamin Franklin (10 volumes) and Constitution signer Gouverneur Morris (3 volumes). Additionally, Sparks compiled the Library of American Biography (25 volumes), The Diplomatic Correspondence of the American Revolution (12 volumes), and the Correspondence of the American Revolution (4 volumes). In all, Sparks was responsible for some 100 historical volumes. Additionally, Sparks was America's first professor of history--other than ecclesiastical history--to teach at the college level in the United States, and he was later chosen president of Harvard.\n \n Jared Sparks' decision to compile George Washington's works is described by The Dictionary of American Biography. It details that Sparks began . . . \n \n . . . what was destined to be his greatest life work, the publication of the writings of George Washington. [Supreme Court] Justice Bushrod Washington, [the nephew of George Washington, the executor of the Washington estate, and] the owner of the Washington manuscripts, was won over by an offer to share the profits, through the friendly mediation of Chief Justice [of the Supreme Court, John] Marshall [who from 1804-1807 had written a popular five volume biography of George Washington], who also consented to take an equal share, twenty-five per cent, with the owner. In January 1827, Sparks found himself alone at Mount Vernon with the manuscripts. An examination of them extending over three months showed that years would be required for the undertaking; and with the owner's consent, Sparks carried off the entire collection, eight large boxes, picking up on the way to Boston a box of diplomatic correspondence from the Department of State, and the [General Horatio] Gates manuscripts from the New York Historical Society. Not content with these, he searched or caused to be searched public and private archives for material, questioned survivors of the Revolution, visited and mapped historic sites. In 1830, for instance, he followed [Benedict] Arnold's [1775] route to Quebec. The first of the twelve volumes of The Writings of George Washington to be published (vol. II) appeared in 1834 and the last (vol. I, containing the biography) in 1837.\n \n In Volume XII of these writings, Jared Sparks delved into the religious character of George Washington, and included numerous letters written by the friends, associates, and family of Washington which testified of his religious character. Based on that extensive evidence, Sparks concluded:\n \n To say that he [George Washington] was not a Christian would be to impeach his sincerity and honesty. Of all men in the world, Washington was certainly the last whom any one would charge with dissimulation or indirectness [hypocrisies and evasiveness]; and if he was so scrupulous in avoiding even a shadow of these faults in every known act of his life, [regardless of] however unimportant, is it likely, is it credible, that in a matter of the highest and most serious importance [his religious faith, that] he should practice through a long series of years a deliberate deception upon his friends and the public? It is neither credible nor possible.\n \n One of the letters Sparks used to arrive at his conclusion was from Nelly Custis-Lewis. While Nelly technically was the granddaughter of the Washingtons, in reality she was much more.\n \n When Martha [Custis] married George, she was a widow and brought two young children (John and Martha--also called Patsy) from her first marriage into her marriage with George. The two were carefully raised by George and Martha, later married, and each had children of their own. Unfortunately, tragedy struck, and both John and Patsy died early (by 1781). John left behind his widow and four young children ranging in age from infancy to six years old.\n \n At the time, Washington was still deeply involved in guiding the American Revolution and tried unsuccessfully to convince Martha's brother to raise the children. The young widow of John was unable to raise all four, so George and Martha adopted the two younger children: Nelly Parke Custis and George Washington Parke Custis, both of whom already were living at Mount Vernon.\n \n Nelly lived with the Washingtons for twenty years, from the time of her birth in 1779 until 1799, the year of her marriage and of George Washington's untimely death. She called George and Martha her \"beloved parents whom I loved with so much devotion, to whose unceasing tenderness I was indebted for every good I possessed.\"\n \n Nelly was ten years old when Washington was called to the Presidency, and she grew to maturity during his two terms. During that time, she traveled with Washington and walked amidst the great foreign and domestic names of the day. On Washington's retirement, she returned with the family to Mount Vernon. Nelly was energetic, spry, and lively, and was the joy of George Washington's life. She served as a gracious hostess and entertained the frequent guests to Mount Vernon who visited the former President.\n \n On Washington's birthday in 1799, Nelly married Washington's private secretary, Lawrence Lewis. They spent several months on an extended honeymoon, visiting friends and family across the country. On their return to Mount Vernon, she was pregnant and late that year gave birth to a daughter. A short few weeks later, on December 14, General Washington was taken seriously ill and died. \n \n Clearly, Nelly was someone who knew the private and public life of her \"father\" very well. Therefore, Jared Sparks, in searching for information on Washington's religious habits, dispatched a letter to Nelly, asking if she knew for sure whether George Washington indeed was a Christian. Within a week, she had replied to Sparks, and Sparks included her letter in Volume XII of Washington's writings in the lengthy section on Washington's religious habits. Of that specific letter, Jared Sparks explained:\n \n I shall here insert a letter on this subject, written to me by a lady who lived twenty years in Washington's family and who was his adopted daughter, and the granddaughter of Mrs. Washington. The testimony it affords, and the hints it contains respecting the domestic habits of Washington, are interesting and valuable.\"\n \n Woodlawn, 26 February, 1833.\n Sir,\n \n I received your favor of the 20th instant last evening, and hasten to give you the information, which you desire.\n Truro [Episcopal] Parish is the one in which Mount Vernon, Pohick Church [the church where George Washington served as a vestryman], and Woodlawn [the home of Nelly and Lawrence Lewis] are situated. Fairfax Parish is now Alexandria. Before the Federal District was ceded to Congress, Alexandria was in Fairfax County. General Washington had a pew in Pohick Church, and one in Christ Church at Alexandria. He was very instrumental in establishing Pohick Church, and I believe subscribed [supported and contributed to] largely. His pew was near the pulpit. I have a perfect recollection of being there, before his election to the presidency, with him and my grandmother. It was a beautiful church, and had a large, respectable, and wealthy congregation, who were regular attendants.\n He attended the church at Alexandria when the weather and roads permitted a ride of ten miles [a one-way journey of 2-3 hours by horse or carriage]. In New York and Philadelphia he never omitted attendance at church in the morning, unless detained by indisposition [sickness]. The afternoon was spent in his own room at home; the evening with his family, and without company. Sometimes an old and intimate friend called to see us for an hour or two; but visiting and visitors were prohibited for that day [Sunday]. No one in church attended to the services with more reverential respect. My grandmother, who was eminently pious, never deviated from her early habits. She always knelt. The General, as was then the custom, stood during the devotional parts of the service. On communion Sundays, he left the church with me, after the blessing, and returned home, and we sent the carriage back for my grandmother.\n It was his custom to retire to his library at nine or ten o'clock where he remained an hour before he went to his chamber. He always rose before the sun and remained in his library until called to breakfast. I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them. I should have thought it the greatest heresy to doubt his firm belief in Christianity. His life, his writings, prove that he was a Christian. He was not one of those who act or pray, \"that they may be seen of men\" [Matthew 6:5]. He communed with his God in secret [Matthew 6:6]. \n My mother [Eleanor Calvert-Lewis] resided two years at Mount Vernon after her marriage [in 1774] with John Parke Custis, the only son of Mrs. Washington. I have heard her say that General Washington always received the sacrament with my grandmother before the revolution. When my aunt, Miss Custis [Martha's daughter] died suddenly at Mount Vernon, before they could realize the event [before they understood she was dead], he [General Washington] knelt by her and prayed most fervently, most affectingly, for her recovery. Of this I was assured by Judge [Bushrod] Washington's mother and other witnesses. \n He was a silent, thoughtful man. He spoke little generally; never of himself. I never heard him relate a single act of his life during the war. I have often seen him perfectly abstracted, his lips moving, but no sound was perceptible. I have sometimes made him laugh most heartily from sympathy with my joyous and extravagant spirits. I was, probably, one of the last persons on earth to whom he would have addressed serious conversation, particularly when he knew that I had the most perfect model of female excellence [Martha Washington] ever with me as my monitress, who acted the part of a tender and devoted parent, loving me as only a mother can love, and never extenuating [tolerating] or approving in me what she disapproved of others. She never omitted her private devotions, or her public duties; and she and her husband were so perfectly united and happy that he must have been a Christian. She had no doubts, no fears for him. After forty years of devoted affection and uninterrupted happiness, she resigned him without a murmur into the arms of his Savior and his God, with the assured hope of his eternal felicity [happiness in Heaven]. Is it necessary that any one should certify, \"General Washington avowed himself to me a believer in Christianity?\" As well may we question his patriotism, his heroic, disinterested devotion to his country. His mottos were, \"Deeds, not Words\"; and, \"For God and my Country.\"\n With sentiments of esteem,\n I am, Nelly Custis-Lewis\n \n George Washington's adopted daughter, having spent twenty years of her life in his presence, declared that one might as well question Washington's patriotism as question his Christianity. Certainly, no one questions his patriotism; so is it not rather ridiculous to question his Christianity? George Washington was a devout Episcopalian; and although as an Episcopalian he would not be classified as an outspoken and extrovert \"evangelical\" Founder as were Founding Fathers like Benjamin Rush, Roger Sherman, and Thomas McKean, nevertheless, being an Episcopalian makes George Washington no less of a Christian. Yet for the current revisionists who have made it their goal to assert that America was founded as a secular nation by secular individuals and that the only hope for America's longevity rests in her continued secularism, George Washington's faith must be sacrificed on the altar of their secularist agenda.\n \n Being in communion with the Anglican Church, and serving for over twenty-three years as a vestryman, and on at least three different occasions serving as a churchwarden, George Washington would have regularly recited the Apostle&#8217;s Creed, which begins:\n \n &#8220;I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.&#8221; \n \n John Marshall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who had previously fought with Washington in the Revolutionary War and served with him at Valley Forge, said of George Washington:\n \n &#8220;Without making ostentatious professions of religions, he was a sincere believer in the Christian faith, and a truly devout man.&#8221;\n \n For much more on George Washington and the evidences of his strong faith, examine the following sources:\n \n George Washington, The Writings of George Washington, Jared Sparks, editor (Boston: Ferdinand Andrews, Publisher, 1838), Vol. XII, pp. 399-411. \n George Washington, The Religious Opinions of Washington, E.

I will avow that I then believed, and now believe, that those general principles of Christianity are as eternal and immutable as the existence and attributes of God.1 \n \n The Holy Ghost carries on the whole Christian system in this earth. Not a baptism, not a marriage, not a sacrament can be administered but by the Holy Ghost. . . . There is no authority, civil or religious &#8211; there can be no legitimate government but what is administered by this Holy Ghost. There can be no salvation without it. All without it is rebellion and perdition, or in more orthodox words damnation.2 \n \n Without religion, this world would be something not fit to be mentioned in polite company: I mean hell.3 \n \n The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity.4 \n \n Suppose a nation in some distant region should take the Bible for their only law book and every member should regulate his conduct by the precepts there exhibited. . . . What a Eutopia &#8211; what a Paradise would this region be!5 \n \n I have examined all religions, and the result is that the Bible is the best book in the world.6 \n \n John Quincy Adams \n \n SIXTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES; DIPLOMAT; SECRETARY OF STATE; U. S. SENATOR; U. S. REPRESENTATIVE; &#8220;OLD MAN ELOQUENT&#8221;; &#8220;HELL-HOUND OF ABOLITION&#8221; \n \n My hopes of a future life are all founded upon the Gospel of Christ and I cannot cavil or quibble away [evade or object to]. . . . the whole tenor of His conduct by which He sometimes positively asserted and at others countenances [permits] His disciples in asserting that He was God.7 \n \n The hope of a Christian is inseparable from his faith. Whoever believes in the Divine inspiration of the Holy Scriptures must hope that the religion of Jesus shall prevail throughout the earth. Never since the foundation of the world have the prospects of mankind been more encouraging to that hope than they appear to be at the present time. And may the associated distribution of the Bible proceed and prosper till the Lord shall have made &#8220;bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God&#8221; [Isaiah 52:10].8 \n \n In the chain of human events, the birthday of the nation is indissolubly linked with the birthday of the Savior. The Declaration of Independence laid the cornerstone of human government upon the first precepts of Christianity.9 \n \n \n Clean up your act, Pandion.",

A verified remark by Eleanor Custis, Martha Washington's grandaughter: \"I never witnessed his private devotions. I never inquired about them.\" Reported quotes by her that say otherwise are lies meant to dupe the ignorant. The Reverend Doctor James Abercrombie, a friend of Washington and rector of the church Washington had attended with his wife, when asked as to Washington's religion replied, \"Sir, Washington was a Deist.\" Washington was never observed to participate in the communion service at the Anglican church that he attended. Washington would stand and leave the church at the beginning of the service. Mrs. Washington stayed. When the pastor (Abercrombie) remarked that it was bad example for Washington to do so, Washington stopped attending church at all on communion Sundays. The fact that Washington was a Deist was attested to by three of his pastors, Reverend Abercrombie, Reverend Wilson, and The Right Reverend William White.\n \n A quote in which anyone mentions god, providence, heaven, etc. do not carry any weight.

But that mindset must make all of the founding fathers christian in order to support the claim that the nation was founded on christian principles. That is important in order to support the rallying cry about returning the country to its christian principles. That involves religious displays on government buildings (viz. Judge Roy Moore and his monumental erection in the rotunda of the Supreme Court building), imposition of christian prayer on all children in public schools, and the replacement of science with religion lessons. It all hinges on some ideal time in the past when all men were christians and imaginary christian principles served to found the nation. If the founding fathers were more deist than christian, and it the Constitution is secular rather than christian, then the argument becomes vacuous.\n \n And still, the christian nation nuts aren't aware of real history. For example, the fact that christians opposed the ratification of the Constitution because it was godless. Some delegates to the Constitutional Convention refused to sign because it did not establish some form of christianity as a state religion. The ratification of the Constitution was universally opposed by christian clergy in churches and by christian legislators in the state assemblys, one example being Patrick Henry. It the Constitution is based on christian principles and if it is intended to establish a christian nation, then why was it opposed by christians?\n \n Historians recognize that the population of America was not very religious at the time. Question 13 of the quiz addresses that. Of course, Easy produces a list of the percentages of religious affiliation of various founding fathers. The problem with that is that most of those affiliations are more about the official religion where the men were from. Thus, men like Washington, Jefferson, and Madison were Anglican. Ben Franklin would have been a Quaker. John Adams would have been a Congregationalist, except that he was a Unitarian (not a christian), which was also listed. From Easy's list we see that except for the 3 Unitarians, not a single founding father was not a christian. An idiotic claim. How mindless can one be to claim that Jefferson, Madison, and Franklin were christians? But they came from states with official state religions.\n \n But you raise another point that has been ignored. The christian nation christians are not of the same faith as christians of the time of the founding of our nation. They are generally members of sects that arose during the early 20th century, based on (yet another) a reinterpretation of christian scripture.",

   "Only three of the Ten Commandments are illegal in the U.S. (not counting the odd locality that has a law against adultery, e.g.), and one of those only under oath in a court of law (perjury). Not killing or stealing are part of every other organized religion's creed, and were reasoned to be bad things by people eons before Christianity was even dreamt of. The fundamentalist notion that people didn't know those activities were wrong till the Moses/stone slabs bit, and ran around killing and thieving willy-nilly in blissful ignorance is ludicrous in the extreme. \n \n I would harbor a deep suspicion of, and certainly keep my distance from, anyone who acted a certain way only because a non-verifiable supernatural Sky Being told him to rather than an ability to reason the rightness or wrongness of the act for himself. (Especially if there are numerous instances in his Sky Being's Big Book of Rules of him breaking his own commandments out of vengeance, spite, or lack of sufficient adoration, or ordering others to break them for him. The OT is largely a matter of \"Do as I say, not as I do.)\n \n One would have to conclude from such a notion that no atheist is capable of telling right and wrong, and that atheists must therefore be responsible for the commission of the vast majority of crimes, which is of course preposterous. (If a criminal is found incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, he's usally deemed insane; thus most atheists would be found innocent by dint of same and sentenced to mental hospitals, leaving our prisons, one presumes, much less crowded than they are.)\n \n Jefferson, the deist Founding Father that the fundamentalist history revisionists expend most of the efforts trying to demonstrate was \"really\" one of their own, wrote this:\n If we did a good act merely from the love of God and a belief that is pleasing to him, whence arises the morality of the Atheist? It is idle to say, as some do, that no such thing exists. We have the same evidence of the fact as of most of those we act on, to wit: their own affirmations, and their reasonings in support of them. I have observed, indeed, generally that while in Protestant countries the defections from the Platonic Christianity of the priests is to Deism, in Catholic countries they are to Atheism. Diderot, D'Alembert, D'Holbach, Condorcet are known to have been among the most virtuous of men.

I firmly believe this, &#8212;and I also believe that without his concurring Aid, we shall succeed in this political Building no better than the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our Projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a Reproach and Bye word down to future Ages.\" - Speech to the Constitutional Convention (June 28, 1787)\n \n It&#8217;s pretty obvious that Franklin believed in a God who did involve himself in the affairs of men and nations, and Franklin also alludes to the New Testament as &#8220;Sacred Writings&#8221; which also reveal God&#8217;s revelation to man. \n \n We'll just look now at two of the ones you provided - Jefferson and George Washington:\n \n George Washington:\n \n He (Washington) was an open promoter of Christianity. For example, in his speech on May 12, 1779, he claimed that what children needed to learn &#8220;above all&#8221; was the &#8220;religion of Jesus Christ,&#8221; and that to learn this would make them &#8220;greater and happier than they already are&#8221;; on May 2, 1778, he charged his soldiers at Valley Forge that &#8220;To the distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of Christian&#8221;; and when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the military on June 8, 1783, he reminded the nation that &#8220;without a humble imitation&#8221; of &#8220;the Divine Author of our blessed religion&#8221; we &#8220;can never hope to be a happy nation.&#8221; Washington's own adopted daughter declared of Washington that you might as well question his patriotism as to question his Christianity.\n \n Being in communion with the Anglican Church, and serving for over twenty-three years as a vestryman, and on at least three different occasions serving as a churchwarden, George Washington would have regularly recited the Apostle&#8217;s Creed, which begins:\n \n &#8220;I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.&#8221; \n \n John Marshall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who had previously fought with Washington in the Revolutionary War and served with him at Valley Forge, said of George Washington:\n \n &#8220;Without making ostentatious professions of religions, he was a sincere believer in the Christian faith, and a truly devout man.&#8221;\n \n In addition, the inscription on Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon is this:\n \n WITHIN THIS ENCLOSURE REST THE REMAINS OF GENL. GEORGE WASHINGTON.\" Over the door of the inner tomb is inscribed this scripture: \"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE....\" \n \n Now, Thomas Jefferson:\n \n Thomas Jefferson was hardly speaking from a strict deist standpoint when he said: \n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n Now, why should Jefferson tremble for his country if God does not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations?\n \n Ant then there's this:\n \n \" I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we\n are, who lead our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their\n native land and planted them in a country flowing with all\n the necessities and comforts of life.\" (Monday, March 4,\n 1805, in his 2nd Inaugural Address)\n \n Remember, a strict deist was one who believed God was like a watchmaker, who wound up the universe and thereafter did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations. Jefferson obviously believed otherwise. That's where virtually all of your examples fail as examples of deism.\n \n As for Benjamin Rush, he had his own Bible (revealed religion) and we still have it today with passages identified in both the Old and New Testaments.\n \n So, you're trying to tell people here a bunch of Bible thumpers you've identified above are your preferred deists? ROTFLOL! Get real.",

   "Were the Founding Fathers \"Deists,\" \"Freethinkers,\" and \"Infidels?\"\n \n Snippet: But wasn't Adams a Unitarian? Those who believe in the \"separation of church and state\" would certainly like us to believe that he was, and that Unitarians were flagrant Tom Paine-type atheists who flouted their anti-religious views and led an entire nation in an anti-Christian revolt. This is far from accurate. \n \n Unitarianism appeared in America as early as 1785; its doctrines were stated by William Ellery Channing in 1819, with the American Unitarian Association being formed in 1825. The Theological Dictionary of 1823 described Unitarians thusly: \n \n In common with other Christians, they confess that He [Jesus] is the Christ, the Son of the Living God; and in one word, they believe all that the writers of the New Testament, particularly the four Evangelists, have stated concerning him. \n \n Were the Founding Fathers \"Deists\" and \"Infidels?\"",

   "\n Jefferson, the deist Founding Father that the fundamentalist history revisionists expend most of the efforts trying to demonstrate was \"really\" one of their own, wrote this:\n If we did a good act merely from the love of God and a belief that is pleasing to him, whence arises the morality of the Atheist? It is idle to say, as some do, that no such thing exists. We have the same evidence of the fact as of most of those we act on, to wit: their own affirmations, and their reasonings in support of them. I have observed, indeed, generally that while in Protestant countries the defections from the Platonic Christianity of the priests is to Deism, in Catholic countries they are to Atheism. Diderot, D'Alembert, D'Holbach, Condorcet are known to have been among the most virtuous of men. Their virtue, then, must have had some other foundation than love of God.--Thomas Jefferson, letter to Thomas Law, June 13, 1814\n\n \n \nJefferson on the common law and Christianity:\n \n I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction at length of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the contrary which you have adduced is incontrovertible; to wit, that the common law existed while the Anglo-Saxons were yet Pagans, at a time when they had never yet heard the name of Christ pronounced, or knew that such a character had ever existed.\n --Letter to Major John Cartwright\n\n \n Hey LA, how about links to these quotes so we can see them in their entirety and in context rather than your cherry picked redacted excerpts? emoticon_xdonno The games you liars play would embarrass any philosophically honest person.\n \n Here it is in its entirety,\n Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Law\n Thomas Jefferson\n June 13, 1814\n \n The copy of your Second Thoughts on Instinctive Impulses, with the letter accompanying it, was received just as I was setting out on a journey to this place, two or three days' distant from Monticello. I brought it with me and read it with great satisfaction, and with the more as it contained exactly my own creed on the foundation of morality in man. It is really curious that on a quesion so fundamental, such a variety of opinions should have prevailed among men, and those, too, of the most exemplary virtue and first order of understanding. It shows how necessary was the care of the Creator in making the moral principle so much a part of our constitution as that no errors of reasoning or of speculation might lead us astray from its observance in practice. Of all the theories on this question, the most whimsical seems to have been that of Wollaston, who considers truth as the foundation of morality. The thief who steals your guinea does wrong only inasmuch as he acts a lie in using your guinea as if it were his own. Truth is certainly a branch of morality, and a very important one to society. But presented as its foundation, it is as if a tree taken up by the roots, had its stem reversed in the air, and one of its branches planted in the ground.\n The Creator would indeed have been a bungling artist, had he intended man for a social animal, without planting in him social dispositions.\n Some have made the love of God the foundation of morality. This, too, is but a branch of our moral duties, which are generally divided into duties to God and duties to man. If we did a good act merely from the love of God and a belief that it is pleasing to Him, whence arises the morality of the Atheist? It is idle to say, as some do, that no such being exists. We have the same evidence of the fact as of most of those we act on, to-wit: their own affirmations, and their reasonings in support of them. have observed, indeed, generally, that while in protestant countries the defections from the Platonic Christianity of the priests is to Deism, in catholic countries they are to Atheism. Diderot, D'Alembert, D'Holbach, Condorcet, are known to have been among the most virtuous of men. Their virtue, then, must have had some other foundation than the love of God.\n The {To chylon} of others is founded in a different faculty, that of taste, which is not even a branch of morality. We have indeed an innate sense of what we call beautiful, but that is exercised chiefly on subjects addressed to the fancy, whether through the eye in visible forms, as landscape, animal figure, dress, drapery, architecture, the composition of colors, &c., or to the imagination directly, as imagery, style, or measure in prose or poetry, or whatever else constitutes the domain of criticism or taste, a faculty entirely distinct from the moral one. Self-interest, or rather self-love, or egoism, has been more plausibly substituted as the basis of morality. But I consider our relations with others as constituting the boundaries of morality. With ourselves we stand on the ground of identity, not of relation, which last, requiring two subjects, excludes self-love confined to a single one. To ourselves, in strict language, we can owe no duties, obligation requiring also two parties. Self-love, therefore, is no part of morality. Indeed it is exactly its counterpart. It is the sole antagonist of virtue, leading us constantly by our propensities to self-gratification in violation of our moral duties to others. Accordingly, it is against this enemy that are erected the batteries of moralists and religionists, as the only obstacle to the practice of morality. Take from man his selfish propensities, and he can have nothing to seduce him from the practice of virtue. Or subdue those propensities by education, instruction or restraint, and virtue remains without a competitor. Egoism, in a broader sense, has been thus presented as the source of moral action. It has been said that we feed the hungry, clothe the naked, bind up the wounds of the man beaten by thieves, pour oil and wine into them, set him on our own beast and bring him to the inn, because we receive ourselves pleasure from these acts. So Helvetius, one of the best men on earth, and the most ingenious advocate of this principle, after defining \"interest\" to mean not merely that which is pecuniary, but whatever may procure us pleasure or withdraw us from pain, [de l'esprit 2, 1,] says, [ib. 2, 2,] \"the humane man is he to whom the sight of misfortune is insupportable, and who to rescue himself from this spectacle, is forced to succor the unfortunate object.\" This indeed is true. But it is one step short of the ultimate question. These good acts give us pleasure, but how happens it that they give us pleasure? Because nature hath implanted in our breasts a love of others, a sense of duty to them, a moral instinct, in short, which prompts us irresistibly to feel and to succor their distresses, and protests against the language of Helvetius, [ib. 2, 5,] \"what other motive than self-interest could determine a man to generous actions? It is as impossible for him to love what is good for the sake of good, as to love evil for the sake of evil.\" The Creator would indeed have been a bungling artist, had he intended man for a social animal, without planting in him social dispositions. It is true they are not planted in every man, because there is no rule without exceptions; but it is false reasoning which converts exceptions into the general rule. Some men are born without the organs of sight, or of hearing, or without hands. Yet it would be wrong to say that man is born without these faculties, and sight, hearing, and hands may with truth enter into the general definition of man. The want or imperfection of the moral sense in some men, like the want or imperfection of the senses of sight and hearing in others, is no proof that it is a general characteristic of the species. When it is wanting, we endeavor to supply the defect by education, by appeals to reason and calculation, by presenting to the being so unhappily conformed, other motives to do good and to eschew evil, such as the love, or the hatred, or rejection of those among whom he lives, and whose society is necessary to his happiness and even existence; demonstrations by sound calculation that honesty promotes interest in the long run; the rewards and penalties established by the laws; and ultimately the prospects of a future state of retribution for the evil as well as the good done while here. These are the correctives which are supplied by education, and which exercise the functions of the moralist, the preacher, and legislator; and they lead into a course of correct action all those whose disparity is not too profound to be eradicated. Some have argued against the existence of a moral sense, by saying that if nature had given us such a sense, impelling us to virtuous actions, and warning us against those which are vicious, then nature would also have designated, by some particular ear-marks, the two sets of actions which are, in themselves, the one virtuous and the other vicious. Whereas, we find, in fact, that the same actions are deemed virtuous in one country and vicious in another. The answer is that nature has constituted utility to man the standard and best of virtue. Men living in different countries, under different circumstances, different habits and regimens, may have different utilities; the same act, therefore, may be useful, and consequently virtuous in one country which is injurious and vicious in another differently circumstanced. sincerely, then, believe with you in the general existence of a moral instinct. I think it the brightest gem with which the human character is studded, and the want of it as more degrading than the most hideous of the bodily deformities. I am happy in reviewing the roll of associates in this principle which you present in your second letter, some of which I had not before met with. To these might be added Lord Kaims, one of the ablest of our advocates, who goes so far as to say, in his Principles of Natural Religion, that a man owes no duty to which he is not urged by some impulsive feeling. This is correct, if referred to the standard of general feeling in the given case, and not to the feeling of a single individual. Perhaps I may misquote him, it being fifty years since I read his book.\n \n The leisure and solitude of my situation here has led me to the indiscretion of taxing you with a long letter on a subject whereon nothing new can be offered you. I will indulge myself no farther than to repeat the assurances of my continued esteem and respect.Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Law\n \n Here's the whole letter in its proper context.",

   "Right. Jefferson was a Christian. Pull the other one, it's got bells on:\n The Christian god can be easily pictured as virtually the same as the many ancient gods of past civilizations. The Christian god is a three headed monster; cruel, vengeful and capricious. If one wishes to know more of this raging, three headed beast-like god, one only needs to look at the caliber of the people who say they serve him. They are always of two classes: fools and hypocrites.--Thomas Jefferson, letter to his nephew, Peter CarrChristianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man.--Thomas Jefferson, letter to Joseph Priestley, Washington, 21 March 1801The authors of the gospels were unlettered and ignorant men and the teachings of Jesus have come to us mutilated, misstated and unintelligible.--Thomas Jefferson, Toward the MysteryThe whole history of these books [the Gospels] is so defective and doubtful that it seems vain to attempt minute enquiry into it: and such tricks have been played with their text, and with the texts of other books relating to them, that we have a right, from that cause, to entertain much doubt what parts of them are genuine. In the New Testament there is internal evidence that parts of it have proceeded from an extraordinary man; and that other parts are of the fabric of very inferior minds. It is as easy to separate those parts, as to pick out diamonds from dunghills.--Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Adams, January 24, 1814I have recently been examining all the known superstitions of the world, and do not find in our particular superstition (Christianity) one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology.--Thomas Jefferson, letter to Dr. WoodsIt is not to be understood that I am with him (Jesus Christ) in all his doctrines. I am a Materialist; he takes the side of Spiritualism; he preaches the efficacy of repentence toward forgiveness of sin; I require a counterpoise of good works to redeem it. Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him by his biographers, I find many passages of fine imagination, correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence; and others, again, of so much ignorance, so much absurdity, so much untruth, charlatanism and imposture, as to pronounce it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same being. I separate, therefore, the gold from the dross; restore him to the former, and leave the latter to the stupidity of some, the roguery of others of his disciples. Of this band of dupes and imposters, Paul was the great Coryphaeus, and the first corruptor of the doctrines of Jesus.--Thomas Jefferson, to William Short, April 13, 1820That Jesus did not mean to impose himself on mankind as the son of God, physically speaking, I have been convinced by the writings of men more learned than myself in that lore.--Thomas Jefferson, to Story, Aug. 4, 1820The truth is, that the greatest enemies of the doctrine of Jesus are those, calling themselves the expositors of them, who have perverted them to the structure of a system of fancy absolutely incomprehensible, and without any foundation in his genuine words. And the day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as his Father, in the womb of a virgin will be classified with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter. --Thomas Jefferson, to John Adams, Apr. 11, 1823\n Anyone who trying to prove Jefferson was a Christian using his own words has got a fool's task ahead of him. Want to go tit for tat quoting him? Bring it on, bub. 'Cause I got plenty more like the ones above--and similar from Adams, Paine, Franklin, Madison, Hale and (later) Lincoln.\n \n I guarantee you it's a losing proposition. You might as well try to prove black is white. (Orwell again.)\n \n See also Jefferson's Religious Beliefs - Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia \nJefferson's religious views became a major public issue during the bitter party conflict between Federalists and Republicans in the late 1790s when Jefferson was often accused of being an atheist. \n \n With the help of Richard Price, a Unitarian minister in London, and Joseph Priestly, an English scientist-clergyman who emigrated to America in 1794, Jefferson eventually arrived at some positive assertions of his private religion. His ideas are nowhere better expressed than in his compilations of extracts from the New Testament \"The Philosophy of Jesus\" (1804) and \"The Life and Morals of Jesus\" (1819-20?). The former stems from his concern with the problem of maintaining social harmony in a republican nation. The latter is a multilingual collection of verses that was a product of his private search for religious truth. Jefferson believed in the existence of a Supreme Being who was the creator and sustainer of the universe and the ultimate ground of being, but this was not the triune deity of orthodox Christianity. He also rejected the idea of the divinity of Christ, but as he writes to William Short on October 31, 1819, he was convinced that the fragmentary teachings of Jesus constituted the \"outlines of a system of the most sublime morality which has ever fallen from the lips of man.\" In correspondence, he sometimes expressed confidence that the whole country would be Unitarian[4], but he recognized the novelty of his own religious beliefs. On June 25, 1819, he wrote to Ezra Stiles Ely, \"I am of a sect by myself, as far as I know.\"\nSorry, Archie, but trying to prove Jefferson a \"Christian\" from the quote you cited is absurd. The heavily qualified redefinition of the word as it might apply to himself that he then goes on to provide--someone who believes Jesus existed and had some highly laudable and admirable ideas--is not going to pass muster with your preacher, or Easy's either. Hell, by that definition, I'm a Christian, and so are many of the other posters here whom you both nastily castigate here at every opportunity. \n \n Jefferson was no Christian in the sense you two are, Archie. Nor in the sense that Robertson, Falwell, Billy Graham, or even the very liberal and pro-gay Desmond Tutu are/were. He did not believe Jesus was the son of God, nor in the resurrection, nor in the words of Paul, and felt that the type of Christianity you practice was an absurd, corrupt tool for oppressing and exploiting the people. Not only did he write or say the things quoted above, but he rewrote the Bible to exclude every miracle, revelation, and supernatural occurence. (Needless to say, it's a very much shorter work than the original.) \n \n When Christian fundamentalists are reduced to lowering the entrance requirements to their club to the point of meaninglessness in an attempt to acquire some sort of historical validity by pointing to Jefferson as a member, they're taking the concept of \"grasping at straws\" to new extremes.",

   "At the forefront of this historical revisionism is Christian Right (strike one) activitist (strike two) from Texas (strike three, you're out) David Barton, founder of a the-founding-fathers-were-really-fundamentalist organization called \"Wallbuilders.\" (If it's the one between church and state, don't they mean wall breakers?) Plainly not the most unbiased, agenda-free historical researcher.\n \n This bozo has, frighteningly, received funding and praise from right-wing Repubs like Bill Frist, despite having been found to have made up quotes from the Fathers allegedly supportive of his claims. His website is pretty hilarious, in that his page of \"founding father\" quotes such top-billed \"major\" influences on the Declaration and Constitution as Samuel Adams, John Jay, John Hancock (well, his signature was the biggest), and John Dickinson. (Psst...Dave... no one's saying there weren't religious true-believers among the signers. But the biggies--Jefferson, John Adams, Madison, Tom Paine, Franklin--were the ones who actually shaped the documents and whose influence forged the country's secular heritage.)\n \n From http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/founding.htm: \n\"We have staked the whole future of American civilization, not upon the power of government, far from it. We have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.\"\n \n So said James Madison, architect of the Constitution, defender of religious freedom and fourth president of the United States, according to the Religious Right.\n \n But to church-state separationists and historians of the post-colonial period, something about this Madison quote has never felt quite right. It seemed unlikely that the same Madison who advocated \"total separation of the church from the state\" and battled to disestablish the Anglican Church in Virginia would say it. The sentiment appeared to clash with his well-known advocacy of a healthy distance between religion and government.\n \n A few years ago, with the quote popping up increasingly in the mass media (including Rush Limbaugh's daily radio show), Robert S. Alley, professor emeritus at the University of Richmond and author of James Madison on Religious Liberty, undertook a dogged effort to track it down. Enlisting the help of the editors of The Papers of James Madison at the University of Virginia, Alley scoured reams of documents, books and writings. After coming up empty-handed, the Madison scholar concluded that the quote was probably fictional.\n \n Now the major purveyor of the quote, Texas-based Religious Right propagandist David Barton, has admitted it's bogus. Last year Barton's group, WallBuilders' issued a one-page document titled \"Questionable Quotes,\" a list of 12 statements allegedly uttered by Founding Fathers and other prominent historical figures, that are now considered to be suspect or outright false. Madison's alleged comment about the Ten Commandments is number four on the list and is flatly declared by Barton to be \"false.\" (See [below] for a full list of the bogus quotes.)\n \n Advocates of separation of church and state were left breathless over Barton's audacity. For nearly 10 years, the Texas propagandist has traveled the country, putting on programs about America's alleged \"Christian heritage\" at fundamentalist churches and other venues. During these events, Barton argued that the separation of church and state is a myth foisted on the country by the Supreme Court 50 years ago. The United States, he insisted, was founded by Christians and was intended to be a fundamentalist-style \"Christian nation.\"\n \n What was Barton's proof for these claims? Many of the quotations he now admits are groundless! At least nine of the 12 were included in Barton's 1989 book, The Myth of Separation, and appeared in the video version, \"America's Godly Heritage.\" Barton was so enamored of one quote supposedly uttered by Benjamin Franklin (\"Whosoever shall introduce into the public affairs the principles of primitive Christianity will change the face of the world.\") that it was included on a biographical sketch WallBuilders distributes about Barton, saying it \"fully sums up what David believes and teachers.\" Barton now admits the quote is \"questionable\" and recommends people don't use it.\n \n Alley finds Barton's reliance on phony history disturbing. \"It's one thing to get up and make a speech and allude to something that isn't there, but when you have somebody parading a document in a book and that turns out to be an outright lie, it's more dangerous,\" Alley told Church & State magazine. \"The danger is that people will find credibility in what he does largely because he represents himself in that mode. He's a double fraud.\"\n \n Continued Alley, \"For Barton to withdraw these quotes is fine, but that doesn't change the fact that they were wrong to begin with.\"\n \n Barton's \"Questionable Quotes\" sheet tries to minimize the importance of the use of phony material. \"Inevitably, the quotes will continue to be heard at the 'popular' level,\" reads the introduction. \"Fret not; the sun will still rise. But at the scholarly level, please refrain from, or at least be cautious in, using any quotation that cannot be authenticated. Thank you for purifying your own waters in the world's rhetorical rivers.\"\n \n In fact, much damage to Americans' understanding of their own history has already been wrought by these fake quotes. As Barton himself notes in promotional materials, \"Many people have used quotes from our videos in writing 'Letters to the Editor' or sharing information with friends or public of officials.\" They have appeared incessantly in both right-wing and mainstream media and have been paraded about by conservative columnists and talk radio programs across the nation. On October 7, 1992, former U.S. Rep. William Dannemeyer of California, a staunch ally of the Religious Right, read the phony Madison quote into the Congressional Record. Millions of people may have been misled by this false information, only a tiny fraction of whom will ever see Barton's \"correction.\"\n \n Barton's sloppy research and predilection to rely on questionable sources never stopped Religious Right activists from recommending his materials. Television preacher and Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson has lauded Barton as a \"wonderful man.\" \"I admire him tremendously for his breadth of information,\" Robertson gushed.\n \n Barton has addressed Christian Coalition national gatherings for three years running and is active in the group's Texas chapter. El Cajon, Calif., City Council member Bob McClellan, a Barton groupie, often accompanies the Texas propagandist to meetings and hawks his books and tapes. McClellan, a Coalition activist, posts a banner saying the materials \"have been invaluable in furthering the principals [sic] behind the Christian Coalition in San Diego.\"\n \n The Rev. Jerry Falwell sells Barton's materials at the Liberty University bookstore, and the Texas activist has been interviewed at least twice by James Dobson on Focus on the Family's daily radio broadcast.\n \n Even Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has praised Barton. In a speech about school prayer delivered at the Heritage Foundation on Oct. 5, 1994, before he was named speaker, Gingrich -- who considers himself a historian -- called Barton's Myth of Separation book \"most useful\" and \"wonderful.\"\n \n Incredibly, Barton appears to have emerged undamaged even after admitting that many of his quotes are bogus, and he continues spreading incorrect information through the Religious Right's media empire. During his most recent interview with Dobson May 2, Barton conceded that Thomas Jefferson's famous 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists of Connecticut calls for a \"wall of separation between church and state.\" But Barton went on to claim that later in the letter Jefferson says separation \"means the government will not run the church, but we will still use Christian principles with government.\" In fact, Jefferson's letter says no such thing. (For more information about this and other Barton errors, see \"Sects, Lies and Videotape,\" and \"David Barton's Bad History,\" April 1993 Church & State magazine.)\n \n Barton is apparently at least somewhat embarrassed by his inaccuracies, or at least wants to cover them up. Thus, The Myth of Separation has been \"updated\" and re-titled Original Intent. The new, longer volume omits the phony quotes and some of the more egregious errors in The Myth of Separation but remains rife with distortions of history and court rulings. Throughout, the book pitches the line that the United States was founded to be a \"Christian nation\" and charges that the modern Supreme Court and church-state separationists have covered up this legacy.\n \n In his WallBuilder Report newsletter, Barton brags that the new volume contains \"over thirteen hundred footnotes.\" He does not point out that The Myth of Separation also contained extensive footnotes but was still inaccurate because the sources Barton relied on were wrong.\n \n Meanwhile, a federal court ruled recently that Barton's materials are inappropriate for use in public schools. The case was brought by Lisa Herdahl, an Ecru, Miss., mother whose objection to official prayers at the local public school has captured national headlines. A less-noticed part of her lawsuit challenges a class at the school known as \"A Biblical History of the Middle East.\"\n \n Herdahl asserted that the course was a ruse for teaching fundamentalist Christianity, and U.S. District Judge Neal B. Biggers Jr. agreed. In his June 3 decision, Biggers noted that course instructors used Barton's video \"America's Godly Heritage,\" as well as other fundamentalist tapes, in class.\n \n \"[T]he only implication the court can draw from the showing of this and other religious films to a class of students supposedly studying Middle East history is that the teachers are attempting to indoctrinate the students in their religious beliefs by claiming to teach Middle East history,\" Biggers wrote. \"This practice cannot be condoned in the context of a public school system. It is best left to the family and the church.\"\n \n Barton's recent misfortunes are not likely to slow down the \"Christian nation\" movement. He continues to speak around the country, and scores of other Religious Right propagandists are also active, including Christian Reconstructionist Gary DeMar, TV preacher D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries, and the Rev. Peter Marshall who, like Barton, is a Christian Coalition favorite. These and some lesser known Religious Right activists crank out books, videos and other materials attacking separation of church and state and advocating union between religion and government.\n \n Commenting on the Madison \"Ten Commandments\" fiasco in a 1995 article for the William & Mary Bill of Rights Journal, Alley, who serves on Americans United's Board of Trustees, noted, \"Proving that a quotation does not exist is a daunting task. If you cannot find it in any extant manuscripts or collections of Madison's works, just how does one prove it will not turn up in someone's attic tomorrow? Of course you cannot.... But, after all, it is incumbent solely upon the perpetrators of this myth to prove it by at least one citation. This they cannot do. Their style is not revisionism, it is anti-historical.\"\n \n Concluded Alley, \"We likely have not heard the last of this nonsense, but it is important to press the new media frauds to document what they claim. Because they cannot do so in most instances, time may ultimately discredit the lot of them.\"\n",

You let yourself be duped and are even proud of it. \n\n \n Show me where Barton personally admitted he manufactured quotes? I see just the opposite.\n \n From David Barton's own website\n \n Raising The Academic Standard For Quoting The Founding Fathers \n \n In 1988, David Barton published The Myth of Separation, documenting the Founding Fathers religious beliefs and practices with over 700 footnotes. In that work, he cited from several sources, including history professors, legal scholars, and early textbooks. Although this is common practice in the academic community, David came to believe that historical debates undergirding public policy should be conducted using a standard of evidence that would be accepted by courts: only the \"best evidence\" should be used (e.g., eyewitness testimony, direct statements and actions by the participants, etc.). In other words, instead of quoting what a professor or judge said about Thomas Jefferson's (or the other 200+ Founding Fathers') views on the First Amendment, let Jefferson's (and the other Founders') own words and actions speak for themselves.\n \n Consequently, David authored a second book (Original Intent, with over 1,400 footnotes) on the same theme as The Myth of Separation in which he does not use Founder's quotes unless they are documented to a primary source; he dropped all \"historical\" quotes from attorneys, professors, texts, etc.\n \n In using this higher standard, he discovered there were about a dozen or so popular and widely-used quotes by historians and others (David had quoted these sources with documentation properly footnoted in The Myth of Separation) that he could not find in the Founders' own writings. Importantly, some of those quotes had come from works nearly a century-and-a-half old and therefore would seem to have been credible; yet David could not find those quotes in original documents.\n \n David therefore released a paper entitled \"Unconfirmed Quotations\" in which he listed those dozen or so quotes that he had used in Myth of Separation and which he would voluntarily no longer use. He called on those on all sides of the debate to refrain from using these quotes in any subsequent writings until their veracity could be established in a source that would meet the legal standard of \"best evidence.\" (Since the release of that article, we have actually been able to find the original documentation for some of those quotes that we originally listed as \"unconfirmed\" - and which antagonists claim that David had made up!)\n \n Despite David's clear statement in the preface of \"Unconfirmed Quotations\" that he intended to raise the academic bar, David's antagonists (such as Rob Boston, et. al) claimed David had \"admitted he made up his quotes\" \"\" a complete mischaracterization of what occurred. On the contrary, David had simply challenged authors on all sides \"\" whether writing for the American Atheist Association or the National Association of Evangelicals, for Americans United for Separation of Church and State or for Christian Coalition - that they should not allege that the Founders said or believed something unless it could be documented in the Founders' own writings or some other equally authoritative source (e.g., the Records of the Continental Congress, Madison's notes on the Constitutional Convention, the Debates of the First Congress, etc.).\n WallBuilders - Issues and Articles - Unconfirmed Quotations\n \n Barton takes on his critics:\n \n WallBuilders - Issues and Articles - Taking On The Critics\n \n Nice going, Pandion.

Why is it that christians have such problems with simple logic?\n \n But since you asked. from here\n \nWhile Mr Barton's bio claims \"David's exhaustive research (from original writings) on the Founding Era has rendered him an expert in this field\", there is significant evidence that this is not accurate. Some of the central quotes in these works, including ones by James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and from US Supreme Court cases, were apparently entirely invented. David Barton has admitted he can not produce sources for many of his quotes but maintains that this is not important to his central thesis because they were \"consistent\" with the views of the Founders. Furthermore, Mr. Barton has no academic expertise in the field of history. His sole earned degree is a BA in religious education from Oral Roberts University.

   " Even on the page that you cite, one of these is shown to arise from an inability to read (misattribution of antecedents). Further, one quotation is marked as confirmed on his site when nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n \n Let's see what it actually says. From the link I referenced:\n \n 14. The highest glory of the American Revolution was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity. -- John Quincy Adams (unconfirmed modified confirmation!) \n \n This quote has had wide circulation for decades and can be traced back to an 1860 work by John Wingate Thornton, The Pulpit of the American Revolution, which reprinted a number of sermons preached during the Revolution. In the overview of that work, Thornton explained: \n \n The church polity [form of government] of New England begat like principles in the state. The pew and the pulpit had been educated to self-government. They were accustomed \"TO CONSIDER.\" The highest glory of the American Revolution, said John Quincy Adams, was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity. 33 \n \n Thornton, an attorney and historian, grew up during the lifetime of John Quincy Adams and held many interests in common with him. His above statement in connection with Adams is Thornton's summation of part of a lengthy speech delivered by John Quincy Adams during an 1837 Fourth of July celebration at Newburyport, Massachusetts (a speech which Thornton may well have heard in person, but which he certainly later read). In that address, Adams observed that Christmas and the Fourth of July were the two most-celebrated holidays in America, and that both were interrelated. As Adams began his speech, he queried:\n \n Why is it that, next to the birth day of the Saviour of the World, your most joyous and most venerated festival returns on this day [July 4th]? . . . Is it not that, in the chain of human events, the birthday of the nation is indissolubly linked with the birth-day of the Saviour? That it forms a leading event in the progress of the gospel dispensation? Is it not that the Declaration of Independence first organized the social compact on the foundation of the Redeemer's mission upon earth? That it laid the corner stone of human government upon the first precepts of Christianity. . ? 34\n Comparing Adams' original 1837 exact quotation with Thornton's 1860 summary of the quote, one immediately sees the similarities. Significantly, in his 1860 work, Thornton accurately related the essence of Adams' message and never presented that phrase as being an exact quotation from Adams; nevertheless, those who used Thornton's work in subsequent generations and writings incorrectly cited Thornton's summary as if it were a direct quotation from John Quincy Adams. Therefore, the \"unconfirmed\" quote attributed to Adams can be replaced with his exact quotation given above from his 1837 speech.\n \n So, once again - where did Barton manufacture a quote??",

   "Hey, dunderhead - show me one quote he personally manufactured for a founding father? Just one, that he himself wrote??\n\n \"It's okay to lie as long as you aren't the first person to tell it\"? If you'd bother to pay attention, or to use your brain, you'd see that the issue here is not whether Barton himself, personally, manufactured quotes from thin air, which -- to the best of my recollection -- I haven't accused him of doing. The issue is whether Barton's published quotes are accurate. They are not.\n \n \nLet's see what it actually says.\n\n Yes, let's!\n \n \nThe church polity [form of government] of New England begat like principles in the state. The pew and the pulpit had been educated to self-government. They were accustomed \"TO CONSIDER.\" The highest glory of the American Revolution, said John Quincy Adams, was this: it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity. 33\n\n This is not a quote. This is Thornton's characterization of what JQA -- not a founding father anyway -- said.\n \n \nThornton, an attorney and historian, grew up during the lifetime of John Quincy Adams and held many interests in common with him.\n\n If being a contemporary and having common interests is grounds for being considered a credible source, then what of the dozens of likewise credible sources verifying that Washington did not accept the principles of what you consider to be Christianity qua Christianity? What is it with you and the double standards today?\n \n \nHis above statement in connection with Adams is Thornton's summation of part of a lengthy speech delivered by John Quincy Adams during an 1837 Fourth of July celebration at Newburyport, Massachusetts (a speech which Thornton may well have heard in person, but which he certainly later read).\n\n So the quote is -- admittedly, unequivocally, indisputably -- not a quotation from Adams. There is no credible evidence that Thornton heard the speech.\n \n Here are the first two paragraphs of the speech as written, without hacking out pieces:Why is it, that, entering upon the sixty-second year of our national existence, you have honored with an invitation to address you from this place, a fellow citizen of a former age, bearing in the records of his memory, the warm and vivid affections which attached him, at the distance of a full half century, to your town, and to your forefathers, then the cherished associates of his youthful days? Why is it that, next to the birthday of the Savior of the World, your most joyous and most venerated festival returns on this day? - And why is it that, among the swarming myriads of our population, thousands and tens of thousands among us, abstaining, under the dictate of religious principle, from the commemoration of that birth-day of Him, who brought life and immortality to light, yet unite with all their brethren of this community, year after year, in celebrating this, the birth-day of the nation?\n \n Is it not that, in the chain of human events, the birthday of the nation is indissolubly linked with the birthday of the Savior? That it forms a leading event in the progress of the gospel dispensation? Is it not that the Declaration of Independence first organized the social compact on the foundation of the Redeemer's mission upon earth? That it laid the corner stone of human government upon the first precepts of Christianity, and gave to the world the first irrevocable pledge of the fulfillment of the prophecies, announced directly from Heaven at the birth of the Savior and predicted by the greatest of the Hebrew prophets six hundred years before?\nThat indissoluble link is that -- in the chain of human events -- the birthday of Jesus came before the birthday of the country, that Jesus was pro-liberty, and that the country is pro-liberty? Seriously? So not only do you have a bogus quotation attribution, you're relying upon the flawed logic of the introduction, the hook, to an Independence Day speech. \n \n \nComparing Adams' original 1837 exact quotation with Thornton's 1860 summary of the quote, one immediately sees the similarities.\n\n But not exactitudes. No context. Not a representation of what I'll show below is even close to what JQA accepted.\n \n \nTherefore, the \"unconfirmed\" quote attributed to Adams can be replaced with his exact quotation given above from his 1837 speech.\n\n But it's not. Dolts keep using it and believing it to be (1) accurate and (2) a representation of what JQA accepted. As usual, the dolts are wrong.\n \n Let's take a look at parts of another Independence Day speech from 16 years earlier, delivered to the U.S. House of Representatives:\n America, with the same voice which spoke herself into existence as a nation, proclaimed to mankind the inextinguishable rights of human nature, and the only lawful foundations of government.\nand\n[America's] glory is not dominion, but liberty. Her march is the march of the mind. She has a spear and a shield: but the motto upon her shield is, Freedom, Independence, Peace.\nIt is clear that JQA did not hold Christianity as the basis for government but the inalienable rights as discussed in the Declaration of Independence, and that the goals of the country are freedom, independence, and peace, not religion.\n \n A highly interesting side note:\n The source I find quotes Thornton as writing the \"principle of Christianity,\" not principles. If one were to accept Thornton's characterization, one would have to conclude that that principle in question is the liberty that JQA discussed at length in the 1837 speech and not religiosity.",

You made that look like you provided that information. In fact it looks to me like you plagerized it from that website and reworded it for your own use. And you talk about Barton?\n \n Regardless, Barton responded (f: Alley can neither claim that Madison \"never\" uttered the \"quote in question\" about the Ten Commandments nor that it was \"false.\" As you yourself know, Madison's \"Detached Memoranda\" (surely one of your favorite documents) was not \"discovered\" until 1946. More Madison letters previously unknown are found regularly, often in the estates of recently deceased individuals who held private collections or inherited family heirlooms received directly from Madison's hand. Furthermore, much of what is known about Madison and his diverse and often changing viewpoints frequently comes from Madison's contemporaries rather than from his own writings. For example, more of Madison's succinct statements against slavery are available through his personal interviews with Harriet Martineau (published in the early 1800s) than from his own writings. Alley can no more claim that the Madison quote does not exist than I can claim that it does. However, I can show that the Madison \"quote in question\" has been in circulation for generations, and I can document it (as I did) to non-modern works and works by credentialed historians.\n \n WallBuilders - Issues and Articles - Taking On The Critics\n \n Secondly,\n \n \"In citing David Barton's The Myth of Separation as the source, Mr. Crowell apparently missed the fact that Barton did not include the words, \"of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government.\"(252) In a video tape Barton inserts \"of all our political institutions\" but still omits the \"capacity of mankind.\"(253) This video version was read into the Congressional Record by Representative Dannemeyer on October 7, 1992.(254)\n \n Barton's sources are two, or three, depending upon how you sort out his confusion. Apart from citing the Lane volume of 1939, he offers as his other source Frederick Nyneyer's First Principles in Morality and Economics; Neighborly Love and Ricardo's Law of Association. (255) In fact, his source appears to be an article entitled \"Neighborly Love and Ricardo 's Law of Association\". (256) Far from appearing in a source by Nyneyer, the alleged quote is found in the latter article and drawn \"[f]rom the 1958 calendar of Spiritual Mobilization.\"(257) Barton's attempted documentation becomes exponentially more curious. He seems to have no clue as to his sources. When approached about his mythical additions to Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptists, he deleted the references in a later edition of his tape.(258).\n \n Looks to me like Barton got his references mixed up and that the quote did previously exist in the 1958 calendar of Spiritual Mobilzation (according to his critic).\n \n You say?",

How many of the first 7 Presidents of the United States were Christians?\n \n a. zero, b. two, c. four, d. six.\n\n The answer I gave was:\n \nAccording to the Reverend Bird Wilson, an Episcopal minister in Albany, \"among all our presidents from Washington downward, not one was a professor of religion.\" Rev. Wilson, in the same sermon in 1831 asserted that the founders of our nation were nearly all Infidels, and that of the presidents who had to that time been elected, not a one had professed a belief in Christianity. Those Presidents were Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, J.Q. Adams, and Jackson.\n\n At the time that Rev. Bird gave that sermon, it was true. But at that time, Andrew Jackson was President. Jackson grew up in a Presbyterian family and had attended his parents chruch as a youth. But he was never baptized. As an adult he seldom practiced religion and never professed any religion. Only after he left the Presidency was he baptized in the Presbyterian church. Only then did he openly profess religion.

He regularly attended church, he was a Vestryman, and he took Communion. Deists don't do that.\n \n As for early education, you can read the following:\n \n America's Schools Began With Christian Education\n \n The founders of the United States believed that useful education - that which produced liberty - must have its foundation in Christianity\n by Stephen McDowell\n \n THE FOUNDERS OF THE UNITED STATES were very much aware of the relation of education and liberty. They knew that a people cannot be ignorant and free. Jefferson said it this way:\n \n If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.\n \n Benjamin Franklin said that ignorance results in bondage:\n \n A nation of well informed men who have been taught to know and prize the rights which God has given them cannot be enslaved. It is in the region of ignorance that tyranny begins.\n \n The founders of the United States believed that useful education - that which produced liberty - must have its foundation in Christianity.\n \n Though many may not recognize his name today, Benjamin Rush played a very significant role in American history. Although Rush was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a member of the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention, his contributions were not limited to governmental affairs. He was also a professor of medicine, a writer, a principal founder of Dickinson College, and a leader in education. In addition, he served on many Bible and medical societies, and societies for the abolition of slavery. He wrote in 1806:\n \n In contemplating the political institutions of the United States, I lament that we waste so much time and money in punishing crimes and take so little pains to prevent them. We profess to be republicans, and yet we neglect the only means of establishing and perpetuating our republican form of government, that is the universal education of our youth in the principles of Christianity by the means of the Bible. For this divine book, above all others, favors that equality among mankind, that respect for just laws, and those sober and frugal virtues, which constitute the soul of republicanism.1\n \n Education in colonial America was primarily centered in the home and church, with the Bible being the focal point of all education. Schools were started to provide a Christian education to those who were not able to receive such training at home and to supplement home education. The first schools were started by the church. The first common schools originated with the school law of 1647 in Massachusetts, which stated:\n \n It being one chief project of that old deluder, Satan, to keep men from the knowledge of the Scriptures.2\n \n Our founders recognized that Satan wants to keep people ignorant. If he can keep them ignorant, he can keep them in bondage. This motivated them to not only start schools but also colleges.\n \n Colleges and universities were started as seminaries to train a godly and literate clergy. In fact, 106 of the first 108 colleges were founded on the Christian faith. One of the original rules and precepts of Harvard College stated:\n \n Let every student be plainly instructed, and earnestly pressed to consider well, the main end of his life and studies is, to know God and Jesus Christ which is eternal life (John 17:3), and therefore to lay Christ in the bottom, as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning.3\n \n The father of the American Revolution, Samuel Adams, declared that education in the principles of the Christian religion is the means of renovating our age. He wrote in a letter on October 4, 1790, to John Adams, then vice president of the United States:\n \n Let divines and philosophers, statesmen and patriots, unite their endeavors to renovate the age, by impressing the minds of men with the importance of educating their little boys and girls, of inculcating in the minds of youth the fear and love of the Deity and universal philanthropy, and in subordination to these great principles, the love of their country; of instructing them in the art of self-government, without which they never can act a wise part in the government of societies, great or small; in short, of leading them in the study and practice of the exalted virtues of the Christian system.4\n \n Knowledge apart from God and His truth is little better than complete ignorance, because the most important aspect of education is the imbuing of moral principles. All education is religious - it imparts a basic set of principles and ideals, a worldview. How the youth are educated today will determine the course a nation takes in the future.\n \n Noah Webster understood this very well. He spent his entire adult life working to reform America and to provide a foundation of liberty, happiness, and prosperity for all citizens. Education from a Christian perspective was key. In 1839 he wrote:\n \n Practical truths in religion, in morals, and in all civil and social concerns ought to be among the first and most prominent objects of instruction. Without a competent knowledge of legal and social rights and duties, persons are often liable to suffer in property or reputation, by neglect or mistakes. Without religious and moral principles deeply impressed on the mind, and controlling the whole conduct, science and literature will not make men what the laws of God require them to be; and without both kinds of knowledge, citizens cannot enjoy the blessings which they seek, and which a strict conformity to rules of duty will enable them to obtain.5\n \n Numerous people in America today agree that a lack of moral values is the root of the country's problems, yet without a standard of moral absolutes rooted in a sovereign God and His truth, and without these being taught and lived in the homes, in the schools, in the government, and in the media, America as a nation will not be able to impart these needed morals.\n \n The people behind the French Revolution believed virtue was necessary for their efforts to succeed, but they thought they could be virtuous on their own apart from God. The founding fathers of the United States knew this could never be. George Washington in his Farewell Address specifically addressed this belief when he said:\n \n And let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion... reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principles.6\n \n America&#39;s Schools Began With Christian&#160;Education &#8212; The Mandate",

   "[QUOTE=Easyrider;388147]Deists, never more than \"a minority within a minority,\" were submerged by evangelicalism in the nineteenth century.[//quote]\n Whoever claimed that Deists weren't a minority? Aren't you paying attention? I guess not. However, the leaders of the independence were Deists or Unitarians. If you name the major influences in the founding of our country (Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Franklin, Hancock, Mason, Morris, Monroe, Paine, Revere, Dawes) you will find that many of them were Deists or Unitarians. They were the educated elite of the day. Historians know quite well that the universities were rampant with the teachings of the Enlightenment. One Dartmouth grad commented that, other than himself, he couldn't name a single christian in his class.\n \n I notice that the Library of Congress article is unsourced except for the illustrations. One can only wonder who these experts are. It certainly is a poor bit of scholarship, but who would expect more from Congress, especially since they are attempting to propagate a myth. I'll do better.\n \n Frank Lambert, a recognized historian of the Revolution says that in 1776, only 17% of Americans claimed to be church members. By 1850 the number had grown to 34%. There's that \"feverish growth.\" (The Founding Fathers And The Place Of Religion In America. 2003. Princeton University Press, Princeton. p. 282.)\n \n Steven Waldman, journalist, and founder of Beliefnet.com agrees. 17% in 1776 and 34% in 1850. (Founding Faith: Providence, Politics, and the Birth of Religious Freedom in America. 2008. Random House, New York. pp. 170 and 203.)\n \n Gary Kowalski, a Unitarian Universalist minister and religious historian says only one in eight Americans claimed church membership before the Revolution. (Revolutionary Spirits: The Enlightened Faith of America's Founding Fathers. 2008. Blue Bridge, New York. p 189.)\n \n Isaac Kramnick and R. Laurence Moore, two more historians state that \"the endlessly repeated claim that the Americans of 1776 were a devoutly religious and especially Christian people...is nonsense.\" They also state that the highest estimates of church membership are only about 10-15% during the Revolutionary era. (The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness. 1996. W.W. Norton & Company, Inc., New York. pp 16 and 17.)\n \n Add to that the fact that more christian ministers were Tories. According to Frank Steiner (yet another historian) most of the established clergy were driven from the country during the Revolution. From a count of 96 parishes and 91 clergymen in Virginia before the war, numbers fell to 23 parishes gone extinct and 34 vacant, with only 28 clergymen in the state. (The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents From Washington to F.D.R.. 1936. Haldeman-Julius Publications. Girard, Kan. p. 87.)\n \n So, it seems, that not only did the christian clergy later oppose the ratification of the \"godless\" Constitution, they also opposed independence in the first place as they were founding a christian nation.\n \n Unsourced material, from no matter where you get it, is sloppy and below par. But it satisfies christian dupes.",

   "Dissing the U.S. Library of Congress?\n A Few Declarations of Founding Fathers and Early Statesmen on Jesus, Christianity, and the Bible\n \n (This list is by no means exhaustive; many other Founders could be included, and even with those who appear below, additional quotes could have been used.)\n \n John Adams\n \n SIGNER OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE; JUDGE; DIPLOMAT; ONE OF TWO SIGNERS OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS; SECOND PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n \n The general principles on which the fathers achieved independence were the general principles of Christianity. I will avow that I then believed, and now believe, that those general principles of Christianity are as eternal and immutable as the existence and attributes of God.1 \n \n The Holy Ghost carries on the whole Christian system in this earth. Not a baptism, not a marriage, not a sacrament can be administered but by the Holy Ghost. . . . There is no authority, civil or religious &#8211; there can be no legitimate government but what is administered by this Holy Ghost. There can be no salvation without it. All without it is rebellion and perdition, or in more orthodox words damnation.2 \n \n Without religion, this world would be something not fit to be mentioned in polite company: I mean hell.3 \n \n The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity.4 \n \n Suppose a nation in some distant region should take the Bible for their only law book and every member should regulate his conduct by the precepts there exhibited. . . . What a Eutopia &#8211; what a Paradise would this region be!5 \n \n I have examined all religions, and the result is that the Bible is the best book in the world.6 \n \n John Quincy Adams \n \n SIXTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES; DIPLOMAT; SECRETARY OF STATE; U. S. SENATOR; U. S. REPRESENTATIVE; &#8220;OLD MAN ELOQUENT&#8221;; &#8220;HELL-HOUND OF ABOLITION&#8221; \n \n My hopes of a future life are all founded upon the Gospel of Christ and I cannot cavil or quibble away [evade or object to]. . . . the whole tenor of His conduct by which He sometimes positively asserted and at others countenances [permits] His disciples in asserting that He was God.7 \n \n The hope of a Christian is inseparable from his faith. Whoever believes in the Divine inspiration of the Holy Scriptures must hope that the religion of Jesus shall prevail throughout the earth. Never since the foundation of the world have the prospects of mankind been more encouraging to that hope than they appear to be at the present time. And may the associated distribution of the Bible proceed and prosper till the Lord shall have made &#8220;bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God&#8221; [Isaiah 52:10].8 \n \n In the chain of human events, the birthday of the nation is indissolubly linked with the birthday of the Savior. The Declaration of Independence laid the cornerstone of human government upon the first precepts of Christianity.9 \n \n Samuel Adams\n \n SIGNER OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE; &#8220;FATHER OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION&#8221;; RATIFIER OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION; GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS\n \n I . . . [rely] upon the merits of Jesus Christ for a pardon of all my sins.10 \n \n The name of the Lord (says the Scripture) is a strong tower; thither the righteous flee and are safe [Proverbs 18:10]. Let us secure His favor and He will lead us through the journey of this life and at length receive us to a better.11\n \n I conceive we cannot better express ourselves than by humbly supplicating the Supreme Ruler of the world . . . that the confusions that are and have been among the nations may be overruled by the promoting and speedily bringing in the holy and happy period when the kingdoms of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ may be everywhere established, and the people willingly bow to the scepter of Him who is the Prince of Peace.12 \n \n He also called on the State of Massachusetts to pray that . . . \n \n the peaceful and glorious reign of our Divine Redeemer may be known and enjoyed throughout the whole family of mankind.13 \n we may with one heart and voice humbly implore His gracious and free pardon through Jesus Christ, supplicating His Divine aid . . .

   "On a number of occasions, the United States Supreme Court specifically recognized America as a Christian nation. In the case \"Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States\" (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer, following a lengthy and exhaustive search of early American historical literature, commented, \"We find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth....that we are a Christian nation....\"\n \n In another Supreme Court Case, \"Zorach vs. Clauson\" (1952, US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, \"We are a religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\" Further, in \"United States vs. Macintosh\" (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George Sutherland affirmed, \"We are a Christian people....affording to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God.\"\n \n At the Constitutional Convention on June 28, 1787, Benjamin Franklin noted: &#8220;...The longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that &#8216;except the Lord build the House, they labor in vain that build it.&#8221;\n \n There are many today who believe Franklin was a strict deist, but Franklin here is not only referencing Bible verses, but is calling it \"Sacred Writings\" (Revealed Religion which is not a deist belief), alluding in part to a teaching by Jesus Christ from Matthew 10:29.",

   "Religion and the New Republic\n \n The religion of the new American republic was evangelicalism, which, between 1800 and the Civil War, was the \"grand absorbing theme\" of American religious life. During some years in the first half of the nineteenth century, revivals (through which evangelicalism found expression) occurred so often that religious publications that specialized in tracking them lost count. In 1827, for example, one journal exulted that \"revivals, we rejoice to say, are becoming too numerous in our country to admit of being generally mentioned in our Record.\" During the years between the inaugurations of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, historians see \"evangelicalism emerging as a kind of national church or national religion.\" The leaders and ordinary members of the \"evangelical empire\" of the nineteenth century were American patriots who subscribed to the views of the Founders that religion was a \"necessary spring\" for republican government; they believed, as a preacher in 1826 asserted, that there was \"an association between Religion and Patriotism.\" Converting their fellow citizens to Christianity was, for them, an act that simultaneously saved souls and saved the republic. The American Home Missionary Society assured its supporters in 1826 that \"we are doing the work of patriotism no less than Christianity.\" With the disappearance of efforts by government to create morality in the body politic (symbolized by the termination in 1833 of Massachusetts's tax support for churches) evangelical, benevolent societies assumed that role, bringing about what today might be called the privatization of the responsibility for forming a virtuous citizenry.\n \n In 1800 major revivals that eventually reached into almost every corner of the land began at opposite ends of the country: the decorous Second Great Awakening in New England and the exuberant Great Revival in Kentucky. The principal religious innovation produced by the Kentucky revivals was the camp meeting. The revivals were organized by Presbyterian ministers, who modeled them after the extended outdoor \"communion seasons,\" used by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, which frequently produced emotional, demonstrative displays of religious conviction. In Kentucky the pioneers loaded their families and provisions into their wagons and drove to the Presbyterian meetings, where they pitched tents and settled in for several days. When assembled in a field or at the edge of a forest for a prolonged religious meeting, the participants transformed the site into a camp meeting. The religious revivals that swept the Kentucky camp meetings were so intense and created such gusts of emotion that their original sponsors, the Presbyterians, as well the Baptists, soon repudiated them. The Methodists, however, adopted and eventually domesticated camp meetings and introduced them into the eastern United States, where for decades they were one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination. \n \n Religion and the New Republic (Religion and the Founding of the American Republic, Library of Congress Exhibition)",

During those 8 weeks he went 6 times - 3 Episcopal, one Roman Catholic, one Quaker, and one Presbyterian.\n \n He suspended his diary during the Revolution and for some time after that.\n \n 1785 - 1\n 1786 - 1\n 1787 - 3\n 1788 - 1\n \n In 1787 Washington was in Philadelphia at the Constitutional Convention. While there he attended a Catholic church once and an Episcopal church once.\n \n He did attend church a few times while President in both New York and Philadelphia, but he did not regularly keep his diary. From his attendance at these churches he came to know the Rev. Wilson, Bishop White, and the Rev. Dr. Abercrombie. These men stated that Washington was not a christian or was a Deist.\n \n 1797 - 4\n 1798 - 1\n 1799 - 2\n \n This is what serves Easy as a devout christian. There is not a single verified line from Washington's papers wherein he mentions Jesus. Strange if he were a christian. He sometimes mentions god, but more frequently \"the Deity\", or \"Providence\" or \"the Author of our religion.\" All Deist phrases.\n \nAre you saying he wasn't a Vestryman?\n\n Again you aren't paying attention or you have a severe reading problem. The position of vestryman was as much a secular position as it was religious. Besides Washington, both Jefferson and Madison, neither one a christian during adulthood, were vestrymen. It wasn't until 1780 that the civil powers of the vestry were abolished.\n \nAre you claiming he never took Communion?\n\n Actually, I think it was the verified statements from Washington's pastors where those statements were found. Washington stopped attending church on Sundays when there were Communion services after it was called to his attention that it was bad example to leave before the communion service. Again, verified statements from his pastors.\n \nIf you are you are illiterate because I've already provided evidence for all three.\n\n No, you didn't. You provided invented quotes from a christian nation site.\n \n We know it's important for you to think that Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and J.Q. Adams were christians.

   "From the previously cited The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents by Franklin Steiner, p. 25:\n \nOne of the most honored clergymen of the Episcopal Church in the latter part of the 18th Century and the early part of the 19th, was the Rev. Dr. James Abercrombie, rector of St. Peter's Church, in Philadelphia. Here Washington sometimes attended while he was President. Dr. Abercrombie was a scholar and at one time a correspondent of Samuel Johnson. Sprague's 'Annals of the American Pulpit,' vol. 5, p. 394, says: \"One incident in Dr. Abercrombie's experience as a clergyman, In connection with the father of his country, is especially worthy of record: and the following account of it was given by the doctor himself in a letter to a friend, in 1833, shortly after there had been some public allusion to it.\" Then follows Dr. Abercrombie's letter:\n \nWith respect to the inquiry you make, I can only state the following facts: that as pastor of the Episcopal Church, observing that, on sacramental Sundays George Washington, immediately after the desk and pulpit services, went out with the greater part of the congregation -- always leaving Mrs. Washington with the other communicants -- she invariably being one -- I considered it my duty, in a sermon on public worship, to state the unhappy tendency of example, particularly of those in elevated stations, who uniformly-turned their backs on the Lord's Supper. I acknowledge the remark was intended for the President; and as such he received it. A few days after, in conversation, I believe, with a Senator of the United States, he told me he had dined the day before with the President, who, in the course of conversation at the table, said that, on the previous Sunday, he had received a very just rebuke from the pulpit for always leaving the church before the administration of the sacrament; that he honored the preacher for his integrity and candor; that he had never sufficiently considered the influence of his example, and that he would not again give cause for the repetition of the reproof; and that, as he had never been a communicant, were he to become one then, it would be imputed to an ostentatious display of religious zeal, arising altogether from his elevated station. Accordingly, he never afterwards came an the morning of sacrament Sunday, though at other times he was a constant attendant in the morning.\n\n\n From the same book, p. 26 comes the following from a sermon by Dr. Bird Wilson entitled \"Religion of the Presidents\" that was published in the Daily Advertiser in 1831:\n \nWhen Congress sat in Philadelphia, President Washington attended the Episcopal Church, The rector, Dr. Abercrombie, told me that on the days when the sacrament of the Lord's Supper was to be administered, Washington's custom was to arise just before the ceremony commenced, and walk out of the church. This became a subject of remark in the congregation, as setting a bad example. At length the Doctor undertook to speak of it, with a direct allusion to the President. Washington was heard afterwards to remark that this was the first time a clergyman had thus preached to him, and he should henceforth neither trouble the Doctor or his congregation on such occasions; and ever after that, upon communion days, 'he absented himself altogether from church.'\n\n Later, Mr. Robert Dale Owen interviewed the Rev. Wilson about the sermon. He wrote a letter about that interview that was then published. In it is the following:\n \n'I endorse,' said Dr. Wilson with emphasis, 'every word of that. Nay, I do not wish to conceal from you any part of the truth, even what I have not given to the public. Dr . Abercrombie said more than I have repeated. At the close of our conversation on the subject his emphatic expression was -- for I well remember the very words -- \"Sir, Washington was a Deist.\"'\n\n Mr Owen again quotes the Rev. Wilson in the same letter:\n \nI have diligently perused every line that Washington ever gave to the public, and I do not find one expression in which he pledges Himself as a believer in Christianity. I think anyone who will candidly do as I have done, will come to the conclusion that he was a Deist and nothing more.\n\n The problem with christian nation nuts is that they don't \"diligently pursue\" anyone's writings. When they want to show that Washington agreed with them, they invent a quote. What is worse, the stupid follow along.\n \n I found part of Steiner's book on the Internet. It's too bad that much of it is missing, apparently due to scanning problems. But the chapter on Washington is there, although two appendices about Washington are not. It is also a shame that the chapters on Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and J.Q. Adams are missing, as is the chapter on another Deist President claimed by christians, Lincoln.\n \n Here's a link to The Religious Beliefs Of Our Presidents\n \n Hopefully this will help Easy, who doesn't understand that books are a source of information and that everything useful isn't on the Internet. He seems to be of a mind that anything on the Internet must be true, especially if someone who claims to be a christian made it up.",

Adams grew up a Congregationalist, like his cousin Samuel Adams, but the progressive ideas of the Enlightenment had become very popular in the universities of America around this time. Even though universities like Dartmouth, Harvard, Yale, and the College of New Jersey (Princeton) were originally religious in nature, they became very secular and humanistic during the 18th century. The idea of \"inalienable rights\", among which are \"Life, Liberty and...\" are taken directly from Locke. Adams and others, like John Hancock, became very liberal, religiously speaking, while attending Harvard. The same seems to have happened to Madison at the College of New Jersey. A graduate of Dartmouth at around this time commented that, other than himself, he couldn't name a single christian in his class. Adams became a New England Unitarian, a religion that grew out of Congregationalism. Adams was a christian only in the broadest sense. He, like Washington, Hancock, Jefferson, Madison and Monroe, denied the trinity and therefore the divinity of Jesus. From what I have read about and by Adams, he was neither a bigot nor opposed to freedom and liberty. I don't know where you could have arrived at those ideas.",

Later, in 1872, another biography of Lincoln was published that had been written by a life-long friend of Lincoln, who had accompanied Lincoln to Washington and had escorted the body back to Springfield.

   "MrwriteLA said: \n \n The \"torturous semantic convolutions\" are all on your side of the argument.\n  \n \n Surely if you stoop to making that claim then you can also show the cause?\n \n Only two of the Ten Commandments are codified into law in this country, apart from bearing false witness under oath and the rare local ordinance against adultery that no one has yet bothered to make a federal case out of.\n  \n \n Obviously you believe that this supports your premise, but nowhere did I make any argument involving the ten commandments. \n \n \n The commandments forbidding murder and theft are are not exclusive to nor did they originate with the Judeo-Christian religion. \n \n Ditto\n \n Fortunately for the country, Patrick Henry, who indeed pushed, with others, for America to be more of a Christian nation, was on the losing side when it came to drawing up its bedrock precepts in the Constitution. \n \n \"Fortunately\" is a matter of opinion. It is a simple matter for you to sit smug behind your computer and declare unequivocally what someone who lived 200 years in the past had in mind. All one has to do is read the writings and arguments of what transpired at the convention. \n \n And why does HIS statement override what those who were on the winning side--the PRIMARY fathers of this country-- said about themselves? I'm supposed to buy what one statement from Henry says instead of the myriad quotes from and about Jefferson, Madison, Washington, Franklin, Paine, Adams?? Talk about torturous semantic convolutions! \n \n \n WAS such a statement made above? Paine was a Deist and ran afoul of even Jefferson. Jefferson had his own bible and Madison, Washington, Franklin, and Adams were by no means the personalities you can invite into your bed. \n \n The principal founders of this country were DEISTS. They called themselves Deist, their contemporaries as well as modern-day historians refer to them as Deists, the overwhelming preponderance of evidence from their writings support the claim. And it was THEY, not Patrick Henry, who shaped this nation.\n \n Since you make the claim then I make the challenge: I want you to list each of the 'founding fathers' and next to their name list their religion. Deist or whatever. We will discuss it after you substantiate your claim.\n \n They were proud about having kept religion out of government, having seen what had happened in other countries. It was deliberate on their part and they constantly patted themselves on the back afterwards for having done so.\n \n Really? Again you make assumptions and pat yourself on the back for making them. What you totally fail to comprehend is that the 13 colonies, even Rhode Island, had religious charters. They were made up of religious people. It is amusing that you make the entendre about what the founding fathers \"saw in other countries\" when the settlers on this continent settled here for the specific purpose of escaping the state controlled Anglican church in England. You see the end results, but the actuality of the matter is that the representatives of the various colonies carried the express wishes of the individual colonies, that in creating a central government the founders would not create a central church. This is exactly what Thomas Jefferson was addressing when he wrote that single and obscure letter describing 'a wall of separation.' It was never a question of Christianity, it was a matter of Church. \n \n Please explain why using the very clear phrase in the Treaty of Tripoli is a \"semantical\" argument. How is it not a fact?\n \n \n The sentence that you and other liberals love to draw upon means nothing but our government isn't a theocracy &#8212; not that the Christian principles of the Bible aren't its foundation.\n \n That treaty, written in Arabic, was translated for the Senate and President Adams by Joel Barlow. The following from the Yale Law School Web site may enlighten our liberal friends. There IS NO Article 11 and this is a FACT:\n \n \"... the Barlow translation is at best a poor attempt at a paraphrase or summary of the sense of the Arabic ... Most extraordinary ... is the fact that Article 11 of the Barlow translation, with its famous phrase, 'the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion,' does not exist at all. There is no Article 11. The Arabic text which is between Articles 10 and 12 is in form a letter, crude and flamboyant and withal quite unimportant, from the Dey of Algiers to the Pasha of Tripoli. How that script came to be written ... as Article 11 ... is a mystery and seemingly must remain so.\"\n \n (Found under \"Note regarding the Barlow translation\" (avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/ bar1796n.asp#n3).) \n \n And sorry but quoting a few words in SCOTUS decisions from two obscure rulings from two centuries ago does not constitute a precedent. THAT is a semanical and not an intellectual argument.\n \n I certainly commend you for arguing your premise in the face of irrefutable evidence, but have at it. \n Any Supreme Court decision establishes a premise . What do you presume to call it? To my knowledge, there are no 'obscure' Supreme Court decisions, and attempting to minimize them is disingenuity. I will leave it at that.\n \n \n Explain how these Supreme Court decisions jibe with this being a \"Christian nation\": \n \n I will be happy to do so, however, I doubt you will jive with the jibe: Only when liberals and others began attacking established precedents to push their unlegislated culture attacks did the Supreme Court turn from a court interpreting the Constitution into a court legislating political correctness into the Constitution. The constitution makes no statement at all of the 'separation of church and state', and contrary to the founders intentions that no state church would be established in the central government, pundits made it to claim that the founders intended that the church not be involved in government. This is one of liberals most blatant lies of all time.",

   "Google it, TQ, Google it! We are not page boys here.\n\n In other words, TQ, he can't tell you. It is a question that christians can't answer because those so called \"christian principles\" aren't in the Constitution.\n \nA quick one is the freedom of worship without meddling by the state.\n\n Ridiculous. The christians wanted to establish a state religion, supported by taxing everyone. That was the case in many of the Colonies. That was the case in Virginia until just before the Constitutional Convention. The position of vestryman was a civil position even more than it was religious. The christians tried to make their religion required. Just study Massachusetts where those who disagreed were banished, imprisoned, or killed.\n \nAll the various liberties listed in the Declaration of Independence.\n\n First, that isn't a founding document. Perhaps you should look up the meaning of the words in \"Declaration of Independence.\" That document did not form a government.\n \n You might also notice that it says that it is \"Nature\" and \"Nature's God\" that entitles the US to independence. That isn't the christian god. It is specifically the Deist god. You could tell if you were actually familiar with phrases used by deists. They used phrases like \"Merciful Providence,\" \"Divine Goodness,\" \"Supreme Being,\" \"Supreme Ruler of the world,\" \"Heaven,\" \"Providence,\" \"The Grand Architect,\" \"the Deity,\" and \"the Great Ruler of Events.\" Washington used the last 5. Washington didn't use \"Lord,\" \"Savior,\" \"Redeemer,\" and he did not once mention Jesus in his private papers. Funny that.\n \n Also notice that it is a \"decent respect to the opinions of mankind\" that compells the Declaration. Not a respect of god.\n \n Further, you also no doubt ignored the fact that the truths mentioned and that you claim to be christian are not revealed in scripture or told to us by Jesus. No. Those truths are self evident. That isn't a christian principle. Christianity is revealed by god in scripture.\n \n Just a little knowledge of christianity makes one aware that \"all men are created equal\" is not a christian tenet. Christians had kings, nobility, serfs and slaves. Elizabeth is, by the grace of god, queen.\n \n Of course, even stupid people know that the right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" has nothing to do with christianity. Christians never were shy about killing and imprisoning anyone who disagreed. The English even burned Joan of Arc at the stake because she was the wrong kind of christian. It was the humanists of the enlightenment formulated those ideas. A right to life and liberty is taken directly from Locke - not a christian.\n \nAll the various listings in the Bill of Rights, etc.\n\n Where does the Bill of Rights say so? There is nothing in the Bill of Rights that was historically a christian principle. Before the U. S. was founded, religion was the government. That's why heresy was a civil crime in most of the christian world. That's why the government burned people at the stake because the church said so.\n \nThe rest you can find out for yourself if you are really interested.\n\n But that's the point. We can't find those chrisitian principles. Well, except for the approval of slavery that is explicitly stated in the Constitution. That is undoubtedly a christian principle.\n \nAnd I am still waiting for someone to argue facts.\n\n I notice that you invent quotes and argue what is obviously not true. How is that arguing facts?\n \n Now that you have failed to show us the christian principles, are you going to admit you were wrong, or are you going to quote where in the Constitution does it mention christian principles and where does it say that they are christian principles?",

That's what I said. It is a christian invention. It shouldn't be necessary since Patrick Henry was a christian, which is why he opposed the Constitution. Are you still suggesting that Patrick Henry went by his own personal standards and not those of whom he represented?\n \n But you are putting up lies. You have a very narrow definition of 'lie' when it comes to those who try to re-write US history. If it is your modus operandi to call those whom you disagree with a liar in order to try for the higher 'moral' ground, you are sadly unbalanced. YOU call a 'lie' that page after web page lists it as possible but not substantiated. Your modus operandi appears to be to put a high bar for anything Christian and subscribe anything below it as a lie and anything that meets the bar as contrived. Don't you presume in calling me a liar. \n \n Please cite the exact Article and section of the Constitution where it says so. No doubt you have pulled this one time after time. Looks good on paper, but factually it is so shallow as to be surreal.\n \n Spoken like a true christian. If you don't like the evidence, deny that it exists. Suddenly the Treaty of Tripoli doesn't exist. But that doesn't work. Article 11 of the version that was ratified by the Senate (without a dissenting vote) and signed by Adams begins, \"As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion...\" Like it or not. That's what it says. It was not said that the Treaty of Tripoli does not exist. Simply the question of article 11. It has been debated pro and con ad nauseam and I am not going to waste time on it here.  Those who cite the Treaty of Tripoli as evidence that this nation was not founded on the Christian religion, usually ignore the Treaty of Paris of 1783. This Treaty, negotiated by Ben Franklin and John Adams among others, is truly a foundational document for the United States, because by this Treaty Britian recognized the independence of the United States. The Treaty begins with the words, \"In the Name of the most holy and undivided Trinity... ,\" and there is no dispute about its validity or its wording. \n \n Actually, the disputed Article 11 says the government of the United States is not founded upon the Christian religion. Which it is NOT. The government is not the nation, and the government of the United States is not the same as the state and local governments. In adopting the First Amendment, the Founders clearly intended that there be no established religion at the national level, but they left the states free to have their own establishments. A primary reason for the adoption of the First Amendment establishment clause was the different establishments at the state level -- Congregationalists in New England, Anglicans in the South, Baptists in Rhode Island, Catholics in Maryland, Quakers in Pennsylvania, etc. The statement in article 11 is not categorically false in and of itself. The statement does not directly contradict my understanding that the United States was founded upon Biblical values that were brought to America largely by Christians. http://www.tektonics.org/qt/tripoli.html\n \n Did either of you bother to read the Constitution? Since Jefferson was talking about the 1st Amendment, and since the 1st Amendment says that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" I think that is is pretty clear to all but christians what Jefferson was talking about. I'm sure that your claims of glory are greatly exagerated. But since it's not even relevant to the topic, who cares what self glory you invent anyway. Very nice try. Apparently the Danbury Baptists and Jefferson were on the same page so you need to contrive a better argument here.\n \n I did not such thing. Further, this has nothing to do with liberal or conservative. It has more to do with lying christians who make up quotes (as you seem to have done) and then swear to them. More small minded ad-hominem. Tell me, are you employing this here to disguise your shallowness or is this your normal everyday persona? You do not know if 'lying Christians' made up that quote you noted above, but it's what you prefer, but it's nothing beyond your opinion. I agreed that the quote was not verifiable, then you turn around and call me a liar. I'm not going to stoop to your level, I will finish this thing and I'm done.\n \n You seem to have difficulty concentrating. What are you talking about? Exactly what it says.\n \n No kidding. You have to wander in order to confuse the issue so no one will notice that you don't know what you are talking about and are inventing most of it anyway. LOL! Another put down. I think I will go back and count' em.\n \n More clap trap. Where in the Constitution does it say that this is a christian nation? Where is god mentioned? Where is Jesus mentioned? Can't show me? I thought not.\n Of course, not and you know that it's not on the paper. But the irony is lost on you.\n \n You liberals try to project the government of colonial times to be the same as the vision of government you have today, which actually was just the opposite of your stunted vision. You cannot even come near making your point when taking into consideration the various local and state governments all whom were Christian except for possibly Rhode Island. It's very convenient for your to ignore exactly why there is not mention of God in the constitution and it is specifically because the people DID NOT WANT IT THERE! You people cannot see past the ends of your noses. Bottom line, you have a case when focusing on the US Constitution all by itself and nothing more. It is very convenient and you need not have any schooling in US history beyond that you were taught in grade school.\n \n Before this ends, answer me one question, I raised the issue of the 'evolving constitution' because such is the only way you liberals can even enter into the dabate: On the issue of abortion, would Jefferson have agreed that that is what the signers intended to cover when they put in that clause? YES or NO.\n \n There is no way you can answer in the affirmative, and such answer is basically your entire playing field with regards to the establishment of this nation.",

The Jefferson Bible (which can be read on line in its entirety, by the way) is a whittled down version of the Gospels that eliminates every miracle, prophecy, and supernatural event... including (and especially including) the Resurrection\n \n Jefferson believed Jesus existed, and was a wise and benificent philosopher who preached many worthwhile things the world would be a much better place for following (none of which, I observe, are followed by the self-aggrandizing \"Christians\" on this board, who seem to a man to derive more pleasure playing snotty, hate-thy-neighbor Pharisees). That's as far as it went. The only time he referred to himself as a \"Christian\" was in THAT sense. \n \n He did NOT believe in the Resurrection, the Virgin Birth, burning bushes, wine into water, or any of the other magic tricks imagined by the authors of the NT, which is why in his lifetime he was often (though incorrectly) accused of being an atheist.\n \n Sorry, bub, but if you don't believe in that stuff in no way are you a Christian, any more than you're a secular humanist if you do.\n \n (Possibly knowing this was a losing argument, the PIQ\\'s subsequent attempts to badmouth or denigrate Jefferson\\'s influence on this country\\'s early development have more than a whiff of desperation about them... but maybe it\\'s just me.\n And now I retire to the user CP for a quick update to the Ignore List.

   "Oh... there's also this (boldface and comments in brackets mine): \n \n America a Christian Nation?\n \n \nDavid Barton [ah, our old dissembling friend again] and others of the Religious right claim that the Supreme Court determined that the United States was a Christian nation in the 1892 case, Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U.S. 226 (1892). Unfortunately, their thesis and the analysis of the case that accompanies it amounts to little more than a manipulation of the language of the opinion [iow, \"torturous semantics\"] to distort the actual meaning of the case, its relevant facts and its stated rule of law. \n \n The facts of Holy Trinity concerned the application of an Act of Congress titled \"An act to prohibit the importation and migration of foreigners and aliens under contract or agreement to perform labor in the Unites States, its Territories and the District of Columbia.\" Holy Trinity Church, a church located in the city of New York, contracted with a minister in England to perform services as rector and pastor at its church. At issue in the case was whether or not the church's action violated the Act which prohibited \"any person, company, partnership, or corporation ... to assist or encourage the importation or migration of any alien ... under contract or agreement ... to perform labor or service of any kind in the United States.\" \n \n The holding of Holy Trinity was based on an interpretation of the purpose of the Act. The Court concluded that the purpose of the Act was to prohibit the importation of foreign unskilled persons to perform manual labor and manual services. A christian minister, the Court reasoned, is a \"toiler of the brain,\" not a manual laborer; Holy Trinity Church, therefore, was found not to have violated the Act when it secured a contract for the holy man's employment. \n \n The rationale in Holy Trinity contains several different parts. First the court discusses how it came up with the idea that the purpose of the Act was to slow down or stop the importation of cheap, unskilled manual laborers which might compete with American unskilled laborers for jobs. The Court says the title of the Act implies its meaning, that only the importation of \"laborers\" will be restricted. The Court then turns to the legislative history, debates, and comments of the Congressmen involved in drafting the Act to conclude that the Act was designed to regulate the domestic unskilled, labor market. \n \n Justice Brewer then writes in the opinion that \"beyond all these matters no purpose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation, state or national, because this is a religious people.\" Several pages later, after presenting a religious history of America, he follows up with the statement: \"These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation.\" Barton splices together these two quotes and cites Holy Trinity as establishing America as a Christian Nation. \n \n To understand whether this last part of the Court's rationale establishes anything at all, it is necessary to first understand that an opinion written by the Supreme Court contains several different parts. The holding of the case establishes the rule of law as decided on by the court and as it relates specifically to the facts of the case. The rationale of the case contains the different reasons why the Court decided a case the way that it did. Contained within these reasons can be comments by the Court which do not have any bearing on the specific rule of law and are not binding on future cases with similar facts. These non-essential comments are called dictum, and unlike the holding of the case, dictum carries no precedential value. The essential comments, or the holding, becomes precedent which can then be applied to subsequent cases with similar facts. \n \n In the case of Holy Trinity the essential comments made by the Court concern the scope of an immigration law. The rule was that the Act did not prohibit foreign \"toilers\" of the brain from accepting employment in this country. The foreign-born professional worker, doctor, lawyer, businessman, or clergyman, would be able to use the rule in Holy Trinity and the rationale regarding the purpose of the Act to support his claim for employment in America. Consider the \"absurd\" result if a doctor from Russia at the turn of the century were to state that he could be hired by an American hospital because Holy Trinity stood for the proposition that \"this is a Christian nation.\" It would not make sense for such a person to cite the dictum concerning America's religiosity as a reason for allowing him access to the American job market. \n \n Whether or not America was a Christian Nation was not even at issue in Holy Trinity. The actual dispute or controversy the Court had to decide had nothing at all to do with religion. The parties in Holy Trinity did not question whether the Immigration Act's purpose was \"for or against religion\" generally or specifically. So when Brewer begins his religious history lesson with, \"no purpose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation, state or national, because this is a religious people,\" he refers to no particular statute, no particular actor. He has moved outside the actual facts of this case and the statute at issue to address the vague application of general principles to law in general. His statements, therefore, create no rule of law, and provide no useful precedent for future legal disputes. As any basic Legal Research textbook will confirm, the legal researcher will not find precedent in such language, but must look for \"the [legal] rules stated by courts [which] are tied to specific fact situations\" (The Fundamentals of Legal Research, 1994, Jacobstein et al, page 6). \n \n Brewer's comments about religion are not tied to any of the facts as presented in Holy Trinity. The Holy Trinity Church did not allege in the facts of its case that the purpose of the Act was to discriminate against a particular religion nor that it was designed to prevent the members of their church from the free exercise of their religion. Since none of the facts suggested that the clergyman was being kept out of the country for the purpose of discriminating against religion or prohibiting religious exercise, the dictum by Brewer addresses no controversy and crafts no rule of law to be applied to other cases as precedent. \n \n Holy Trinity's legacy includes a number of Supreme Court cases which cite the opinion as support for either statutory construction based on legislative intent or the use of immigration policy to exclude or include immigrants. Only on three occasions does the Holy Trinity christian nation dictum make an appearance in a Supreme Court case. \n \n In the 1931 case of U.S. v. Macintosh, an ordained baptist minister was denied naturalization because he was unwilling to take an oath to bear arms in defense of the country unless he believed the war necessitating the defense to be morally justified. As in Holy Trinity, the legal rule established by this case had nothing to do with the christian nation quote. Instead, the applicant was denied citizenship based on a reading of the naturalization statute which required the oath. \n \n However, in Macintosh dictum, Justice Sutherland writes, \"We are a Christian people, according to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledging with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God.\" Sutherland then states that as a nation we must assume that obedience to our laws is \"not inconsistent with the will of God;\" therefore, a foreign-born person refusing to follow the naturalization statute to the letter would be denied citizenship. \n \n There are a couple interesting notes about Macintosh. First, in Holy Trinity, Brewer uses the phrase \"we are a christian nation\" to allow a foreign-born minister access to this country. In Macintosh, it is used to keep a foreign-born ordained minister out. Second, a different result would most likely have occurred had this case arisen after World War II when the court overturned the Macintosh line of cases (Girouard, 1946). \n \n The other two cases which cite Holy Trinity's christian nation dictum are Marsh v. Chambers (1982), and Lynch v. Donnelly (1983). Brennan writes dissents in both cases and uses the Brewer verbiage to criticize the majority's use of history to support legislative prayer and a government sponsored creche. In the creche case, (Lynch), Brennan writes, \"By insisting that such a distinctively sectarian message is merely an unobjectionable part of our 'religious heritage,' the Court takes a long step backwards to the days when Justice Brewer could arrogantly declare for the Court that 'this is a Christian nation.' Those days, I had thought, were forever put behind us ....\" \n",

   "Thank you, MrwriteLA, but it is apparently a revisionist opinion you post, same goes to pandion's claim of dicta. It was NOT dicta:\n \n First, the statement is not \"dicta,\" and second, even if it were, it could still be a legally binding precedent.\n \n As pandion noted: \"Dicta\" is a personal comment by a judge in his opinion which is a digression from the matter before the court. The phrase refers to short statements which are \"not upon the point or question pending, as if turning aside for the time from the main topic of the case to collateral subjects.\"\n Rohrbach v. Ins Co. 62 NY 47, 58 See Black's Law Dictionary.\n \n The line about America being a Christian nation is the central support for the Court's holding, and is thus not \"dicta.\" It is not a \"short\" digression; it occupies fully half of the Court's opinion.\n \n Background: In the Holy Trinity case, Congress passed an anti-immigration statute. Certain vocations were explicitly exempted from the law (\"among them professional actors, artists, lecturers, singers, and domestic servants\" [143 U.S. 457, 459] ), but not preachers. The Church of the Holy Trinity hired an Englishman as their pastor, and the INS goons attempted to keep them from having a pastor based on this law. The Supreme Court held that because this is a Christian nation, the law could not be applied against Churches.\n \n In PUBLIC CITIZEN v. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 491 U.S. 440 (1989), JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, concurring in the judgment, wrote:\n \n The Church of the Holy Trinity entered into a contract with an alien residing in England to come to the United States to serve as the director and pastor of the church. Notwithstanding the fact that this agreement fell within the plain language of the statute, which was conceded to be the case, see ibid., the Court overrode the plain language, drawing instead on the background and purposes of the statute to conclude that Congress did not intend its broad prohibition to cover the importation of Christian ministers. The central support for the Court's ultimate conclusion that Congress did not intend the law to cover Christian ministers is its lengthy review of the \"mass of organic utterances\" establishing that \"this is a Christian nation,\" and which were taken to prove that it could not \"be believed that a Congress of the United States intended to make it a misdemeanor for a church of this country to contract for the services of a Christian minister residing in another nation.\" Id., at 471.\n \n That 'dicta' was obviously binding precedent........notwithstanding anyones protestations to the contrary......",

   "And a response to ALL you others who make presumptions upon others intelligence:\n \n Premise: If a Christian republic had been the goal of\n the framers, that sentiment would have been included in the Constitution. \n \n This is erroneous, and fails to appreciate the dynamics of federalism and ecclesiastical competition at the time the Constitution was framed. Every state constitution was Christian. They were jealous of their rights. Any mention of religion in the federal constitution would have been perceived as an establishment of one of the rival denominations, and could have jeopardized its ratification. It's too bad the clergy had to be so competitive that they could not agree on a simple statement of faith, but that is the reality, not a desire to create a God-less nation. \n \n I will not accuse you guys of not having the intelligence to appreciate the point noted, although some of you have stated thus of myself, rather it is your ingrained ideology which simply allows you to slough off any premise at odds with your opinion.\n \n As is the same thing in the politics of the left today, the thinking is that the more often something is said, it will hopefully become true.

   "One more chance, try again:\n \n By a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Holy Trinity Church v. U.S., 143 U.S. 457 (1892) declared in the Opinion written for the Court by Mr. Justice Brewer, that \"These and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation.\"\n \n\n \n Exactly. Here's more from that court case.:\n \n Justice Brewer, who delivered the opinion of the Court, gave the basis for the Court's conclusion (that America was a Christian nation):\n \n This is a religious people. This is historically true. From the discovery of this continent to the present hour, there is a single voice making this affirmation. The commission to Christopher Columbus ... [recited] that \"it is hoped that by God's assistance some of the continents and islands in the ocean will be discovered . . . .\" The first colonial grant made to Sir Waiter Raleigh in 1584... and the grant authorizing him to enact statutes for the government of the proposed colony provided that \"they be not against the true Christian faith . . . .\" The first charter of Virginia, granted by King James I in 1606 . . . commenced the grant in these words: \" . . . in propagating of Christian Religion to such People as yet live in Darkness . . . . Language of similar import may be found in the subsequent charters of that colony . . . in 1609 and 1611; and the same is true of the various charters granted to the other colonies. In language more or less emphatic is the establishment of the Christian religion declared to be one of the purposes of the grant. The celebrated compact made by the Pilgrims in the Mayflower, 1620, recites: \"Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and advancement of the Christian faith . . . a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia . . . . The fundamental orders of Connecticut, under which a provisional government was instituted in 1638-1639, commence with this declaration: \" ... And well knowing where a people are gathered together the word of God requires that to maintain the peace and union . . . there should be an orderly and decent government established according to God . . . to maintain and preserve the liberty and purity of the gospel of our Lord Jesus which we now profess . . . of the said gospel [which] is now practiced amongst us.\" In the charter of privileges granted by William Penn to the province of Pennsylvania, in 1701, it is recited: \" ... no people can be truly happy, though under the greatest enjoyment of civil liberties, if abridged of. . . their religious profession and worship . . . . Coming nearer to the present time, the Declaration of Independence recognizes the presence of the Divine in human affairs in these words: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights . . . appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions . . . \"; \"And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\" \n \n The Court continued with example after example, citing portions from the forty-four state constitutions (the number of states in 1892), using many of the same excerpts given in this book in earlier chapters. The Court's historical discourse continued for several pages until finally summarizing its findings:\n \n There is no dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal language pervading them all, having one meaning; they affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not individual sayings, declarations of private persons: they are organic utterances; they speak the voice of the entire people. While because of a general recognition of this truth the question has seldom been presented to the courts, yet we find that in Updegraph v. The Commonwealth, it was decided that, \"Christianity, general Christianity, is, and always has been, a part of the common law . . . not Christianity with an established church . . . but Christianity with liberty of conscience to all men.\" And in The People v. Ruggles, Chancellor Kent, the great commentator on American law, speaking as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New York, said: \"The people of this State, in common with the people of this country, profess the general doctrines of Christianity, as the rule of their faith and practice. . . . We are a Christian people, and the morality of the country is deeply engrafted upon Christianity, and not upon the doctrines or worship of those impostors [other religions]. \"And in the famous case of Vidal v. Girard's Executors, this Court . . . observed: \"It is also said, and truly, that the Christian religion is a part of the common law ....\" These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation. \n \n Church of the Holy Trinity v U.S\n \n And nothing about the liberal's supposedly ubiquitous deism.

The founding fathers expressed it as follows: \"As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion...\" You see, that phrase comes from Article 11 of the Treaty of Tripoli.

You are desperate, and what you think has no basis of fact, but is nothing but biased opinion. The justices themselves put your remarks to shame In PUBLIC CITIZEN v. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 491 U.S. 440 (1989), JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, concurring in the judgment, wrote:\n \n The Church of the Holy Trinity entered into a contract with an alien residing in England to come to the United States to serve as the director and pastor of the church.

You invoke obiter dictum, yet the EVERSON v. BOARD OF EDUCATION OF EWING TP., 330 U.S. 1 (1947) set the stage for the secular humanists to rely far more on dictum for their subsequent church-state crusade. You, on the other hand, prefer to have it both ways, took 170 years for them to finally have their day and they have gone at it with a vengeance since that time. \n \n \n Moreover, how did a Justice of the Supreme Court in 1892 determine the intent of the founding fathers. Nice try, but Brewer&#8217;s &#8216;dictum&#8217;, his meaningless opinion, made up HALF of the SCOTUS finding, it represents the entire court unanimously, has been used as a precedent by a later court and is legitimately so notwithstanding your protestations to the contrary.\n \n It would be a better idea to listen to the founding fathers themselves. None ever expressed the desire to found a christian nation, except for christians who are claimed by christians to be founding fathers even though they opposed the ratification of the Constitution. You are as bad as some of those ACORN vote counters niggling over whose vote is legitimate or should be thrown out. It is of no consequence whom you claim are &#8216;founding fathers&#8217;, but for a common agreement, the starting point is the signers. History determines whom the founding fathers were and since you people have been in the process of re-writing history since 1947, naturally you have a completely different picture. It is generally accepted by historians that there were three deists within the signers.\n \n The founding fathers expressed it as follows: \"As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion...\" You see, that phrase comes from Article 11 of the Treaty of Tripoli. It was negotiated by Joel Barlow, a Deist and close friend of Thomas Paine and George Washington, under Washington's administration. The treaty was ratified without a dissenting vote by the Senate (many of whom could be considered founding fathers), and signed by John Adams. As was pointed out by MrWriteLA and myself previously, the christian quibble that this is a mistranslation of the Arabic text is meaningless.

And yet the christian nation nuts claim that a case from 1892 somehow sets a retroactive precedent. Yeah, right, the treaty was ratified unaminiously and with no public dissent noted. Reason states that that treaty was not at all what it appeared to be or all the so-called Christian dissidents and traitors had gone into hiding and their churches burned down. Moreover, several other treaties were negotiated within a few years later near identical to the first, but with no article 11. Did someone come to their senses?\n \n So it comes back to the christian nation zealots actually showing us where in the Constitution it says that this is a christian nation. Even Esdraelon recognizes the fact that the diversity of christian cults in the country made it impossible to found a nation with a state religion. But it seems strange that if the intent was to found the nation on even the most broad concepts that the thousands of christian cults hold in common, they would have said so. But did they even mention god? Did they even mention Jesus? Did they even mention christian principles? You are becoming more obvious each time you put down a word. christian nuts, christian zealots, christian cults. You liberals certainly have a way with words. Again, it was quite well understood up until 1947 what the constitution was all about and what kind of document it is. The fact of the matter is you don&#8217;t want want any discussion on the matter, if you fully mean to infer that Christians have ever wanted a state religion then you are completely ignorant of history or a flat out, unmitigated liar.\n \n The christian nation zealots have converted Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and J.Q. Adams to christianity. I think it was Esdraelon who even converted Franklin. Ludacris. It seems the only Deist they haven't converted was Thomas Paine, who they claim was an atheist, even though he was less so than Jefferson. Ah, Ludacris, that&#8217;s the rap guy eh? You words may have impact upon those too lazy to study history for themselves or those who hold to your particular opinion, however, no one has &#8216;converted&#8217; any founding fathers or signers to &#8216;christianity&#8217;, nor have I attempted to convert Franklin, simply noted that he never acclaimed himself a deist. Thomas Paine was a hard one to read, I don&#8217;t think he was an atheist, but likely was a deist. The founding fathers, even those who were deists believed in the same God as christians, so don&#8217;t hold your breath. \n \n The reason for all of this rabid argument, out of context quotes, unverified (invented) quotes, and misstatement by christian nation advocates is pretty simple. They need to justify the desire to impose their religion on everyone. They are not content with religious freedom (which they claim is a christian idea). They want to force christian prayer on all school children. They want to remove any idea with which they disagree from public school curriculum's. They want to teach their religion as science in our schools. That's why this is important to them. Unless this nation was founded as a christian nation on christian principles, then there is no christian nation as intended by the founding fathers to return to. The very idea justifies the lies and distortion. This whole passage here is something dribbling out of the south end of horse traveling north. You liberals and secular humanists have used this argument ad nauseum, ad infinitum. It is a completely unjustifiable lie as is most of the content used to support your premise. It is nothing more than the same character assassination and innuendo used in general politics by the left today.\n \n That is also why it is important to me. Except for this American Taliban attitude of christians, I wouldn't care. I am perfectly happy to let them practice their superstitious, magical beliefs. I don't want to be forced to do so by force of law, and I don't want my children to be taught religion in science classes (actually, that's my grandchildren). When the vice-presidential candidate of the Republican Party can declare that George Bush's invasion of Iraq was a mission from god, I know that this country is in great trouble.  It may be important to you, because the left needs someone to hate, and someone to be the bogey man. Someone to stir up the minions to keep the divisions up near 50% so they stand a chance in political elections. American Taliban attitude indeed. Only those so blinded by your own agenda and ideology fail to see through your farce.\n \n \n You liberals can be compared to a judge who will only allow two pieces of evidence into a trial in favor of premise, regardless of the realms of evidence to the contrary. In this case, the US Constitution and the Treaty of Tripoli. They rabidly latch onto that which appears to bear out their case at the exclusion (or attempted exclusion). All evidence to the contrary is steadfastly argued away or ignored. \n \n If the founding fathers could see exactly what the liberal secular humanists have done to the Constitution, doubtless they would call for tarring and feathering, and run our of town on a rail, or put in the block for a few months.",

   "more piles of horse pucky cut.\n\n So when it comes right down to it, you can't show where in the Constitution there are any christian principles, and you can't tell us what they are. Nor can you show that it was the intent of the founding fathers to found a christian nation. I did better than you. I found one of your christian principles in Article I Section 9: The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight.\"\n \n There is also Article I Section 2: \" which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.\"\n \n That is were it is specified how the number of Representatives will be determined. I wonder why it is that, if all people are equal under the christian principles of the Constitution, there is a difference between free men and others. Free men are counted as 1 person and other persons are counted as three fifths. There's christian principle of equality for you.\n \n By the way, the Constitution allowed slavery because it was a compromise that would make ratification more likely. You see, the puritanical northerners opposed slavery (because they couldn't make it work for them) while the christian landholders of the south wanted to keep their slaves. Slavery was a concession to the christians of the South. That's why the christian principle of slavery is in the Constitution.\n \n Perhaps you can point out the specific Article and section where other christian principles are mentioned. If you want to see an example of government founded on christian principles, you might look into Geneva under Calvin.

   "So when it comes right down to it, you can't show where in the Constitution there are any christian principles, and you can't tell us what they are. Nor can you show that it was the intent of the founding fathers to found a christian nation. I did better than you. I found one of your christian principles in Article I Section 9: The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight.\"\n \n There is also Article I Section 2: \" which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.\"\n \n That is were it is specified how the number of Representatives will be determined. I wonder why it is that, if all people are equal under the christian principles of the Constitution, there is a difference between free men and others. Free men are counted as 1 person and other persons are counted as three fifths. There's christian principle of equality for you.\n \n By the way, the Constitution allowed slavery because it was a compromise that would make ratification more likely. You see, the puritanical northerners opposed slavery (because they couldn't make it work for them) while the christian landholders of the south wanted to keep their slaves. Slavery was a concession to the christians of the South. That's why the christian principle of slavery is in the Constitution.\n \n Perhaps you can point out the specific Article and section where other christian principles are mentioned. If you want to see an example of government founded on christian principles, you might look into Geneva under Calvin. Then tell me about christian principles like right to life and liberty.\n \n You might try to educate yourself about the history of the country.

Not my case, mind you, but THE case. You don't have one, and I don't need You to show me anything, but thank you anyhow.\n \n The Constitution is a neutral document and was made so due to what you call the 'christian cults.' \n \n Stop beating a dead dog: The singers did not Make it a Christian country, it already was a Christian country. \n \n I have never once stated that the signers intended to create a Christian country. I have never stated that this was a Christian country by law. \n \n When I state that \"it was established\", I do so from the understanding of what government constitutes to a Christian and a Conservative, and that is the government is the people \"We The People\"...capische? The Constitution does NOT determine who the people are, what the people believe, nor anything pertaining to the people other than what the people allow the government to have. (At least this was the original intent). \n \n YOU, on the other hand, as a liberal secular humanist, see the government (Constitution) as making the people, making their identification, and setting a \n benchmark as to what the people are (nothing, per your argument)\n \n You continue to worry these 'christian precepts' like a dog shaking a dead squirrel. You won't find any in the Constitution other than those I gave you which you discarded. You really just don't have a clue or your are disingenuous. \n \n THIS COUNTRY WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE PEOPLE BY THE TOIL OFF THEIR BACK AND THE SWEAT OFF THEIR BROW AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT!\n \n Answer the previous response.",

The rest of your diatribe above does not even warrant the dignity of a response. &#8216;Disestablished&#8217;, indeed, about the same factual basis as your claim that only 8-15% of the population was Christian when the Constitution was signed.

Catholics represented 2% of the population in Colonial times so don&#8217;t ramble off on tangents.\n \n In Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Finland Lutheranism is the state religion. Again you make up a strawman and try to infer that the US was ever in danger of a state religion. The absurdity of your inferences are surreal.\n \n Of course, Anglicanism (Church of England) is the state religion in Great Britain. Another one....\n \n Of course there are other countries in which many of the people are christians (Germany, Poland, France, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Italy, Spain, Romania, etc.).

This is enough, you simply ramble from one inference into another with not the slightest backing to support yourself. It is so absurd it is becoming disgusting. Your ignorance of history is shocking and for your to imply any knowledge on the subject after putting out this tripe is beyond comprehension.\n \n Your attitude and ideology is exactly what the problem is in the political arena in this country today. There will never be any meeting of the minds when those like you on the left have completely lost theirs.\n \n So truly, the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion. The &#8216;government' for all intents and purposes obviously can be said to be secular, but notwithstanding your idiotic words like &#8216;repressive theocracy' and minimizing what may be minimized only in a minimal mind, this country was established as a Christian nation. I have read charters also, and you are bogus. Every single sentence you write has to be checked out for authenticity. \n \n This is by no means a &#8216;Christian nation&#8217; today, certainly not after the farce you people and your liberal activist secular humanist &#8216;judges&#8217; have made in the SCOTUS since 1947, and by the way, your &#8216;dictum&#8217; was a lie and shown to be a lie and you simply ignored it. You attempt to infer wisdom, but you exhibit absolutely no scholarship other than personal opinion and baseless inferences. If you want to pat yourself on the back, be my guest, but this &#8216;debate&#8217; is no debate, it is simply but a defense that has to be made when rats are undermining the foundation. \n \n The &#8216;foundation&#8217; is NOT the Constitution, it is simply a piece of paper, the foundation is the PEOPLE. That&#8217;s where my argument has been. THAT is the foundation of this country, and only a blind fool would claim otherwise.\n ",

   "Here's the Phiadelphia Daily News column that Olbermann refers to on his show: \nSay what you want about Glenn Beck, but do not dispute this: The man is enormously influential in the American political debate. Spend some time with any one of the new conserva-libertarians who've been getting so much face time since last spring -- the Tea Party, the 9/12 Project, or more extreme groups that are out there like the Oath Keepers -- and you'll often find that their activism traces back to Beck, whether it's something he said on his Fox News program or his radio show or the books that he's touted into best-sellers like the \"The 5000 Year Leap,\" an obscure Christian-oriented take on the Constitution and the Founding Fathers by a deceased John Birch-era right-winger that has sold by the truckload since it was Beck-endorsed.\n \n But now, with the 2010 elections approached, this bad boy behind blue eyes is actually planning to kick it up a notch. He's working on something called \"The Plan\" (which seems to involve a book, although I'm sure he's donating the profits back to \"the cause) that will be unveiled at what he hopes will be a massive rally on Aug. 28 at the Lincoln Memorial, on the 47th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King delivering his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at or about the same sport. But to work up to what he says will be a 100-year plan, Beck is starting out with a series of what he initially called \"educational seminars\" and he's now calling \"American Revival.\" This week, Beck divulged the lineup for the initial 8-hour (!) event in Orlando on March 27. So what's the bottom line on where Beck plans to lead his flock next?\n \n To parphrase Beck himself...fear for your country.\n \n It turns out that Beck's blueprint for America is deeply rooted in a Christian fundamentalist misinterpretation of American history, one that is built upon made-up quotes and bogus historical facts. What's more, while Beck seeks to portray himself as a libertarian -- remember, classic libertarianism includes abiding respect for the wall between church and state -- his kick-off speaker at his first \"American Revivial\" is a leading architect of the right-wing same-old, same-old, the close alliance between the Republican Party and Christian activists that helped bring us George W. Bush -- and our current mess. That speaker is Texas GOP activist and school-textbook corrupter David Barton.\n \n Here is Beck's announcement:\n It is an eight hour event. You and I on stage with three different experts. David Barton is going to be the first one and we're going to talk about the meaning of faith in America. All the lies that you have been told, that this isn't a nation of faith, that religion played no role. I'm you will be stunned when you learn and see the real history that is no longer taught.\n The real reason that history \"is no longer taught\" is because...it's bogus. Let's look at Barton -- who Texas Monthly called in a massive profile \"The King of the Christocrats\" -- and his track record.\n \n Barton is the founder of a Texas-based group called the WallBuilders, a foundation devoted to proving that the roots of the United States and its Constitution are not based on the separation of church of state -- as is widely believed and widely taught -- but as country built upon a bedrock of Christianity. That is also the premise of a widely circulated book that Barton published in the 1990s called \"The Myth of Separation\" -- a book that was eventually re-written and issued under a different name because it was larded with bad information, some of which nevertheless became gospel on conservative talk radio. As noted in the 2006 Texas Monthly article (via Nexis):\n In 1995 the historian Robert Alley attempted to trace the provenance of a quote that Rush Limbaugh had mistakenly attributed to James Madison, in which Madison purportedly called the Ten Commandments the foundation of American civilization. All roads led to David Barton, whose The Myth of Separation attributed the following quote to Madison: \"We have staked the whole future of American civilization, not upon the power of government, far from it. We have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self government; upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.\" Barton cited two sources for the quote: a 1939 book by Harold K. Lane called Liberty! Cry Liberty! and Frederick Nyneyer's 1958 book First Principles in Morality and Economics: Neighborly Love and Ricardo's Law of Association. Alley couldn't find the quote anywhere in Nyneyer's book, however, and eventually concluded that Barton had pulled it from an article in a journal with the unlikely title Progressive Calvinism, which, in turn, had attributed it to something called the \"1958 calendar of Spiritual Mobilization.\" In any case, Alley reported, the editors of Madison's papers were unable to find anything in his writings that was even remotely similar. \"In addition,\" they added, \"the idea is inconsistent with everything we know about Madison's views on religion and government, which he expressed time and time again in public and in private.\"There is a lot more fabrication or misinterpretation in Barton's writing. As noted by Rob Boston of the Americans United for Separation of Church of State, who for understandable reasons began tracking Barton in the 1990s:\n But Barton's biggest whopper concerns Thomas Jefferson, who coined the metaphor \"wall of separation between church and state.\" Jefferson used that phrase in an 1802 letter to the Danbury (Conn.) Baptist Association. According to Barton, Jefferson went on to add that the \"wall\" was meant to be \"one directional,\" protecting the church from the state but not the other way around, and, furthermore, that it was intended to keep \"Christian principles in government.\"\n \n This is a complete fabrication, and if Barton would take the time to actually read Jefferson's letter he would see that he is simply wrong. Jefferson's letter says nothing about the wall being \"one directional\" and certainly does not assert that it was meant to keep \"Christian principles\" in government. Such sentiments appear nowhere in the body of Jefferson's writings or speeches. In fact, they conflict sharply with our third president's well known advocacy of church-state separation and religious freedom.\n That's not all that he uncovered about David Barton:\n \n In 1991 Barton addressed the Rocky Mountain Bible Retreat of Pastor Pete Peters' Scriptures for America, a group that espouses the racist \"Christian Identity\" theology. Advocates of this bizarre dogma insist that white Anglo-Saxons are the \"true\" chosen people of the Bible and charge that today's Jews are usurpers. Aside from being a virulent anti-Semite, Peters has advocated the death penalty for homosexuals. According to the Anti-Defamation League, other speakers at the event included white supremacist leader and 1992 presidential candidate James \"Bo\" Gritz, a leader of the radical and increasingly violent militia movement, and Malcolm Ross, a Holocaust denier from Canada. In November of that same year, Barton spoke at Kingdom Covenant College in Grants Pass, Oregon, another \"Christian Identity\" front group with ties to Peters.\n \n Asked to explain these actions, Barton's reply amounted to a not very creative \"I didn't know they were Nazis\" dodge.\n \n Needless to say, none of these controversies derailed Barton's career as a rising star in either the evangelical movement or the Republican Party. In fact, for most of the 2000s, he served as vice chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, where he's also been a leading fundamentalist voice in that state's ever-raging debate over school textbooks. The national GOP hired Barton as a consultant in the 2004 election, and Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas said Barton's \"research provides the philosophical underpinning for a lot of the Republican effort in the country today - bringing God back into the public square.\"\n \n Indeed, his work rose to the level that a prominent critic assailed him in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, writing that Barton's \"pseudoscholarship would hardly be worth discussing, let alone disproving, were it not for the fact that it is taken so very seriously by so many people.\" The author of that piece was another U.S. senator -- Pennsylvania's Arlen Specter.\n \n Now Barton will be taken seriously by a lot more people, thanks to his new relationship with Glenn Beck. That is most unfortunate. His view of the Founding Fathers is completely at odds with the reality, which is that while many of architects of the Declaration of Independence had a personal belief in Christianity, the core founders including Madison and Jefferson believed profoundly in both freedom of religion and a government that would be free of religious influence. Indeed, that's one of the tenets that makes the American experience so unique, and why that experiment is now at risk -- threat from the likes of David Barton, his high-powered allies in the Republican Party, and now Glenn Beck.\n \n Beck's alliance with Barton also undercuts some of his most-repeated claims of the last year, that he is a libertarian placing a pox on both political parties, or that he wants to steer his massive following in a new direction for America. This in fact shows that his \"100-year plan\" for the nation would set us back more than 234 years, before the time when brave men imagined a nation where people would be free to worship all religions, or no religion. The Beck-Barton plan is a dangerous idea -- but given what we've learned about Beck's influence over the last year, it is also something that is too dangerous to ignore.\nGlenn Beck's plan to save America...with Christian-right pseudohistory | Philly | 02/09/2010",

Like Newton most certainly was not, Locke may not have been a trinitarian. Historian Stephen D. Snobelen says of Newton, \"Isaac Newton was a heretic. But like Nicodemus, the secret disciple of Jesus, he never made a public declaration of his private faith - which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unravelling his personal beliefs.\" Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a Socinian sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an Arian and almost certainly an antitrinitarian. In an age notable for its religious intolerance there are few public expressions of Newton's radical views, most notably his refusal to take holy orders and his refusal, on his death bed, to take the sacrament when it was offered to him. (Wiki) Also could you post your definition of &#8216;religious liberal&#8217; Both Newton and Locke were resistant to the Catholic as were those who became Protestant.

Nowhere at no time did any christian state recognize a right to life and liberty if one disagreed with the local christian cult. You are juxtaposing Christianity with the religious state. Yeah, right, per Roman Catholicism, RC was the state religion of Europe, and got rich off its thieving of the common people. Protestants left Europe, England in particular due to the Anglican church. &#8220;Local Christina cult&#8217; just keep it up as you a re proving that you have an innate bias and very little credibility.\n \n The \"Pilgrims\" didn't come here to establish freedom of religion for everyone.

The Salem trials were hysteria and if you presume to put up falsehoods, then it&#8217;s your responisbility to back it up. Links please to substantiate that the Pilgrims did not believe in religious freedom.\n \n On the other hand, most settlers of this continent did not come here for religious reasons. That is true, but life in the New World was extremely difficult, there were no roads, houses, government or farms. Those who tried to settle in America knew that they were risking their lives. Many did come here for economic reasons, but so what, they were Christians. Nevertheless, since the charters were granted by the King (another christian principle of equality), most colonies had state religions that had vicious laws for punishment for failure to conform. The King OWNED the New World, per se, according to English law. It was required that he and only had the authority to grant charters.....It is fortunate that the laws were not enforced very often, and then usually for political reasons There was no &#8216;fortunance&#8217; involved because the majority of christians in the colonies werer totally against state church and would no allow it. There were some colonies granted to those who still followed the Church of England, but were not allowed to put that principle into application. Your ignorant, demeaning, and disingenuous tirade is simply to mislead the ignorant. Those are the christian principles of the settling of this nation - economic gain and religious oppression. Links please, and dispense with any of your &#8216;atheist&#8217; links, they are already biased, as you claim links by Christian authors are.\n \n But it has already been admitted that this nation was not founded on christian principles. There is nothing to 'admit&#8217; as far as I am concerned. It was always Christian, as I have explained above.Yeah, right, you were shown up and now taking a different tact.

Of course they were rationalists, because their Christianity WAS a rational matter to them. That's the way it often works--it's only been a mostly modern unfounded premise of agnostics/atheists today that can't stomach the idea of religion and rationalism being compatible (if not downright complimentary!). With all the religious scientists, history clearly doesn't bear out that supposed incompatibility. It's just a form of elitist bigotry that takes such a position that one isn't a part of the other. If the devoutly religious Newton had lived TODAY instead, liberal skeptics would be treating him like they treat any religious-scientist nowadays--pretty much with scorn. Because in their thinking--'religion ain't reasonable', and therefore they've started with a prejudice before any conclusions.\n \n Indeed, many of our founders were not Christians in an orthodox sense. Many were deists or others outright non-believers, if you will. Like many here, I'm not comfortable with the phrase \"Christian nation\" either. But let's be straightforward here--they DID make an effort to be TOLERANT toward Christianity and religion in general. That's where the real Jefferson and the so-called rationalists of today (who seem to think they're modern-day Jeffersonians) have parted ways on a fundamental level: I don't recall reading the founding fathers going out of their way to argue down religion and belittle it at any opportunity they could get. I think Jefferson would be rolling in his grave at the sterilizing brand of so-called rationalism that we see nowadays which really has little tolerance for religious belief anywhere. The founders didn't wear a determination to oppose religion on their sleeves; they had plenty of tolerance for the fact there were other ideas out there that they didn't agree with. So while it wasn't truly founded on religion, luckily, our country also wasn't founded on what so-called \"enlightened\" thinking has come to be in THIS day and time.",

   "\"In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\" - Romans Chapter 1\n\n \n \n PASSAGE 4\n ROMANS 1:26-27\n NATURAL AND UNNATURAL\n \n What does Romans 1:26-27 say about God?\n \n For our discussion, this is the most controversial biblical passage of them all. In Romans 1:26-27 the apostle Paul describes non-Jewish women who exchange \"natural use for unnatural\" and non-Jewish men who \"leave the natural use of women, working shame with each other.\"\n \n This verse appears to be clear: Paul sees women having sex with women and men having sex with men, and he condemns that practice. But let's go back 2,000 years and try to understand why.\n \n Paul is writing this letter to Rome after his missionary tour of the Mediterranean. On his journey Paul had seen great temples built to honor Aphrodite, Diana, and other fertility gods and goddesses of sex and passion instead of the one true God the apostle honors. Apparently, these priests and priestesses engaged in some odd sexual behaviors -- including castrating themselves, carrying on drunken sexual orgies, and even having sex with young temple prostitutes (male and female) -- all to honor the gods of sex and pleasure.\n \n The Bible is clear that sexuality is a gift from God. Our Creator celebrates our passion. But the Bible is also clear that when passion gets control of our lives, we're in deep trouble.\n \n When we live for pleasure, when we forget that we are God's children and that God has great dreams for our lives, we may end up serving the false gods of sex and passion, just as they did in Paul's time. In our obsession with pleasure, we may even walk away from the God who created us -- and in the process we may cause God to abandon all the great dreams God has for our lives.\n \n Did these priests and priestesses get into these behaviors because they were lesbian or gay? I don't think so. Did God abandon them because they were practicing homosexuals? No. Read the text again.\n \n In our Soulforce video, There's a Wideness in God's Mercy, the Rev. Dr. Louis B. Smedes, a distinguished Christian author and ethicist, describes exactly how the Bible says these promiscuous priests and priestesses got into this mess. Once again it has nothing to do with homosexuality:\n \n SMEDES: \"The people Paul had in mind refused to acknowledge and worship God, and for this reason were abandoned by God. And being abandoned by God, they sank into sexual depravity.\"\n \n SMEDES: \"The homosexuals I know have not rejected God at all; they love God and they thank God for his grace and his gifts. How, then, could they have been abandoned to homosexuality as a punishment for refusing to acknowledge God?\"\n \n SMEDES: \"Nor have the homosexuals that I know given up heterosexual passions for homosexual lusts. They have been homosexual from the moment of their earliest sexual stirrings. They did not change from one orientation to another; they just discovered that they were homosexual. It would be unnatural for most homosexuals to have heterosexual sex.\"\n \n SMEDES: \"And the homosexual people I know do not lust after each other any more than heterosexual people do... their love for one another is likely to be just as spiritual and personal as any heterosexual love can be.\"\n \n Thank you, Dr. Smedes. (To get a copy of the video featuring Dr. Smedes, There's a Wideness in God's Mercy, visit Soulforce : Freedom for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People.)\n \n Getting to know a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender person of faith will help you realize that it is unreasonable (and unjust) to compare our love for each other to the rituals of the priests and priestesses who pranced around the statues of Aphrodite and Diana. Once again, I feel certain this passage says a lot about God, but nothing about homosexuality as we understand it.\n \n You'll also note that Romans 2 begins with \"Therefore, [referring to Romans 1], you have no excuse, whoever you are, when you judge others; for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself...\" Even after he describes the disturbing practices he has seen, Paul warns us that judging others is God's business, not ours.",

   "Nice try, Jazy. And straight from a pro-homosexual website. \n \n Idolatry certainly plays a major role in Romans Chapter One. Paul begins his writing by describing humanity's rebellion and decision to worship creation rather than the Creator. The pro-gay theorist seizes on this concept to prove that Paul's condemnation of homosexuality does not apply to him-he does not worship idols, he is a Christian. \n \n \"But,\" Schmidt cautions, \"Paul is not suggesting that a person worships an idol and decides therefore to engage in same-sex relations. Rather, he is suggesting that the general rebellion created the environment for the specific rebellion. A person need not bow before a golden calf to participate in the general human denial of God or to express that denial through specific behaviors.\"[85]\n \n A common sense look at the entire chapter bears this out. Several sins other than homosexuality are mentioned in the same passage:\n \n Fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers; backbiters, haters of God, disobedient to parents....

If verses 26-27 apply to people who commit homosexual acts in connection with idolatry, and thus homosexuals acts are not sinful if not committed in connection with idolatry, then the same must apply to verses 29-30 as well.\n \n Therefore, we must assume that fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness et al are also condemned by Paul only because they were committed by people involved in idolatry; they are permissible otherwise.\n \n Which is, of course, ridiculous. Like homosexuality, these sins are not just born of idol worship; they are symptomatic of a fallen state. If we are to say homosexuality is legitimate, so long as it's not a result of idol worship, then we also have to say these other sins are legitimate as well, so long as they, too, are not practiced as a result of idolatry.\n \n Responding to Pro-Gay Theology\n \n So Jazy, according to your logic, if gay sex sin is ok, then so are fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers; backbiters, haters of God, disobedient to parents....\n \n Is that what you're trying to tell us?",

I've already provided the scriptural support. \n \n Show me one God-approved gay sex scriptural passage in the entire Bible?\n \n \nAlso you need to establish that Paul, not God, is even referring to gays and doing so based on God's laws and not man's observations and erroneous conclusions of what God's laws are.\n \n\n \n You might want to read the following:\n \n Responding to Pro-Gay Theology\n \n The scriptural responses to gay theology are about half way down the webpage.\n \n Paul is not speaking nearly so subjectively in this passage. There is nothing in his wording to suggest he even recognized such a thing as a \"true\" homosexual versus a \"false\" one. He simply describes homosexual behavior as unnatural, no matter who it is committed by.\n \n His wording, in fact, is unusually specific. When he refers to \"men\" and \"women\" in these verses, he chooses the Greek words that most emphasize biology: arsenes and theleias. Both words are rarely used in the New Testament. When they do appear, they appear in verses meant to emphasize the gender of the subject, as in a male child (arsenes). In this context, Paul is very pointedly saying the homosexual behavior committed by these people was unnatural to them as males and females (arsenes and theleias ). He is not considering any such thing as sexual orientation. He is saying, in other words, that homosexuality is biologically unnatural-not just unnatural to heterosexuals, but unnatural to anyone.\n \n Additionally, the fact these men were \"burning in lust\" for each other makes it highly unlikely they were heterosexuals experimenting with homosexuality. Their behavior was born of an intense inner desire. Suggesting, as Boswell and Mollenkott do, that they were heterosexuals indulging in homosexual behavior requires unreasonable mental gymnastics.\n \n Besides which, if verses 26-27 condemn homosexual actions committed by people to whom they did not come naturally, but do not apply to people to whom those actions do come naturally, then does not consistency compel us to also allow the practices mentioned in verses 29-30-fornication, backbiting, deceit, etc.-so long as the people who commit them are people to whom they do come naturally?\n \n You're not going to be one of those pro-gay sex apologists or defenders, are you?",
