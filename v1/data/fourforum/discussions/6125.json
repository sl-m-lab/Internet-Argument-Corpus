   "... because God does not condemn\"\n \n That's a quote from a recent Swedish film but I like it anyway. I'm gonna give you another picture of what I think could be God's relation to man.\n \n Let's say I'm walking on a road near an open field. I see a small insect crawling on the road and I realize that this could be really dangerous for the insect since someone might step on it. So I pick it up. The insect gets scared as hell and tries its best to bite me but does not succeed. I throw the \"ungrateful bastard\" out in the field where it's much safer and walk on. \n \n It doesn't matter to me if the insect ever understand why I did what I did or if it ever thanks me. It doesn't matter that in fact it tried to hurt me cause I understand why it did this. Likewise God must understand our situation better than we do and therefore understand completely why we do what we do and thus not need any kind of please for mercy or thanks from us at all. \n \n The higher being helps the lower without any need for a reward, just because the higher being knows better and can see further. If there is a God he'll lift us up in any case, whatever we do. There are religions that put this idea forward and they make so much more sense to me than the Jewish/Christian/Muslim religion with its hate and revenge driven God. It is so obvious to anyone with half a brain that this religion (cause it is one religion with three names) comes originally from an ensalved people. \n \n A God that needs to punish... that's not an image of God that's an image of a powerful human being.",

There is no difference, 23for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement,[i] through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished- 26he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus. \n \n Cheers....",

There cannot be a subjective \"for me\" right and wrong because then it is no longer right and wrong but rather an opinion. to say there are no absolute moral right or wrongs is clearly displayed in all of humanity as inconsistent. All of humanity has a concept of right or wrong.\n\n \n Indeed, all societies in history have had a sense of a dividing line between right and wrong, but that line has been moved back and forth in different societies. This effect is mainly due to an extreme ideology taking hold for whatever reason, and if it persists, the generation brought up under the new ideology (mostly) wholly absorb its values.\n \n Consider the most obvious example, those Nazis who willingly participated in the Holocaust. Granted, we have many examples of people who were sickened by what they did, and commited those crimes out of fear, but there were also a great many of them who believed it was the right thing to do; that killing Jews (and other non-Germans) was in fact morally acceptable. They believed this because they were brought up that way, and every conceivable nuance of Nazi German society was constructed to indoctrinate them in this belief.\n \n Another obvious example would be the terrorists who have been bombing Western targets in the last few years. These people do not do something they know to be wrong because they are insane or something, they believe it to be entirely morally appropriate for them to annihilate themselves and others in the name of a greater cause. \n If we refine this example to the original mujahideen in Afghanistan, some of whom became the first footsoldiers of Bin Laden's extreme Islamist movement, we can see why they have this twisted sense of right and wrong. Most were young, born in the late 70s. Afganistan was invaded by the Soviets in 79 and has known nothing but violence since. Thus the children of the late 70s have known nothing but violence and Islam all their lives. This is what creates the \"extreme Islamicist\" state of mind that ordinary people cannot understand. They were then gathered by various ideologues and their anger and hatred directed, not without good argument, towards the Capitalist West.\n \n Other examples would be African (I do not mean to generalise here, but I do not know enough of the specifics) attitudes towards women, Muslim \"honour killings\" of women, the Japanese xenophobic culture pre-1945, and countless other examples from the past and present where people see a certain groups of people as almost \"morally irrelevant\", that it is not just \"not wrong\" but it is in fact right that we keep women/other races/whoever in their place, and if this is to be achieved by killing them, so be it.\n \n The fact that so many different moral strucures have existed throughout history leads me to question your proposition that\n \nYou have a sense of right and wrong, it exists inherent in your being. Therefore, there must be an objective right and wrong. If so, it cannot come from humans.\n\n Yes, I have a sense of right and wrong, but it is not inherent in my being, it is taught to me from the day I am born by my parents and by the society and environment in which I live.\n Therefore, if moral outlooks are dictated by environment, there is no objective right and wrong. If there were, it would of course not come from humans. \n However, I believe that the historical records show quite plainly that morality is an entirely human construct, which has been changed again and again over time to either:\n 1)Suit the goals of a power base, or \n 2)Justify the irreconcilable emotions of a people who have suffered a catastrophe.\n Your assertion that \n \n every human on the planet has the same sense of right and wrong\n\n is clearly not well supported.",

To say that humanity set up the concept is inconsistent. That would mean that somewhere at sometime, there was a a time and place where right and wrong did not exist.\n\n \n The concept of right and wrong is a cultural universal, certainly, and like you I would never argue for its being a human construct (in the sense that some people somewhere sat down and invented it).\n \n Rather, it is intrinsic to the way human brains work. Kohler's work on the development of moral behaviour in children shows a very predictable pattern of rule acquisition, analogous to the predictable acquisition of language: seeking rules to govern behaviour is 'hard-wired' (or, to use your phrase, 'it exists inherent in your being').\n \n Where we will differ, I suspect, is over its origin. From my perspective, it is an evolved trait, strongly favoured by natural selection: no supernatural agency required.\n \n Like Liminus in the preceding post, I will take issue with\n \n \nevery human on the planet has the same sense of right and wrong.\n\n \n This is demonstrably untrue. In many tribal societies, killing people outside the tribe is not regarded as a moral offence. The Aztecs waged war on neighbouring peoples specifically to capture victims for sacrifice, and regarded that as a perfectly proper thing to do. The Old Testament writes approvingly of infanticide in numerous places.\n \n People are born with a strong drive to acquire, in infancy, a sense of right and wrong, as they are to acquire a language. But just as they are not programmed to acquire a particular language, so the social environment they grow up in can inculcate a very flexible sense of what is acceptable behaviour and what is not.

   "The concept of right and wrong is a cultural universal, certainly, and like you I would never argue for its being a human construct (in the sense that some people somewhere sat down and invented it).\n \n Rather, it is intrinsic to the way human brains work. Kohler's work on the development of moral behaviour in children shows a very predictable pattern of rule acquisition, analogous to the predictable acquisition of language: seeking rules to govern behaviour is 'hard-wired' (or, to use your phrase, 'it exists inherent in your being').\n \n Where we will differ, I suspect, is over its origin. From my perspective, it is an evolved trait, strongly favoured by natural selection: no supernatural agency required.\n \n Like Liminus in the preceding post, I will take issue with\n \n \n \n This is demonstrably untrue. In many tribal societies, killing people outside the tribe is not regarded as a moral offence. The Aztecs waged war on neighbouring peoples specifically to capture victims for sacrifice, and regarded that as a perfectly proper thing to do. The Old Testament writes approvingly of infanticide in numerous places.\n \n People are born with a strong drive to acquire, in infancy, a sense of right and wrong, as they are to acquire a language. But just as they are not programmed to acquire a particular language, so the social environment they grow up in can inculcate a very flexible sense of what is acceptable behaviour and what is not. A culture's morality evolves to maximise that culture's fitness: there are no absolutes.\n\n \n You have misrepresented what I said (all three of you). I never said that everyone on the planet says that the same things are either right or wrong, merely that everyone has a sense of right and wrong. It is the same in that everyone without exception declares something to be right or wrong. \n \n The evolutionary concept simply doesn't hold water logically. If it were an evolutional issue then we would see different traits evolving. Knowing right and wrong is existent in every person. If it was simply a trait that evolved like, say a placenta versus egg laying(as evolutionists say, I disagree with evolution but that is another argument and I can accept it for the sake of this argument), then what are the trait counterparts to knowing \"right and wrong\".\n \n If it were indeed evolutionary, we would see whole societies isolated from us that would never demonstrate any knowledge of the existence of right and wrong. To say that they have been killed off in survival of the fittest, you would have to show me that society in the fossil record. And you will unllikely be able to show that their \"right and wrong\" did not exist whereas ours do.\n \n It is demonstrable. At this point, I don't remember what brought up the discussion in the first place and I will only be posting once in a while (have another life). So feel free to ignore this if you wish. Although, it is a good topic for discussion and I would like to hear from more on each side.\n \n EF",

That's pretty narrow-minded of you, isn't it? \n \n And what lie did you buy into where you think Christ isn't who the Bible says he is? \n \n For broad is the path that leads to destruction.

However you have no tolerance for those who believe differently - accuse of them of believing in false gods and heresy. The tactful and decent thing to do in such a case would be to keep quiet if you have nothing pleasnat to say. but you dont do that.

Would you rather I patted them on the backs so they can go down to hell in peace? Not even God want's that. \n \n I even have 2 people in this forum (Jitobear and Orion) who are too scared to declare who their so-called \"god\" is and who cannot provide the first piece of credible evidence to back up their beliefs. If their beliefs are valid they should be proud to provide their evidences. \n \n \nFor my own part, I tolerate any mans views, as long they dont interefere with my way of life - for example teaching biblical genesis in publin schools.\n\n \n I say make it an elective. After all, that's the \"tolerant\" position, isn't it?\n \n \nStrange that I an \"old European\" would have to explain the concept of freedom of expression to an American\n\n \n We have freedom OF religion here in America, not freedom FROM religion. Kids in school can even initiate Christian prayer groups in school and use school facilities to meet. Now that's freedom!",

Ephesians 2:8 For it is by grace through faith in Jesus christ that you have been saved, and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God- 9 not by works, so that no one can boast. 10 For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\n \n \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No man comes to the father except through me.\"  John 14:6\n \n Acts 4:10-12 says: \"Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
