   "http://http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article345930.ece\n \n \n Three British residents held in Guantanamo Bay have won a legal battle which could lead to the Government demanding that they are freed by the US.\n \n They were granted leave to seek a court order by a High Court judge with the comment that the United States' view of what constitutes torture \"is not the same as ours and doesn't appear to coincide with that of most civilised countries.\"\n \n The legal decision came on the same day that a United Nations report, backed by the European Parliament and human rights organisations asked for the Guantanamo Bay camp to be shut.\n \n The US rejected the call. The White House spokesman Scott McClellan said: \"These are dangerous statements we are talking about there. We know al-Qa'ida terrorists are trying to disseminate false allegations [about torture].\"\n\n \n It's about bloody time. I doubt anything will come of this as Rumsfeld and the Pentagon have about as much moral integrity as Josef Stalin (if I can find a source that proves this I'll post it, otherwise my source is Actual World Events That I Know Of). But it's VERY satisfying to see someone such as a High Court Judge finally make a big deal out if it. \n My favourite part which echoes the thoughts of people around the world just needs to be printed again:\n \n \nThey were granted leave to seek a court order by a High Court judge with the comment that the United States' view of what constitutes torture \"is not the same as ours and doesn't appear to coincide with that of most civilised countries.\"\n",
