   "I do not exactly subscribe to moral relativism; I tend to attempt to reason my way into determining what is absolutely right.\n \n When considering abortion, I started by wondering when life begins. But I think it is pretty clear-cut that life begins as soon as a sperm or an egg is created. Those things are certainly alive, though we allow them to die, just as we allow the same for other creatures who are not people. So perhaps the question is \"when does a sperm and an egg become a person?\" To that question, I truly think that there is no specific line. Sperm and eggs can be considered a person. The moment of conception could be considered the beginning of being a person. Perhaps it is the moment a child gains self-awareness, or maybe the ability to learn. Perhaps it is when the child gains the ability to reason beyond that of animals and plants that determines when it is truly a person and not an animal. Perhaps it is when the child is born itself and is no longer a parasite on its mother. In truth, these are all stages of becoming a person. Life begins as a process. Which stage do we choose for when we grant rights? We should not choose it arbitrarily.\n \n To answer this question, I started with a sperm and an egg. We certainly do not consider this a person, for if we did, then we would all be obligated to allow as many of those sperms and eggs to turn into people as we can. We'd all need to have sex as often as possible, whether we wanted to or not. On the opposite side of the spectrum, after birth a child is certainly a person. So what makes it okay for us to say that this child was not a person when it is a sperm and egg, but that it is a person after birth?\n \n Is it the fact that a sperm and egg are seperate entities which denies them rights? I don't think so. Were it possible to seperate a full person in such a manner, then reconnect him, I do not think anyone would agree that while in the seperate form, that person no longer has rights and it would be okay to kill him, even though he could reform into a single entity. So although seperation is a difference, it is an arbitrary difference. It is not the reason we deny the sperm and egg rights. The reason that we don't force people to have as many children as possible, as I understand it, is because sometimes parents do not want to give birth to and raise a child. They do not have the means to provide a good life for that child or do not currently have the desire to raise one for some reason, so they just let sperm and eggs die until they decide to raise a child. Even if we ban abortion, we are saying that a sperm and egg does not have rights until the parents decide to have a child. We give them the choice to let sperms and eggs die because we believe that if a woman does not want to use her egg to create a child, no man should be able to force her to do so. If a man does not want his sperm to be used to create a child, he should not be forced to do so. Knowing that men and women have the right to decide whether their sperm and eggs are used to create children, it seems only logical that if they did not intend for their sperm and eggs to be used to create a child, we should not force it upon them. This does not mean that it is unreasonable to grant people a time frame in which to decide that their sperm or eggs were misused, but the decision to have a child should be that of the parents.\n \n Banning abortion to me seems to be instituting the logic that we should sometimes force people to use their sperm and egg to create a child, while sometimes we should not. We have chosen those women who are raped and the most irresponsible couples for people who must use their sperm and eggs against their intentions. This does not seem an appropriate solution to me.\n \n Perhaps I am wrong; it feels wrong to break down abortion into a logical process, but it is the only way I can make a fair decision. There are so many good points on both sides of the issue that I do not think it can ever be resolved until we develop the technology to keep aborted children alive.",

A society's morals are effectively the consensus of individual moral views within that society: it is capable of change for people are capable of independent thought and action but it doesn't descend into anarchy as there is a level of inertia against change that any new idea must fight against. A society sits at equilibrium with its moral values then shifts to a new equlibrium once the momentum for change becomes strong enough as that momentum suddenly becomes the new inertia.\n \n To try a completely different tact, how about if I get you to read up on homeostasis (the old fashioned view of how complex organisms work) versus homeodynamics (the modern view)?

   "It is also completely unproven that God does not exist, an assumption the moral relativist makes that is comletely unfounded.\n\n \n Why? Moral relativism is not dependent upon God. If God exists, it doesn't change it, if God doesn't exist, it doesn't change it. It is quite a irrevelant factor. Therefore, it does not matter and my argument does not rest upon the problem that yours does. \n \n \n\n By this definition, murder cannot occur without, at the very least, two human agents. It is the unlawful killing of one human being by another human being. Parasites are not human beings, and thus they cannot be murdered.\n\n \n Why it is unlawful? We have plently of laws that state when it is okay to kill someone. Some people even get paid by the state to do it. Not to mention in civilizations such as the Aztec, ritual murder of nobles was a good thing. Parasites are not humans? I disagree, I know a number of blood suckers who don't do anything but feed off others. \n \n \n\n Kill such a person? No. Murder such a person? Yes.\n\n \n Well then, how is that different?\n \n \n\n Your argument that supposedly proves that moral absolutes don't exist is that there are different opinions on what is moral.\n\n \n Okay...\n \n \nThat is, the reason moral absolutes cannot possibly exist is that one person thinks a given action is wrong, another person thinks the same action is right.\n\n \n Alright. Not necesasrily one person though. History is full of varying morals. \n \n \n\n What happens if we accept this logic and apply it to every claim? For instance, some people think the Holocaust actually happend, some people do not. Does it follow that there is no universally right answer to this? Or, does it only follow that there are two opinions about the subject?\n\n \n Bad example. Holocaust is something that happened in history. You can't compare the two. Besides we have evidence of the Holocaust, we don't have evidence of absolute morality. Besides, if we really want to deal with the problem of unfounded ideas, none of this could even exist, therefore the Holocaust never really did happen. I'm still waiting. You fail to deal with the exceptions and you fail to even view the idea from another angle.

You can not follow an absolute moral code if you don't know it, yet if there is one it must include something like 'ignorance is no excuse' otherwise the only real part of this ultimate moral code is that moral relativism is valid.\n \n But the fact that this code exists so that people can be punished (without punishment is there any point whatsoever to morality?) yet refuses to actually reveal itself to them so they can abide behind seems to me so alien to the concept of human justice that yet again it may as well not exist. If that is in there then pretty much anything could and the code is going appear to be completely arbitary and not follow any logical system at all.

The religious claim it is revealed in their texts, and that we will be punished or rewarded in accordance with it, at least in the afterlife. Non-naturalists believe it can be deduced, by any rational being, from undeniable truths.

Or is it merely a faith based thing?\n\n Here i go: \nWho can say there are no signs of it? Perhaps somebody has seen a sign of it. Besides that, even if there was no sign, it still does not follow that an absolute truth does not exist. It just means that we have no sign that an absolute truth exists. Furthermore, it is impossible to deny that an absolute truth exists.

Can we offer evidence to give a good reason to hold one view over another? Sure.\n \n \nI already did. Merely becuase you wish to avoid discussing it doesn't make your argument correct.\n\n Avoid discussing it? Let me refresh your memory yet again.\n \n I said:\n \n \nHow about genocide, child molestation, slavery?\n\n To which you responded:\n \n \nI'm going to assume that absolute moral standards says all three are bad. Yet there are instances where they are not bad, and in fact necessarily to stay alive. How can something be absolute when there are exceptions?\n\n So far you have not given an exception. You have said that there are exceptions, but have not offerd one. Are you still with me? Hang in there.\n \n I then went on to say:\n \n \nI say that gathering large groups of people, sending them off to centralized locations, and gassing, burning, and starving them to death is absolutely wrong.\n\n \n To which you replied:\n \n \nIs that wrong in all instances? can you name a exception? If you can, it is not absolute.\n\n \n To which I obviously responded:\n \n \nThis is wrong in all circumstances...I recognize no exception. I hold the action i stated to be absolutely wrong.\n\n \n Then you again:\n \n \nSo genocide would be wrong aganist a specific group that was killing everything and everyone and would not stop? Think about it this way, if you were a Nazi, would you think that new lands and a twisted form of manifest destiny was wrong? Think in a different perspective.\n\n Is this your exception? I don't understand it if it is, hence I have asked you to clarify it. Are you saying that if the only way to stop a group of people from gathering large groups of people, sending them off to centralized locations, and gassing, burning, and starving them to death was to gather them together, send them off to centralized locations, and gas, and burn, and starve them to death, that genocide would be acceptable? If this is an exception, why is it an exception?\n \n Anyways, continuing on...\n \n I replied thus:\n \n \nI don't think you heard me, so I'm going to try to make my position loud and clear. GENOCIDE IS WRONG IN EVERY SITUATION, NO EXCEPTIONS. The Nazis may have believed genocide was right, but it does not follow that because they thought genocide was right, that genocide is in reality right. It also doesn't follow that just because they thought genocide to be right, that there is no universal standard by which we can determine their actions to be wrong. I have adopted such a standard.\n\n \n You again:\n \n \nThat is nothing but mindless rant, and it's also a pure \"because I say so.\" You offer nothing but your own opinion and you obviously refuse to even look at it from a different angle. You make no indictation of where such a standard came from, all you have is closed opinion. I'm going to get my frying pan. Where I showed exceptions, you are just shouting.\n\n \n To which I responded:\n \n \nI have clearly tried to explain where the standard comes from, but everytime you reply with something like this:\n \nyou are basically committing the fallacy of beginning the question, assuming that the starting point is true when it could not be.\n\n You respond to me with such responses even though I have shown that your own arguments don't hold up under this standard.\n \n\n \n You again:\n \n \n\n \n2. I accept no situation where genocide is permissable. Do you?\n\n Merely because you don't want to look at the exceptions doesn't make absolute morality correct. We can ignore whatever we want, does it make our opinions true? No it does not. You are merely resorting to \"because i say so.\" In some instances, genocide may not be the best alternative, but it may be the only one that is pratical.\n \n \n3. I have offered absolutes.\n\n No, you have offered situations with exceptions, exceptions you refuse to even comment upon. If you do not want to even bother to view from a second angle, there is no point in this discussion.\n \n\n \n And here I go...A very key point from me coming up:\n \n \nI will be happy to address your exceptions. Let's make it simple and talk about one action I take to be absolutely wrong: genocide. Give me an exception to this.\n\n Notice that this is obviously not a refusal to comment on your exceptions. In fact, I in this quote invited you, begged you, to give me an exception to genocide. Seeing how you must have such convincing exceptions, I figured you would jump at this chance. But, what do we hear as your response?\n \n \nI already have. You have ignored all three exceptions. \n \n I suggest you learn how to back your claims up before posting. All you have right now is \"because I said so.\"\n\n How disappointing. You rebuke me for not addressing your exceptions, yet you refuse to offer them.

Even if no events in history do not provide the exception to a rule that you claim to be a moral absolute does not make it such - based on this logic, we would have to wait for the results of new developments such as human cloning, before condemning them as wrong - however, the complaints i hear most about cloning come from moral absolutists. I can't offer you a case on genocide off the top of my head, but one of the other three cases you claimed - child molestation - i can: The Sambia of Papua New Guinea use fellatio in rituals between men and boys from an early age in boys until they are of such an age to be men themselves. This would be condemned by yourself, but an entire race of people have done this for centuries upon end - which questions the idea that it concerns a moral absolute.",

Could you elaborate a little more?\n\n Okay - what i am driving at with this point is that even before any results have been presented for the field of human cloning, and although there are profound benefits that could be reaped from such advances (stem cell research could treat millions of diseases relatively cheaply), there always seem to be a small minority that stand in the way of such advances.

   "Irvine,\n Moral absolutists are not utilitarians.\n The reason you see this correlation is because with the issues of cloning and stem cell research, there are clear moral and ethical challenges that must be dealt with through some moral lense. These moral and ethical challenges are rooted in the same moral absolute that says that murder is wrong. The harvesting, devaluing, killing, and commodization of human life for the purpose of experimentation is not much different than the type expirimentation denounced at the Nuremburg trials. \n \n Just for the record, and you may already know this:\n Pro-lifers are for stem-cell research. While they are against embryonic stem cell research(as it envolves the destruction of a human embryo), they wholeheartedly support adult stem cell research (which has shown more promise anyway).\n \n There is much research that indicates that therepeutic adult stem cell research is more promising than embryonic stem cell research.\n 1.There is no threat of rejection/immunal reaction\n 2.Less threat of tumor formation\n 3.Adult stem cells are being increasingly recognized as being more pliable than originally believed.\n 4.The discovery of adult bone marrow stem cells (multipotent adult progenitor cells) can develop into virtually any human tissue type and reproduce extensively without losing their broad developmental capacity.\n \n Also, there is research that indicates that inducing adult non-stem cells to convert directly into cells of many types without first having to pass through the embryonic stage. A group of Norwegian scientists have reportedly already induced an adult skin cell to behave as immune system cell and nerve cell in the lab.\n \n Adult stem cell research is good because \n 1. Its great promise \n 2. It does not involve the destruction of a human embryo\n \n With regards to the issue of human cloning, many are advocating cloning as a method of harvesting human embryos in order to perform reseach on them and use their stem cells. This is unethical.",

   "However if you want to find out how to make the stem cells change you need to study embryos because while bone marrow stem cells may be able to produce multiple types of cells they don't do it normally. Only embryos have the triggers you need to find.\n \n I have a feeling reading somewhere that they just arn't as good - you can make them become another cell but not then grow into a fully functioning organ. If you just want tissue, its fine but for a practical use they are not in the same league as embryonic ones.\n \n And there is a massive difference between the Nazi science and embryonic stem cell research - in the latter no suffering is caused, which is the important thing.",

   "Notice that this is obviously not a refusal to comment on your exceptions. In fact, I in this quote invited you, begged you, to give me an exception to genocide. Seeing how you must have such convincing exceptions, I figured you would jump at this chance. But, what do we hear as your response?\n\n \n Genocide - Hypothetical example - A single nation of mixed race manages to purge all races but one. This last surviving race, obviously being bloodthirsty and motivated, reaches high levels of military power. In later years, this nation subverts all neighbouring states and makes them submit to it's rule, ending centuries of civil war and internal strife, allowing for a unified focus on internal infrastructure and welfare. By killing ten million people from a single race, this nation manages to save the lives of one hundred million people who would have otherwise died in civil wars and internal strife. Is genocide bad? Yes. But in this hypothetical scenario it is not the worst scenario.\n \n Slavery - The Romans built an Empire on the backs of slaves which lasted hundreds of years and made massive jumps in engineering, agriculture, government, etc. Their use of slaves has, potentially, lead to the western culture we enjoy today.\n \n And so on. Pick a crime you consider to be absolutely evil. Which is to say, it is the absolutely worst possible choice in any given scenario.",

   "You seem to be assuming a utilitarian opposition (ie killing 10 million is justified if it saves 100 million), and while it is probably true there are no strict act-restrictions under such a framework, it's not in itself a relativist position to say 100 million saved is always better than 10 million.\n \n But if you step outside a utilitarian/consequentialist ethical model, you can consistently apply rules to action - you can say genocide is always wrong even if the consequences are appealing or productive. That wouldn't view killing 10 million to save 100 million as a \"convincing exception\", just as an example of a wrongful act.",
