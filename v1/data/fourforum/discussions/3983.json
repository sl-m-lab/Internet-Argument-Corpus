   "My curiosity was aroused regarding the current lack of Fallujah damage photos available on the net. Immediately following the attack I saw several displaying vast areas of rubble, remains of mosques and general destruction attributable to intense 'precision' bombing, artillery fire and house-to-house fighting techniques adopted from the Israelis consisting of total destruction of residential areas room by room to supposedly reduce casualties but in reality more of the civilian psychological dominance theme. This AM I spent some search time and most images of the destruction, for whatever reason, have been pulled. Many search results read 'image no longer available' and in some cases entire albums have been deleted.\n \n Some additional reading disclosed that the only 'official' cameras allowed in Fallujah during the attack were for official military purposes and after the attack confined to authorized Iraqi nationals taking images of bodies for identification by relatives in relocation camps before dogs completely ate the bodies or they were buried. That's the reason the body pictures are still in circulation, as those images were obviously emailed to enough people that containment would be impossible.\n \n While I'm not a conspiracy theorist, it does seem strange, considering Fallujah was one of the largest battles in post-invasion Iraq, that I'm unable to find pictures of general physical destruction. That leads me to believe the original images were taken from the now common individual blogs of military service people in Iraq followed by many news sources not satisfied with embedded reporter news carefully sanitized by our military for 'security purposes' before release to the general media. As the military provides and controls Internet access for Iraqi domiciled service personnel, those blogs can be controlled, even if after the fact.\n \n One thing does seem to be consistent, that the US government is acutely aware that photos such as the massive physical damage we've created, body bags of US dead and the horrors of house to house fighting with civilian deaths including children will not serve their political rationalization of instilling humanitarian democracy in Iraq. The veil of secrecy surrounding all administration functions is more than a little questionable.",

Americans are fine with detached participation when their government dictates the 'right' thing is being accomplished, currently including Iraq and Columbia. They (the public) draw on Rummy's statements of civilians being forewarned of planned attacks, which supposedly absolves the military (and Americans) of all responsibility. Pictures of mutilated children and mass destruction distract the public from their government assisted focus on escape facilitated by deception. \n \n The media was largely responsible for public sentiment turning against our war in Vietnam. Repeated TV coverage of body bags, mutilated people, defoliated jungles, razed villages and the other realities of war eventually sunk into the minds of the general public and they reacted accordingly. This administration has eliminated all possibility of that politically destructive coverage ever happening by tightly controlling 'free' press access to military operations.",

Some of the kids here may not remember vietnam era photojournalism, but you certainly should. \n \n I think we can count on our government to do everything within their power to keep a tight lid on any and all pictures coming out of Iraq. While a few have certainly slipped through, they have an unprecedented control over reporters in country with the embed program. \n \n It would, at this point, take quite a bit to convince the American public that we are not the knights in shining armor that we have been told we are. You see a somewhat interesting phenomenon in combat soldiers. No matter how nasty and brutal their tactics, or how terrible their objective, they can almost always be counted on to claim that they are fighting on the side of right, and no matter how many civilians they kill, they can generally be counted on to claim that they are helping the people. The rational behind this is not difficult to divine. Euithr you are fighting on the side of right and helping people or you are just murdering scum, and nobody wants to think of themselves as murdering scum.\n \n I think we see a similar condition in the Americna public. Either we are the hero in this sotry or we are just murdering scum (albeit by proxy). We don't want to be the murdering scum who initiated an elective war against a country that was of absolutly no threat to us and then commenced to kill of 100,000+ civilians in a single year. That certianly makes you murdering scum, so the US public can be counted on to close their eyes to such things, wrap themselves in the flag, and, no matter what happens, go to bed at night telling themselves that we are the hero in this particular epic struggle. \n \n Luckily for the US government, the US public is excellent when it comes to deluding themselves. 38% of us still think we found stockpiles of WMDs. It is going to take a LOT of evidence to convicne the American public that we are the agressor here and the tactics we have employed are deplorable. \n \n If you ask your average american who is fighting us in Iraq, they will list sunnis, baathists, and \"foreign fighters\". Just a little reality check for all you out there. There have been less tha 20 foreign fighters confirmed to be operating in Iraq. NOBODY in the entire country has actually claimed to have met Al Zaquari in person. Not a single person, and the body count form falluja shows that the forces there were not only sunnis, but shiites as well.\n \n The folks we are fighting in Iraq are a mixed force of hardcore fundamentalist, nationalists, and guys who came home form work one day to find that we had precision bombed their homes, with their families still inside, to a smaking pile of rubble. They gathered in falluja because they (they insurgents) controlled the city and they could plan strikes aginst coalition forces from there. \n \n Have you people not noticed that after we do a week or two of heavy hits, where we level a bunch of peoples houses and kill a bunch of civilians that insurgent attacks go throught the roof? Is this really that difficult to understand? How hell bent would you be in revenge if somebody came along and blew up your house and killed your family? If it was me, I would certainly be out there with a rifle and an IED.\n \n Just watch what happens as people start filtering back into fallujah and find their homes destroyed and everything they had gone, including in some case their fathers and sons (since women and children were all allowed to leave, but men had to sneak out of the city).",

   "None of it surprises me. I was impressed with the degree of control the administration is capable of exercising over the media, the Internet included. While a great deal of traditional visual and print media has become politically detached to maintain advertiser consumer audiences with as little psychological disturbance as possible to stabilize their positive (buying) attitudes (the Chicago Tribune image library had the simple 'image removed' on Fallujah coverage), lack of Internet coverage tells the story. \n \n Nor does a lack of reaction to our deeds in Iraq by the US public surprise me. That band of sheep went from WMDs to instilling democracy as a rationalization for invading and occupying a third tier sovereign nation without hesitation. The administration's pathetic justification of instilling democracy in Iraq so it will spread throughout the ME and bring peace is no different than the domino theory used by Ike, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon to justify Vietnam. The public gobbled that one up for years in their effort to be right, so why not use proven deception. Estimates of dead Vietnamese from that war are at about 3-million with 55,000 US losses, so the ratios remain about the same in Iraq and seemingly very acceptable to the US public. \n \n Vietnam photojournalism that remains most vivid to me is the last helicopter leaving the US Embassy in Saigon with literally dozens of people hanging on the skids in an attempt to escape what they knew would be deadly retaliation for supporting the US in that slaughter. And watching them drop to the ground one by one as it gained altitude. Free press is now a dead issue. As even our educational system has deteriorated so badly in the government quest for mediocrity as the ideal control measure, few Americans not adults during that period are even aware of the motivation or result similarities. \n \n Time to get out of Iraq? Anyone with even a sliver of intelligence remaining from endless government propaganda control has to understand we should never have been there in the first place. But that eliminates the general US public. They're (public) caught up in a fruitless attempt to maintain a status quo in their declining standard of living based on a false economy assisted by the deficits Iraq provides. As long as our government can support the public escape from reality, it'll take a really big shock to get their heads out of the sand and motivate us to leave Iraq.",

Once the veneer of civilization is peeled off, usually one burst of automatic weapon fire directed at you will do it, it has always been conceded that patriotism and/or ideological justification become secondary motivations to all soldiers.

Again, you are trying to compare the two before this one is over. that is an invalid comparison. \n \n We havent faced any serious ground opposition since vietnam. During Gulf 1, Bush senior made the decision not to try to actually take over the country, and wisely so. He didn't want to get mired in exactly the kind of thing that we are facing now. America doesn't do well in such wars. We never have. American style wars involve flying over and dropping precision guided bombs on residential neiborghoods, or launching cruise missiles from a ship a thousand miles away. We don't seem to be as skilled when it comes to facing the enemy on the ground. We also don't seem to have the whole \"winning the hearts and minds\" thing down. This is probably becuase in the quest for public acceptance for the war, which automatically requires low casualty figures on our side, we have no compunction against leveling residential neiborghoods, or even entire cities, in order to \"soften up\" the enemy.\n \n The big protests against Vietnam did not start until the draft had been initiated. It was not until people were facing a very real, involuntay participation that they got up off their cans and started protesting. Just wait. If things do not improve in Iraq, or if we do something idiotic to bring more opposition, there is a good chance that we will see another draft. Then we can do a proper comparison of anti war protesting.\n \n \nPart of the reason for this is that a lot of the country view this war as a part of the broader war on terror. Whether you agree or not, that's the general public's perception. Anti-war buffs just can't seem to drum up enough oppostion.\n\n \n According to Fox news (who ran a poll on this just this week) you are wrong. Over half of Americans differentiate between the war in Iraq and the war on terror. It took a long time for the majority to figure out what the 10% of us who were paying attentiuon when the war started already knew. for those who still haven't figured it out, don't worry. some folks are jsut slower than others. Your mother still loves you. You don't have to be ashamed to ride the short bus.\n \n \n \nYour comparisons would carry more weight if they weren't always made by anti-war prophets of doom such as yourself nearly every single time the U.S. takes on a military engagement, and we haven't seen another Vietnam yet.\n\n \n I don' think that any of the folks you are debating here are anti war prophets of doom. I have no problem with wars in general. I was all for carpet bombing afghanistan until the mountains were valleys.\n \n I DO have a problem with illegal wars. I have a problem with fighting elective wars in such a manner that we put the lives of US soldiers above those of civilians. A soldiers job is to die on a battlefield if asked. A civilians job is not. When we intentionally use tactics which cause civilian casualties in order to preserve soldiers lives so we can keep support for the war up, that is wrong, and is largely why we always loose ground wars. Every time you kill a civilian, you make enemies. Every time you level a city, you make LOTS of enemies. This is not rocket science.",

   "Does Anyone Know What We Are Doing in Iraq?\n \n President Bush is out of touch with the American people, the U.S. military, and international political reality.\n \n With every poll showing smaller and smaller minorities approving of Bush and his war in Iraq, with top U.S. generals sending signals that they want to reduce U.S. troops in Iraq, and with the world at large viewing Bush as a fanatic who cannot acknowledge his blunders and mistakes, Bush announced in his weekly radio address that \"our efforts in Iraq and the broader Middle East will require more time, more sacrifice, and continued resolve.\"\n \n Does Bush think he is a dictator? \n \n Perhaps Bush supplied the answer in his reference in his weekly radio address to \"our efforts in...the broader Middle East.\"\n \n What are our efforts \"in the broader Middle East\"?\n \n The only American efforts \"in the broader Middle East\" that have been defined are in the policy writings of Bush's neoconservative advisers who cooked up the invasion of Iraq. For the neocons, our efforts are in behalf of Israel's security.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.antiwar.com/roberts/?articleid=7115\n \n \n .",
