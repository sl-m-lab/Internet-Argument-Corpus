   "Don't worry, the church itself is divided over the issue of homosexual, but general public opinion is like 70 % think its o.k.\n \n And if you think in terms of you and god, why would your creater give you urges and feels if they were bad? Your base feelings haven't been corrupted or changed by satan, which is all he can do.\n \n God made you the way he made you for a reason. And I don't think god would be cruel enough to give us something, just to torment us. God knows all and is all powerful, he makes no mistakes and he is forgiving, he choices a person's goodness based on the choices they make in life, and whether those choices follow the teachings of the bible. So as long as you follow the 10 commandments, keep down on then sins, and don't loose faith I'm sure you'll get to heaven.",

   "Hi Velvet,\n \n I'll let you know up front that I'm presenting a view that beleives you can change. The most important thing is that God loves every person, and will forgive any sin in the world. If he doesn't, then I know that I'm going to hell, considering that I once swore right at God, whom I believe in. (the f-word, no less)\n \n \"We know from the Bible that every life is valuable because it is made in the image of God. You are unique to Him (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). \n \n As Christians, we know that the sacredness of life is based on God's character-not our characteristics. We truly are not our own; we were bought with a price.\"\n (from Focus on the Family's website)\n \n I am a Christian too, and we know that God's sacrifice for us - his very own son - is infinitely precious and powerful. If God ever said 'no, even the death of my son couldn't make up for this sin... this is too big even compared to my son', well... does that make any sense? That would mean that our own capablility for evil is greater than God's capability to love and be gracious, our own badness would be greater than His goodness and Jesus's sacrifice. That is absolutely not true.\n \n I don't know for 100% sure that homosexuality is a sin. I've seen some very persuasive arguments for it. The first link here is to Focus on the Family's page on homosexuality. I think that it is a loving, but frank view, which covers a lot of ground. At the bottom of their page is a link to Exodus International, and I'll also put that link at the bottom of this post.\n \n If your freinds are true Christians they will support and love you. I realize that Christians do not always live up to our example - Jesus. Its for you to judge whether to tell them. It is my feeling that you will get much needed support from them. Some may not understand, probably some will not understand - but those who do understand are your real freinds. There is also the option of Exodus, which I'm sure is guaranteed to be supportive and confidential. \n \n I also beleive you should tell your parents, but again, I don't know them.

   "There is also the option of Exodus, which I'm sure is guaranteed to be supportive and confidential. \n\n \n Statement by the American Psychological Association-\n \"The potential risks of 'reparative therapy' are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior, since therapist alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already experienced by the patient. Many patients... were inaccurately told that homosexuals are lonely, unhappy individuals who never achieve acceptance or satisfaction. The possibility that the person might achieve happiness and satisfying interpersonal relationships as a gay man or lesbian is not presented, nor are alternative approaches to dealing with the effects of societal stigmatization discussed... the APA opposes any treatment, such as 'reparative' or 'conversion' therapy which is based on the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based on a prior assumption that the patient should change his/her sexual orientation.\" \n \n That's real nice, Robbie. \"Conversion therapy\" doesn't help people.

   "Velvet,\n \n There is no law against you being both christian and gay at the same time. Your sexual prefference is your own, likewise your belief / view on god is your own. There is also no law saying you must \"come out\" to people. Just enjoy your life as it is, don't hide anything. If people figure it out that you are homosexual, let them. If these people are your true friends, they will feel no differently about you. If they have shallow, narrow minded views which cause them to dissolve you friendship over it, then perhaps they were not really friends in the first place. Do what your heart tells you is right. If you are a christian and happy that way, continue to be a christian. If you are gay and happy to be gay, continue to be gay. Friends will come and go throughout your life, take the good from these relationships and move on, take the bad and learn from it.
