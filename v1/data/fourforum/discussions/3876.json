   "I don't believe any more in the war against terrorism. It's a crappy ****! After the tragedy in Beslan the whole world was talking about that cowardly villainous act of Chechen terrorism. That was right after the Beslan tragedy that the Kavkaz-Center website was closed in Lithuania and later in Finland. Now it got opened in Sweden! What is interesting, three Islamic websites were banned on the territory of Sweden for propaganda of violence, terrorism and anti-Semitism. At the same time, for some reason a Chechen source remains on-line though it provides information of the same nature. Is it logical? Are Chechen terrorists any better than the Arab ones?",

   "Yes and no. Chechnyan terrrorist are fighting a war vs the Russians in which genocidal tactics by the Russians are being praticed. Chechnya had a population of over 1 million back in 1994, it now is believed to have a population of around 750 000. The indiscriminate destruction of Grozny by Russian forces in my mind legitamizes any acts by the Chechnyans in retaliation.\n \n But then again I would if I knew how would give real aid to the Iraqi resistance, which some people call terrrorists (I personally feel they are classic examples of freedom fighters the same way as the Afghani freedom fighters were during the 80's).",

   "This is the problme with the entire concept of a \"war on terror\". One mans \"terrorist\" is another mans \"freedom fighter\". \n \n I, too, support the Iraqi resistance. I hope they kick our butts right out of the ME. I know it isn't likely, but one can certainly wish for justice whether they get it or not.\n \n Even AQ is viewed by many as freedom fighters. They are fighting the expansionist polices that America has been using for years to further our control of other nations. They are fighting our support of tyranical regimes. They are NOT fighting because they \"envy our wealth and power\" (nice try though, bush).\n \n I am not certain I agree with you when it comes to the Chechnyan tactics. While It may well be acceptable fro AQ to strike at civilians targets, I am not sure that the Chechnyans doing the same is fully legitimate. In AQ's case, they are opposing decades of poor foreign policy carried out by a fully democratic nation. Unfortunatly, one of the prices of freedom and democracy is, IMHO, partial responsibility for the actions of those you elect.\n \n The Chechnyans are fighting a war which is not entirely rooted in the actions of a long standing, democratically elected government. As such, I think some of their tactics which involve strikes designed primarily to injure or kill civilians may be unjustified.",

I will say the Breslan attack was ill concieved and counter productive to Chechnyan rebels overall\n\n \n The breslan attack was horrible in terms of the PR that they recieved. \n \n The problem that these \"terrorists\" seem to be coming up against is that governements, as they grow, become so detached from the people that what the citizens of any particular country want has little or nothing to do with what the government does. \n \n We have this problem right here in the US. I have not yet found anybody who was willing to say that persuing predatory trade agreements that allow US companies to use children as virtual slave labor is acceptable. I have yet to find anybody who feels that supporting tyrannical regimes is acceptable. I have yet to find anybody who, when the racial policies of Israel are explained to them, find supporting them acceptaqble (until you point out that the policies you just explained are those of israel, in which case alleged conservatives change theri mind). \n \n This doesn't matter. Our government has been doing this stuff for years. Tehy made no secret of the fact. Americans have simply become too fat and lazy to bother policing their government. \n \n I don't know if the situation is the same in Russia or not. From what I have seen I would say not. The poulation of russia seems to have a prettty firm grasp of what is going on and has happened in regards to the chechens, and the polls I have seen of the russina people strongly suggest that they are willing to wash their hands of the whole mess and let the chechens go to hell their own way. \n \n It seems that maybe the Russian government is starting to bow before the opinion of the public in the matter just a bit. It will be interesting to see how this goes.\n \n Of course, in America, you can count on somebody to drape the flag over the issue and swarms of drooling XXXXXX will forget everything they have ever known about the issue. This is because in the US, we enjoy a system of democratic fascism, and hypernationalism is one of the defining traits of a fascist regime, and the purpose of government under a fascist regime is to value itself as the highest priority in its culture.",
