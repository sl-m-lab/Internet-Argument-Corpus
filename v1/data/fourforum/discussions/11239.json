   "You would have to write a letter to Bush when it comes to drilling off the coast of Florida. He is the one that nixed it as a favor to his brother. \n \n\n \n Speaking of writing a letter to Bush, that's exactly what I did, and here is what I said.\n \n Subject: OPEC gouging the USA:\n To: president@whitehouse.gov\n \n Dear Mr Bush,\n It has been a couple of years since writing you as I\n am so disgusted by your compromises in so many area's, it\n seemed a waste of time. But since you are sitting idly by and\n allowing OPEC to force us to finance Islam's war\n against us before they finally destroy us after breaking our\n economy, I felt I might as well appeal to your sense of\n survival and your legacy by pointing out a few harsh realities\n before giving you an immediate solution that will force them\n to increase production immediately and stop manipulating\n the market in order to force prices up at the pump as they\n have been doing.\n \n They know all too well that when the US makes a\n determination to accomplish a goal, no power on Earth\n can stop us. They also know that the only thing stopping\n us from harvesting 300 years worth of crude oil from\n fields we have found are the environmentalists and the Democrats\n who want us to stay in bondage to the middle east, when\n they know that OPEC has no concern at all for our economic\n security at all.\n \n What I can't understand is why you, who is so pro-self\n defense against the threats that radical Islam\n represents have been so silent in speaking out against the\n obvious agenda being applied against us now by restricting\n production so as to force prices up in all areas of\n the American market place due to the additional\n manufacturing and transportation costs incurred. \n \n So let's see if you have the courage to actually fix\n this problem and in the process become the hero of the\n American people, disarm the Democrats in their quest for the\n White house, guarantee a Mcain victory in November, and\n simultaneously motivate OPEC to IMMEDIATELY increase\n production and lower gas prices at the American pump\n within ONE WEEKS TIME. Here it is:\n \n It requires that you GET MAD first of all. That you\n give a speech saying that:\n \n I've had it, and I wont take it anymore. I have\n waited for OPEC to do the right thing based on my insistence\n that we want to preserve our business relationship with\n them that has existed for so many decades. After all, it\n was American technology and manpower that created and\n built the middle eastern oil industry.\n \n With that said, they have betrayed our trust and are\n artificially gouging the American people by decreasing\n production in order to illegally force prices up. My\n response as President of the United States is to\n fulfill a promise of OIL INDEPENDENCE that was made to the\n American people by this Government after the end of the Oil\n Embargo during Jimmy Carters failed Presidency. \n \n So I am announcing that by Executive Order, The\n American Oil Companies that have already discovered ample\n supplies of Oil in Fields ONSHORE OR OFFSHORE, that we can\n harvest immediately can now drill without Government\n restrictions based on current environmental protection safeguards\n that are currently in place and will insure that wildlife\n is protected while the needs of the American people are\n assured also. \n \n If America can't trust their Oil Suppliers to treat us\n fairly then we MUST finally become Energy Independent\n until such time that alternate energies are available to us\n as a Nation.\n \n I am also ordering that construction on 4 new state of\n the art Oil Refineries be built immediately in order to\n serve the increased Oil Production that will be forthcoming.\n This Executive Order is being signed because this power\n play by OPEC is an attack on the US economy and therefore an\n extension of the War on Terror that we are entrenched\n in. Unless we respond with nothing less than complete\n energy independence from the Middle East, then we will end up\n being slaves to them as they hold us hostage\n financially as they are doing right now by artificially manipulating\n the market and gouging the Country which is responsible\n for building the industry they are now using against us. \n ===============================================\n \n Now let's face it Mr President, as of yesterday most\n Americans heard the Oil Company Executive\n categorically state to Senator Leahy that it was the Congress and\n the environmentalists who are responsible for our oil\n dependence to OPEC by not allowing us to harvest the\n abundance of crude that we know is there; thereby\n shutting him down like the babbling idiot he is. Now you have\n the power, as a lame duck, to do something that will\n change the direction of the American Economy, finally take a real\n and effective stand against OPEC, be an example for the\n rest of the World that we don't have to be dependent upon\n enemies for our life blood, which Oil is as the lubricant that\n keeps the gears of our economic machine greased and\n moving as efficiently as it has since Oil became such an\n important commodity. And also redeem yourself in the eyes of the\n American people who have lost so much confidence in\n you due to the inconsistencies in you policies.\n \n Granted, the libs and the environmentalists will go\n apoplectic in response to your aggressive move, but\n that is a good thing as it will clarify for the American\n people that it's the liberals who are promoting the misery\n index as they refuse to do the right thing for the American\n economy or the cost of living which the cost of OIL is\n affecting every part of. HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO SHINE\n BEFORE LEAVING OFFICE GEORGE, DO THE RIGHT THING AND WATCH\n THE ARABS INCREASE PRODUCTION OVER NIGHT IN ORDER TO\n ATTEMPT TO STOP US FROM MOVING FORWARD WITH YOUR EXECUTIVE\n ORDERS.\n In Him,\n Ali ********\n New Hampshire,\n 603-***-****\n ",

I believe he was wrong to do it, but I'm sure it was tied in with environmental politics. A very small part of the entire problem. Peter Robinson, vice chairman of Exxon, puts it this way;\n \n \nRobertson said President Bush's trip this week to Saudi Arabia is \"highly embarrassing\" because he is \"calling on the Saudis to produce more oil when we are not doing it ourselves.\" The last refinery built in America was in 1976. Tighter government regulations are the main reason. That's how unserious we are about our energy \"crisis.\" \n \n Robertson said there would be plenty of oil available to the United States if the oil companies were allowed to get it: \"Eighty-five percent of offshore oil is off-limits.\" Responding to objections to offshore drilling by environmentalists and their allies in Congress, Robertson noted that some of the strongest pro-environment nations in Europe - he mentions Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom - lease offshore locations for oil exploration. The technology has become so good, he said, that during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, \"one thousand offshore wells were destroyed (in the Gulf of Mexico), but not one leaked.\" Australia, he said, has allowed offshore drilling for 40 years without any environmental damage. \n\n \n http://www.townhall.com/columnists/CalThomas/2008/05/13/in_defense_of_big_oil\n \n \nAs far as the rest, even if we drilled everywhere in the US that we believe there may be oil, it would still be 10 years before we saw any benefit at all, and the total daily production would basically only be a blip on the radar in the face of continued decline. ANWAR, which has been the big hot button issue when it comes to oil drilling of late, would, at peak production, only provide about 1% of our daily use in the US. If Anwar went into full production tomorrow and the most optimistic estimates of its output turned out to be correct, it would lower the price of a barrel of oil by about $0.75. \n\n \n These aren't facts, they're just extreme liberal Democrat talking points. The conservative talking points (from the same link above) look like this;\n \n \nAccording to government estimates, there is enough oil in areas accessible to America - 112 billion barrels - to power more than 60 million cars for 60 years. The Outer Continental Shelf alone contains an estimated 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Had President Clinton not vetoed exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in 1995, when oil was $19 a barrel, America would currently be receiving more than 1 million barrels a day domestically, all of it taken by better technology than existed more than 30 years ago. That was when the Alaskan pipeline was built despite protests from environmentalists who claimed it would destroy the caribou. It didn't, but the environmentalists are back with the same discredited arguments. Because most of the oil remains \"off-limits,\" we are becoming more dependent on foreign oil. \n\n \n From price affects of 75 cents per barrel, to estimates of 112 billion barrels, it's easy to see that estimates of what we actually have cover a really broad range. The only way to find out what we have is to drill for it. It doesn't make sense to assume that environmentalists are automatically right, and not try to find out. If a state, its people, and private companies seek to do something, it's none of the Federal Governments business according to the tenth amendment. Clinton's veto only worked because not enough people know much about their country's founding. Clinton vetoed drilling in ANWAR 13 years ago. If your 10 year figure above is true, we would at least have information that we don't have now, if nothing else. \n \n \nMost of the offshore stuff that we think is or might be there is too deep to do us much good right now. \n\n \n Then why is it profitable for China to go to all the expense to move it's equipment there and get it? \n \n \nChevron has STILL not sanctioned its Jack 2 find in the gulf because they have no way to extract it profitably. Most of the continental shelf drilling that people seem to think we should be doing is 2 MILES deeper than Jack 2. \n\n \n Source? \n \n \nI think there is something to Snakespits post as well. \n\n \n I don't see America seeking world domination. \n \n \n If we are staring peak oil in the face, it makes sense to try to hold some back for the future. \n\n \n Doom and gloom cries that we are staring peak oil in the face have been going on since the 1930's. There's no evidence that it's any more true now than it was then. \n \n \nAs far as individuals and companies making long term plans with current price instability...yes and no. \n\n \n It's yes a whole lot more than it's no, depending on the type of business. If it has to do with transportation, food, infrastructure, etc. then it's yes. If it's gambling, entertainment, etc. then maybe not so much. Real production vs fast buck businesses. My link above referenced the fact that no oil refineries have been built since 1976. It's easy to understand why. MTBE is a gasoline additive intended to increase octane and cut air pollution. After being pressured by environmentalists to use it, they're then sued for it after it's discovered that it pollutes ground water. \n \n http://www.townhall.com/news/business/2008/05/08/oil_companies_agree_to_settle_mtbe_contamination_lawsuits\n \n Small wonder that the ratio of oil refinery construction to gambling casino construction has done a 180 since 1976. \n \n \n \nI have taken several consulting jobs with several fortune 100 companies in the last few years that deal with operations side issues in the face of an assumed peak in oil supply. They have been trying to plan for it, but in truth there is just not a lot of planning that can be done...sometimes you are just screwed.\n\n \n They are screwed TODAY a lot more than they were 50 or 75 years ago, because back then there was far less likelihood of political whims (often environmentalism) causing drastic shifts in the business world. I recently heard somewhere that half the companies on the fortune 500 list in 1980 weren't on the list at all in 1990. The speculation of reasons for it probably vary as much as opinions on how much oil there is in ANWAR. But population shifts and changes in insights which arise from personal freedoms and changes in technology are far more predictable than government mandates such as fuel mileage standards, or foreign corruption in oil prices, or lawsuits over MTBE. \n __________________",

I consider it an act of war on the American economy, and we must respond to it now before it collapses our economy. I pray Bush will do it because if he does, he will insure a Mcain win as the dems will truly go apoplectic at the move revealing for all to see how twisted and anti-american their political perspective is. Add to that the fact that OPEC will immediately increase production in order to lower prices in the hope of reversing his executive orders, it becomes a win win no matter how you cut it. \n \n The bottom line is during the 76 Oil Embargo, the US Congress swore to the American people that they would attain Oil Independence and never allow us to be held hostage by OPEC again because of that debacle, and 32 years, here we are again.

If your 10 year figure above is true, we would at least have information that we don't have now, if nothing else. \n\n \n You are the closest thing to an extreme liberal in this conversation, so I suppose that you would be the correct person to identify their talking points. As far as \"75 cents\", sorry, bud, those are just cold hard facts:\n \n \n http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/anwr-drilling-could-cut-75/story.aspx?guid=%7B26229D0C-EC53-4FF1-BC12-6CE405A403AC%7D&dist=msr_4\n \n \nWASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Producing oil from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska could cut crude oil prices by about 75 cents per barrel by 2025, the Energy Department said Thursday in a special analysis prepared for Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. The price decline would be about 0.6% of the current spot price. Under federal law, no drilling is now allowed in ANWR. Under the most likely case, production would begin in 2018 and peak in 2027 at 780,000 barrels per day, with total production of 2.6 billion barrels\n\n \n That is the Bush energy department speaking there. \n \n You can find the report a few different places online if you look. \n \n Nobody is assuming that environmentalists are automatically right, and frankly it is stupid to assume that environmentalists are the primary force keeping us from drilling in these areas. First of all, the 112 billion barrels that people are citing is total oil in place. We can not recover \"total oil in place\", we recover URRs (ultimately recoverable reserves) which MAY, if we are VERY lucky add up to as much as 30% of total oil in place.\n \n Second, as the peak oil folks have been warning us for several years now, it is not reserves that matter, but rather how fast you can extract them. The simple fact of the matter is that oil production has been essentially flat for the last 4 years and it is looking more and more like just keeping them flat (as opposed to falling) is probably more than we are going to be able to do. The problem is NOT RESERVES. If it was jsut a question of reserves, we would have no problem. The problem is that there is a limit to how fast you can get the stuff out of the ground. THAT is your supply, not the reserves. If you cannot get it out of the ground fast enough to meet demand, you have a problem. \n \n \nThen why is it profitable for China to go to all the expense to move it's equipment there and get it? \n\n \n It is not. What they are hitting are some smaller fields off the coast of cuba...fields that we have known about for years but until recently were unprofitable to work (not enough oil there to be worth the investment).\n \n \nSource? \n\n \n Chevrons reserve figures and 2006/2007 filings. \n \n Here is a pretty decent article abotu jack 2 written by an oil industry insider:\n \n http://oilbeseeingyou.blogspot.com/2006/09/chevrons-jack-2-deep-water-oil.html\n \n \nDoom and gloom cries that we are staring peak oil in the face have been going on since the 1930's. There's no evidence that it's any more true now than it was then. \n\n \n YES, there is. There is a LOT, LOT more evidence. Unlike the 1930s when we were literally UNABLE to track world oil output, today we do it literally every day. The IEA, which is pretty much the entity in charge of that, is calling for major production shortfalls:\n \n http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121139527250011387.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\n \n \nThe world's premier energy monitor is preparing a sharp downward revision of its oil-supply forecast, a shift that reflects deepening pessimism over whether oil companies can keep abreast of booming demand.\n \n The Paris-based International Energy Agency is in the middle of its first attempt to comprehensively assess the condition of the world's top 400 oil fields. Its findings won't be released until November, but the bottom line is already clear: Future crude supplies could be far tighter than previously thought.\n\n \n \nFor several years, the IEA has predicted that supplies of crude and other liquid fuels will arc gently upward to keep pace with rising demand, topping 116 million barrels a day by 2030, up from around 87 million barrels a day currently. Now, the agency is worried that aging oil fields and diminished investment mean that companies could struggle to surpass 100 million barrels a day over the next two decades.\n\n \n \nBut the IEA's pessimism over future supplies has been building for some time. Last summer, the agency warned that OPEC's spare capacity could shrink \"to minimal levels by 2012.\" In November, it said its analysis of projects known to be in the works suggested that the world could face a shortfall by 2015 of as much as 12.5 million barrels a day, unless there was a sharp drop in expected demand. The current IEA work aims to tally the range of investments and projects under way to boost production from the fields in question to get a clearer sense of what to expect in production flows.\n\n \n Frankly saying that there is no more evidence today of a problem than there was in the 1930s is just plain dumb and frankly shows an absolutely appalling lack of knowledge of the subject. This is something that WILL have a major impact on your life. I would suggest you pull your head out of your...er...uh...sand...and take a look at it as opposed to just spewing idiotic, partisan rhetoric. \n \n \n Frankly I deleted the rest of your post because as far as I can tell it is just a \"blame somebody...anybody on the left\" rant. Most large companies have been preparing for this for a couple of years now. Unlike the general public, they generally prefer fact based assessments and contingency planning and there has been strong enough evidence that this may turn out to be a problem available for long enough now that they have taken a look, including looking at mitigation possibilities. True, there is not much that a lot of them can do, but they have at least looked at the issue and tried to get in front of it. \n \n At the end of the day it has become increasingly clear that we have a major supply problem when it comes to oil. Pretending that we can drill our way out of it with domestic resources is just plain stupid and is VERY likely to get a lot of people killed. \n \n I know you like to pretend to be a conservative, but hiding your head in the sand and refusing to acknowledge problems is NOT the conservative way.",

   "NO, go back and look it up. Bush nixed almost all drilling off the shore of florida as a favor to his brother because they (Floridians) were concerned that the big oil rigs would drive down tourism. \n\n \n I never denied what you said! But anyone can see that \"off the shore of Florida\" is only a small part of the total areas (ANWAR, east coast, west coast, etc.) that are politically off limits for drilling. \n \n \nYou are the closest thing to an extreme liberal in this conversation, so I suppose that you would be the correct person to identify their talking points. As far as \"75 cents\", sorry, bud, those are just cold hard facts:\n \n \n http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/anwr-drilling-could-cut-75/story.aspx?guid=%7B26229D0C-EC53-4FF1-BC12-6CE405A403AC%7D&dist=msr_4\n \n \n \n That is the Bush energy department speaking there. \n \n You can find the report a few different places online if you look. \n\n \n Different government reports have different purposes, this ones purpose seems to have been prepared for Senator Stevens of Alaska. Different government reports at different times for different political purposes seem to often conflict - my Cal Thomas links government reports seem to have a different tone than what you have dug up. Their inconsistency and bias is made clear by this one - to make projections in pricing as precise as ~75 cents~ by the year 2025 is simply laughable. \n \n \nNobody is assuming that environmentalists are automatically right, and frankly it is stupid to assume that environmentalists are the primary force keeping us from drilling in these areas. First of all, the 112 billion barrels that people are citing is total oil in place. We can not recover \"total oil in place\", we recover URRs (ultimately recoverable reserves) which MAY, if we are VERY lucky add up to as much as 30% of total oil in place. \n\n \n That is the opinion of you and Dick Durbin. (he's a conservative, right?) With a doom and gloom assumption of no changes in technology. \n \n \nSecond, as the peak oil folks have been warning us for several years now, it is not reserves that matter, but rather how fast you can extract them. \n\n \n Who are \"peak oil folks\"? A government buraucracy? Someone who MAKES A LIVING with doom and gloom predictions? \n \n \nThe simple fact of the matter is that oil production has been essentially flat for the last 4 years and it is looking more and more like just keeping them flat (as opposed to falling) is probably more than we are going to be able to do. The problem is NOT RESERVES. If it was jsut a question of reserves, we would have no problem. The problem is that there is a limit to how fast you can get the stuff out of the ground. THAT is your supply, not the reserves. If you cannot get it out of the ground fast enough to meet demand, you have a problem. \n\n \n There is something in between getting it out of the ground and meeting demand, it also needs to be REFINED, doesn't it? The way to deal with problems is recognize mistakes from the past, make attempts to right them, and not repeat them. It's a conservative thing. \n \n \nIt is not. What they are hitting are some smaller fields off the coast of cuba...fields that we have known about for years but until recently were unprofitable to work (not enough oil there to be worth the investment). \n\n \n Still doesn't make sense for your position. If it's now worth the investment for China, it should be even more worth the investment to us, because we're a lot closer to it. China's getting it and we're not, because they don't have to answer to environmentalists, liberals, \"peak oil folks\" like American oil companies do. \n \n \nChevrons reserve figures and 2006/2007 filings. \n \n Here is a pretty decent article abotu jack 2 written by an oil industry insider:\n \n http://oilbeseeingyou.blogspot.com/2006/09/chevrons-jack-2-deep-water-oil.html \n\n \n With a title of \"Oil Be Seeing You\", and the text of an opinionated, doom and gloom piece. If he's an oil industry insider, he must not like his job. \n \n \nYES, there is. There is a LOT, LOT more evidence. Unlike the 1930s when we were literally UNABLE to track world oil output, today we do it literally every day. The IEA, which is pretty much the entity in charge of that, is calling for major production shortfalls:\n \n http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121139527250011387.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\n\n \n \n Production shortfalls, not necessarily resource shortfalls, as you claim in your \"cold hard facts\" above. FROM YOUR LINK;\n \n \nSome analysts, however, contend that scarcity isn't the issue -- only access to reserves and investment in tapping them. \"We know there is plenty of oil and gas resource in the world,\" says Pete Stark, vice president for industry relations at IHS. He says the difficulties of supply aren't buried in oil fields, but are \"above ground.\" \n\n \n \"Above ground\" - politics and environmentalism. \n \n \nFrankly saying that there is no more evidence today of a problem than there was in the 1930s is just plain dumb and frankly shows an absolutely appalling lack of knowledge of the subject. \n\n \n And you just showed an appalling lack of reading comprehension, I didn't say there was no more evidence of a problem, I said there was no more evidence that we are staring peak oil in the face. \n \n \nThis is something that WILL have a major impact on your life. I would suggest you pull your head out of your...er...uh...sand...and take a look at it as opposed to just spewing idiotic, partisan rhetoric. \n\n \n Since I own and operate a 5mpg diesel truck for a living, I can assure you that it has a major impact on my life right now. I'm wondering why diesel fuel costs so much more than gasoline even though it takes less effort to refine it. I'm looking at things like what AA said about the 1976 Congress assuring us of energy independence, of freedom from OPEC whims, and what can be done about it, and what has caused our failure to do it thus far. I'm thinking about reversing some of our past mistakes that are so glaring since 1976. What are you doing besides spewing idiotic, partisan rhetoric? What have you suggested be done about it in this thread? \n \n \n \nFrankly I deleted the rest of your post because as far as I can tell it is just a \"blame somebody...anybody on the left\" rant. \n\n \n Now you're defending the left, I thought you were a conservative! emoticon_frazzled The rest of my post was actually a realistic look at how things can change in business, the reasons for it, the heavy taxation on oil (non existent less than 100 years ago) the failure of ethanol, the lack of new refineries, there are so many common sense facts, the reasons for them and possible solutions, that your rants simply can't address. \n \n \nMost large companies have been preparing for this for a couple of years now. Unlike the general public, they generally prefer fact based assessments and contingency planning and there has been strong enough evidence that this may turn out to be a problem available for long enough now that they have taken a look, including looking at mitigation possibilities. \n\n \n Mitigation? What, kissing OPEC's a$$? What a conservative you are. \n \n Large companies don't prepare very well if they can't forsee how the general public will react as prices change. I heard on the news the other day that automakers are scrambling to step up production on small cars, and cut back on suv's and f-150's, not because of any planning but because of sudden marketing changes. \n \n \nTrue, there is not much that a lot of them can do, but they have at least looked at the issue and tried to get in front of it. \n\n \n They can do less and less, as government gets bigger and bigger. \n \n \nAt the end of the day it has become increasingly clear that we have a major supply problem when it comes to oil. Pretending that we can drill our way out of it with domestic resources is just plain stupid and is VERY likely to get a lot of people killed. \n\n \n Thank you, Mr. Durbin.",

In this case the purpose of the report was to provide the most likely impact of drilling in ANWAR, and that is what they came up with. It may be too optimistic. Anwar could potentially provide PEAK output of about 780,000 barrels per day, but peak output only lasts for a year or two, and we use about 21 million barrels per day in the US, so you are talking a very small fraction of our daily usage. \n \n The Saudis just announced a 300,000 barrel per day production boost starting NOW, and the price of oil actually went UP $2. \n \n \n \nThat is the opinion of you and Dick Durbin. (he's a conservative, right?) With a doom and gloom assumption of no changes in technology. \n\n \n That is not anybodies \"opinion\". That is just cold, hard, fact.

Someone who MAKES A LIVING with doom and gloom predictions? \n\n \n Guys like Warren Buffet, Pickens, Dick Cheney, and several other industry insiders who make a living by being RIGHT that have been warning us for several years that we were coming up on a production peak when it comes to oil. Cheney first mentioned peak oil nearly 15 years ago at a Haliburton shareholders meeting. \n \n \nThere is something in between getting it out of the ground and meeting demand, it also needs to be REFINED, doesn't it? The way to deal with problems is recognize mistakes from the past, make attempts to right them, and not repeat them. It's a conservative thing. \n\n \n With refieneries running at 83% capacity right now it would not seem that refinery capacity is a problem. If refineries were running at 98% capacity and they were complaining about not having enough capacity you might have a point.\n \n \nStill doesn't make sense for your position. If it's now worth the investment for China, it should be even more worth the investment to us, because we're a lot closer to it. China's getting it and we're not, because they don't have to answer to environmentalists, liberals, \"peak oil folks\" like American oil companies do. \n\n \n They don't have to answer to Jeb Bush, who is trying to protect his states tourism industry you mean because that is LITERALLY the only reason we are not drilling off the coast of florida right now. The Presidents brother said \"do me a favor\". \n \n \nProduction shortfalls, not necessarily resource shortfalls, as you claim in your \"cold hard facts\" above. FROM YOUR LINK;\n \n \"Above ground\" - politics and environmentalism. \n \n\n \n Sure there are above ground factors at work as well, though politics and environmentalism are a lot less of a factor than you might think. A good example of an above ground factor is that the Sauds have just said that they have chosen not to exploit several known fields because they want to leave that oil in place for future generations. The Russians have also scaled back some projects because as their production has started to hit problems they have decided that they would rather produce less now and have more for the long term than try to pull all they have now.\n \n There is HOPEFULLY some of this going on in the US as well. If we exploit all our known oil resources today it will maybe make a difference of 50 cents at the pump. If we leave some of that oil in the ground for another 20 years that oil will not mean the difference between paying $3.50 and paying $4 at the pump, it will mean the difference between having medication or not...or having 100 million people starve to death in the US or not. Look at it as underground storage and be proud of the fact that we in the US are capable of showing the same foresight as the sauds...or do you really hate your children so much that you would doom them to a life without essential medication and chemicals just so you can save a few bucks on gas today???\n \n \n \nAnd you just showed an appalling lack of reading comprehension, I didn't say there was no more evidence of a problem, I said there was no more evidence that we are staring peak oil in the face. \n\n \n No, I did not misread it, and I stand by my statement. There is a LOT more evidence.\n \n \nSince I own and operate a 5mpg diesel truck for a living, I can assure you that it has a major impact on my life right now. I'm wondering why diesel fuel costs so much more than gasoline even though it takes less effort to refine it.

The gasoline market, while not exaclty flexible, IS a lot more flexible than the diesel fuel market. I feel your pain on this one. One of my remaining business interests includes an operation that burns between 6000 and 10,000 gallons of diesel per month to run a couple of massive generators. I write a check for that at the beginning of every month. It hurts.\n \n Frankly the idea that your position is somehow superior here because you put forth a bunch of ideas that are easily proven to be unrealistic is laughable. You want some ideas? You are not going to like them. We do not currently have the technology to fix this problem and continue our way of life. It simply cannot be done. Our way of life depends heavily on cheap oil, without that it jsut cant be done. There may well come the day when new technology provides us with a replacement energy supply that is comparable but we are decades away from that, so all we can do now is try to push by until we come up with something better.\n \n First, we institute a $5000 per year large vehicle tax on SUVs, pickups, etc... with exemptions for people who need them for their work (construction industry, farmers, etc...). This would cut oil prices by as much as 25% and is a good start.\n \n Then we roll back environmental regulations on coal fired process plants to pre-Bush levels. This would allow industry to replace oil products with coal in a lot of processes and would also make it easier to exploit CTL technologies. \n \n Next we start working on our transport infrastructure. Remove environmental impact studies from intermodal transport site requirements and work out a new sytem of imminent domain that railroad operators can use to build new track. \n \n \nNow you're defending the left, I thought you were a conservative! emoticon_frazzled The rest of my post was actually a realistic look at how things can change in business, the reasons for it, the heavy taxation on oil (non existent less than 100 years ago) the failure of ethanol, the lack of new refineries, there are so many common sense facts, the reasons for them and possible solutions, that your rants simply can't address. \n\n \n Not defending the left.

Are you on crack? There is NO taxation on oil, and the avergae royalty paid on a barrel of oil in the US is less than $2. Total taxes on gas amount to about 50 cents. Is that what you are talking about? And more important, are you really foolish enough to blame this on a 50 cent tax on gas?? If we were to do away with the gas tax, how do you propose we pay for our roads...or as a hyper liberal liek Bush do you just not worry abotu how we pay for things??\n \n \nMitigation? What, kissing OPEC's a$$? What a conservative you are. \n \n Large companies don't prepare very well if they can't forsee how the general public will react as prices change. I heard on the news the other day that automakers are scrambling to step up production on small cars, and cut back on suv's and f-150's, not because of any planning but because of sudden marketing changes. \n \n\n \n ROTFLMAO. The American consumer is extremely predictable. That is not a problem. Automakers were not caught flat footed on this. In fact, GM announced last year that they were probably over-producing pickups and SUVs, but those were the only really profitable business segments for them so they kept doing it.",

   "Your article specifically talked about drilling off the coast of Florida. \n\n \n Not hardly, here's part of it again. \n \n \nFrom ANWR to off-shore development such as Lease Area 181 in the Gulf of Mexico, we have identified oil and natural gas reserves that can be developed and used responsibly. Yet time and time again efforts to increase supply, and reduce prices, are blocked. For instance, ten years ago President Clinton vetoed development in ANWR. \n\n \n \n \nGuys like Warren Buffet, Pickens, Dick Cheney, and several other industry insiders who make a living by being RIGHT that have been warning us for several years that we were coming up on a production peak when it comes to oil. Cheney first mentioned peak oil nearly 15 years ago at a Haliburton shareholders meeting. \n\n \n No one listened apparantly, or prices would have risen steadily over the last 15 years, without this several hundred percent skyrocketing that's going on today. \n \n \nWith refieneries running at 83% capacity right now it would not seem that refinery capacity is a problem. If refineries were running at 98% capacity and they were complaining about not having enough capacity you might have a point. \n\n \n How about if they were running at 83% capacity, and making it clear that much new drilling at all would overwhelm them? Or if they were asking about lessening efficiency and ever increasing maintenance of 32 year and older facilities? I can't document that they are, but it does make sense. \n \n \nThey don't have to answer to Jeb Bush, who is trying to protect his states tourism industry you mean because that is LITERALLY the only reason we are not drilling off the coast of florida right now. The Presidents brother said \"do me a favor\". \n\n \n He told him his tourists would much rather see China drilling off his coast than they would U.S. companies? \n \n \nSure there are above ground factors at work as well, though politics and environmentalism are a lot less of a factor than you might think. A good example of an above ground factor is that the Sauds have just said that they have chosen not to exploit several known fields because they want to leave that oil in place for future generations. The Russians have also scaled back some projects because as their production has started to hit problems they have decided that they would rather produce less now and have more for the long term than try to pull all they have now. \n\n \n I don't agree, but there's really nothing more to say about it. When it comes to U.S. \"access to reserves and investment in tapping them\" I don't consider success or failure of U.S. access and investment to be completely (or even largely) controlled by our enemies. If it is, I can't think of a higher political priority than to change that. \n \n \nThere is HOPEFULLY some of this going on in the US as well. If we exploit all our known oil resources today it will maybe make a difference of 50 cents at the pump. If we leave some of that oil in the ground for another 20 years that oil will not mean the difference between paying $3.50 and paying $4 at the pump, it will mean the difference between having medication or not...or having 100 million people starve to death in the US or not.

Also, when we're talking about the drastic price increases of oil today, ($19 in 1995 vs over $130 and quickly climbing today) it's about more than just saving a couple of bucks, it's about an economic collapse. Both would be comparably disastrous to future generations. I guess I'd rather take care of children I see toddling around today, than I would children that won't be born for another 100 years. I do think the latter will see oil completely replaced. We can't prepare for it in any way today, any more than late 19th century America could prepare for the changeover from horses to gasoline engines. \n \n \nDiesel is more expensive than gasoline due to supply and demand factors. The gasoline market, while not exaclty flexible, IS a lot more flexible than the diesel fuel market. \n\n \n Why is that? I'm not doubting you, I'd like it explained to me. \n \n It looks to me like extra high diesel prices are political - fewer diesel buyers, less public outcry, even though the public pays for it in higher product prices. They don't feel it like they are when they're standing at the gas pump. \n \n \nI feel your pain on this one. One of my remaining business interests includes an operation that burns between 6000 and 10,000 gallons of diesel per month to run a couple of massive generators. I write a check for that at the beginning of every month. It hurts. \n\n \n Be glad it's got that funny color to it, meaning you don't have to pay road use tax on it. But really I'm not complaining all that much, things work out. Less solvent O/O's than me are dropping out, leaving more work, nice pay increases, and more choice for me. But I'm not bragging either, with fuel increasing 20 to 30 cents per week, pay increases can't keep up. They won't until prices stabilize, then they will - the work has to be done. (short of an economic collapse, that is) \n \n \nFrankly the idea that your position is somehow superior here because you put forth a bunch of ideas that are easily proven to be unrealistic is laughable. You want some ideas? You are not going to like them. We do not currently have the technology to fix this problem and continue our way of life. It simply cannot be done.

This would cut oil prices by as much as 25% and is a good start.\n\n \n Not conservative at all, that's liberal, social engineering at it's best. That throws vehicle manufacturers into a tailspin. It's what I was talking about when I said that companies can't plan. How can ANY business plan anything, with even the slightest possibility that government can immediately throw that huge monkey wrench in the works? \"Exemptions for people who need them\" - big opening for corruption there. In the meantime, RV / camping business fail, putting economy-car-driving people out of work.\n \n \nThen we roll back environmental regulations on coal fired process plants to pre-Bush levels. This would allow industry to replace oil products with coal in a lot of processes and would also make it easier to exploit CTL technologies. \n\n \n Pre-Bush levels? Bush put environmental regulations on coal, and Clinton did not? Other than your implication that Bush is the villain, it's a good idea. FAR more unrealistic than drilling for more oil however. Environmentalists would have a field day with that one. I can just see TV commercials showing a coal miner, black with soot, dusting himself off while a nearby child coughs. I can hear Charles Gibson and Katie Couric reporting it. Too much emotion involved. \n \n \nNext we start working on our transport infrastructure. Remove environmental impact studies from intermodal transport site requirements and work out a new sytem of imminent domain that railroad operators can use to build new track. \n\n \n Again, a great idea but far more unrealistic than drilling for oil. Imminent domain lawyers and environmentalists make nice livings with transportation right-of-way cases. They're not going to let it happen. Gibson and Couric would help them out. \n \n \nNot defending the left. Just demanding that there be some reality in the conversation as opposed to the pathetic mudslinging that some who claim to be on the \"right\" seem to believe is conversation. \n\n \n It goes both ways. When I point out no new refinery construction in 32 years, Clintons ANWAR veto, the failure of ethanol, etc. and it makes sense that these things are problems that we don't need to repeat, is it really worse mudslinging than the things you say? \n \n \nHevy taxationon oil??? Are you on crack? There is NO taxation on oil, and the avergae royalty paid on a barrel of oil in the US is less than $2. Total taxes on gas amount to about 50 cents. Is that what you are talking about? \n\n \n \n \n Thaaaat's what I'm talking about, that measly little 50 cents per gallon. Long ago (mid seventies) I worked for the Kroger food store company. As a young guy in the store planning dept. I was shocked to see that the average food store BACK THEN took in $100,000 gross per week. 7 or 8 checkouts. I can only guess what the big food stores do per week today, $1/2 to $1 million maybe, with 10 or 11 checkouts? Pause a few minutes and gaze at the checkout activity at your local busy food store sometime, then do the same at your local busy Shell station. See if the dollars are flying by at the checkout at the same rate they are at the gas pumps. (they won't be - gas pumps are much faster) Ponder what that Shell station grosses per week, then divide that by about 8 to get your 50 cents per gallon. There is a reason I used the \"millions of dollars per second\" in my post to AA. emoticon_idea \n \n \nAnd more important, are you really foolish enough to blame this on a 50 cent tax on gas?? If we were to do away with the gas tax, how do you propose we pay for our roads...or as a hyper liberal liek Bush do you just not worry abotu how we pay for things?? \n\n \n I don't believe ALL gasoline tax goes for nothing but roads, they're not paved with gold. And I know that there are other sources to pay for roads. I pay about $2000 per year in licensing and road use taxes. So do a few other truck owners. \n \n \nROTFLMAO. The American consumer is extremely predictable. That is not a problem. Automakers were not caught flat footed on this. In fact, GM announced last year that they were probably over-producing pickups and SUVs, but those were the only really profitable business segments for them so they kept doing it.\n\n \n But they had no way of knowing that gasoline/diesel was going up this fast, consequently, they had no idea that buying habits were going to change this fast. Simple supply and demand don't cause prices to go up this fast, politics combined with foreign relation problems do.",

Did....Limbaugh, Liddy, Cal Thomas, Michael Medved, Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Dick Cheney, George Bush, Newt Gingrich, used to be liberal Democrats? \n \n \nDo you really not realize that when I talk about neocons being liberals that I am not slinging mud...I am just putting forth a historcial fact...that the neocons came from the ultra liberal branch of the democratic party.

You are arguing that the price increase is based on increased competition demands for a limited amount of oil that can be harvested by OPEC to dole out to all of its customers. And that just isn't true at all. What is causing the rise in prices is the restrictions OPEC has placed on production. Here, from an article today: http://www.yahoo.com/s/896195 which clearly shows that OPECS actions are politically motivated.\n OPEC sees no need to pump more after price surge June 8, 11:04 am ET \n By Simon Webb\n \n DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC members saw no need on Sunday to pump more oil in response to last week's double-digit surge in oil prices to over $139 a barrel that top exporter Saudi Arabia described as unjustified.\n \n More pain was coming for consuming economies hurting from record fuel costs as prices were likely to climb further, officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said.\n \n Oil soared more than $16 a barrel - over 13 percent - in a two-day rally on Thursday and Friday on weakness in the U.S. dollar and rising tension between Israel and Iran.\n \n \"I think there is enough oil in the market,\" Shokri Ghanem, head of OPEC member Libya's National Oil Corporation, told Reuters in a telephone interview.\n \n Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is the only OPEC member with capacity to boost output quickly and significantly.\n \n But Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi and his Pakistani counterpart met on Sunday and agreed that the price rise was unjustified and unrelated to market fundamentals, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.\n \n Consuming governments have put pressure on OPEC, supplier of more than a third of the world's oil, to boost output to ease the effect of high oil prices on their economies. Germany's government voiced its concern on Sunday about the impact of oil's rally.\n \n \"The increase of the oil prices is becoming a real threat to the worldwide economy,\" Germany's Economy Minister Michael Glos told Reuters.\n \n $150 OIL?\n \n OPEC blames factors beyond its control, including speculation and international political tension, for the price rises. Those factors could take prices even higher soon, said Iran's OPEC representative Muhammad Ali Khatibi.\n \n \"I forecast that by the end of summer the price of oil will reach $150 a barrel,\" Mohammad Ali Khatibi was quoted as saying by Iran's state broadcaster.\n \n Iran is OPEC's second largest oil producer and the deepening dispute with the West over Tehran's nuclear ambitions has contributed to oil's rally.\n Now don't get me wrong; I'm not denying the bolded in your statement above at all. What I am saying is that OPEC is artificially forcing the price up by limiting the supply they are able to deliver if they only chose to do the right thing. As we can also see, this gouging on OPECs part is disrupting the economies of many Countries. Not just the USA. And I'm not defending our wastefulness in the gas guzzlers we own, but none of that trumps the fact that OPEC is gouging the US market which is responsible for giving them the technology needed to harvest the Oil that they are manipulating the market with.\n \n I have seen reports that the US has access to 300 years worth of Oil Reserves we aren't even attempting to harvest. I can assure you that if we tapped those sources and made ourselves completely oil independent, in 300 years, we will have perfected other energy sources such as Solar, wind, fuel cells and even ionic, hydrogen or geothermal energy power. And I haven't mentioned all of the options for power being studied today. Even though we have made great strides forward with many of these technologies, in 300 years they will be perfected and can be placed where they are most naturally beneficial in order to create a complete and very clean universal energy grid.

Half the people on this planet don't even get enough to eat.\n\n \n Hi jskufan, I don't know how old you are, but during the oil embargo of 1973 I was one of five guys who had to sit in a line each morning at 5AM with my families company vehicles as gas was rationed out. And neither was that shortage caused by an actual shortage, but was due to with holding oil in order to raise the cost of the barrel of oil which sold for around 2.70 a barrel and reflected a price of around 35 cents a gallon at the pump for gasoline.\n \n It should also be noted that the oil embargo of 73 was the death nell for the large gas guzzling American car, and led to the advent of the japanese import. Toyota comes to mind as one of the earliest imports from Japan, and Datsun also, which is called Nissan today. My buddy owned a Datsun 510 which was a neat little car and very fuel efficient too. \n \n With that said, regarding your statement that unless forced to seek alternative energy sources, we wont do it; or that as long as oil is cheap we will avoid seeking green, or cleaner fuel sources, I agree that it might slow it down, or give us time to not rush the development of the technology. But if you google any of the fuel technologies I referred to above, you will find many pages on the work being done in each field.\n \n I think that for reasons of Global Warming alone and the concerns that come with that issue alone, I think the juggernaut of green energy sources is here to stay no matter how cheap and plentiful oil is. I know that if the US actually did tap enough oil fields to guarantee us 300 years worth of oil, I would never vote to discontinue research for other sources or energy. Remember my friend, no matter how many green energy sources we perfected, OIL will always be needed in order to lubricate moving parts in machines which moves the industries that support our civilizations at all levels of production. So oil will always be a key component as a commodity. The goal is to make it less important than it currently is though as an energy source.",

And neither was that shortage caused by an actual shortage, but was due to with holding oil in order to raise the cost of the barrel of oil which sold for around 2.70 a barrel and reflected a price of around 35 cents a gallon at the pump for gasoline.\n \n It should also be noted that the oil embargo of 73 was the death nell for the large gas guzzling American car, and led to the advent of the japanese import. Toyota comes to mind as one of the earliest imports from Japan, and Datsun also, which is called Nissan today. My buddy owned a Datsun 510 which was a neat little car and very fuel efficient too. \n\n \n Actually, I believe my age is in my profile, :). Comparing the oil embargo to the present situation admittedly isn't accurate. However, then as now, we are reminded that we are completely reliant on foreign oil. Our national security and domestic economy are highly dependant on foreign oil. It puts us in the awkward position of relying on foreign countries, some of whom really don't like us very much. I remember some of our early attempts at building small, fuel efficient cars. I personally owned a Ford Pinto. American car companies got caught back then with their pants down, and the same thing is happening to them all over again. While the rest of the world has never strayed from small, fuel efficient cars, the big three have been spoon feeding American consumers giant gas guzzlers for the last several years. \"If you build them, they will come\". Was it really that hard to predict the price of oil rising with the industrialization of the Asian markets??? Where was all that extra supply supposed to come from??? What's happened to steel? copper? lead? Unfortunately now we're getting suckered into grain based alternatives so the prices of all our food items are rising as well. How many gallons of oil does it take to make a gallon of ethanol? emoticon_confused If we're not carefull, we'll have a nation of corn farmers and no one will be able to afford a loaf of bread.",

I think we are getting tied up with semantics. Everything you say in this part of your post is true and accurate. \n \n \n Was it really that hard to predict the price of oil rising with the industrialization of the Asian markets???

How many gallons of oil does it take to make a gallon of ethanol? emoticon_confused If we're not carefull, we'll have a nation of corn farmers and no one will be able to afford a loaf of bread.\n\n \n I don't even disagree with your complaints here except to add that although we're getting sucked into these loser moves, I see no reason to use corn or grain for fuel when as I said above, we know right where 300 years worth of oil is. All we need to do is pump it out and refine it. But I'm sure we wont do the right thing as a Government or a Nation because the powers that be are playing games that you and I have no way of knowing the intended agenda, much less the rules. All we are in that game is the pawns to be used like so much currency. \n \n Even though I agree with you that we have consumed ourselves into this problem by not doing exactly what the politicians promised they would after the last embargo of 73, I refuse to take sole responsibility for the rise in price at the pump today because we all know that OPEC is limiting production to force prices up all over the world. And responsibility for that lies directly and solely with them, not us. We are the loyal customers getting gouged by our supplier.\n \n I have become very jaded in my outlook for America's future as is obvious by the e-mail I sent to our illustrious President which I posted above on this thread. http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=311778&postcount=5 I hoped he might have the stones to do the right thing. But obviously there are powers that be whom he is beholding that trumps his loyalty to the people he was elected to serve. :xbanghead \n \n Just don't think that anything will change if a democrat wins and we wont have anything at all to disagree on. emoticon_xgood",

   "I think that for reasons of Global Warming alone and the concerns that come with that issue alone, I think the juggernaut of green energy sources is here to stay no matter how cheap and plentiful oil is. I know that if the US actually did tap enough oil fields to guarantee us 300 years worth of oil, I would never vote to discontinue research for other sources or energy.\n\n Maybe not, but the kind of massive, commercially-focused development programme those sources of energy require to become a viable part of our lives isn't something government funded research is particularly efficient at realising. I don't think it's realistic to expect research that is focused on securing further government funding to necessarily yield products that will meet the needs and desires of consumers.\n \n The truth is, we've had cheap oil for ages and alternative sources have not seen significant investment - and the reason for that is that even optimistic mid-range forecasts of the price of energy from those sources ran higher than the price of traditional fuels. Maybe in today's climate (cough) our ecological consciences will nudge people towards paying extra for green energy - a bit like paying extra for organically produced food - but I think that might be a thin straw at which to clutch. Paying extra out of a desire to appear socially responsible is, like organic food and the Toyota Prius, an indulgence for the well-off middle classes.

Most every technological advancement enjoyed by the civilian population of the USA today arose directly from Government supported research. Our Space program has contributed to incredible technological advancements from GPS, the Internet, Cell Technology, electronic miniaturization, biological and medical discoveries from zero gravitation experiments done in Space to mention just a few scientific disciplines that have revolutionized our lives as Americans.\n \n Now regarding energy production, how about the Government subsidized fuel cell technology: \n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/31/AR2007053101607_pf.html \n Japan, through its various energy companies and in cooperation with Ballard and Ballard's competitors (yes, the fuel-cell industry is now rife with rivalry), rapidly is increasing the number of fuel-cell power units installed in buildings. The technology, largely government-subsidized, is so popular in Japan that the country's energy companies are beginning to run fuel-cell advertisements on TV.\n \n And fuel cells are beginning to show up in sectors largely invisible to the media and the public. A fuel-cell powered forklift, anyone? They are beginning to be used in factories and other materials-handling businesses worldwide.\n \n Also, the next time a storm or other disaster short-circuits the grid power going to your local cellphone tower, fuel-cell backup power could keep you connected thanks to unhappy lessons learned during disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n \n Traditional lead-acid battery backup devices ran out of juice several hours after the storm, disrupting first-responder communications as well as communications among families and friends. Now, many telecommunication companies are saying that hydrogen-powered fuel cells would have kept those cellphone towers working longer and more reliably.\n \n But, as Sheridan said, continued development and application of the technology amounts to a long-distance race. But at least he and Ballard now appear to be gaining more political backing in that endeavor from provincial and state governments in Canada and the United States, as evidenced by Ballard's prominent role last week here at the Pacific Economic Summit's Clean Energy Conference.\n \n Both Gordon Campbell, premier of British Columbia, and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger cited Ballard for its contributions to the development of alternative energy. But perhaps the most useful comments came from Campbell, who urged governments and environmental groups worldwide to abandon the silliness of trying to pit one technology against another.\n And didn't the Government perfect the Nuclear Technology that is now used to power civilian population centers? Every avenue of energy technology is usually supported by Government oversight of some sort, if for no other reason than to make sure it's safe for consumer and public consumption.",

   "I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE!\n\n \n Then, we shouldn't drill in our backyards until we need to...but, we should suck all of their oil dry all the while seeking alternative energy sources.\n \n That way, when most of the world's oil does run dry, we'll still have something left to squeeze by for a few years.\n And during that time, we wage wars of conquest and extermination.\n \n Thus, I support wars of conquest and extermination now in the name of 'Blood for Oil' so that when it's all gone...we can still wage such wars.\n \n Sounds all logical to me.\n \n And, once all of these wars of conquest and extermination are over and won...we'll have a nice peaceful world to live in. Maybe like a 1,000 years worth of peace or even more. \n \n And I propose the use of non-exterminated populations as an alternative to the need for fuels...almost an 'alternative fuel source' if you will.\n I'd call this practice 'juicing'. As that's a good analogy to what we should do...and the practice of 'slavery' is illegal so we can't call it that.\n \n Oh, and I think with a little imagination we could use the excess human byproducts like fat from the conquored populations as an energy source.\n Anyone know how much energy burning a human body produces?

And that whole concept is just plain wrong on so many levels in my opinion. \n \n I mean, do we allow lumber companies to price gouge their customers just before and immediately after a hurricane or Tornado in order to increase steel 2x4 sales, or to motivate development of new house building materials? Of course we don't. The thought of endorsing what is happening now with oil prices in order to justify our need for alternate fuel sources is totally repugnant to me. We in fact, fine companies for raising their prices during times when Natural Catastrophes occur here in the USA.\n \n \n \nArtificially induced or not, the current oil situation is merely a shadow cast by the oncoming storm.\n \n \n I disagree again Peeling. OPEC is made up of, I believe 12 separate Countries. Each of which have huge oil deposits. Combined, they have access to enough Oil to supply the Worlds needs for many centuries to come. What is happening now is purely Political and is being propagated by Iran and the other Anti-American Countries that want to punish us for our support for Israel and our stance on radical islam. Pure and simple, this is an ideological war and the oil is their pawn.\n \n \nThat 300 years worth of oil won't last nearly as long when it's having to power the whole world - or were you planning on keeping it all for yourselves?

And if our oil wells were under any threat at all, it wouldn't be for lack of sharing it, it would be to destroy our supplies by radical islam, in order to once again make us dependent upon their oil at their price. \n \n \nNo. I think now is the time to bite the bullet, while we still have some control over how painful the process is. If we put it off and get it wrong, there'll be suffering on a truly unprecedented scale. It might be the end of us entirely.\n \n \n I agree that making an all out commitment to new energy sources NOW is paramount. But only while we simultaneously gain oil independence. And the reason for that is that no matter how technologically advanced we become, we will ALWAYS need an oil supply as the lubricant that keeps our machines running. I understand we have synthetic lubricants now such as graphite, but they are more expensive to produce than oil so they aren't viable replacements. A 0.21 tube of graphite for example, is $1.51 today, and that is a discounted price. See the link: http://www.drillspot.com/products/346351/Tube-O-Lube_31644G_Dry_Powder_Graphite_Lubricant So nothing we can synthetically manufacture will automatically replace our thirst or need for oil, even if we never need to refine another gallon of it for gasoline again, some day. Do the math and figure out the cost for 1 pound of graphite lubricant if you want a heart pounding shock. So the need for crude oil is far from being replaced synthetically.\n \n \nI recall someone making the very good point recently that if our present civilisation collapses, we may never be able to rebuild, because the only natural resources left are all but inaccessible except by the most advanced modern technology - which we wouldn't be able to recreate because we wouldn't have the resources available to do it. We've burned through almost 4,000,000,000 years of the Earth's goodwill in a couple of hundred years; I think we need to do some growing up, real quick.\n\n \n I marvel at how quickly people forget that due to the repercussions of only 3000 deaths on 9/11/01 how close our economy came to completely collapsing. Tourism, the Airlines, Car Sales and Home Sales crashed simultaneously leading to an economic crisis of monumental proportions. The ensuing panic in Manufacturing and in retail sales led to massive layoffs. Had we had a President that went into appeasement mode and attempted to tax the Government out of that crisis by raising taxes on the American people, we may very well be a third world country by now. But Bush lowered the taxes and offensively propelled us forward through the fear and apprehension of that time. \n \n What truly shocked me about that experience was how fragile the whole infrastructure we rely on is. If the RITs can get 7 nuclear suitcase bombs into the USA, which I believe they can, or have already accomplished, they can level the NY financial district, Washington DC and all 5 of our Port Shipping Operations, we will immediately, within seconds of that event become a third world country which we will NEVER recover from.\n \n As for burning through 4 billion years of natural resources in a couple of hundred years, that is just more fear mongering as we have plenty of untapped oil available for the taking under every Continent and most every Country on Earth. Just as we can drill just 10 feet down \"almost\" anywhere on Earth and find water, so can we drill down between 3000 and 5000 feet \"almost\" anywhere on Earth and find Oil and natural Gas which are usually found together.",

And that whole concept is just plain wrong on so many levels in my opinion.\n\n But you're in favour of subsidies to make green technology more attractive, right? Subsidies which have to be paid for via tax, which you'll end up paying, one way or another, on top of what you're paying for oil anyway.\n \n My point is that oil prices are going to rise. The developed world has enjoyed a honeymoon period of profligate consumption at rock-bottom prices, and that time is coming to an end. Several billion extra people are in the process of becoming oil consumers; there's no way output can keep up. This is just a taster of what's to come.

   "No nuclear plants have been built in the past 20 years. Why? Environmentalists will not allow it.\n\n Even if you're right - and I think again you're over-simplifying in order to blame people you don't like - that doesn't mean 'they' are wrong. Waste management technology is inadequate to handle the kind of massive proliferation required to make a significant dent in global energy needs. Nor is the rest of the technology chain (including extraction and enrichment) in place to support upscaling of nuclear power usage. It's not just about building reactors. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for nuclear power - but we need to know what we're doing before we make it the backbone of our economies.\n \nOur domestic oil production has dropped by 22 percent since the last energy crisis. Again, radical environmentalism is working against any new drilling.\n\n Again, are 'they' wrong to be concerned? I'm concerned about new drilling, not because I think some dewy-eyed deer might bump its fuzzy little head on the pipeline, but because it's fixing the wrong problem. We have a choice: we can continue to ramp up production to meet demand, foster greater oil dependency in developing countries, and slam headlong into the brick wall of depleted reserves at ninety miles an hour, killing everyone, or we can start applying the brakes now, reducing our dependence upon oil and simultaneously giving us more stopping distance.\n \nDid you know that Rocky Mountain shale oil holds more than six times as much potential oil reserves as Saudi Arabia -- enough to fuel America well into the next century?\n\n I heard three times, myself, but never mind. Even if you don't care about the environmental damage current methods of oil shale recovery involves, you're still thinking short-term; you're still saying we should just carry on as we are and let our grandkids foot the bill. \n \n All this about how you would vote to continue research into alternative fuels is as meaningless now as it has been for the last few decades. The profligacy of western cultures - with America leading the way - has gone nowhere but up. The growing public concern for the environment you insist will see us right had no effect on sales of gas-guzzlers - on the contrary, they continued to increase. Recently, they've crashed - why? Because fuel became more expensive.\n \n You said it yourself: we need oil for all kinds of things and will continue to need it for those purposes a heck of a lot longer than a few hundred years. So let's act now and preserve those precious resources for uses where there is no substitute. In the long term, other energy sources may become more viable, but in the short term we may just have to bite the bullet and focus on economy: saving money by using less power, rather than by making power cheaper.",
