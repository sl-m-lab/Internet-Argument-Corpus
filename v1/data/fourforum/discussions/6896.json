   "I never said people are insane because they may want to commit suicide or even kill for that matter. It has nothing to do with insanity but perception. Most humans are \"normal\" in the mental capacity, but we all have our own little quirks, but most of us our \"normal\" unless one is diagnosed with a mental retardation or mental disorder, pretty much we all are \"mentally the same\". Even someone who kills is not necessarily insane, they are very \"normal\". \n \n Anger is a reason (not the only reason) why people commit violence and even murder. Because we get angry, doesn't mean we are \"insane\", when some people get angry, they calm down and do nothing, others might be violent towards another, and others will kill another because they are angry, and at no point does \"insanity\" come into the picture, but moreso, one's perception is the key reason why people react the way they do. \n \n Even people with depression or physical pain where they want to commit suicide, does not mean they are insane, farthest from the truth. When I say faulty thinking, its more like not having the knowledge or resources to lift them out of their situation. For example, when we had the great drepression in America, and men were jumping out of the windows committing suicide because of financial loss, they didn't go insane, but they \"viewed\" money more important than life itself, their perception/way of thinking is faulty because they may felt like they dug a hole to big to get out and not knowing how to get out, they commit suicide. When we all know if someone can teach us methods of coping then almost everything can be dealt with.\n \n As for the girl in your example zach. I couldn't tell you what was in her mind. Was she ever insane? No.\n \n Every person is different when they internalize pain. Years of emotional abuse and other abuse, she filtered it the only way she knew how, being from parent who were from China ( I believe), this girl may have perceived a cultural obstacle as well, who knows its all speculation, only she knows her true intentions. Even so, at no point do I think this child was ever insane, and quite opposite she is very brilliant, but COPING, its all about coping, and if no one is showing her how to cope with her anger, and she has to find the answers herself, then her way of thinking is faulty when she commits murder (not insane). At no point was this girl crazy, no one was there to show her how to cope and redirect her anger.",

   "Should we or should we not. It's an ethical question and one not easy to answer. Religious belief says you must not kill, and therefore killing a person whether he's healthy and happy, or living in permanent agony from terminal disease, is a crime against GOD. The profound belief to preserve life, has made difficult to legislate Euthanasia. The only country (which I know of) in the world where it's legal for doctors to perform euthanasia, is The Netherlands. Doctors can choose to turn off the the machine which keeps a terminally ill patient alive. They can choose not to give a suffering patient his medicine, etc. However there has been some controvercy, because questions have been asked whether or not some patients where in fact terminally ill or not. It has come to attention that some doctors \"abuse\" this right, and choose not to treat patients as they see fit. Personally I think it should be illegal, mainly because of the dilemma as to when it should be used and when it should not.",
