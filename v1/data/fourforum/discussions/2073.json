   "I was originally going to respond with some sincere comments about creating coherent statements, etc., but I have had those deleted by moderators in the past. So I didn't.\n \n \nJust look up moral relativism on the web \n google search \"moral relativism definition\" will do it.\n\n Close - Consider that the morals taught by Christianity are essentially moral relativism on a larger scale. Consider that even within Christianity, you could pick almost any topic and find that different branches teach and preach a different morality with different values. Of course you can say that The Bible is where all true absolute moral values come from. But there isn't universal agreement on how to interpret the Bible in all areas of morality. As far as I'm aware, there's only one 'denomination' that can trace their teachings of morality back to the time of Christ, and all other denominations are some segment that broke off from the original Christian church. Why did we experience these splits in the church? I don't claim to have an absolute answer to that question, but it seems a lot like moral relativism to me... (I don't like this or that aspect about what this church teaches. Rather, I interpret the Bible differently, and my conscience is not at peace. So, I am going to go over here and start a new church that teaches my interpretation of the Bible.)\n \n And the above assumes that Christianity holds the key to absolute moral values! What about all the other faiths, religions, and belief systems of the world?\n \n The fact is, in the physical world, any concept of 'value' is fabricated based on perception. To make a value judgment (good, bad, right, wrong), you must have a basis for making that judgment. The fact is, in the physical world, X is X. If something happens, something happens. What you make that mean to you and the value you place upon it and the impact that it has upon you is completely up to you. Nobody can force you to believe something. For example, it is possible that you might feel guilty when you do something 'wrong.' You would be making yourself feel guilty. No one else can do that for you.\n \n If you choose to adhere to traditional Christian teachings (with which there is nothing inherently 'wrong,' by the way), your perception will likely be based in these teachings. And so your value judgments will likely be similar to others with similar perceptions. Your perception may be that you believe God instilled absolute moral values in us and wrote them on our hearts. But that's only your perception... your belief. You don't even KNOW with certainty that there is a God. You only BELIEVE. And assume for a moment that God did write these moral values on our hearts. How do you know that God didn't write something else on someone else's heart? (Maybe He just wanted to keep things interesting for us???)\n \n Question for you, Close --< Do you believe our way of life is the way we were meant to live? I'm interested in your answer, but I'll tell you my opinion at the same time. There is not one 'right' way to live. There are many ways to live. No one way is 'better' than any other way. Certain ways of living have certain consequences.",

   "\"Moral Relativism\" assumes \"neutral\" morals, which, to me, is a contradiction.

   "[edited]\n \n...their actions are immoral.\n\n This is your opinion. You are entitled to it. It is not, however, an absolute truth. If you label the actions 'immoral,' you must have a pre-determined definition of what is 'immoral.' According to this definition, the actions may be determined to be immoral. But the definition that YOU use for what is immoral is not necessarily the same definition that another person may use. You see... we have been through this before in a different thread (http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2026). To claim there is an absolute moral 'right' and 'wrong,' there must be a universal standard that applies to every single individual in all contexts. If such a standard exists, where is it? What is it? How can we know it?\n \n In the thread to which I am referring, you suggested that the Bible is the universal standard. Yet I asked what is the standard for interpreting the Bible and applying it to everyday situations? In answer to that question, you referred me to a website (http://www.kenanderson.net/bible/index.html) which states explicity:\n \nThere are so many opinions and interpretations of the Bible that it is difficult to know just how we can sift through them all and find the truth. Why do people disagree over what the Bible says? The answer is not in the Bible itself, but in its readers.\n\n So, Ken Anderson appears to be suggesting that the absolute moral truth is in the Bible, but whether that truth can be extracted properly depends on the reader. So... in the end, who claims to have the 'proper' understanding of the Bible? Is there just one 'right' way to understand the Bible? Or can the Bible speak to different people in different ways? \n \n \nPlease read the following link, and the page that follows it. They explain how I feel about this subject.\n\n I quote this link:\n \"Morality refers to a doctrine or system of conduct relative to principles of right and wrong behavior.\" [emphasis mine]\n Even the definition provided here states that morality is relative to principles of right and wrong behavior. What are those principles? \n \n Morality relies on duality in order to make judgments. There must be a good and there must be a bad. There must be a right and there must be a wrong. By the definition of morality stated in the link, we must first have a set of principles of right and wrong behavior. If we ascribe to a system of morality, then, yes, there is a right and a wrong. But in the absence of a system of morality, then this duality disappears as the illusion that it is.\n \n Please note that there is a distinction between 'lack of morality' as viewed from within a system of morality and a 'the absence of a system of morality.' \n \n The former could be viewed as terrible! People would run around doing whatever they pleased! Murder would be everywhere! Prostitution, child pornography, rape, drug abuse, spousal abuse, child abuse, stealing, white collar crime, tax fraud, gang activity, etc. would be rampant! The world would fall to pieces. Hmm... sounds a bit like the world we live in... and have lived in for thousands of years... all the way back to when Cain murdered Abel, right? The fact is, people run around doing whatever they please anyway. Some people choose to do what they please within the guidelines of a system of morality. They are still doing what they please.\n \n Within a system of morality, human nature is seen as deficient, yet were we not created in God's image and likeness? How can that be deficient? Within a perspective of a system of morality, bad people do bad things because they lack morality or they are evil or bad. Good people do good things because they are moral and good and just and righteous. In the absence of a system of morality, people do things. There is no judgment or value placed on the things, nor the people. That's not to say that these 'things' that people do have no consequences. \n \n If Suzi gives her coat to a homeless person in the winter, the consequence may be that this homeless person does not freeze to death because the coat retains warmth. Is this action 'good'? Only if you view it as 'good.' Inherently, the action is the same no matter how you view it... Suzi is giving her coat to a homeless person. Not to turn this into a debate about context or situational ethics, but consider that the homeless person was holding Suzi at knife-point until she handed over her coat. The action is exactly the same, yet we are likely to view it differently within the context of a system of morality.\n \n My point here (though I don't believe I made it very clearly) is that the absence of a system of morality does not dictate that everyone will act in a way that would be perceived to be immoral from within a system of morality. People act the way people act, with or without a system of morality. Consider the Catholic priests that have been accused of molestation over the recent past... they certainly have a well-defined framework of morality, but that didn't affect their actions.\n \n Another perspective: Anyone who knows me who operates under a system of morality would consider me to be a very 'moral' person. This is not to blow my own horn... it just is a statement of fact. I have been told numerous times by countless people how 'good' I am, and what solid character I have. They are welcome to their opinions. Their opinions do not change who or what I am. (Though they may affect the reality of how they deal with me, but that's another line of thought.) The fact remains that I am who I am. I operate under no system of morality. I make no imaginary distinctions between 'right' and 'wrong.' I do not spend my energy trying to figure out what is 'right' and what is 'wrong' according to some set of guidelines... rather, I accept what is.\n \n Well... enough for now.",

In reality, nothing is different. Your perception will be different, though, depending on your mindset. Without a framework of morality, there is no need to label the actions 'evil.' Rather, the actions are what they are. That does not mean that someone operating without a framework of morality is going to rush out and act like Nazi Germany. The potential result of acting like Nazi Germany is that millions of minorities could be put to death.",

   "\"Moral Relativism: Essentially, moral relativism says that anything goes, because life is ultimately without meaning. Words like \"ought\" and \"should\" are rendered meaningless.\"\n\n The above is not a definition, but rather an interpretation of the concept. Per my understanding, moral relativism does not suggest that all behavior is morally acceptable. Per my understanding, it states that humans will perform actions... the actions themselves do not have intrinsic meaning, but they only have the meaning that is assigned to them by someone who wishes to assign value to them.\n \n Life, itself, IS without meaning. Every individual assigns whatever meaning to life they desire. Assuming you are Christian, you will likely look at life and say it's beautiful because the meaning of life is to accept Christ as your personal savior and try to act like Christ in your everyday life so that we may one day live forever in God's presence. There is nothing 'wrong' with living life this way and believing this. But the distinction is that YOU are placing that value upon life. YOU are choosing to view life from that perspective. You could, if you desired, choose to view life from a different perspective. If the meaning of life can change just by changing your viewpoint, then how can life itself have any meaning outside of the meaning you assign to it?\n \n I'm not sure this analogy can be followed through all the way, but in a sense, it's like a tree that falls in the middle of the forest with no creature around for miles. Does it still make a sound? What is 'sound'? Roughly, sound is our interpretation (via mechanisms in the ear and the brain) of waves that travel through the air. Without such an interpretation, the concept of sound is meaningless (though it could be argued that the waves themselves are the 'sound'). If a deaf person is there to witness the tree falling, the same waves travel through the air as if no one was there. But there is still no concept of sound. When a person with good hearing is there to witness the fall, that person is able to interpret those waves as a concept we know as sound.\n \n Only within a framework of morality are words like 'ought' and 'should' valid.\n \n \nEvolution and moral relativism go hand-in-hand, for evolution teaches that life is accidental, without meaning or purpose.\n\n This is NOT what evolution teaches. In fact, evolution doesn't teach anything. Perhaps that is what YOU make evolution mean to YOU. \n \n \nTherefore anything you do is o.k., becaue it ultimately doesn't matter. \n\n This is not a logical consequence of accepting evolution. Whether or not you accept evolution, any action you do will be the same action. It will have the same consequences. \n \n \nIf you believe we are created, however, moral relativism cannot work. Creation implies a Creator. All things created are subject to a set of laws, whether natural or devine.\"\n\n This first statement is not true. It will 'work' if you want it to 'work,' just as it will not 'work' if you do not want it to 'work.'\n \n What is the set of laws of which you speak? Some of them I am aware of... gravity, for example... the fact that evolution happens, for example... Biological creatures and populations are subject to these laws, whether they are aware of it or not.\n \n \nCalling it \"deviant behavior\" would have been more accurate.\n\n This is your opinion. Deviant implies that there is a 'non-deviant.' Again, this is assuming a duality. Consider accepting that it was behavior without feeling the need to assign value to it.",

   "To Close_slave_can:\n I hope that you don't mind me disagreeing with you! I think that Darwin and Dawkins have made the issue of \"morals and ethics\" a joke. Think about the following questions for a while:\n Why do we have an inbuilt sense of right and wrong? Why do we sometimes feel guilty or ashamed when we have done something wrong? Why do we have a sense of obligation or responsibility to other people? Why should mere blobs of animate matter be concerned for the temporary well-being of other blobs if both are going to die? How can we live - or die - with dignity if our existence is meaningless? Why do we take ourselves so seriously if Richard Dawkins is right to say that we are nothing but \"jumped-up apes\"? How can shrink-wrapped bags of biological elements have any rights or concerns of justice, freedom, possession or happiness - or even to life itself? What gives us any greater value than rocks, ants or termites? \n \n If the survival of the fittest is evolution's greatest prize, why should we not encourage the non-survival of the unfit? Why should we care for the frail, the mentally defective, the chronically sick, the senile, homeless or the starving? Should we not give evolution a hand by getting rid of them - and the sooner the better? They are a drag on our society aren't they?\n \n There is no evidence in those questions, they are just merely there to question you. I got them from the book \"Evolution: Fact or fiction?\" that was written by John Blanchard. And he has a very good point: why should the result of an accident have any morals, ethics and feelings at all? Why is it when you see one of the Ethopian kids on television shows that you could almost cry. It is so moving to see little kids like that, just skin and bone. Do you feel for them? I know that I do. We watched a movie about it in legal studies and most had to look away at some stage throughout the documentary. One could say that \"our hearts went out to them\". emoticon_cry \n \n The following comes from the book \"Where was God on September 11?\" once again written by John Blanchard.\n If you are an atheist how do you explain the existence of goodness, love, kindness, generosity or sympathy? Atheists are clearly capable of all of these, but if human beings are just collections of bones, blood and tissue, what do these things mean and why is there any virtue in them? When Dr Richard Dawkins admits that \"Universal love and the welfare of the species as a whole simply do not make evolutionary sense,\" he is confirming that tere is no way - or it is very unlikely - to arrive at personal morality from an impersonal universe. How do we jump from atoms to ethics and from molecules to morals? If we are nothing more than \"mutated pondscum\" than how can we ondemn anything as being \"evil\" or commend anything as being \"good\"? Why should we be concerned over issues of justice or fairness, or feel any obligatino to treat others with dignity or respect. Why should the elimination of nearly 6 million Jews and other minority groups affect us if we are the products of mutations?\n \n That I guess is one of my main stumbling blocks in believing in evolution.",

   "To Close_slave_can:\n I hope that you don't mind me disagreeing with you! I think that Darwin and Dawkins have made the issue of \"morals and ethics\" a joke. Think about the following questions for a while:\n Why do we have an inbuilt sense of right and wrong? Why do we sometimes feel guilty or ashamed when we have done something wrong?\n\n Feel free to disagree with me, I only have a problem with with people who insult me. \n \n I could see how a sense of right and wrong could evolve. Dawkins discusses actually discusses it at length. \n \n One reason that morals make it more likely that your genes get passed on is that is that it makes you enjoy cooperating with your family and hate working against your family, and a strong family benefits all its members. This benefit would outweigh the fact that sometimes you would have to look after an \"idiot relative\". Another interesting take on it is that our power of speech and advanced powers of reasoning were initially ust quirks like the peacocks tail, however when humans started to be able to use their large brains and speech skills this quirk became something useful and let humans discover tools and pass them down to future generations. \n \n As for why do many people care for the helpless that's also easy to explain. If we could not care for the helpless we would be bad parents and we would not successfully breed. \n \n \n @7th_Arty \n relient K is a christian band. Since I bothered to go on the internet and look it up that proves I am a lying creationist. On a more serious note, do not be disturbed about your words be censored. This is because even with censorship I think everyone is clear on exactly who has opinions that 7th_Arty has respect for.",

   "To Close_slave_can:\n You quote (not that I need to remind you):\n \nAlso I think life was an accident and I resent that some people use this to conclude that I have no moral standards. I cannot rationally justify my ethics using my beliefs but so what? \n \n \n Well, where do you get your beliefs about right and wrong from? I mean, I know that you have moral standards and are most likely an ethical person. \n \n Sandycane does have a point in her previous message to you. It is just that I think that the main point was that you have no basis  for believing what you believe to be true about morals and ethics because you have no one who tells you what is right and wrong, you must choose them and put them into practice for yourself. You have what I call \"relative morality\". This is where people decide for themselves what is \"right\" and what is \"wrong\". However, Chirstians believe that there is what I call an \"absolute morality\". This absolute morality comes from our Creator God who sets the rules and morals that govern all people. I had a small debate about this with the bootfitter in another section on abortion. I don't think that Sandycane was not pointing out that you have no morals, they just aren't absolute, i.e. you get to choose them for yourself. \n \n You may indeed have exactly the same morals and values that I have, but you still have \"relative morality\" as you have choosen those yourself. I have the \"absolute morality\" as I believe and try to put into action what God has revealed through His Word, the Bible, e.g. love your enemies. I will admit it, I don't always succeed, but I do my best. \n \n \nReligion has been used to justify all sorts of things to disgust me and using it to \"validate\" your actions does not really impress me.\n \n \n Some of which disgust me too. Like those people who say that \"God [or the devil] told me to do it [such as kill a person]\". God protects His people - if it is in His will. There was the most amazing story that I have ever heard in a book called \"Fighting McKenzie - ANZAC Chaplain: Tribute to a Hero\" by Col Stringer. Just incase you don't know much about the ANZAC's, ANZAC stands for \"Australian and New Zealand Army Corps\" and these were the brave men who went into Gallipoli in the WWI. Many of them got slaughtered. It was Australia's biggest defeat. The ANZAC's got off the boats on the wrong spot and were subsquently slaughtered by the Turkish soldiers in the inital landing. They then cleaverly devised a plan to escape from Turkey - which was a total success. Hundreds of thousands of ANZAC troops died there. \n \n Anyway, McKenzie was an ANZAC Chaplain at that time whilst they were at Gallipoli.McKenzie was truely a man of God, he quoted in a letter to his family: \"Gladly indeed will I die if by that means I can save some.\" He was a great mate with many of the ANZAC soldiers. He witnessed such bloodshed, yet he still stayed faithful, both to the LORD and to \"his boys\". He saw many men off to glory. He charged at the enemy trenches with a shovel, he did not go in behind the lines, he was in the front line. He, like many other soliders spoke of seeing or hearing \"angels\" during several battles. Col Stringer [editor] quotes the following from the A.I.F. in Sinai and Palestine p.155 in reference to the liberation of Jerusalem:\n \"From General Chauvel down to officers, troopers and captured Germans, visions of ancient buildings, strange animals, lighted villages and angelic beings were witnessed en masse. During debriefing, hundreds of stories were corroborated through cross-checking examinations. As there was no logical explanation, offically the incident was recorded as \"lack of sleep\". Reports of angelic beings appearing during the fighting occured up to the cessation of hostilities in 1918. They are too numerous to detail...Statements were taken from captured enemy officers who had witnessed the same manifestations. General Allenby called for detailed reports and interviewed some witnesses himself...\"\n \n McKenzie quoted in \"Time Army that went with the boys\", p.117:\n \"Some of my time in the trenches was employed burying British dead that had lain on the field for a fortnight. Going forth with a pick and shovel, I sought to give these heroes a Christian burial. In doing this one morning, I had occasion to go onto a ridge in full view of the enemy from two points. They started shelling, evidently thinking I was one of the digging party. \n \n They sent over whizz-bangs and later big shells; they fell in close proximity to where I was working. I had buried seven of these fallen heroes .... when my Guardian Angel said to me, \"Get away from hee quickly.\" I obeyed instantly, and had got away 25 yards in a slanting direction from the enemy's fire, when a big shell landed right on the very sport where I had been standing just a few seconds before. All I got was a shower of earth.\"\n \n I think that I'm getting a little off-topic here, just like my English teacher. Get him started on something scientific and he starts on with stuff about the \"Biological Revolution\". Oh, yes, well back to the point. God protects His people if it is in His will. Appearently some people have used the excuse \"it is written into our genes by our ape like ancestors\" to justifiy crimes, such as murder, slander, affairs, etc. The information I got from an email by AiG, they stated:\n \"Time magazine, for example, had an article that said infidelity is built into our genes. Because of our alleged evolutionary history, it said we&#8217;re programmed to cheat on our spouses.\n \n We&#8217;re also hearing that homosexual tendencies are there because they&#8217;re part of some people&#8217;s DNA make-up! \n \n While this is all preposterous, there is a connection between evolution and immorality, but it&#8217;s not genetic. Believing in evolution can lead to immorality. Evolutionary thinking undermines the idea of absolute standards for our behavior. If there is no Creator and we evolved, then no one owns us and we have a right to set our own rules.\"\n \n So I hope that you can see that the point that Sandycane was trying to make! Sorry about getting off track, it is just a very interesting topic, don't you agree? I'm just about to start reading the book, I've had a quick glance over it!",

   "And your final statement pretty much sums everything up. That's the way YOU see it.\n \n Moral relativism, as I understand it, does not imply multiple truths. The concept is simply that morals are not absolute truths, but rather perspectives, as you suggest.\n \n Consider your example of killing another individual... You believe it is wrong no matter what, but it may be a necessary evil. Some people would argue that killing another human being would be a morally good thing to do in certain circumstances. Other people would argue that killing people is not inherently 'right' or 'wrong.' Whose to say that your assertion is any better than anyone else's? Where do we find a universal truth that says, \"Killing another individual is always wrong... no exceptions\"?\n \n The absolute truth in this situation is that if you kill another individual, then that individual is physically dead. They are no longer living and breathing. That's fact. That's truth. By definition. Any assignment of value to the act of killing is opinion. Perhaps many people share your opinion, but it is still opinion.\n \n Peace,\n TheBootfitter\n \n P.S. I'm curious about your handle... is that a typo? Or does 'relient' have some significance of which I am unaware.\n\n \n I ended my post with the way I see it because for some reason, in another forum, people had the impression that I was not expressing a humble opinion, but a judgmental truth. That IS the way I see it, but I have learned through experience, that my beliefs really have no bearing on the structure of reality, so why not try and align them with reality? I look at morals in a level of degrees. You gave the example of killing. Killing no matter what the situation is bad, and an evil to take the life of another human being. But when the time comes, we have to make our decision on which is the worst evil, and it is a sad truth, but one evil must be overlooked at times to prevent another. Such as: if you have a child and you know that a man is going to kill that child, and the only way to stop him is to kill him, then what do you do? I would kill the man, because although it is an evil to take another life, it is a worse evil to fail as a parent and not protect your child. \n It's impossible to judge something on a relative scale, because then there is no standard, and no criteria for which you base your judgments. And by that stance, who are we to condemn Hitler and his third Reich? (Kudos to Robbie for bringing up that point)\n \n And in response to your question, I spell it (relient) this way for a purpose. Slave was right, it does have to do with the Christian band Relient K. And 7th_Arty, who were you accusing of avoiding something? Just wondering...",

   "Ah! Here you are. You seem to be avoiding the Archaeopteryx thread. You seem to lack the ganas to support your assertions.\n \nI think that Darwin and Dawkins have made the issue of \"morals and ethics\" a joke.\n\n Really! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species. Otherwise you are babbling. Please cite specific passages from Darwin's books where he made \"morals and ethics\" a joke. Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins. Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men.\n \nThink about the following questions for a while:\n Why do we have an inbuilt sense of right and wrong?\n\n Because society teaches us what is acceptable. Those who fail to learn are known as criminals. They are sociopaths.\n \nWhy do we sometimes feel guilty or ashamed when we have done something wrong?\n\n Because your mommy and daddy told you \"no, no, no\" when you did something wrong. Even my dog does that. When she was a puppy she used to poop in the corner of the dinning room and pee in the guest bedroom. She was always ashamed even before I found the evidence. In fact, because she was ashamed was the reason that I went looking.\n \nWhy do we have a sense of obligation or responsibility to other people?\n\n I know I do. My parents taught me and I taught my sons. One is an officer of the court and the other is an Army noncom with 3 college degrees. I learned from my parents.\n \nWhy should mere blobs of animate matter be concerned for the temporary well-being of other blobs if both are going to die?\n\n So that is your opinion of humanity? How sad. Or maybe your are erecting a strawman and not doing a very good job of knocking it down.\n \nHow can we live - or die - with dignity if our existence is meaningless?\n\n But why do you need some supernatural entity to give meaning to your existence? I don't. I have attempted to pass along the sense of moral responsibility that I learned from my parents. So far I think that I have been successful.\n \nWhy do we take ourselves so seriously if Richard Dawkins is right to say that we are nothing but \"jumped-up apes\"? How can shrink-wrapped bags of biological elements have any rights or concerns of justice, freedom, possession or happiness - or even to life itself? What gives us any greater value than rocks, ants or termites?\n\n That doesn't even make sense. My question is why this personal attack on Dr. Dawkins was not deleted? It is nothing more than babble without any support in fact.\n \nIf the survival of the fittest is evolution's greatest prize, why should we not encourage the non-survival of the unfit?\n\n I'm sure that this will be deleted as \"unfriendly,\" but truth is what it is.\n \n First, \"survival of the fittest\" was an economic theory proposed by Herbert Spenser. It is not a prize of any kind. To say so is evidence of great ignorance. \"Survivla of the fittest\" was applied to Darwin's theory of natural selection against his will. It does not represent the depth of the concept. Darwin proposed a theory of differential reproductive success of heritable characteristics. He did not propose (or even dream) that a misapplication of his ideas would or should be used as an excuse for genocide.\n \nWhy should we care for the frail, the mentally defective, the chronically sick, the senile, homeless or the starving?\n\n Empathy? Compassion? Honor? What is your point? What does this have to do with evolutionary theory?\n \nShould we not give evolution a hand by getting rid of them - and the sooner the better? They are a drag on our society aren't they?\n\n What absolute ignorance. Why wasn't this sort of \"unfriendly\" **** deleted? Evolution isn't a code of moral behavior. Only a fool would make such a claim.\n \nThere is no evidence in those questions, they are just merely there to question you.\n\n Bullroar. Those questions are strawmen raised by those who lack the moral integrity to educate themselves in the issues before speaking. Those \"questions\" are an example of ignorance - intentional ignorance.\n \nI got them from the book \"Evolution: Fact or fiction?\" that was written by John Blanchard.\n\n Ah! Then you are a dupe.\n \nAnd he has a very good point: why should the result of an accident have any morals, ethics and feelings at all?\n\n Indeed! Why? If I catch my heel and fall down a flight of stairs, what is the moral implication that your propose?\n \nWhy is it when you see one of the Ethopian kids on television shows that you could almost cry. It is so moving to see little kids like that, just skin and bone. Do you feel for them? I know that I do.\n\n So what is your answer? Compassion has nothing to do with your morality. So what about this? A poor individual living on the edge of starvation is drafted into the army. In the army he is well fed and even educated to some extent. But he is sent to war in an effort to try to kill me and my compadres. But before he gets off a shot, I see him and put a shot through his forhead. Now where is your compassion? I suspect that you are less compassionate than I. Do you shed tears?\n \nWe watched a movie about it in legal studies and most had to look away at some stage throughout the documentary. One could say that \"our hearts went out to them\".\n\n I'll bet it did. Did any of you money go out to them? Do any of you volunteer to go out to them? How are you different from me in this case and why is this relevant to evolutionary theory?\n \nThe following comes from the book \"Where was God on September 11?\" once again written by John Blanchard.\n\n OH GOODY! Another meaningless quote.\n \nIf you are an atheist how do you explain the existence of goodness, love, kindness, generosity or sympathy?\n\n Is this guy for real? Is he actually asserting that an atheist cannot love his/her children? What a pompous ***! Nothing that he states has anything to do with God. What idiocy!\n \nAtheists are clearly capable of all of these, but if human beings are just collections of bones, blood and tissue, what do these things mean and why is there any virtue in them?\n\n So atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality.\n \nWhen Dr Richard Dawkins admits that \"Universal love and the welfare of the species as a whole simply do not make evolutionary sense,\" he is confirming that tere is no way - or it is very unlikely - to arrive at personal morality from an impersonal universe.\n\n And I ask the question again. Have you read Dawkins? Do you actually know what he says? It's a bit disengenuous to make such statements if you haven't read the books in question. How shall I say this? You have been duped. Well - that's going to be censored!\n \nHow do we jump from atoms to ethics and from molecules to morals?\n\n We don't. That is a sign of ignorance. Try to educate yourself. Science does not deal with what is moral. Science is naturalistic and deals with what is observed in nature.\n \nIf we are nothing more than \"mutated pondscum\" than how can we ondemn anything as being \"evil\" or commend anything as being \"good\"?\n\n Eminently silly. I mean, if you want to argue the issues wouldn't it be better to actually argue against some meaningful question? Who but a creationist ever claimed that wer are nothing more than \"pond scum?\"\n \nWhy should we be concerned over issues of justice or fairness, or feel any obligatino to treat others with dignity or respect.\n\n Was that a question? We should do so because it is beneficial to the orderly conduct of society. That's what our society has come to value, and that is what is taught to many members of our society. But some don't learn and they become criminals.\n \nWhy should the elimination of nearly 6 million Jews and other minority groups affect us if we are the products of mutations?\n\n I'm not sure what your point is. Are you trying to raise the Hitler question? Hitler was a Christian and claimed that he was doing his Christian duty. What does any of that have to do with the differential reproductive success of advantageous alleles? Evolutionary theory is not a moral imperitive. It is an explanation of what is observed in nature.\n \nThat I guess is one of my main stumbling blocks in believing in evolution.\n\n I believe in what I have no evidence to support. That is faith. I do not believe in evolution. The evidence is overwhelming for the educated. As for your \"stumbling blocks,\" they are founded in ignorance. Why don't you educate yourself? You make creationism look foolish.\n \n By the way, what is the problem with Archaeopteryx? I'm sure that you have educated yourself to address the list of features that I gave. I just can't believe that you would speak to the issue and not understand the implications of all of those points that I listed. Were you just a parrot?\n \n It seems that you lack the ganas to even say that you don't know. An example of \"creation science\" at its best!",

My point is that although you can argue your ethical system is justified by a higher power this logical statement does not get you out of bed in the morning. Isn't it your love for others that motivates you to act ethically. I just cannot Imagine that you have a constant logical discussion that you hear in the mind along the lines of \"God made everything and can punish me horribly and reward me greatly so I better do what he says\". To summarise I think you would not be a christian if \"christian absolute values\" did sit well with you emotionally, so I think there is only a trivial differnce between you and someone like me who decides on what is ethical based on my feelings and what allows society to function.",

The latter is a very poor way of describing natural selection, not evolution, as it leads to confusion (such as you are displaying). Morals are what binds a human group together.

There has to be something more behind our physical beings, something that gives us substance, meaning, and the intellect that we all naturally have. If not, then what are emotions and morals but a fast ticket to the bottom of the food chain?\n\n \n Morals allow societies to form, and groups to function more effectively. Emotions are simply guiding forces that help shape useful behaviour, and in particular unpredictable behaviour. All these things are evolutionarily useful.\n \n The evolutionary study of alturism (and morality) is well advanced and based on solid mathematical modelling. A good book on Game Theory should give you the basic concepts needed to understand why, it's also covered in many of Dawkins books.\n \n Going back to the original question:\n \n I find Moral Relativism to be too poorly defined a term to be particularly useful. However, if we instead ask the question: has evolutionary theory made it easier to believe that morality is a human construct rather than an absolute truth?\n \n I'd say: yes, it has. The reasons for this are twofold: firstly, evolutionary theory has advanced our understanding of the natural world immeasurably and on the way we've come to a useful understanding of how social animals interact and work - morality is not that far from the same principles and, indeed, is probably an extension of the same principles. Secondly, our understanding of the real story of how we came to be has made atheism much more credible - no longer do we need a rib-pulling god designing all the animals - and under atheism the idea of morals as absolute truth makes no sense.

   "Ah! Here you are. You seem to be avoiding the Archaeopteryx thread. You seem to lack the ganas to support your assertions.\n \n Why hello my friend! \n No, why should I waste my time on such a pitiful argument. You won't listen to me. You and I just have different interperations. You are being \"willingly ignorant\". I have put forward my simplified argument. You \"tried\" to rip it to shreds, but I would say that no one won. I have been told by various people that \"You'll have to get used to people ignoring the arguments\n and attacking character. This is what evolutionists do when they can't\n do anything about the argument. At that, you must move on to someone who will listen.\" You have proved this. You can give me a long list of stuff that does not support your theory, but in a few words from Dr Jonathan Sarfati about archaeopteryx would destroy the \"so-called evolution of the bird\". Go ahead and pay me out all you want. I know that I have the truth, and I know the way. I only wish that you will one day find out. \n \n Some of your evolutionary pals don't even know how the birds evolved. They have rejected that archaeopteryx is an intermediate form. I think that you are mistaken about what your evolutionists believe. However, in the article, Bird Evolution flies out the window, the creationist anatomist Dr David Menton shows that Archaeopteryx is a true bird with flight feathers, not a transitional form&#8212;and certainly not a feathered dinosaur. And Dr Alan Feduccia, a world authority on birds at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an evolutionist himself, says: &#8216;Paleontologists have tried to turn Archaeopteryx into an earth-bound, feathered dinosaur. But it&#8217;s not. It is a bird, a perching bird. And no amount of &#8220;paleobabble&#8221; is going to change that.&#8217;2\n Dr David Menton says in the article:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/Docs/1352.asp \n in response to being asked whether or not there is any evidence for bird evolution, he said this:\n \nNot the slightest &#8212; and the people who take each view make that point. There are no examples of living or fossil scales that even remotely resemble a feather. Archaeopteryx has complete feathers like modern birds.\n \n \n Dr Michael Menton, a well known scientist (agnostic) who wrote the book \"Darwinism: A theory in crisis\" says that he \"can't imagine how the intermediates lungs [between a reptile and a bird] could be fully functional\". He says that half formed lungs wouldn't work and that would result in the extinction of the species. In \"The Revised Quote Book\" that I'll be getting later on tonight when Dad comes home (from working) for my birthday there are many quotes that have the evolutionists bagging out their own theory, or saying that there isn't any evidence for it. BUT NOTE: they still believe it! \n \n I quoted this before, but I don't think that you paid it any notice before, so I'll quote it again. Archaeopteryx had fully formed flying feathers, the classical elliptical wings of modern woodland birds, and a large wishbone for attachment of muscles responsible for the downstroke of the wings. Its brain was essentially that of a flying bird, with a large cerebellum and visual cortex. The fact that it had teeth is irrelevant to its alleged transitional status - a number of extinct birds had teeth,, while many reptiles do not. Furthermore, like other birds, both its maxilla (upper jaw) and mandible (lower jaw) moved. In most vertebrates, including reptiles, only the mandible moves.\n \n As you will find out if you do some snooping, that archaeopteryx is fully a bird. It isn't an intermediate form. It is a true bird, and many scientists, including creationists and leading evolutionists, consider it to be a bird. There are many problems with bird evolution. Apart from the fact that dinosaurs and reptiles don't have the genetic information for making feathers, their respiratory and cardiovascular systems are very different and any tranistional forms would die because it wouldn't be able to breath.\n \n \nReally! Then I assume that you have read Darwin - at least On the Origin of Species. Otherwise you are babbling. Please cite specific passages from Darwin's books where he made \"morals and ethics\" a joke. Please also do the same for the works of Dawkins. Your assertion presumes that you have read the works of both men.\n \n \n No, why would I read such racist books for? I know what Darwin's book \"Origin of the Species\" did to people's thinking. It fueled racism. Taking the way that the \"white people\" treated the Aboriginals of Australia for example. We hered them over cliffs, we shot them, we stabbed them, we boiled them. Scientists from European countries sent people to Australia with orders on how to kill the Aboriginals and how to plug the bullet holes from their head just to put them in museums. The same was done over in America and other countries. All in the name of evolutionism. Now where is the morality and ethics in that? Huh? Darwin taught that the Aboriginals were the closest people to the alleged \"ape like creatures\". Now is that racist or what? He also says that the highest people was the white people who lived in Europe. He had no basis or any evidence for saying that! This is what evolutionary thinking does to people. There is no morals or ethics in evolution.\n \n \nBecause society teaches us what is acceptable. Those who fail to learn are known as criminals. \n \n \n Now since evolution (athestic evolution) is supposed to be an random accident, who needs or who cares about order? Why should our society have order if, throughout our whole history (evolutionarly speaking) there never was any? Where do we get our laws from? We get them from, oh wow, the Bible! How knew? Every religious groups have the basic laws that state \"don't kill, don't steal, be faithful to your spouse, etc\". I don't know what you are trying to prove here. Why should re-arranged molecules care about order? You are only digging yourself into a deeper and deeper whole. Quit now while you still have the chance.\n \n \nBecause your mommy and daddy told you \"no, no, no\" when you did something wrong.\n \n \n You are missing the entire point (again). Why do you feel ashamed? Because you know that what you did is bad. I have heard from a great Australian war hero, one of our remaining ANZACs soliders (recently passed away I think) that we he stabbed the enemy soldier with the spike thing on the end of their gun (WWI era) and he saw him die that it was \"the worst feeling that a human can possibly endure\". He said that that image will haunt him for the rest of his life. He knows that he did something wrong, but it was a war, and unfortuantely that kind of thing will happen. You are way off the plot. But let us continue.\n \n \nI know I do. My parents taught me and I taught my sons. One is an officer of the court and the other is an Army noncom with 3 college degrees. I learned from my parents.\n \n \n You must be very proud of your sons. For once, however, please stop thinking about yourself and your family. Take a step back and look at the big picture. Everyone (at least most people) feels a sence of obligation to their fellow humans. Why is this so? You never answered my question (that was not even remotely to you in the first place). If you are going to make a point, at least do it answering the question. \n \n \nSo that is your opinion of humanity? How sad. Or maybe your are erecting a strawman and not doing a very good job of knocking it down.\n \n What do you think? Neither. It is not how I view humanity, nor is it a straw man argument. I do not know where you got that idea from! If evolution is true, than are we not literally \"mutated pondscum\"? Are we not just an accidental arrangement of molecules? Why should I treat any of you with respect and dignity if evolution is true? But since it is not true, everyone has a purpose and is loved very much by our Creator God. I may not like you very much (I can only go on by how you treat people and the message that I got from you is not a very nice indication), and I certainly wouldn't ever have a drink with you when I get old enough, but God does! He loves you that much that He sent Jesus to die for your  sins. So that you may have eternal life with Him. I hope that you take up on His offer... Once again you try to hard to destroy an argument that wasn't even an argument. It was just a question, a simple question. Don't try so hard and may be you might have some success.\n \n \nBut why do you need some supernatural entity to give meaning to your existence? I don't. I have attempted to pass along the sense of moral responsibility that I learned from my parents. So far I think that I have been successful.\n \n \n Otherwise, why am I here? If evolution is true than I just mutated pondscum, an accident, a thing that shouldn't be here. I am not unique, not special. I'm just another kid questioning why we are here. I have no purpose, no soul, nothing to look forward to through death and so on. That doesn't make me feel very \"wanted\", nor does it make me happy. I am the work of the creative processes of our loving God, who made me with a purpose. I am special. In fact, I am so special that Jesus went to the cross to die for my sins, as well as yours. That fills me with a sense of pride and just how important we are to our loving God. I know that my future is in His hands. And that I'll once again be rejoining God in Heaven. I have not only got the future to look forward to, but also life through death. Also, if things get tough, I will have the LORD there with me that I can draw strength from. Filled with hope I am.\n \n \nThat doesn't even make sense. My question is why this personal attack on Dr. Dawkins was not deleted? It is nothing more than babble without any support in fact.\n \n \n I am not attacking Dr Dawkins! He said the quote himself. I am not attacking him for saying such a statement. Once again, you are trying to hard and in the process you have made yourself look like a bit of a fool. Dr Dawkins quoted that quote in: the \"Sunday Telegraph\", 18 October 1998. Bye bye argument. He was the one that said it, not me.\n \n \nFirst, \"survival of the fittest\" was an economic theory proposed by Herbert Spenser. It is not a prize of any kind. To say so is evidence of great ignorance. \"Survivla of the fittest\" was applied to Darwin's theory of natural selection against his will. It does not represent the depth of the concept. Darwin proposed a theory of differential reproductive success of heritable characteristics. He did not propose (or even dream) that a misapplication of his ideas would or should be used as an excuse for genocide.\n \n \n Don't give me that. You know as well as I do that \"Survival of the fittest\", a.k.a. natural selection, was Darwin&#8217;s only mechanism for his theory. He may well have not dreamt that his ideas would have been used for genocide, but the fact is that they were. I acknowledge the fact of &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221;. It is what we observe. I am not proposing that we do get rid of them. You are once again making this up. It was a hypothetical scenario based on IF evolution is true. IF evolution is true, than why do we have feelings such as compassion. You still haven't addressed this question.\n \n \nEmpathy? Compassion? Honor? What is your point? What does this have to do with evolutionary theory?\n \n \n You do not listen. If you do not listen than you will not learn. You are constantly making yourself look like a fool. You are not destroying my arguments as you have not even addressed them. You are attacking my character of which you know nothing about. It would be wise of you to quit it at once. The above feelings and emotions have nothing to do with evolution! Evolution cannot explain how these universal feelings can come into being, yet they are here. Why should mutated pondscum have feelings or thoughts of what is right? That is my point! Evolution cannot explain how these feelings can come about! You once again have no listened to me. No wonder why you are not to successful with your debating.\n \n \nBullroar. Those questions are strawmen raised by those who lack the moral integrity to educate themselves in the issues before speaking. Those \"questions\" are an example of ignorance - intentional ignorance.\n \n \n Those are not straw men arguments. They were questions, inquiring an answer. If evolution did happen, than I would like you to explain to me how and why we evolved feelings such as compassion and where we get our sense of \"justice\" from. You are making up rubbish that I had never ever hinted nor stated.\n \n \nAh! Then you are a dupe.\n \n \n Once again, unfounded basless accusations. Where is your evidence for this? I think the expression is \"you have been duped\". You wouldn't know the slightest thing about me, so lets keep to the facts and science shall we?\n \n \nSo what is your answer? Compassion has nothing to do with your morality. So what about this? A poor individual living on the edge of starvation is drafted into the army. In the army he is well fed and even educated to some extent. But he is sent to war in an effort to try to kill me and my compadres. But before he gets off a shot, I see him and put a shot through his forhead. Now where is your compassion? I suspect that you are less compassionate than I. Do you shed tears?\n \n \n More baseless accusations. You are once again making up stuff. Everyone cries, and yes I have done it many time. In year 8 when my family moved away from Newcastle to our present location, I didn't fit in at all. Any pay out, like the ones that you do to me now may have set me off. Now I am a lot stronger and I can just brush you guys off without a care in the world. You are not worth my time, I am only replying to tell you to get your facts straight and deal with the evidence, not with me or my character.\n \n \nI'll bet it did. Did any of you money go out to them? Do any of you volunteer to go out to them? How are you different from me in this case and why is this relevant to evolutionary theory?\n\n \n No. I am a student and I personally don't have much money. So how could I help them? I have very limited money of my own. I help when I can, but sometimes with my present finances I can't do much. If I had enough money, as I assume you do, than yes I would help them as much as I could. This is just an example of where people feel compassion. And as I have said before, Dawkin's has trouble explaining how the universal feelings could come about through evolution. We would not expect mutated pondscum to produce feelings and morals, ethics, etc. \n \n \nIs this guy for real? Is he actually asserting that an atheist cannot love his/her children? What a pompous ***! Nothing that he states has anything to do with God. What idiocy!\n \n \n You really need to take some lessons in calming down and how to listen to people. Now that you brought it up, I'll finish the quote: \n \nIf you are an atheist, how do you explain goodness, love, kindness, generosity or sympathy? Atheists are clearly capable  of all of these, but if human beings are just collections of bones, blood and tissue, what do these things mean and why is there any virtue in them?\n \n \n I thought that you might have caught on and hence, shorted my message. But I was wrong. So your argument is quite false and untrue. How about we do what you suggest, read the book and see for yourself? Or, did that too go out the door when you wrote your argument? Kind of contradictory, eh?\n \n \nSo atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality.\n \n \n Once again you are missing the point! That is not what I said, nor is that what I was hinting at. Read the title of the topic, \"evolution and moral relativism\". The quote by Dawkins implies that feelings and morals, ethics, etc, should not have evolutionarly evolved. But even if they did, what virtue would they have? None. But, going from the point of view that evolution is wrong and that there is a God, than we have a basis for morality, feelings of justice, ethics and so on, that came from Him! He sets the absolutes for morality, feelings, ethics and so on. So this applies to everyone. Hence, even if you don't believe in God, the same things still apply to you and so therefore your feelings have virtue and are meaningful.\n \n \nWe don't. That is a sign of ignorance. Try to educate yourself. Science does not deal with what is moral. Science is naturalistic and deals with what is observed in nature.\n \n \n Did I mention science? No. Once again you are making up stuff! Firstly science is not naturalistic. Science is the human enterprise of trying to work out what, how and why a certain observation does what it does. It works off the basis of the Law of Causality, i.e. cause and effect relationhip. I did not mention that science deals with morality! You are raising a straw man argument and not doing a very effective job of destroying it. I was talking about evolution, not science. Since evolution (athesitic evolution) deals with things like how something came into being, than I used the logic, \"Why do we have morality?\" Evolution cannot really explain its existance.\n \n \nEminently silly. I mean, if you want to argue the issues wouldn't it be better to actually argue against some meaningful question? Who but a creationist ever claimed that wer are nothing more than \"pond scum?\"\n \n \n I do believe that that is the title of this topic. I am just merely pointing out that evolution cannot or it would not make any sense as to why it would produce morals, ethics, and feelings of justice, etc. Off the top of my head I can't give any names, but I know that there have been. Memory is failing already and I'm only 17.\n \n \nWas that a question? We should do so because it is beneficial to the orderly conduct of society. That's what our society has come to value, and that is what is taught to many members of our society. But some don't learn and they become criminals.\n \n \n Yes, I forgot the question mark. emoticon_emb That is a very stereotypical view of how criminals become criminals. Many do it out of necessity, or out of duress. They have morals and values, they just aren't as fortunate as others in the way of possessions and money. \n \n \nI'm not sure what your point is. Are you trying to raise the Hitler question? Hitler was a Christian and claimed that he was doing his Christian duty. What does any of that have to do with the differential reproductive success of advantageous alleles? Evolutionary theory is not a moral imperitive. It is an explanation of what is observed in nature.\n \n \n Actually if you were educated in history you would know that Hitler was an evolutionists. If you got that simple trivial thing wrong, why should I trust you in things that I do not know? Atheistic evolutionist Sir Arthur Keith acknowledged of Hitler:\"The Germal Fuhrer ... is an evolutinoist; he has consciously sought to make the practice of Germany conform to the theory of eolution.\" ~ Keith, A., 1947. \"Evolution and Ethics\", Putman, New York, p.230.\n Don't worry, some of my friends didn't know either. If evolution is true, than it should have some reasonable explanation as to why we have morals, but it doesn't.\n \n \nI believe in what I have no evidence to support. That is faith. I do not believe in evolution. The evidence is overwhelming for the educated. As for your \"stumbling blocks,\" they are founded in ignorance. Why don't you educate yourself? You make creationism look foolish.\n \n \n Okay, just a minute ago you were talking about missing links and how archaeopteryx is the transitional fossil, now you are contradicting yourself by saying that you don't believe in evolution. I'm some what confused. That is, if I understood your message. I probably didn't. Sorry in advance if I mis-interpreted it. My stumbling block is not founded in ignorance, it is founded on logic. Why should an accident and naturalistic processes produce something like morals and ethics, values, etc? That is a logical question to ask. I make creation look foolish? Yep, okay. If that is what you believe than go ahead. I swiped up all of your arguments without a sweat. You could not even answer my only question: \"Where do, by evolutionary theory, morals and ethics come from?\" So who is the bigger fool here? I perfer to think that neither of us are fools, or me because I am arguing against something that is not worth it, i.e. the topic.\n \n \nI'm sure that you have educated yourself to address the list of features that I gave. I just can't believe that you would speak to the issue and not understand the implications of all of those points that I listed. Were you just a parrot?\n \n \n Poly want a cracker? LOL... No. Why would I want to when I have quotes from your evolutionists denying that there are any transitional forms? That does not seem logical! Actually, I have just had a week full of exams. Listen to what Stephen Jay Gould says on the topic about the evolutionary family trees:\"The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not the evidence of fossils.\"I gather that you'll want to know where that quote came from? \"Evolution's erratic pace\". Natural History, vol. LXXXVI(5), May 1977, p.14.\n \n I personally myself may not have fully understood the issues, that is why I use references. That is the safest thing to do!\n \n \nIt seems that you lack the ganas to even say that you don't know. An example of \"creation science\" at its best!\n \n \n Charmed. I do know the issues and have spent quite a while studying up on them. I know that to get from a single celled microorganism to the complex life that we see today such as a human would require the addition of nearly 999 books of 500 pages, fine print, of genetic information. And I also know that evolution cannot account for this. There has not thus far, been one mutation that can be seen to add any new material to the genome. Mutationn and natural selection are both information loosing processes, so how do evolutionists get new genetic information to keep their theory alive? I have no idea, they ignore the evidence and try not to let people know about it.\n \n The END. I must retire, it is getting late and time for some ice cream! Sorry about the length. I wish that it wasn't so long! I do not want to continue this argument, I will read your reply but will not answer it. I have put forward my argument in response to your reply.\n Best wishes,\n astronomyfan87.",

Where is the Bible racist? That I would like to know? It teaches that we are all equal in the sight of God and that there is only one race, The Human Race - which science has verified. So it is obvious that there is no racist attitude in the Bible. Creationists are not racists either. Since they work from the Bible they know that everyone stands equally before God and that there is only one race, the Human Race.\n \n You mention the KKK. They are not Christians!

   "You seem to be stuck on this idea of 'right' and 'wrong.' I may mis-understand the concept (assuming it is precisely defined), but my understanding is that there is no such thing as a moral right and wrong.\n\n \n That's only from a viewpoint that says there is no ultimate morality. If there is, then some actions are Right and some actions are Wrong. I think we must have different understandings of the idea.\n \n \nThere is nothing about the theory of evolution that precludes a God. That fabricated idea is absurd. There is nothing about the theory of relativity, nor the theory of gravity, nor the theory that the earth is round that precludes the existence of a Creator God. In reality, God may or may not exist. Some people believe God exists. Others do not believe God exists. Neither view can be proven based on physical evidence. Both are beliefs only. Though one of those beliefs must necessarily be true.\n\n \n I did not say that evolution precludes God, all I am saying is that many Atheists seem to think it does, and thus it likely contributes to the number of people who beleive there is no God. If a person does not beleive in God, then they must beleive there is no ultimate morality.\n \n \nEven with a God, your measuring stick is completely subjective. The measuring stick you use, even if you 'got it' from the Bible, may be completely different than a measuring stick that another Christian uses. Consider tossing the measuring stick aside... Consider that God isn't really interested in measuring you... \n\n \n I disagree. Lets assume that the Bible was inspired directly by God, as I beleive, and as do most, if not all, Christians as well. Then the Bible is God's measuring stick of morality, which he gave to us. We may disagree on exactly how to use it, how precisely to apply it, but we do agree that it is God's measuring stick. And, assuming the Bible is a message from God, it would seem that He does care about me. Assuming that Jesus was God's son, it would seem that God, the Son, and the Holy Ghost care about me, and you, very much.\n \n \n Now you are catching on. (I suspect not really, but the last statement you made makes sense.) Within a framework of morality, we would call the actions of Nazi Germany 'bad,' 'evil,' 'terrible,' etc. Viewing the same situation without a framework of morality, Nazi Germany still performed the same actions that had the same results. In reality, nothing is different. Your perception will be different, though, depending on your mindset. Without a framework of morality, there is no need to label the actions 'evil.' Rather, the actions are what they are.\n\n \n I thought I'd been saying that all along about relative morality! \n \n \nThat does not mean that someone operating without a framework of morality is going to rush out and act like Nazi Germany. The potential result of acting like Nazi Germany is that millions of minorities could be put to death.\n\n \n Perhaps not, but they certainly don't seem to have much reason not to - especially if some sort of benefit is anticipated. (such as an improved economy or medical advancement, or just a consilidation of power for the perpetrators)",

   "Morality comes from working together, even those who beleive their morals are aboslute and god given have to admit that a lot of them are there to let people live in large groups (which makes sense if God wanted people to live in groups they will need laws to get along). Mimetic evolution comes into this now as well, beleifs spread and change in the same way as genes do and this can lead to odd beliefs sticking around longer than they are actually useful for survival which is where we get the odder and more controversal morals, and these are usually based around defining groups or religion.\n \n The basic morality is 'me and you can stop him from doing things we don't done to us better than one of us can on our own', the morals themselves are the accpetable behaviour the group will tolerate and the freedoms they are willing to sacrfice. It isn't hard to see how a moral system could arise from this as it gets increasingly complicated as society evolves and the number of actions increases. Also importantly it shows the vital key point as to why evolution and lack of any higher power doesn't mean a collapse of morals- it is a lot easier living as a group than fending for yourself, and a group can protect you and bend others to its will, the sacrifices of freedoms is ususally worth making for these benefits. The larger and more tolerant the group, the less freedoms you sacrifice and the more often you can do what you want.",
