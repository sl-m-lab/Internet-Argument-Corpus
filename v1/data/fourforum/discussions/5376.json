   "ATLANTA, GEORGIA -- Representatives of the nation's top psychiatric group approved a statement Sunday urging legal recognition of same-sex marriage.\n \n If approved by the association's directors in July, the measure would make the American Psychiatric Association the first major medical group to take such a stance.\n \n The statement supports same-sex marriage \"in the interest of maintaining and promoting mental health.\"\n \n It follows a similar measure by the American Psychological Association last year, little more than three decades after that group removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.\n \n The psychiatric association's statement, approved by voice vote on the first day of its weeklong annual meeting in Atlanta, cites the \"positive influence of a stable, adult partnership on the health of all family members.\"\n \n The document clarifies that the association is addressing same-sex civil marriage, not religious marriages.\n http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0505230162may23,1,4935846.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed",

Sometime ago I proved you wrong about this, and you now try again. Please read....\n \n Most adults who sexually molest children are considered to have pedophilia, a mental disorder described in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). An adult who engages in sexual activity with a child is performing a criminal and immoral act that never can be considered normal or socially acceptable behavior.\n \n Pedophilia is categorized in the DSM-IV as one of several paraphiliac mental disorders. The essential features of a paraphilia (sexual deviation) are recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviors that generally involve nonhuman subjects, the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or children or other nonconsenting persons...................\n Similarly, many individuals who act on their pedophiliac urges claim that their behavior is nonproblematic and may even claim it is \"beneficial\" to the child. Nonetheless, the DSM-IV would consider such individuals to have pedophilia because, by definition, acting on pedophiliac urges is considered to be an impairment in functioning.\n http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_detaillb.cfm?article_ID=ZZZUZRUZGLC&sub_cat=355",
