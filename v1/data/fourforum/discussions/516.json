It makes your skin lighter, sucks ALL the pigmentation out of the skin which makes u VERY light. \n \n He does admit to having plastic surgery. He says he has in his books, and also in documentaries. He is saying that it's ridicilous how many people THINK he has and how many he REALLY has. I mean I bet he's got like 5 nose jobs thats about it. His face he doesn't get surgery on, just the nose.",

Plus what I said below key words \"I BET HE'S HAD\" not \"I KNOW HE'S HAD\"! The pigment disorder which you don't obviously know about EITHER is first it starts out in blotches but then it spreads throughout the whole skin causing ALL not SOME but ALL of the pigment to be eliminated.emoticon_angry",

   "That's where you are wrong once again. His books came out BEFORE any of the interviews that y'all know today. But see you guys would not know that because you don't take the time to research and back your arguement....all you do is say tabloid lies. Tabloids lie, there aren't ANY truth whatsoever in tabloids. They are only out to make money~ \"Just because you read it in a magazine or see it on a TV screen don't make it factual, ACTUAL.\" Okay you guys just read that, I mean SO many people are fooled by this XXXX. \n \n Now sure I yell at y'all sometimes but that is only because you just won't even think about what you know about him is ALL based upon lies. I just want you to know the truth and not be so focused on what the tabloids say.<see tabloid thing above< Now see when you guys yell at me all for the tabloid lies, I yell back, because tabloids are no good pieces of garbage and need to leave people alone. Ya know you guys may think I hate you and everything but that is where you are wrong I just want you to see what tabloids can do to you, and how you can stopp them. Tabloids are just no good and we don't need them. l Geez you can't go ANYWHERE these days without a camera in your face.",
