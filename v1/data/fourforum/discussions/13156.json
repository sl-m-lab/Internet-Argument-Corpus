The plane exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people, 189 of them American. \n \n Speaking at the Scottish government's ministerial headquarters in Edinburgh, Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill he said that humanity was a defining characteristic of the Scottish people, and that \"our belief dictates that justice be served but mercy be shown.\" \n \n \"It is my decision that Mr. al-Megrahi be released on compassionate grounds and allowed to return to Libya to die,\" he said. \n \n In defending his decision, MacAskill said that the former agent \"did not show his victims any comfort or compassion. They were not allowed to return to the bosom of their families to see out their lives, let alone their dying days. No compassion was shown by him to them. But that alone is not a reason for us to deny compassion to him and his family in his final days.\" \n \n He said at the news conference that he had rejected the application to transfer him to a prison in Libya, and that after seeking medical advice, he estimated that Megrahi had about three months left to live. \n Scotland Releases Lockerbie Bomber on Compassionate Grounds - washingtonpost.com \n",
