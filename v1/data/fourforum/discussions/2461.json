   "There must be lots of debate topics more pleasant than that of race, but I was asked to address the issue of why black rates of street crime are higher than for other groups, so here goes. \n \n There are a number of theories on the subject; let me go from the most popular among criminologists (that means most liberal) to the least popular. \n \n The most popular explanation focuses on America and argues that crime is produced by a culture that demands economic success of everyone in a society where such a goal cannot be reached by some. The strain caused by the pressure to succeed when there is a lack of opportunity to do so leads people to turn to crime in desperation as a way to achieve the American Dream.\n \n The problem with this theory is that research has revealed that America, a country that should produce much strain and thus crime, does not have a high rate of property crimes, the very crimes that enrich a person the most. \n The U.S. is similar to other countries in property-related crimes. Where America (and American blacks) stick out is with violent crime--crimes that generally are not profitable. The typical murder involves an argument between two guys over some trivial matter, and the murder profits you nothing. \n \n Another problem with this theory is the basic criminological finding that criminals are \"generalists\"; that is, they commit a very wide range of illegal and legal but irresponsible acts. Not only do they steal, they vandalize; they assault adults and children and rape women (and sometimes men); they get addicted to drugs and gambling and wild, reckless living; they have work records of unreliability; and they have unstable relationships. Strain theory presents the image of an ambitious guy who just needs a chance, but criminals are short-term hedonists. \n \n Where the theory is more credible is with drug dealing which can be very profitable, especially for a youth who otherwise will be flipping burgers for minimum wage. The vast majority of street dealers never achieve the long-term wealth symbolized by the American Dream, but it can get some guys big money quickly. \n \n A more realistic theory might focus more on a subculture which has developed in poor black communities of flashy conspicuous consumption and has glamorized not only the money and things but the status and glamor of the gangster. With many blacks at the margins of society, this kind of alternative culture may have developed in contrast to the orginal image of the theory of poor people just wanting mainstream respectability that wealth could give.\n \n Strain theory was designed to explain property crime, but where blacks have especially high rates is with serious violence, so more recent theorists have presented at least two revisions of the theory. First, oppressive treatment of blacks, especially unfair in a society preaching eqaulity, has produced a diffuse rage and resentment among blacks. That rage is a general feeling, not necessarily directed at anyone, but it gets taken out on convenient targets, usually other blacks.\n \n A problem with this theory, like strain theory, is that it is designed to explain the situation in the U.S., but the reality of high levels of black violent crime is found in any country that has data on the issue. WHO, INTERPOL, and victimization survey data all indicate that rates of violent crime are high among blacks in Canada, or Britain; in all predominantly black Caribbean countries; and in black African countries. \n \n One could argue that oppression in those countries could have them same effect there, but the high rates are found, not matter how absent whites are from the society, and no matter matter the level of white domination. For example, South African violent crime has escalation in tandem with reforms there. This theory would predict a decrease in violent crime as white domination receded. The same is true in the U.S. During the 1960s and 1970s, we saw the the cause of civil rights advance; at the same time there was a crime explosion. \n \n Another version of the theory, since people are far from satisfied with the original, is that black crime rates increased 1960-1994 because inquality grew between lower-class blacks and middle-class BLACKS. As the latter moved into middle-class lifestyles, lower-class blacks were left behind, and this is the source of their resentment. A theory like this may be consistent with a specific historical trend, but the problem with these theories is that they fail to be general enough to explain the worldwide pattern. \n \n Social learning theory contends that marginalized communties develop subcultures favorable to crime, and so there develop powerful gangs which compete with the decent people of the neighborhood for the loyalty of the children. Some children will fall under their influence and will socialized into the gang. \n \n The problem with this theory, along with others, is that it views all kids as the same and as passive sponges who either have good luck and avoid the gang's influence or have bad luck and fall into it. Research shows that small children and school-age children who have serious behavior problems are more likely than other children to be involved in serious crime 20 or 30 years down the road. Sociological theories like social learning ignore the fact the children get on a path toward criminality at the earliest of ages. So any valid theory must incorporate this finding. \n \n Another theory claims that crime is the product of neighborhood with weak, disorganized institutions, especially those that socialize children. So crime grows rampant where the families, schools, churches, community orgs., and businesses are failing at their jobs of socializing and supervising young people. Research clearly shows that crime is rampant in these kinds of neighborhoods, but the analyses are always done at a macro-level, so we don't know, for example, if it's the kids not going to church who are breaking the law or not. These studies don't rule out the possiblity that these neighborhoods have higher numbers of people with certain traits who are prone to criminality. This trait theory may not be true, but it cannot be ruled out with these kinds of studies. \n \n Related to this disorganization theory is the idea that blacks have high crime rates because they have high levels of family instability and this problem is very concentrated in poor black neighborhoods, so you'll have say 80% of families with dad not around all living together on the same block. Such a condition causes families and neighborhoods to lose control of young people. Research generally shows that if you control for family structure, the black-crime correlation at the neighborhood level often disappears, but once again we don't know if its the characteristics of the neighborhood that is causing the problem or that the neighborhood has a higher number of people with traits conducive to crime (and other social problems). \n \n The last two theories are generally politically unacceptable to criminologists, so they usually don't study them--at least as they relate to explaining balck crime. The first is self-control theory which claims that crime is the result of not correcting children consistently when they misbehave, so they grow up not developing the habit of considering the long-term consquences of bad behavior or how it hurts others. According to this theory, newborn babies are naturally self-focused and can only thinking about getting their needs met right now. The habit of thinking of others and the future has to be taught to children over the long haul of childhood, through thousands of learning opportunities. Criminals never effectively learn this and lead lives of impulsivity, pleasure-seeking, shortcut-hunting, and irresponsibility. \n \n The research finding that criminals engage in a wide variety of destructive behavior is consistent with this theory, as is the fact the serious behvaior problems short very early, are shown early in school through defiance of teachers, bullying, aggression, stealing, vandalism, lying, etc. And the problems continue right into adulthood. The theory cannot explain everything however; impulsivity, low self-control, risk-taking, intelligence, etc.--all these kinds of traits are certainly related to crime but far from perfectly. \n \n More specifically for this thread, I haven't seen the theory tested to explain the racial difference in crime. If this theory were true, implied is that black families tend to be less effective at consistently correcting misbehavior on the part of their children. It is well documented that family problems are more common in black families, and some research indicates that black children tend to receive less supervision, but people simply do not like to consider this possibilty, so it has not been studied much. \n \n Even less politically acceptable is the theory that average differences in biology account for race differences in crime. This is a totally taboo subject and is generally not studied, especially in any direct way. Twins studies do show such traits as aggression, impulsivity, risk-taking, callousness, lack of altruism, narcissism, intelligence etc., are substantially influenced by genes, but this is far from direct evidence that racial differences are explained by different frequencies in these traits. Some have argued that antisocial personality disorder--partly genetic in origin--occurs more often in blacks, but the research has not been done from what I have seen. Research has shown that blacks tend to have higher levels of testosterone--shown to be related to aggressiveness--than other groups, one reason for their higher rates of prostate cancer. \n \n A biological theory is the one theory that could most easily explain the high rates of crime in countries all around the world, but in one study in Criminology by Neopolitan, he eliminated the race-crime correlation by controlling for several social factors. The biological people, on the other hand, would argue that the genetic composition of population produces its social conditions which in turn produce behavior like crime, so the social factors simply mediate the effects of genes. Most social scientists refuse to study these claims, even with the motivation to disprove them, so the facts are simply scarce. \n \n A genetic explanation, for instance, cannot explain trends like the explosion of street crime in the U.S. during the 60s,70s, and 80s, nor its decline in the second half of the 90s. \n \n Anyway, like always in social science, there is no simple answer. No theory seems to handle all the facts.",

   "Interesting read I must say. Personally I think it seems like there is no \"definite\" answer to crime, but rather theories that may explain certain criminial behaviour, or increase the \"risk\" for criminal behaviour. \n \n When it come to the theory of a competative culture giving rise to crimes I personally think that theory seems a bit weak for the reasons you gave. It might explain tax fraude, embesslement and organised economic crime (such as drug barons), but murders and rape are generally not motivated by economic gain. But I suspect that economics do play a part nonetheless. I don`t know about the statistics in the US, but I would be surprised if they where much different from the swedish statistics where social class heavily influences the tendancy to commit (violent) crime. The explanation might not lie rational economic profit maximizing (as violent crime seldom give rise to economic profit), but it might lie in the parenting, social pressure, lack of parental expectations, distrust in society, lack of dreams, general alienation, abusive homes, substance abuse etc, etc. As far as I`ve undrestand, blacks tends to have a worse socio economic status then whites in the US. As this is true in virtually every european country (as well as countries like South Africa) it would perhaps explain some of the differences in crime rates?\n \n I also wonder how crime rates are correlated with urbanisation. I mean, to me it seems like cities have much higher crime rate/capita than \"the countryside\". Perhaps a higher representation of blacks in cities oculd explain some of the higher crime rates?\n \n I also want to point out that South African general crime rates have been dropping for a few years now. And while there is still a very high crime rate, the development is going in the right direction.",

   "i had always been of the opinion that the social problems among any society is rooted in parenting and upbringing. it is true that black families are mostly single-parent, and the environment tends to 'parent' the child even more than the child's own mother. i think that anybody being raised in an environment where crime and illegal activity is prominent will tend adopt criminal and illegal behavior, no matter what race. therefore the ghettos continuously spawn cycles of criminals that 'raise' criminals.\n \n of course, free will is always a factor, as there are always 'success stories' of people that came through a ghetto background and yet adopted legal and socially acceptable activities, so the environment may not tyranically dictate the fate of all ghetto people, but it certainly is a strong influencial factor, and the majority of people succumb to it\n \n i think one of the major enigmas is the seeming tendancy for white children to be more easily disciplined than blacks. most black people that grew up in the 70's and earlier will undoubtedly recall getting 'whooped' (corporal punishment) growing up, and are usually grateful that their parents were that strict with them, since they testify to turning out better because of it. conversely, white people growing up in the same era seem to have experienced much less whoopings, but more alternative form of correction like \"go to your room\" or \"youre grounded\", and apparently it would be sufficient for them to curb their behavior.\n \n to me, this is one of the most significant differences that i have noticed between the 2 races. and i believe that from this stems most of the other behavioral differences that the both races are stereotyped on. \n \n of course, this is mainly from my personal perspective, and there may or may not be other factors that i overlook that produce this contrast",

   "Unkerpaulie, excellent post. One mistake people make with discipline is to assume that different groups tend to be different because of a different culture: blacks and Hispanics tend to spank or \"whoop\" more (at least traditionally as you say) than whites because of cultural differences. It seems just as likely that these groups are spanking more because their encountering misbehavior more frequently. This would explain why in any group--black, Hispanic, or white--boys tend to be spanked more often than girls--because they misbehave more. I don't know if I have run across research but my impression is that Asian parents tend to take a milder approach with their children, yelling or spanking less, but then again the kids more often seem to be more easily managed. Research shows that you get escalation where the child is difficult, so the parent is harsh, sometimes creating more defiance in the child, and so on in a cycle.",

I think there may something to your idea about cultural differences. I know writers like the black sociologist Franklin Frazier argued that slavery eliminated any element of African culture, but others have argued that, for example, the very high rate of single parent households is similar to many West African countries where prominent men would have more than one wife and usually would not live with any of them. This, combined with the fact that women generally had some control over their crops, tended to make women less dependent on a man, more willing to take care of things on her own. \n \n The only problem I have with this idea is that prior to the 1960s most black families in America had both mom and dad together, so this trend toward mother-only households is a recent phenomenon.

   "Well it seems clear to me that there is a reciprocal relationship between the two. As Moynihan pointed out in the 60s, 25% of black babies were born to single moms. Then the War on Poverty was put in place and by the 90's 70% were born out-of-wedlock. It has stayed steady around 70% since the welfare reforms were signed into law by Clinton in 1996. That seems clear evidence to me that welfare benefits have resulted in a further decline in marriage among blacks (and whites too, although at a lower rate).\n\n to me it still does not correlate. mothers would very very scarcely opt for government support over a father figure. its extremely more common that fathers dont want the burden of being tied to a family and leave the mothers to fend for themselves. the state tries to sustain the mothers by providing more benefits, and this may make the options of fathers abandoning their kids easier, since they know that the state provides for single mothers in their absence. it is utterly rare that women will want to raise a child by themselves just to be independent of the father's support. consider also that a substantial number of black mothers have children by more than one man. in an effort to look for fatherly support for their families, some mothers try to find a substitute father, hoping that he will stick around and help her raise the family. what happens in most of these cases is the new man gives her yet another child and abandons the family again, putting the mother in a worse position than she started in, and putting more pressure on the state to fund the growing family\n \n i assure you, it is certainly not a case of women wanting indepence and opting state funding over fatherly support",

I'm sure they will be waiting there with sacks of gold for you upon your return. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nimagine if it were the other way around, if africans took over and made whites plant gardens and live in thatch huts. would you be happy to assimilate to that culture?\n\n \n My ancestors were starved out of Scotland in the 1700's and my first relative came to the US as an indentured servant. You think that Africans held a monopoly on human suffering over the last 300 years? Are you aware that many slaves were sold into slavery by neighboring tribes instead of killing them all off or by their own leaders? One could argue that slavery kept a portion of the African population from being butchered in local tribal clashes and provided goods and services to many African tribes. I don't have any statistics on what percentage of slaves were captured by other African tribes, but I'd guess that it wasn't just a few........ Wait, I found a couple of sources to reinforce my point:\n \"Even after Europeans began importing black slaves to America, most trade was just that: \"trade\". In most instances, the Europeans did not need to use any force to get those slaves. The slaves were \"sold\" more or less legally by their (black) owners. Scholars estimate that about 12,000,000 Africans were sold by Africans to Europeans and 17,000,000 were sold to Arabs (most of them before 1776, when the USA wasn't even born). The legends of European mercenaries capturing free people in the jungle are mostly just that: legends. A few mercenaries certainly stormed peaceful tribes and committed horrible crimes, but that was not the rule. There was no need to risk their lives, so most of them didn't: they simply purchased people.\"\n \n http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/slavetra.html\n \n and\n \n \"In order to suppress the African slave trade more effectively, the United States and Great Britain agreed to the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 1842. This treaty provided that the United States would keep ships along the western coast of Africa to operate with British vessels against the slave traders. \n \n From 1843 until the outbreak of the Civil War, the United States provided an African Squadron for such duty as well as other vessels off the waters of Brazil and Cuba for the same purpose. \n \n Perry's policy was one of supporting Liberia, which had been founded some two decades before on the African \"Grain Coast\" as a haven for freed negroes from the United States. The new colony was deeply resented by the local, coastal tribes which had acted as slave trade's middlemen, buying slaves from their bushmen captors and selling them to masters of slave ships. Missing their former profits from the now outlawed commerce in \"black ivory,\" these natives gave vent to their anger by harassing, threatening, and sometimes attacking the black colonists from America. From time to time, they also preyed upon American merchant shipping. \"\n \n http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/slave.htm\n \n So, you see. Slavery wasn't only a black vs white issue. It was also a black vs black and white vs white issue.\n Food for thought, eh? emoticon_confused",

He was well-loved by the blacks in Detroit and caused a mass exodus of MANY businesses out of Detroit. Detroit became the murder capital of the US during this period. His successors have softened their anti-white rhetoric and have been able to attract businesses back into Detroit and it is turning around. Casinos, GM's HQ and a host of new housing developments are positive signs of change in Detroit's management and philosophy towards whites and the \"Burbs\" that Coleman Young routinely railed against.\n I think that the moral of the story is that you must assimilate into the larger society or suffer as a result of failing to do so.",

   "Greetings to Galton and All:\n \n I am trying to paint a happy face on this post, but there seems just no way. At the risk of also being labeled a racist (btw, the ancestors on my mother's side are native Americans), please allow me to interject a few points from personal experience, that may lead to further light on this topic. I believe your saying, History+Reason=Wisdom plays a role here. Allow me to state the obvious and also say that no rule applies to everyone, and there are always exceptions. \n \n The invention that translated the old world into different civilized societies was the plow. With the plow and irrigation techniques, some of mankind learned to generate and store sufficient food resources to allow for the growth of towns, cities and even empires. While some among us continued to build upon these foundations, people in other parts of the world remained hunters and gatherers. This is the difference in what we call civilized societies and tribal communities. \n \n Most of the folks descended from civilized lineages welcome one another by looking each other in the eye with a firm handshake. These are signs of honesty, presence of mind, security within oneself, and our honest intentions toward the other party. We all know how if feels to be summed up, as we go through this initial process of introductions to one another. \n \n There are governing dynamics that apply to African Americans (and indeed native Indian Americans, and the descendents of other tribal backgrounds) that do not apply to the descendents of the dominant European settlers of this great nation. It was explained to me by some of my black coworkers that they avoid looking each other directly in the eyes, as this is a sign of one man seeking dominance over the other. Anyone who has spent time in prison knows what this means (one eyeballing the other). My experience is that this behavior is typical of those who have descended from tribal cultures where hierarchies and descending family orders are the hallmark of their entire existence. \n \n Has anyone else noted the genocidal behavior of one African tribe over another that goes on over in Africa? Many of my black friends here in America have suffered the loss of a family member from the hands of another black person. One of my lifelong friends lost his wife and son in a drive-by shooting, as they were standing in his front yard. The next week he was robbed by another black man at gunpoint while visiting his local convenient store. I myself was knocked unconscious from behind with a four foot level, and almost thrown off a building by an enraged black man. My brother was attacked downtown and had his face cut open by an enraged black man over a driving incident. \n \n The answer for me has nothing to do with economic success, lack of opportunity, the American Dream, or any other such nonsense. As a society, we are being made to pay for the mistakes of our forefathers who believed that enslaving tribal people was a viable option, as a means of attaining their American Dream. Forcing people from a tribal heritage to live in a civilized society is setting a time bomb, and just waiting for it to explode. These bombs are going off every hour of every day across this country. \n \n The last I heard, one in six black men in California were behind bars, and the numbers were only getting worse. Many black men welcome prison, because of their inability to cope with the rules governing our society. After all, life in prison has a hierarchy setting that very much resembles a tribal setting. Sorry for the gloomy report, but my brother and I are thankful to be still counted among the living. \n \n Can anyone provide us with numbers on the just how many crimes are being committed by the illegal aliens who are flooding into this country at record pace? How long before Bush signs them all up for voter's cards and driver's licenses? Are they descended from tribal or civil societies? I guess we will figure that one out by the crime rates over the next 100 years, as our children will certainly pay for the mistakes we continue to make today.\n \n Terral",

The International Tribunal on Reparations for African People in the USA, for example, was an offshoot of the Black Panthers movement (5). Reparation demands were often anti-white and separatist. In 1968, the Republic of New Africa called for $400billion in reparations to finance an independent black republic (5).\n \n Today, by contrast, the demand has moved into the heart of the US liberal elite - and carries the banner, not of black separatism, but of national unification and the 'healing' of social divisions. The Democratic Party has agreed that it will champion up to $440billion of reparations (6). Senator John Coyers Jr has 31 sponsors for a bill in the Senate that will pledge millions to studying the possibility of reparations for slavery. At least 10 US city councils, including California and Chicago, have endorsed the idea of a federal 'impact statement' on slavery (7). Academic conferences have been held on the subject, and a number of academics support the reparation cause.http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000002D21E.htm \n \n\n \n I guess, like Bond, you're out of touch with the black population as well.

One thing that bothers me about this sad state of affairs is that in a normal, healthy society, the general rule in social relations is reciprocity: \"I will return to you what you do for me.\" But this couldn't be further from the reality when it comes to race relations these days. If blacks as a group reciprocated toward whites as they typically are treated by whites, few blacks would make negative comments about blacks in public settings, and other blacks would jump on them for saying those things, and they would say that those claims are nonsense and constitute hate speech. To give an example, a brave black guy would say, \"We all know that white people can't dance.\" Instantly, a chorus of blacks would cry out that such a statement is patent nonsense, you are a hater if you say it, and even if it were true, it is because whites are denied opportunities to learn how to dance, and anyway, maybe whites can't dance, but we blacks are not very good at ballet. \n \n I will defend, apologize, and wring my hands in concern for black problems when the typical black person defends, apologizes, and wrings his hands in concern over white problems. Doing so treats blacks as equals, not as an indulgent parent toward a child.",

I don't have a link offhand about black/English incomes because those comparisons are not commonly made, but does that seems out of whack? And I gave you an apple/apple comparison: blacks in the 50s with blacks now. If Wolfgang reported more crime for middle income blacks than lower income whites, what do expect that studies show for middle-class black/middle-class white or lower-class blacks/lower class whites comparisons? LARGER racial differences. And that is exactly what you see. A substantial percentage of middle-class blacks get sucked into the ghetto world where they have many family/friend connections. This is not surprising since it is the ghetto that produces the image of what is cool for black youths in general. I hear stories all the time in the classroom of blacks students who have a middle-income cousin from a good family getting sucked into a gang. How many middle-class white gang bangers do you know? In fact, how many lower-class white gang bangers do you know? \n \n In all the studies I have seen (many, I have a PhD in criminology nad have to read the damn things whether I want to or not) race is much more strongly correlated with serious street crime than social class. For example, if we take 500 randomly selected cities, and run a correlations beween percent black, percent of the population in poverty, and the homicide rate, race will explain probably three times as much variation in homicide as poverty does. In fact, in a multivariate analysis where the two factors are thrown into the equation, the poverty-homicide correlation is sometimes reduced to zero. The way this finding would be interpreted is that the reason why there is any correlation between poverty and homicide is that blacks have higher rates of poverty than whites. The poverty-homicide correlation is interpreted as spurious or non-causal. \n \n I'm sure you're going to complain that I still haven't provided any links so I'll look something up to show that I'm not lying.",

Does the original poster only mean violent crimes? Felonies? Misdemeanors? Fines? Does the original poster only mean offenses for which the person was incarcerated? Fined? Warned?\n Anyone can make a statement of varying validity, and implicitly assert their belief as truth.

Men in that type of society develop hair triggers for violent retaliation against anyone who would test his resolve by signs of disrespect that could reveal them to be easy pickings for rustlers or theives. In the inner-city, a young man's wealth is easily stealable since it is in the form of drugs or cash, and police protection is unreliable. \n \n Inner-city neighborhoods are among the most violent environments and they have a \"culture of honor\" in a sense. The obsession with respect, the cultuvation of a reputation for toughness, the willingness to violently retaliate against any slight are startlingly similar to the culture of honor in the South. \n \n Another factor, explained by Steven Pinker in The Blank Slate is that \"poor people, especially young men, cannot take pride in a prestigious job, a nice house, or professional accomplishments[...] Their reputation on the streets is their only claim to status.\" Status and esteem are powerful motivators, recognized not only by psychologists but by the framers of our very Constitution.",

Maybe if I started a website that claimed whites are 3.5 x more likely to become involved in necrophilia, it would somehow become true.\n Not only could one argue with the source, one can argue about the significance of its figures. For instance, many times the media uses % in place of actual numbers if the numbers aren't statistically significant and/or the % gives us a greater feeling of its immensity. (Pay attention to the \"teasers\" right before commercial breaks.) For example, 3 out of 4 people in my office have red hair vs 75% of the ppl in my office have red hair.

It's \"due in part to\" x outnumbering y.\n \n Logical fallacies abound, but that's what happens when one denies logic and thinks based on emotions, faith, or outright ignorance. \n *BTW, I don't have a problem with racists per se, just ignorance. I believe that if you give all people a chance and assess them individually, you can find a reason to hate them without reference to their race, culture, etc.\n\n \n Not really. The point is if there are more blacks, and all people were equally likely to commit a hatecrime, the odds are greater that a single individual would be a white person committing a hate crime than a black person committing a hate crime. Hopefully both of these combined outnumber the innocent people, but you get my point. It's not \"take a random white person\", it's \"take a random person\". They are more likely to be white, so with percentages it would make sense for there to be more whites committing hate crimes.",

   "Wow, if it's from a website then it must be true. Maybe if I started a website that claimed whites are 3.5 x more likely to become involved in necrophilia, it would somehow become true.\n Not only could one argue with the source, one can argue about the significance of its figures. For instance, many times the media uses % in place of actual numbers if the numbers aren't statistically significant and/or the % gives us a greater feeling of its immensity. (Pay attention to the \"teasers\" right before commercial breaks.) For example, 3 out of 4 people in my office have red hair vs 75% of the ppl in my office have red hair. If I wanted to emphasize how greatly the redheads outnumber the darkhaired, I'd choose the %.\n \n\n \n Not really. 3 in 4 gives a more personal touch to it and seems more significant than 75%. It is also better because of rounding. If it's really 70%, they can still use 3 in 4, because if you have 4, the odds are it would be 3, NOT 2 (50%).",

You're changing the error to fit your thinking. The original statement was \"Blacks commit 7.5 times more violent interracial crimes than whites, although whites outnumber blacks by 7 to 1.\" A violent interracial crime is not the same as a hate crime. Take the black guy in New York who shot people on the subway for example. He shot randomly, but because statistically a white person was shot by a black person, that can be considered a \"violent interracial crime.\" Read that sentence again. However, because he killed indiscriminately, it wasn't a \"hate crime.\" Please check your assumptions.\n The white college student who ran over people with his car committed a violent crime. But because he was white and --surprise! -- most of his victims were white, statistically less \"violent interracial crimes\" were committed during that act.\n I actually don't know why you'd say that. Maybe you just read it wrong. Yes, take a random person, it's more likely a white person *as the victim* as well. When you add \"hate crime\" as a criteria, you're specifying things that aren't there.",

I don't think this is talking about random killings, but specific killing of the other race. If everyone was just as likely to commit an interracial hate crime, the odds are that it's a white person. We don't look at the victims, because it's not that people are equally likely to be victims. That's just luck.",
