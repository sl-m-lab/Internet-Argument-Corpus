One of them is called \"self-defense\".\n \n And I think that needs to be pointed out because we are talking about whether the assailant committed a justified killing, or an unjustified killing. If anybody tries to put \"gay panic defense\" near \"self-defense\", it's like putting a dried up thistle next to a rose...\n \n ===============================\n \n I always found this defense \"amusing\" (or maybe just ironic) from the perspective that some of the people who believe in the \"gay panic defense\" also believe homosexuals to be mentally ill.\n \n And the \"gay panic defense\" is essentially telling the court that the assailant was in a diminished mental state and should not be held liable for his actions. That he could not control his violent outburst. Essentially, that he is the mentally ill one...\n \n \n On another level, has this type of defense ever been successfully attempted / employed?

I had a gay man ask me some rather uncomfortable questions one time but I didn't kill him (this was when I worked at a hotel). I replied \"sorry I'm not gay\" and we shot the breeze until my shift was over. I think he felt a little embarassed though.
