It might, indeed, be said that they crossed to the islands by swimming, but this could only be true of those very near the mainland; whereas there are some so distant, that we fancy no animal could swim to them. But if men caught them and took them across with themselves, and thus propagated these breeds in their new abodes, this would not imply an incredible fondness for the chase. At the same time, it cannot be denied that by the intervention of angels they might be transferred by God's order or permission. If, however, they were produced out of the earth as at their first creation, when God said, \"Let the earth bring forth the living creature,\"25 this makes it more evident that all kinds of animals were preserved in the ark, not so much for the sake of renewing the stock, as of prefiguring the various nations which were to be saved in the church; this, I say, is more evident, if the earth brought forth many animals in islands to which they could not cross over.\n St. Aurelius Augustin\n http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-02/npnf1-02-22.htm#P2783_1557226\n \n Further...from a Q&A Orthodox site\n Q\n A non-Christian person has pointed out what he believes to be a contradiction in the book of Genesis. First, God commanded Noah to take two of every living creature without distinguishing between clean or not clean ones: Gen 6: 19-20 \"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.\" Then, God distinguished between the clean creatures and the unclean as follow: Gen 7: 2-3 \"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.\" Noah though, took only two of every kind ignoring the second command of God by taking seven of the clean ones as it is stated here: Gen 7: 8-9 \"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.\"\n \n A\n Noah did not ignore God's commandment but followed it exactly. God's command to Noah was \"Two of every sort ?. , to keep them alive\" (Gen 6:19-20) Those are the minimum of each species to go in the ark and be kept alive afterwards. Then God gave Noah more specific instructions, to take seven pairs of the clean beasts and of the clean birds. The purpose of this became clear after the flood. The birds were needed to explore the earth (Gen 8:7-12) and the clean animals to be used as sacrifice to the Lord. Noah did not ignore this commandment but the Bible says \" There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female\"  If you read this carefully it does not say one pair of each species but that they went in as pairs males and females. If Noah had taken only one pair of each and then offered each of these pairs in sacrifice, these species would have become completely extinct.",

   "Monty babbles:\n \nCertainly science has provided part of the answer with their finding of the Mitachondrial \"Eve\", suggesting that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human populations.\n\n Again Monty has shown that he doesn't bother to learn what he is talking about before he speaks. It is not true that science has \"found\" the mitochondrial Eve, nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human population. Both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme. The mitochondrial (note spelling monty) Eve is a mathematical concept. If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct, then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so.\n \n And of course, the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondria. High school biology students know this. And, of course, recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles. Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene, monty's assertion becomes pure nonsense.\n Hank says:\n \nThe hypothesis of a mitochondria Eve is about 17 years old and has been shown to be wrong.\n\n Really? When and by whom? I wasn't even aware that it was an hypothesis but simply a mathematical concept derived from the mutation rate of the mitochondrial DNA. Possibly the time has been adjusted due to differing estimates of the mutatiion rate, but the concept is valid.\n \n Here is some information. Monty, I would recommend that you read the books suggested so that you might gain some understanding of what you are discussing. You continue to make yourself look foolish. River out of Eden is a good, basic introduction to the main concepts of evolutionary biology.\n \n For information on Mitochondrial Eve see What, if anything, is a Mitochondrial Eve?",

It's not much of a falsification theory you have there. Why not earthquake myths? Or spirits from heaven wiping men out. What about other universals? Such as fire or lightning or a plague, or demons?\n \n There are universal elements to the story of the flood...\n \n Sumerian\n In the eleventh tablet of the Semitic Babylonian epic of Gilagamesh is a flood story that is the source for the Noah story. The Gods resolved to cleanse the earth of an overpopulated humanity, but Utnapishtim was warned by the God Ea in a dream. He and some craftsmen built a huge (seven decks encompassing one acre in area) ark. Utnapishtim then loaded it with his family, the craftsmen, and \"the seed of all living creatures.\" The waters rose up, and a storm continued for six days and six nights. The Gods repented and wept upon seeing the global destruction of living beings and stilled the flood on the seventh day. The waters covered everything but the top of the mountain Nisur, where the boat landed. A dove was loosed, but it returned, having found no place to rest. A swallow was sent, but it too returned. Seven days later, after having loosed a raven that did not return to the ark, the people began to emerge. Utnapishtim made a sacrifice to the Gods. He and his wife were given immortality and lived at the end of the earth. \n \n Babylonian\n Three times (every 1200 years), the Gods became distressed by the disturbance from human overpopulation. The Gods dealt with the problem first by plague, then by famine. Both times, the God Enki advised humans to bribe the God causing the problem. The third time, Enlil advised the Gods to destroy all humans with a flood, but Enki had Atrahasis build an ark and so escape. Also on the boat were cattle, wild animals and birds, and the family of Atrahasis. After seeing the suffering caused by the flood, the Gods regretted their action, and Enki established barren women and stillbirth to avoid the problem in the future. \n \n Hebrew\n Based on the Babylonian story with the difference that the flood was a harsh punishment for humanity's sinfulness. Noah was 600 years old when it began to rain for what ended up being 40 days and 40 nights. After the end of 150 days, the waters were abated. The ark rested in the seventh month upon the mountains of Ararat. Waters decreased until the 10th month, on the first day of the 10th month; tops of mountains were also seen. At the end of 40 days, Noah opened the windows of the ark. First, he sent a raven, which went to and fro. He then sent a dove, which returned and hadn't found land. After seven more days, another dove was loosed; it returned that evening with an olive leaf. The next week, the dove didn't return. After a year and 10 days from the start of the flood, every creature emerged from the ark. Noah sacrificed some clean animals and birds to God, and God, pleased with this, promised never again to destroy all living creatures. \n \n Australian\n During the Dreamtime flood, woramba, the Ark Gumana carrying Noah, Aborigines, and animals, drifted south and came to rest in the flood plain of Djilinbadu (about 70 km south of Noonkanbah Station, just south of the Barbwire Range and east of the Worral Range), where it can still be seen today. The white man's claim that it landed in the Middle East was a lie to keep Aborigines in subservience. \n \n Chaldean\n Xisuthrus was warned of a coming flood by the God Chronos, who ordered Xisuthrus to write a history and to build a vessel (5 stadia by 2 stadia) for his relations, friends, and two of every type of animal. After the flood began to subside, he sent out some birds, all of which returned. Upon trying again, the birds returned, their feet covered in mud. On the third trial, the birds didn't return. The people disembarked and offered sacrifices to the Gods. Xisuthrus, his wife, daughter, and the pilot of the ark were eventually transported to live with the Gods. \n \n Zoroastrian\n Ahura Mazda warned Yima that destruction in the form of floods, subsequent to the melting of the snow, was threatening the sinful world and gave him instructions for building a vara in which specimens of small and large cattle, humans, dogs, birds, fires, plants and foods were to be deposited in pairs. \n \n Hindu\n Manu, the first human, saved a small fish from the jaws of a larger fish. After hearing the smaller one beg for protection, Manu kept the fish safe, transferring it to larger and larger containers as it grew, finally returning it to the ocean. \n Because of this kindness, the fish returned to warn Manu about an imminent flood and told him to build a boat, stocking it with samples of every species. After the flood waters rose, Manu tied a rope to the fish's horn. The fish led him to a mountain and told Manu to fasten the ship's rope to a tree so that it would not drift. He stayed on the mountain (known as Manu's Descent) while the flood swept away all living creatures. Manu alone survived. \n \n \n Greco-Roman\n Zeus decided to punish humanity for its evil ways. Other Gods grieved at the destruction because there would be no beings to worship them. Zeus promised a new stock, a race of miraculous origin. He was going to use thunderbolts when he remembered one of Fate's decrees: that a time would come when sea and earth and dome of the sky would blaze up, and the massive structure of the universe would collapse in ruins. With Poseidon's help, he caused storm and earthquake to flood every part of the land except the summit of Mount Parnassus. When Zeus crushed the hanging clouds in his hand, there was a loud crash, and sheets of rain fell from heaven. The rivers began rushing to the sea. When Neptune struck the earth with his trident, the rivers raced across the plains. Sea and earth could no longer be distinguished; all was sea without any shores, covering every living being except for one fortunate couple, Deucalion and Pyrrha. Earlier, Deucalion and Pyrrha had consulted Themis at her oracular shrine. She warned of a future flood, and they prepared by acquiring a boat. In time, their boat ran aground on the summit of Mount Parnassus. (Note: This is the mountain at Delphi, \"navel of the earth\" and home of the great oracle.) \n Recognizing their piety, Zeus allowed them to live and withdrew the waters. It was then that Deucalion and Pyrrha remembered the other oracle given by Themis: to repopulate the world by throwing \"behind you the bones of your great mother.\" Pyrrha didn't want to injure her mother's ghost by disturbing her bones. Prometheus soothed her fears. \"Oracles are righteous and never advise guilty action...\" They decided that the \"bones\" were stones in the body of the earth (\"Great Mother\"). They threw the stones, which became humans; men of the stones thrown by Deucalion; women, of those cast by Pyrrha. Animals were produced by earth of its own volition. According to Plato: \"Many great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years.\" \n \n \n Jicarilla (Apache)\n Before the Apaches emerged from the underworld, there were other people on the earth. Dios told an old man and old woman that it would rain forty days and nights. People were warned to go to the tops of four mountains (Tsisnatcin, Tsabidzilhi, Becdilhgai, and another whose identity isn't known) and not to look at the flood or sky. The people didn't believe the old couple. When the rains came, only a few people made it to the mountain tops and shut their eyes. Those who looked at the flood turned into fish or frogs; if they looked at the sky, they turned into birds. After eighty days, Dios told the 24 people remaining to open their eyes and come down. These 24 people went into mountains. Eight other people survived the flood who were able to travel by looking where they wanted to go, and they were there. These people told the Apaches about the flood before going into two mountains themselves. Around the turn of the millennium, the surface of the earth will again be destroyed, this time by fire. \n \n Mayan\n God sent the flood because the people made from wood (an early version of humans) had no souls, minds or hearts and had forgotten how they were made. They wanted to escape, but the animals that they had starved and beaten, the pots they had burnt, and the trees they'd stripped refused to help them. Only a few escaped the flood, and it is said that their descendants are monkeys. \n \n Aztec\n In the Valley of Mexico there lived a pious man named Tapi. Creator told him to build a boat to live in, to take his wife and a pair of every animal that existed. Neighbors thought he was crazy. As soon as he finished, it began to rain. The valley flooded; men and animals went to mountains, but they were submerged. The rain ended, waters receded, etc. Tapi realized that the flood waters had receded after having sent a dove that did not return. Tapi rejoiced. \n \n Squamish\n When the Squamish saw the great flood coming, they made a giant canoe and a long rope of cedar fibers with which they fastened the canoe to a giant rock. Into the canoe, they put every baby, a young man and woman to be their guardians, and food and water. The waters rose and drowned everyone else. After several days, the man saw Mount Baker in the distance. He cut the rope and paddled south to it, and made a new home there. The outline of the canoe can still be seen halfway up the slope of Mount Baker. \n \n Skagit\n The Creator made the earth and gave four names for it -- for the sun, waters, soil and forests. He said only a few people, with special preparation for the knowledge, should know all four names, or the world would change too suddenly. After a while, everyone learned the four names. When people started talking to the trees the change came in the form of a flood. When the people saw the flood coming, they made a giant canoe and filled it with five people and a male and female of all plants and animals. Water covered everything but the summit of Kobah and Takobah (Mts. Baker and Ranier). The canoe landed on the prairie. Doquebuth, the new Creator, was born of a couple from the canoe. He delayed getting his spirit powers, but finally did so after his family deserted him. At the direction of the Old Creator, he made people again from the soil and from the bones of the people who lived before the flood. \n \n Mandingo\n A charitable man gave away everything he had. The God Ouende rewarded him with riches, advised him to leave the area, and sent six months of rain to destroy his selfish neighbors. The descendants of the rich man became the present human race. \n \n \"People of Mount Jefferson\"\n Twice, a great flood came. Afraid that another might come, the people made a giant canoe from a big cedar. When they saw a third flood coming, they put the bravest young men and young women in the canoe, with plenty of food. Then the flood, bigger and deeper than the earlier ones, swallowed the land. It rained for many days and nights, but when the clouds finally parted for the third time, the people saw land (Mount Jefferson) and landed on it. When the water receded, they made their home at the base of the mountain. The canoe was turned to stone and can be seen on Mount Jefferson today. \n \n Yakima\n In early times, many people had gone to war with other tribes, but there were still some good people. One of the good men heard from the Land Above that a big water was coming. He told the other good people and decided they would make a dugout boat from the largest cedar they could find. Soon after the canoe was finished, the flood came, filling the valleys and covering the mountains. The bad people were drowned; the good people were saved in the boat. We don't know how long the flood stayed. The canoe can still be seen where it came down on Toppenish Ridge. The earth will be destroyed by another flood if people do wrong a second time. \n \n Caddo\n Four monsters grew large and powerful until they were high enough to touch the sky. One man heard a voice telling him to plant a hollow reed. He did so, and it quickly grew very big. He, his wife, and pairs of all good animals entered the reed. Waters rose to cover everything but the top of the reed and the heads of the monsters. Turtle destroyed the monsters by digging under them and uprooting them. The waters subsided, and winds dried the earth. \n \n Chippewa\n While the medicine man Wis-kay-tchach was hunting, his young wolf was killed by some water lynxes. Wis tried to kill one of the lynxes to get revenge. First, he turned himself into a stump at the edge of a lake. Frogs and snakes tried to pull the stump down, but Wis kept himself upright. The lynx, suspicions lulled, went to sleep. Wis returned to normal shape and, though warned to shoot the lynx's shadow, forgot and shot its body. He shot a second arrow at the shadow, but the lynx escaped into a river, which then overflowed and flooded the whole country. Wis escaped in a canoe. \n \n Navajo\n For their sins, the Gods expelled the Insect People from the first world by sending a wall of water from all directions. The Insect People flew up into the second world. Later, in the fourth world, descendants of these people were likewise punished. They escaped the floodwaters by climbing into a fast-growing reed. Cicada dug an entrance into the fifth world, where people live today. \n \n Hopi\n The people repeatedly became distant from Sotuknang, the creator. Twice he destroyed the world (by fire and by cold) and recreated it while the few people who still lived by the laws of creation took shelter underground with the ants. When people became corrupt and warlike a third time, Sotuknang guided them to Spider Woman, who cut down giant reeds and sheltered the people in the hollow stems. Sotuknang caused a great flood, and the people floated in their reeds for a long time. They emerged after coming to rest on a small piece of land. They still had as much food as they started with. Guided by their inner wisdom (which comes from Sotuknang through the door at the top of their head), the people traveled on, using the reeds as canoes. They went northeast, finding progressively larger islands, until they came to the Fourth World. When they reached it, they saw the islands sink into the ocean. \n http://www.dreamscape.com/morgana/titania.htm\n \n Also see a much more extensive list at \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/flood-myths.html\n But be warned...\n Note that they dismiss this impressive list of the flood by saying \"In most borderline cases, I included the story here anyway.

We will be looking forward to hearing about some of that evidence. Since you mention the Grand Canyon, please explain how it is evidence for some sort of mass destruction. Please be sure to indicate the formations above the canyon that indicate the mass of water and the formations below the canyon that indicate the massive outflow. Also please explain why the canyon walls of soft sediment did not collapse. The lithification would have taken hundreds of years - what prevented the walls from collapse immediately after the flood? Also, explain the origin of the aeolian strata in the walls of the canyon. How could a global flood that covered the mountains have retreated to form these strata? If the flood killed all living animals, what is the source of the trace fossils of land vertebrates in these strata? How could they still be alive after the flood had flooded the land and then retreated? Please explain the retreat and return of the flood. Such a claim is non-biblical.\n \nbut the observations are left up to subjective human interpretation, so even \"evidence\" is suspect.\n\n No, it's not.

Then a prediction is made that must be true if the hypothesis is correct. Then an experiment is devised that tests the prediction.

It is telling it in 'story' mode, hence at the bottom it says \"Next: The Theory\" which links to the theory which I also posted separately as my second link.\n \n \nThe second and third links seem reasonable but contradict the global flood legend as well as the correct time frame.\n \n The fourth link is just quoting the Bible and it has been shown what happens when the Bible is used for a scientific text. It gets a little embarrassing. But the main thing is that you fourth link says your third link is NOT evidence for Noah's flood. So why did you post contradictory links?\n\n \n They are all links that deal with a very real major flood on the 'biblical' scale. Not all think it was world-wide, or caused by God.",

You are showing selective bias here because you don't pull up anyone from your own side that strays; such as Iamthetruth's most recent attacks on Holy Tradition.

Not a few commonalities here and there, but largely the identical story.\nOriginally Posted by SLP\n Why did yahweh decide to drown his creation? To cause all manner of beast to suffer in terror? Why not just snap his celetial fingers and get rid of all the bad in the world? Sounds like a sadistic bastard to me...\n Then why not worship Gilgamesh? I mean, maybe you are worshipping the wrong deity? \n\n I think it says so in the Bible, that His creation had displeased Him.\n \n \n\n \n Like I said, why not just snap his celestial fingers and make all that displeased him vanish? No suffering, no destruction. Why the unnecessary cruelty? Does you got get off on that sort of thing? Pretty sick, if you ask me. Of course, god may have done no such thing, and the bible authors just made it up to keep the simple folks in line...\n\n \n Yet, when the Nazis walked across Europe, people asked \"Where is God?\"\n \n That sort of mentality condemns Him when He acts, and when He doesn't.\n\n \n When he acts or doesn't act in ways that produce unspeakable evil and cruelty, 'he' deserves the condemnation.\nOriginally Posted by SLP\n Then why not worship Gilgamesh? I mean, maybe you are worshipping the wrong deity? \n\n I could be wrong, but when I read the Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Classics), Gilgamesh was but a king. (He might have been deified afterwards), but regardless, Gilgamesh did not play the role of destructor, so why bring up worship of him?\n\n So you feel compelled to worship one who destroys?\n\n \n \nOriginally Posted by SLP\n Kind of like reading a Woodmorappe book, I guess.... \n\n I've no idea what this means.\n\n \n Woodmorappe often makes blanket claims that he simply expects his readers to accept.\nOriginally Posted by SLP\n But I think the commonalities are stretching abit to claim that hey all refer to the flood in the bible. I mean, if there really was only one flood, then all of those peoples would have descended (in frighteningly short order) from Noah and his kine. They should have all had the SAME flood story, no? \n\n \n They do have the same flood story.\n Common elements;\n Creation gone awry\n Special person chosen for saving\n Devastating flood\n Escape by boat (rather than climb to some very high mountain)\n Creation anew\n \n\n \n Commonalities do not 'the same' story make.\n \n\n Many of the differences can be accounted for the fact that the majority of the cultures were illiterate and were relying on oral history.\n\n \n But since all of these many cultures all derived from a single group of 8 peole no more than 4000 years earlier does it not stand to reason that their stories should be pretty much identical?\n \n But, as you say, since Noah's was an oral cultiure, had it crossed your mind that maybe the whole flood story is just the product of embellishments and distortions?

   "What leads you to believe that the Grand Canyon was \"carved\" by the river?\n\n It has the characteristics of a canyon carved by a river. It does not look like it was carved by a large runoff of water. If that were true, the area of the Grand Canyon would look like the channeled scablands of eastern Washington and Oregon.\n \n Here, for example, is Meander Valley from the Grand Canyon. Notice how the river runs from lower left to the right edge and then back across to the left.\n \n http://images.encarta.msn.com/xrefmedia/sharemed/targets/images/pho/t001/T001957A.jpg \n \n Here is another meander in the upper Colorado River.\n \n http://www.afterimagegallery.com/barnbaumhorseshoe.jpg \n \n Such structures are NOT characteristic of a vast runoff of water, but a slow moving river. The runoff of vast amounts of water looks like the channeled scablands. There is nothing that looks like channeled scablands around the Grand Canyon.\n \nIt is possible, is it not that part of it occured through other geologic means.\n\n Part of it? The actual cause of the Grand Canyon was the uplifting of the Kaibab Plateau and the Wasatch Ranges. Exposed surfaces become weathered from temperature changes and are washed away by storms. The sediment carried in the river abrades the river channel. What causes did you have in mind?\n \nAlso, given that the earth was not uniformly shaped at any time in history (but in this context at the time of the flood) why would water flow the same at all points on the surface.\n\n But why would the Grand Canyon be unique? Most especially, why don't we see sedimentary deposits like those of the canyon around the world? If a global flood happened, shouldn't there be a layer of sediment that is contiguous and continuous around the world? Of the layers in the Grand Canyon, which marks the start and which the end of the flood? What is the source of the layers above and below the flood? How did aeolian strata end up in the canyon wall?\n \n Shouldn't the other \"Grand\" canyons have similar strucutre? Take the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. No meanders and no sedimentary deposits. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone cuts through rhyolite.\n \nAdditionally there are greater canyons than the Grand Canyon.\n\n Do they appear similar to the Grand Canyon? Sedimentary layers, meanders, etc?\n \nMany of them are Underwater currently. The Mariana's trench comes to mind as well as many others.\n\n The Mariana Trench is not a canyon. It is caused by the subduction of an oceanic plate under a land plate, in that case, the Pacific plate beneath the Philippine plate I think. There are other sea trenches along the Pacific coast of the Americas, south of the Alutian Islands. All around the Pacific rim as a matter of fact. They have nothing to do with water flow.\n \nThere is also some geologic evidence that the flood was real as there is evidence of a time in earths past where the crust split causing a huge eruption of water along a massive fault sending great amounts of water into the atmosphere.\n\n Really? What evidence is that. I know that creationists such as Walt Brown and Kent Hovind use that ad hoc story, but neither has offered any evidence.\n \nI saw this on the discovery chanel once upon a time so I don't have a written source for you.\n\n Where did all of that water go? There isn't enough water on earth to cause a global flood. I doubt that the discovery channel story was anything more than an ad hoc story without evidence.",

Additionally there are greater canyons than the Grand Canyon. Many of them are Underwater currently. The Mariana's trench comes to mind as well as many others.\n\n \n I'm not a geologist or even very knowledgeable about the Grand Canyon. From what I have read, the canyon is the result of several long term forces with the river being the main cause. But continental drift, weather, types of vegetation, and others helped in the carving of the canyon.\n \n However I just had a basic question. That is, if it was a global flood that caused the canyon, why do we only see a small number of huge canyons? The implication is that a massive rush of water carved out the canyon. But water would have been flowing everywhere in large amounts. What is so special about the Grand Canyon that caused it to form and not others all over the world? Maybe there is a reason, but I just asked the question.\n \n \nThere is also some geologic evidence that the flood was real as there is evidence of a time in earths past where the crust split causing a huge eruption of water along a massive fault sending great amounts of water into the atmosphere.

One the water would be so hot that most of life would be cooked.

   "You mean like the Theory of Evolution when first published?\n\n Again you show your scientific illiteracy as well as you semi-literacy in English. It seems that you don't understand the meaning of \"ad hoc.\" Merriam-Webster says it means \"concerned with a particular end or purpose.\" In this context I used it when epaphras_faith speculated that the oceans were not salty before the flood and that fish rapidly adapted to a salt water environment after the flood. Since there is no evidence that the seas were ever less salty, and there is no evidence that evolution can occur on such a grand scale at rates far beyond any ever proposed by an evolutionary biologist, his explanation is \"ad hoc,\" i.e., concerned with the purpose of showing that a global flood was possible.\n \n I assume that you are referring to the publication of Darwin's book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, when you talk about \"the Theory of Evolution when first published.\"\n \n (By the way, the theory of evolution is not a proper noun and does not need to be capitalized. That also means that \"the\" and \"of\" are not proper nouns because of their inclusion in that phrase. Similarly, \"on,\" \"the,\" \"of,\" and \"by\" are not nouns because they are used in the title of a book.

Otherwise you wouldn't describe the theory of natural selection as \"ad hoc.\" Only a fool would do so.\n\n \n Origins does deal with pre-history. Prehistory is that dealing with the origins of man. You are making another stupid comment again based on no knowledge of the subject.\n Look at a book on it at http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/cat/pba99.html and note \"The topics covered range from the origins of our own genus in Africa around two million years ago, to the issues of the Later Stone Age and the emergence of civilization in Northern Europe, Anatolia, and south-east Asia.\" That is, it is everything up to 'recorded history'.\n \n But don't let ignorance of a subject stop you commenting!

The fact that you don't even know that prehistory studies the origins of man makes your 8th grader statement ironic.\n \n \nBut since none of them have been part of this discussion I have no way of knowing what you are talking about.

So it would seem that if there is a scientific theory of abiogenesis, it has been tested by definition and therefore isn't ad hoc.\n\n \n No, you made a general statement about 'ad hoc' theories. And you are suggesting that you believe in only tried and proven theories, such as evolution. BUT you also believe in abiogenesis, which is based only on speculation. If you raise an issue, expect it to be criticised, where warranted.\n \n \nOn the other hand, cretinism is ad hoc because it is nothing more than untested assertion. I have asked for supporting evidence on many occasions and you have failed to present any. Your belief in cretinism is ad hoc.\n\n \n Ah, see, it is a general use of 'cretinism' for creationism. It's not just Montalban's views. It's creationism in general. You're so funny Lurch, you chop and change almost as much as Hank.\n \n \nSo how am I responsible for what \"people do?\" You're being irrational. I am responsible for what I say and not for what anyone else says. There are no theories for what went on \"before\" the big bang simply because such ideas are not predictive nor testable. Don't you know what a theory is?\n\n \n As I say, here you diverge with Hank, only he's pretty quiet about this one.\n \n http://home.flash.net/~csmith0/bigbang.htm by Dr. Michio Kaku is Prof. of theoretical physics (note THEORETICAL)\n Some agree with you Lurch...\n \"Note also that one cannot ask, much less answer, \"What happened before the big bang?\" Since no time earlier than the Planck time can be logically defined, the whole notion of time before the big bang is meaningless. \"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/cosmo.html\n HOWEVER, on the same site\n \"``There was no primordial chaos before the big bang - not really. Instead, everything was neatly concentrated in one location. Then it scattered, and is still scattering, a disorderliness far exceeding the structural order of galaxies, stars, planets, and life forms which have appeared in the course of the process.'' [Poul Anderson \"Science & Creation\" Analog, Sept 1983]\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-meritt/complexity.html\n Obviously they have a theory about what existed before the big bang.\n Just goes to show you that there's many different sciences out there :)\n \n \nI have no idea what \"materialism constructs\" is supposed to mean. You seem to have trouble addressing science. You seem to think that since you assign some magical power to your cretinism that I must somehow do the same with science. Actually, science is quite natural - no magic, no miracles.\n\n \n A construct is an idea or concept, a construction of thoughts. We learnt that in Sociology, at university :)\n \n But anyway... You said materialism has nothing to do with evolutionary theory\n Post 2 of \"The Many Faces of Science\"\n \nScience is not materialistic but naturalistic\n\n \n First you say science isn't materialistic, now you're saying you don't know what materialistic constructs are?\n \n \nAnd now a cognitive dissonance on my part. What does \"...insult ad hominem debate from my side...\" mean? Do you mean that I insult your ad hominem style of debate? Of course I do. It is pathetic. It is a sure sign that you on the defensive. It is a sign that you are unable to support your assertions are that you know it.\n\n \n So, whilst you insult people with ad hominem, when you do so, it is justified. Mmm. \n \n \nWhy should I be interested or responsible for Iamthetruth? Why is it relevant to this discussion? Wait. I see. It is yet another example of your great powers of logic. Somehow I am responsible for something someone said sometime of which I am unaware. You cretins are such powerful thinkers! And that doesn't even consider your paranoia.\n\n \n You are not responsible, unless you are also Iamthetruth. However, you show a massive bias here (as with your previous statement), and this in turn indicates the honesty you are prepared to engage in. Quite happily you intervene in any argument, when you feel a creationist has erred, even if it's an ad hominem argument. But you are totally silent with vileness from your own side... and this is quite vile. Iamthetruth alluded to the fact that he'd be there in church with me, and even asked me if I enjoyed the service, because he did... of course he picked the wrong day, making himself look like a buffoon, and even here you were silent. He commented on Holy Tradition, and knows nothing about it. Yes, you are responsible for yourself, and if you are gutless, then that is up to you. Oops, was that an ad hominem. Please tell me how your's are more justified!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Anyway, for you benefit, here's the post encapsulating all together your wavering theories of English usage. :)\n \n Post319 on \"Grudgingly conceding some points\" I said...\n \n You've moved position again.\n Initially you were arguing about the word evolutionary when I was using the word evolutionaries.\n Then you said that its always acts as an adjective (even if in a title; see quote from you below re: post98). Now you're saying that it can be a noun if it's in a title. Which is what I was saying - context changes the word. You need to see how it functions in the context.\n \n \nThe name of a book, the title, is a name; therefore a noun. \n\n \n \nTrue. But my point has nothing to do with book titles. \n\n \n How dishonest. This is the first time you?ve agreed on this point.\n You?ve said Post 303 on this thread \n \n Even if \"evolutionary\" is used in the title of a book, it is still an adjective. \n\n \n So, even when it?s functioning as a title, you said its not a noun. But now you?re arguing that together with other words it can be.\n However, now you?ve changed your mind and concede, finally that as a book title it can be a noun. Thus, what if the book was just called ?Evolutionary? it would be a noun! It would be the name of the book!\n \n \nJust like \"The Great Sandy Desert\" or the \"Grand Canyon\". Grand by itself functions as an adjective. Grand in Grand Canyon is part of the name. Names of things are nouns! \n\n \n \n Right. The whole title is a proper noun. \n\n \n Good, again. Then if the book title is ?Evolutionary? than evolutionary can be a noun. I never claimed anything more than in the context it can be used as a noun. There?s a famous poem called ?If? by Kippling. That in it?s context is a noun. End of story, you?d think.\n But hang-on that was never the reason you started this debate in the first place, now was it?\n \n \n You are separating the components, when together they function as a noun. \n\n \n \n No. My point has nothing to do with book titles. It was your claim that because the adjective \"evolutionary\" was used in the title of a book, it was therefore a proper noun. It isn't. The whole title is a proper noun. You used the adjective \"evolutionary\" improperly. You did not use it in the title of a book. You used an adjective as a noun. \n\n \n I didn?t use ?evolutionary? improperly. I called you dudes ?evolutionaries?. I said it was a collective noun, a name I had coined.\n \n Show me where I used an adjective as a noun. \n\n \n \n You made a mistake and you are unable to admit it. Please take some time to study English grammar if you are going to discuss it. You are quite confused about parts of speach.(sic)\n\n \n You are correct about using the name lurch as being a noun only. It was a bad example. Show me where I misused evolutionary. You can?t. You haven?t so far.\n If you can show me where I misused the word evolutionary, which is the whole reason you brought up this debate you?d have a case. You?ve argued against me for months on this issue without presenting the evidence that I misused it.\n You argued that it could never act as a noun anyway. You argued that it was always an adjective, no matter where. Now you admit that as part of a book title it can be a noun.\n It?s apparent that you?re still not willing to put up with the evidence.\n Post80 of \"How does a new species come about? \"\n Was when you first raised this objection.\n \nAre you not aware that the word \"evolutionary\" is an adjective? It only displays ignorance to try to use it as a noun.\n You must have a point in such intentional gramatical (sic) ignorance. Would you care to explain?\n When you say \"evolutionaries\" are you referring to evolutionary biologists? Not everyone on these boards is a biologist. Why do you insist on showing such ignorance? \n\n \n I had said \nEvolutionaries is my word (an collective noun) to group together all the people who's religion is evolution, such as yourself who are so pig ignorant of other matters that if they know a little bit of science they think they're the only ones who can discuss it, and then all other matters as well, such as English usage. \n\n \n You repeated it again post 85\n My point is that the word \"evolutionary\" is an adjective and you are using it incorrectly as a noun. You need to think before you write. \n\n \n This despite the fact I was using the word evolutionaries.\n Where was I using it as a noun (even though I could have?).\n Post 95\n \nOh, that's right 'evolutionary is an adjective. Well, only sometimes. Sometimes it's a noun as in \"Smith wrote a book called 'Evolutionary Theory'\"\n\n \n Post98\nYet another display of your semi-literacy. Even in the title of the book the word \"Evolutionary\" is an adjective, in that case modifying the word \"Theory\". Evolutionary is an adjective all the time. You continue to make yourself look like a fool. \n\n \n No, it doesn?t modify the word Theory. Now you say it is a noun because it?s part of a book, but not then, you said it still acted as an adjective?.modifying a noun.\n I replied\n \nPlease please please do some thinking before you write. It doesn't modify Theory. \n\n \n And it doesn?t, as part of the title, it?s part of the title.\n This is what you argued all along. That you would try to subtly modify it now is typically dishonest of you. You said that even as part of the title, it?s modifying the noun Theory, that it?s still acting as an adjective. It isn?t.\n \n \n Paul Goldschmidt's Dictionary of Period Russian Name\n \n Kacha (f) -- \"swaying.\" \n http://www.sca.org/heraldry/paul/ka.html\n \n So Lurch, as I used with the example of a personal name, I think Kacha. In Russian it meant 'swaying' which is a verb. It would function as a verb, in a sentence, in Russian. But, it has also become a Christian name. Thus it can function as a Proper Noun. \n  IT DEPENDS HOW IT IS USED IN A SENTENCE\n - which is the golden rule of functional grammar, something else I learnt at university. :)",

   "There were several. Do a search for Poirier, if you will.\n \n The crux is, his book, a textbook for prehistory mentioned at least four schools of thought re: the ascent of man.\n One the presapiens, another preneanderthal, etc.\n \n These schools are accepted because\n a) they have evidences\n b) they are evolutionary\n \n but\n they are mutually exclusive, in that if one worked, then the others can't have.\nSounds about right. That's the (depending on your mindset) nightmare or the joy of science. There are minor mutually exclusive schools of theory that exist (such as human evolution hypothoses), but they pale into insignificance compared with newtonian physics versus thermodynamics verses relativity versus quantum mechanics. They all appear to be right, yet contradict each other! What a joyously messy universe we live in :D\n \n \nWhilst this doesn't disprove evolution, it makes any claims to 'truth' rather suspect.\nBroadly speaking, there is no truth in science (whether Truth, truth or 'truth'), only probabilities.\n \n \nAnd I am rather annoyed by evolutionaries continually harrying my side as if we've got no answers. Quite frankly, if one side has too many, then that hardly makes them right either.\nWasting your time complaining to me about that. I feel that the creationist stance is nonsense and baseless.\n \n \nPerhaps none of us are up to your standard.\nQuite the opposite. I should fit right in.\n \n \nBut it's interesting that here you've divided science from sceintists. There is no one 'science'. There are various sciences, Nazi science, feminist science, marxist science.\nThese are philosophies of science, not actual science itself.\n \n \nI must say that it is interesting to that there's a glimmer of hope as you're the first to even countenance the notion that scientists can be anything human. I've struggled to get a hearing re: a priori bias.\nPeople are subjective, even scientists. The latter use a tool of objectivity (science) to minimise that subjectivity (such as recognising the bias of the hypothesis and thus testing the inverse [the null hypothesis]), but they remain subjective. Science can be debased by bad scientists.\n \n G.",

If one take that view that it was a miracle, then there is no point in looking for evidence, testing the idea scientifically etc: one either believes the miracle without question, or one doesn't.\n \n If there was no miracle and it is proposed as a natural event that should stand up to testing then one has problems. It has been tested and those tests failed. There was no global flood a few thousand years ago (more precisely the probability of a global flood occuring as per the bible giving rise to the world today [including leaving no evidence of its occurance] are vanishingly small and are comparible with the probability that the world was only created, fully formed, 10 minutes ago when an orange space monkey farted).\n \n G.",

I think it has something to do with me giving this site as an explanation of something that might be evidence there was time before the big bang if it turns out to be valid. But I?d be interested in your take on it anyway.\n \n http://feynman.princeton.edu/~steinh/npr/\n\n \n \n Hank has proposed some people read how the Ekpyrotic model of how the Big Ban started, firstly at \"Continue of \"open the close minded\"\" thread and then more recently above.\n \n \"What our model does is amend the earliest moments of the story. Instead of beginning with nearly infinite temperature and density, the universe began in a very different state - cold and nearly vacuous. The hot expanding universe we know came as a result of collision that brought the universe up to a large but finite temperature and density. The rest of the story is as the Big Bang model would have it, but the beginning is different. \"\n http://feynman.princeton.edu/~steinh/npr/\n and\n \"The model is based on the idea that our hot big bang universe was created from the collision of two three-dimensional worlds moving along a hidden, extra dimension. The two three-dimensional worlds collide and ``stick,\" the kinetic energy in the collision is converted the quarks, electrons, photons, etc., that are confined to move along three dimensions. The resulting temperature is finite, so the hot big bang phase begins without a singularity. The universe is homogeneous because the collision and initiation of the big bang phase occurs nearly simultaneously everywhere. The energetically preferred geometry for the two worlds is flat, so their collision produces a flat big bang universe. According to Einstein's equations, this means that the total energy density of the Universe is equal to the critical density. Massive magnetic monopoles, which are over produced in the standard big bang theory, are not produced at all in this scenario because the temperature after collision is far too small to produce any of these massive particles. \"\n Ibid\n \n Yet...\n Post 78 \"So, how did they get all those animals on the ark?\"\n \nDon't know what you are talking about. We can't know what went before the big bang.\n\n \n One of you is wrong. As this Ekpyrotic model quite clearly states that the Big Bang was caused by collision of dimensions or some such rot, how do they know when according to Lurch, they can't know.*\n \n The whole notion of anyway goes against what Lurch said earlier. I was criticising abiogenesis in particular, but his response applies to all 'scientific' theories...\n \n Post 80 \" So, how did they get all those animals on the ark?\"\n \n So it would seem that if there is a scientific theory of abiogenesis, it has been tested by definition and therefore isn't ad hoc.\n\n \n Therefore, the Ekpyrotic model of how the Big Ban started is not science as by Lurch's definition, it's not been tested.\n \n Lurch also has readily attacked non-scientific sentiment...\n \n Post 72 \"Quit trying so hard!\"\n \nI believe that God set up all the scientific laws and created the universe through what we now call the big bang.\n\n \n Lurch should be saying to Hank that science and God have no place together, blah blah.\n \n There's loads of missed opportunities between you guys! Are you two engaged or something? Of course you two don't like to 'engage' each other in debate :) Your only notions are to attack creationists, even if it means ignoring each others mistakes and contradictions. Then, when you've bullied the person away, you declare a victory of rationality!\n \n I'd like to add my own quote which I like, despite the source.\n The Big Bang\n \"It is mystifying that a large part of the community of astronomers and astrophysicists around the world should regard the big bang as a good approximation of something called \"the truth\" when they are aware of the empirical problems crying out for attention. Can we no longer live with the knowledge that we are ignorant of many things? ? John Maddox, 1998 (6)\"\n http://www.panspermia.com/theend.htm\n \n \n *The only rational counter argument I expect is one over a difference between the words 'before' and 'beginning'.",

Water melts. Mountains covered. World wide flood literally.\n\n Do you know what geology is? Here's a nice little fact for you to consider. There isn't enough water on earth to cover the mountains. If you want to do the math (it's not very difficult - both of my sons can dash it off in a couple of minutes) you will find that the amount of water necessary to raise sea level from where it is now to the depth necessary to cover the mountains is more than the amount of water on earth. Even if every bit of ice on the earth melted, my home wouldn't be in a sea-side community. And I live on the coastal plain of Texas. If all of the water in the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica melted, sea level would rise be some 60 to 70 ft.\n \nBiology:\n Ice age animals go extinct. A few kinds survive.\n\n There have been mass extinctions, but geologic evidence doesn't indicate that they were caused by floods. In fact, today we are undergoing a mass extinction the may surpass all that have gone before. It isn't that floods don't destroy living things where they occur. The thing is that there isn't any evidence of a global flood that covered the mountains.\n \nAnthropology:\n Demons do the nasty creating new species of humans.\n\n What do demons have to do with anthropology? Demons are a construct of religious mythology. Evils (i.e., unfortunate events) that were not understood were attributed to demons. Why is it necessary to attribute the origin of hominid species to supernatural means when natural explanations are adequate to explain it?\n \nBunch of hominids compete. Only humans survive.\n\n That may be true. There were several hominid species and only we are left.\n \nWith those ice bridges gone you need a boat.\n\n But there never were any ice bridges that crossed to Australia and New Zealand.

You hopefully now understand my problem. To me \"false science\" and \"not a science\" do not sound like the same thing, just as \"false cat\" and \"not a cat\" are not the same thing.\n\n \n That's probably the most inventive falsification argument I've ever come across. You've done a very subtle shift in stating it's not a term you've used, instead of 'not a term you've heard of', which I believe borders dishonesty.\n \n It is a term used all the time...\n \n \"Lysenko's intuitions about chance in biology were so successful that 20 million people starved to death as a result of his false science applied to agriculture.\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/chance/chance.html\n \n As you seem so well versed in evolution & science you must have heard of it. Whereas I've never heard of a 'false cat', and therefore never used it as a term. So, please tell me what a false cat is? Simply because I've never heard of it, I'm intrigued how it's an analogy of anything.\n \n Your problem then is one of using a bizarre analogy that I've never heard of and going 'voila! although I can't explain it, I've never heard of your claim... therefore I've proven....???\"\n \n False science: It's used to describe creation science all the time. Don't play coy now, and pretend you don't know what it means.\n \n \nI agree in part. There's evidence, but the moment you look at it, it ceases to be objective.

It's never observed, or it's not a theory.\n \n Secondly, what about abiogenesis; hypothesis based on no observation. Experimentation proving nothing, but still a possibility, therefore 'science'.\n \n Thirdly, you say that science doesn't prove anything, but it can prove something false, effectively. So, it's like saying 'although we can't say 100% it's false, it's false!'\n \n \n As for stats, \"There's lies, damned lies, and statistics\" \n\n \n \nAnd in science, it is supposed to be the latter.

I presented what Poirier states. If you don't believe it, then you must say so. But don't say that I didn't present it.\n \n You are playing another game here as I presented the different schools of thought. If you're not interested, then you're not interested. Enough said; and considering that you show great knowledge of evolution I believe you are being rather coy, as it is likely that you already know of many different theories of the ascent of man, already.\n \n \n Is maths a science, or a tool of science? \n\n \n \nA tool of science.

My book was a university textbook when I did Prehistory (at university!)\n \n \n Then the science used by Nazis is science, as it follows method. \n\n \n \nIf it used the scientific method, then it was science.\n\n \n Before you stated it was a philosophy of science.

So much for your theory of science.\n \n \n Then Evolution is based on inconclusive evidences. \n\n \n \nSo is gravity and thermodynamics. Your point?\n\n \n Then you are again at loggerheads with most of your camp.\n \"Biological evolution is a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time. That this happens is a fact. Biological evolution also refers to the common descent of living organisms from shared ancestors. The evidence for historical evolution -- genetic, fossil, anatomical, etc. -- is so overwhelming that it is also considered a fact. The theory of evolution describes the mechanisms that cause evolution. So evolution is both a fact and a theory\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-qa.html\n \n Unless facts can be based on inconclusive evidences. I am open to this possibility :)\n \n \n \nThen your view of evolution is not based on real events, but on information gathering. \n\n \n \nThis makes no sense. In what way is the behaviour of an extant organism not a real event for example?\n\n \n You said it was about stats. I may have misunderstood you.\n \n \n So when it's taught as science, it's not science, even if it follows a method. \n\n \n \nIf it follows the scientific method, then it is science. If it doesn't, then it isn't.\n\n \n Cool. I think we've already covered this one earlier.\n \n \n You can easily say 'the latter' because you've been raised in a western-liberal ideal that there are no such differences in the sexes - unless you came to that opinion through your own research, but either way, your conclusion, though PC, is subjective... in fact, it's based on a social trend... because now it a trend to view men and women in a certain way. \n\n \n \nOr alternatively it could have been because it is philosophy.\n\n \n But it followed scientific method. Scientists found the evidences that backed up their beliefs that women were essentially inferior;\n smaller frame (weaker)\n smaller brain (on average; according to stats :) )\n less women doctors, scientists etc (also based on stats :) )\n emotional studies (You can just hear the Victorians saying \"damn it, don't women cry a lot! Can't they stop that blabbering? etc)\n etc.\n \n It was science. We can now ridicule it at leisure, because our philosophy has changed. Now we can find the scientific evidences that prove our new philosophical evidence (following 'scientific method' if you will)\n \n \nNow which is it more likely to be: what I say is what I mean, or what I say needs reinterpreting to be what you want to hear?\n G.\n\n \n I've no idea what you mean. emoticon_mad",

On adoption the Supreme Court rules that that man's name be put onto the Birth Certificate in place of the absence of the real father. For the purposes of law, this amended Birth Certificate is the \"Original\" Birth Certificate. When \"X\" reaches 18 and calls for a copy of his Original Birth Certificate, the Department of Births, Deaths and Marriages presents him with the one containing his adopted father.

And, as I've just stated, when in law something is certain, it can be completely false in reality, therefore, by extension, when something is certain in science, it can be utterly false in reality.\n \n I've given the example regarding the nature of women.\n \n There's others as well. The place of Neanderthal Man has shifted from being a mere brute, to being a close relative. He's been a different species, now he's as close as a sub-species. What was true in science 100 years ago, is now false in science. Just like in law a man can be guilty, then found later to be innocent. So, your analogy with law is quite good. I'm glad you brought it up.\n \n However, we can declare something to be true 'in law'. And also true 'in science'. This doesn't mean that they are 'true' in reality. So, when you base your life on something such as evolution, where the truths continually move, then you're bound to be confused.\n \n \n Herein lies the parallel with science. Science of evolution is a fiction. It is concocted to be 'official' insofar as it follows scientific method. However, we know that God created the world. \n\n \n \nWrong, you believe that your god created the world. I suspect your god is a fiction. We do not know for certain. But if you wish to jump to conclusions and claim contradictory ideas as lies, then that's up to you. You are the one being dishonest in such actions though, not science. \n\n \n I understand that God is not a part of science, hence your attempts at reconciliation between the two re: Genesis on another thread come to zero.\n \n \nVery well, as you've accepted that there's conflicting theories, then you have dealt the death of your empirical science argument. \n\n \n \nNo I haven't. But you clearly listen to nothing I say, so I will not explain why yet again.\n\n \n Fair enough.\n \n \n Cool. Your philosophy of how evolution should be taught further undermines the ideas of science as science. The professors etc that chose the book disagree with you, and your notion of maths in evolution. \n\n \n \nWhat was the course and what was your book?\n\n \n Huh? I told you. I cited it by Poirier. And I said it was Prehistory. I did it as part of a Bachelor of Arts, granted, but it was done by the then leading Australian higher learning in the field of prehistory/palaeontology\n \n \nI did. I've been using the term \"Nazi science\". \n\n \n \nApart from when you used the term \"the science used by Nazis\". As I said, pay attention and quit calling me a liar to cover for your own mistakes.\n\n \n Your direct response was to when I used the term Nazi science (see above).\n \n \n Yes, I'm afraid it does. But quite odd that you'd think Nazi science is more of a science then creation science! \n\n \n \nThe former is philosophy, the latter is a farce. Neither are science\n\n \n Yet, you still tacitly give more credit to one over the other.\n \n \n It might support it. I don't care. I'm interested in the fact that if Goldschmidt is correct, then gradualism is false. It is more of the argument of conflicting theories. \n\n \n \nAs is often the case, its likely to prove to be a combination that's correct. But as you admit, all you are interested in is the idea that there are conflicting hypotheses as you misinterpret this to mean that the empirical evidence behind evolution is null and void.\n\n \n Indeed, it is my raison d'etre here to show that evolution is but a philosophy, a dangerous one too, as it separates people from God.\n \n \nThe search for extra-terrestrial life (or et-life) follows scientific method. It is done by scientists, with the backing of pre-eminent science unit; NASA.\n However, it doesn't have any proof, it's totally theoretical, therefore according to you, not science. \n\n \n \nAh I understand now, you are just confused as usual. No surprises there then. If, as you say its following the scientific method, then its science. \n G.\n\n \n Based on no empirical evidence!",

You can not say that man ascended by one pathway, then say also, that he ascended through a totally different pathway. And, also through another different pathway, and also another one.\n \n Poirier discusses four different methods. You seem quite content to believe that four theories can each be perfectly valid, providing that they follow scientific method; although at least three must be false - yet you reject creation science as science which more displays your own philosophical outlook.\n \n \nSo you are calling me a liar. \n\n \n \nNot as often as I should.\n\n \n Even though you pretended to not know the meaning of 'false science'.

Perhaps you fit option 1 or 3 rather than 2 as I previously claimed?\n\n \n a) it follows scientific method, just as Nazi science does\n b) that is but one view of how the Bible is interpreted, it is a generalisation and only fits the views of some Christians.\n \n \n You said that the science that determined that women are inferior has been falsified... \n\n \n \nDon't lie please, I said no such thing.\n\n \n You said it was not science, but a philosophy of science. Specifically you said, when I asked you is it science of a philosophy of science, you said\n Post 127\n \nThe latter\n\n Post 131\n \nNope, \"essentially inferior\" is a purely subjective concept and any study reaching such a conclusion is inherently unscientific.\n\n \n So although you didn't use the word 'falsified' you've said it's unscientific at worse, and only a philosophy of science at best. How have I lied?\n \n You say it is both a 'philosophy of science' and 'inherently unscientific'. You argue all sides at once.\n \n \n Look at Newton... Followed scientific method. Much of the theory now superseded... \n\n \n \nAh it may have been superseded, but it still remains valid. But in a universe where a photon can exist in two places at the same time, and where it can be both a wave and particle at the same time, why should we worry that Newtonian physics is both right and wrong depending on the perspective?\n\n \n There's the point \"PERSPECTIVE\" a human trait. I've been saying this the whole time about science, and you've been denying perspective/subjectivity come into science (excepting in your false dichotomy of the Philosophy of Science), so unless you're now going to suggest that Newtonian Physics is a philosophy of science, you've just argued against yourself.\n \n \n You've got to either say\n \"Newtonian science is not science, because much has been falsified\", or \"Creation science is science despite any chances it can be falsified\". \n\n \n \nNo, I really haven't got to say either as they are both wrong. Newtonian science has not been falsified (but could be, for it is \"real\" science) and modern creation \"science\" cannot be falsified (because any version that can be already has been) and thus isn't science.\n\n \n Now this is confusing.

Did you really not know that?\n\n \n I worded this wrong. Where is the empirical evidence that ET exists? There is none. Yet scientists are looking for something that they don't know exists, hence theoretical, and hence not a science for you (sometimes)\n \n Despite having no evidence for the existence of ET, and only statistical reasons for believing ET might exist, they spend billions on looking.\n \n \n...You compare certainty of science to law... \n\n \n \nActually I gave you a very specific comparison.\n\n \n So did I. Your analogy was that science and law are similar, because neither can, in reality be 100% true. Likewise, my analogy shows that the law can have something true in law, but be utterly false in reality. Hence, the comparison of science to law is valid.\n Science once taught that the Neanderthal were a totally different species, now we declare that to be false. It must therefore have been false, even when they taught it was true. The analogy is complete.\n \n \nYou have ignored that comparison and instead have tried to shoehorn it into something unrelated. You have built a strawman. From experience burning it will do me no good, as you will deny it was a strawman in the first place and then rebuild it.\n\n \n Interesting use of metaphors.\n \n \n There's others as well.

Even if it's misdirected :) Too many people are way too PC.\n \n The only problem with your line of reasoning is that once you say that all the triumphs that we've experienced, following your supposed destruction/lessening of religious pressure has happened, then the I can introduce all the bad things that have happened.\n \n I could then suggest that things such as VX-Nerve gas, A-bombs etc, undermine your idea of science and progress.\n \n That is, your argument is that there has been great good happening, because we've moved beyond the influence of religion. If religion has no or less influence now, then all the bad things must be blamed on science too (unless you argue that religious influence still permeates, but only negatively; but I don't think you were making that argument).\n \n So when we deal with the amount of poverty in the world, it may be drawn upon that evolution ('survival of the fittest') permeates capitalist thinking. Progress can be seen in the faces of the starving of Ethiopia.\n \n \nI read what Hank said: you may have noticed that I attempted to clarify that I was not agreeing with you. If you still think I was, then my clarification wasn't clear enough. I did not agree with you that Newtonian physics had in any way been falsified. If previous posts by me suggest otherwise, please disregard them as they were poorly expressed.\n\n \n Certainly some of it has been superseded by more modern notions of physics. Newtonian physics is too simple an explanation.\n \n I don't think that they were poorly expressed, but there's still confusion, if something is no longer taught as true, because it's been superseded by a new truth, then I would count it (that which has been replaced) as being made false, which is what untrue is.\n \n Perhaps science has a different understanding of 'false'. This seems to be the case, that things can both be true, and uncertain at the same time. False, and true at the same time, etc.\n \n \nYour link to an article about evolution forgeries (and please note here I am not agreeing with you that they are) is a classic example of why creationists have problems in this area.

It is like when people attack the church over Galileo, and my defence is \"Oh, but that happened 400 years ago\"... this would be an invalid defence (and hence I've never used it - as far as I can recall).\n \n I had also, on a much earlier post, dealt with Haeckel's false drawings.\n http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/17rec03.htm gives an account of how these faked drawings were taught, long after they were known to be false.\n \n Swanscombe Man is not one I've raised before, so I mention it now.\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/a_anomaly.html gives a list of what it terms \"Anomalous Fossils\". What's in a term? Well, the fact that scientists gave many of these finds the term \"Man\" is highly suggestive.\n \n However, if you want more recent ones, I had, some time ago given links to the archaeoraptor, which was faked quite recently.

If you call an equation false because it does not hold true in every case, then every equation is false. At least until or if we discover a unified theory. I use equations every day in my work. I have never used an equation that was accurate for every situation. Yet I have never had anyone that was reviewing my work say &#8216;hey these equations are false because they&#8217;re not accurate at the speed of light&#8217; LOL\n \n BTW last time I checked, they were still being taught as valid equations in science classes in high school and college.\n \n \nI think if the argument focuses on this you miss Monty's point concerning creation science (which is real and is science) and evolutionary science (equally so).\n\n \n I know exactly what monty&#8217;s point is concerning creations science, which he rarely discusses.

Creation &#8216;scientist&#8217; don&#8217;t do science, they just criticize evolution. Have you ever seen or heard a creation vs evolution debate? They are usually put on by creationist. And they usually stipulate that the Bible will not be discussed, but it will be a discussion about evolution only. Evolution like all sciences, is a complicated field. Experts spend years of study, sometimes in very specific areas. The leaders in the creationist movement don&#8217;t do science.

This went on forever, and he was wrong, and not only was he wrong, he was highly insulting.\n \n Someone else argued that 'maths is not a science' and that then went into a word debate. See the debates with Priscilla on this one.\n \n Then there were the debates about whether the world was round or not, which again I didn't start. And you were the one who came in with your laughable egg-shaped earth theory.\n \n You've asked me to define 'kind'. So has WJA.\n \n Your real objection is that you make statements without knowing the implications of what they mean. Hence you're change of heart about the validity of 'survival of the fittest'.\n \n As I said, you have absolutely no sense of personal embarrassment. You have the gall to come in and declare here that I'm only interested in such an argument.\n \n My very first posts on this forum were criticised because I'd misspelled speciation, and had used the spelling 'specification'. So don't come out with such dishonesty now and claim that I'm only interested in 'word games'.\n \n I have indeed stated that I know little science (how many times have you guys reminded me of this admission?). I also stated that my strengths are in the meanings of words. That you've engaged me in these types of debates at all speaks volumes... though you're now saying that you don't argue this sort of debate. I must have some how compelled you.\n \n I play to my strengths, and if I ask you what do you mean by something, and you don't know, then there's little reason for you to believe in it, except through faith. And, in fact, at the end of the day, that's all you have. You believe that your version of evolutionary science is 'it', and that all others are not, or don't exist. (see your rebuttals in the \"Many Faces of Science\" thread)\n \n \nJust look at how he is still referring to my comment on the earth being egg-shaped for the fiftieth time. I have explained how most people understand what egg-shaped means and even posted the picture of an egg that is exactly the shape of the earth. And his response when faced with the evidence in black and white? Oh well we were talking about a chicken egg. A chicken egg is pointed on one end and the earth is not pointed.\n\n \n Indeed, the earth is not egg-shaped. Because when we deal with the word 'egg', it's a given that it's a chicken egg. If you go to a burger bar and ask for bacon and eggs, do you specify \"Chicken Egg\"? You don't because in our culture the words 'egg' and 'chicken egg' are synonymous. Thus when something is described as 'egg shaped' it is 'chicken egg shaped', that is kind of oval. That you can find a round egg and then declare that this is what you meant is downright dishonesty. It has the logic of; I can find an stick that looks like Elvis Presley, but I would be wrong to claim that Elvis looked 'stick-like'. You are just plain wrong, and you try the most dishonest contortions to try to get out of it.\n \n But then, you have no sense of embarrassment. Ask your 7 year old to draw an egg. If she draws a square, will you say that it is 'correct'?\n \n \nNow I just ignore him about that because anyone who has read the post about the matter realize what a fool he is making of himself. And what that has to do with evolution or even science is a mystery to me. But I now refuse to get sucked into these mindless debates about chicken eggs. LOL\n\n \n Because you are wrong. You are so dishonest as to convolute an argument to cover up a silly mistake.\n \n You did so about 'survival of the fittest'\n \n \nOn one thread where monty stuck to the subject for a short while on the thread ?An eye for make believe?, you will see where barbarian demolished his argument. And he started the thread.\n\n \n Actually Barbarian entered the debate some time after I had left it (19th September 2003). See Post 16 where SLP is complaining that I've not responded. So you could very well say \"SLP\" was the victor. I gave my reasons for leaving at Post 21, In December 2003.\n \n I did re-visit it, but Barbarian was just going over the same issues I'd already gone over. Then the argument changed completely to one about literal interpretations by Orthodoxy which was being argued on another post, so you're dishonest again, Hank. (see posts 46, 47, 48, of the Eye for Make-believe thread) In fact, you changed the subject too, when asking there about whether there's a forum on-line, that gives serious debate. So, does this mean that you lost to me?\n \n In fact what it means to you is, that whomever has the last post, has won. This means, by your logic, that as you've now stopped arguing about the egg-shaped earth, I've won the debate.

   "The odd thing Hank is you know you're arguing about the definitions of words, something you claim only I do\n \n \"In physics, the historically famous Sir Isaac Newton developed his famous Newton's Laws involving such things as force, mass, motion and gravity. His works are the accomplishments of a genius and have gone down in history as one of the finest developments in science. However, Einstein came along in the early 1900's showing that under certain conditions, Newton's Laws can be falsified.* Did that discredit Newtonian physics in its entirety? No, it did not. Eventually, Einstein's theories on relativity, as brilliant as they were, were shown to be falsified in some respects by Quantum physics, but Einstein's works are still recognized today as being remarkable advancements in science.\" \n http://www.creationism.ws/prelude.htm (note \"not entirely\" therfore, in part)\n \n \"For example, Newtonian physics was falsifiable, and indeed was falsified by Eddington's observation of light displacement around the sun during a solar eclipse (Popper 1935).\"\n http://www.empgens.com/wright/progress06.html\n \n \n That's not what I said, I said much of it has been superseded/falsified. If it's no longer the truth, then it's false. I did not say the whole theory has been falsified. \n\n \n \nWant to point out which part was falsified? A new theory for monty maybe. You?re bucking for a Nobel Prize aren?t you? LOL\n\n \n \nAnd it has been. Much of it has been superseded by quantum physics. \n\n \n \nHey I?m really interested in what part was superseded by quantum physics. I?m holding my breath for your post showing the part that was superseded. \n\n \n However, I should have said it like this...\"Einstein's theory of relativity has superseeded some parts of Newtonian Physics...\"\n \n \"Newtonian theory, which held sway prior to the 20th century, described gravity as a force In other words two massive bodies like the Earth and an apple were understood to exert a pull on each other as a result of the law of gravity. If an apple started out at rest, say just as it broke off from a tree, then gravity would cause it to move towards the Earth until it collided with it. Newton's law of gravity was able to explain in detail not only the fall of apples, but also the orbit of the moon about the Earth, the motions of the planets about the sun, and much more. GR can also explain all of those things, but in a very different way. In GR, a massive body like the sun causes the spacetime around it to curve, and this curvature in turn affects the motion of the planets, causing them to orbit around the sun....\n For the most part the predictions of GR and Newtonian gravity are very similar. There are small differences that can and have been measured in the solar system, however, and to date all the data have matched the predictions of GR. Moreover, there are  certain situations, like the vicinity of a black hole, where GR makes predictions drastically different from those of Newtonian theory.  I will briefly discuss some of these later and talk about what evidence we have for some of the more exotic predictions of GR.\"\n http://www.ncsu.edu/felder-public/kenny/papers/gr1.html\n \n General Relativity has changed the explanation of the movement of things affected by gravity. It gives different explanations of the mechanics around a black hole.\n \n \"In 1915 Albert Einstein dramatically changed our idea of what gravity is, but Newton's description is  often adequate.\"\n http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/black1.html\n Not always but often!\n \n Newton's explanation just isn't adequate all the time. I am wondering why you would dispute this.",

   "One poster on another forum stated:\n \"I confess to have not read the thread on sci.logic so I don't know exactly how you're defining \"falsifiable\" but if Newtonian/Maxwellian Physics claims that the speed of light varies with the speed of the source or observer and to explain why we detect no variation we have to introduce the (Special) Theory of Relativity, I don't see how you can say that it hasn't been falsified.\n Similarly, Quantum Theory superceded Newtonian/Maxwellian mechanics because several observations totally contradicted the old paradigm (e.g. electrons orbiting a nucleus not radiating away their energy and spiraling into the nucleus). Adding Bohrian orbital rules doesn't extend the old theory by adding a \"new force\", but falsifies some of its rules.\"\n \n \n Interestingly enough, I came across an article about the possibility of time travel (which is impossible using Newtonian Physics, but not Einstein's)\n \"If we accept Newtonian physics as the basis for our existence, then there is no room for time traveling. It is simply taken for granted that there is a global time that runs equally for everybody under all circumstances. That's it. It's so evident, so perfectly in line with common sense, that it may not even be mentioned in Newtonian texts. \n A warning: If you try to modify the time concept in the Newtonian framework, you'll have to modify all the other laws of nature accordingly. That's a huge undertaking. But that's what Einstein did in his Special Relativity Theory. \"\n http://www.ettnet.se/~egils/essay/essay.html\n \n \"Newtonian physics assumes that time is the same everywhere\"\n http://www.twow.net/ObjText/OtkCaLbStrB.htm\n This is not so, for Relativity.\n \n Thus Newtonian explanations can still be used to describe a brick falling from the top of a wall, but it does not work in explaining other phenonmena.\n \n \"Any number of pathological investigations give way eventually to one like quantum mechanics--which necessitated a few adjustments to the law of conservation of mass but ultimately withstood criticism, explained results that Newtonian theory couldn't explain, and revolutionized physics. \"\n http://www.columbia.edu/cu/21stC/issue-3.4/turro.html\n \n emoticon_love",

   "Wow, talk about dishonest. But you do this. Your interpretations of the Bible are based on your own interpretations; without recourse to the experts who put it together (in Greek).\n \n Iamthetruth attacked Orthodoxy, and knows nothing about it. etc.\n \n Lurch has done the same.... oh that's right, you chicken out and don't admonish them for dealing with issues that they know nothing about.\n \n \n \n Again, dishonesty from Hank.\n \n Lurch raised the objection to me using the word 'evolutionary'. Then he accused me of misusing it. This went on forever, and he was wrong, and not only was he wrong, he was highly insulting.\n \n Someone else argued that 'maths is not a science' and that then went into a word debate. See the debates with Priscilla on this one.\n \n Then there were the debates about whether the world was round or not, which again I didn't start. And you were the one who came in with your laughable egg-shaped earth theory.\n \n You've asked me to define 'kind'. So has WJA.\n \n Your real objection is that you make statements without knowing the implications of what they mean. Hence you're change of heart about the validity of 'survival of the fittest'.\n \n As I said, you have absolutely no sense of personal embarrassment. You have the gall to come in and declare here that I'm only interested in such an argument.\n \n My very first posts on this forum were criticised because I'd misspelled speciation, and had used the spelling 'specification'. So don't come out with such dishonesty now and claim that I'm only interested in 'word games'.\n \n I have indeed stated that I know little science (how many times have you guys reminded me of this admission?). I also stated that my strengths are in the meanings of words. That you've engaged me in these types of debates at all speaks volumes... though you're now saying that you don't argue this sort of debate. I must have some how compelled you.\n \n I play to my strengths, and if I ask you what do you mean by something, and you don't know, then there's little reason for you to believe in it, except through faith. And, in fact, at the end of the day, that's all you have. You believe that your version of evolutionary science is 'it', and that all others are not, or don't exist. (see your rebuttals in the \"Many Faces of Science\" thread)\n \n \n \n Indeed, the earth is not egg-shaped. Because when we deal with the word 'egg', it's a given that it's a chicken egg. If you go to a burger bar and ask for bacon and eggs, do you specify \"Chicken Egg\"? You don't because in our culture the words 'egg' and 'chicken egg' are synonymous. Thus when something is described as 'egg shaped' it is 'chicken egg shaped', that is kind of oval. That you can find a round egg and then declare that this is what you meant is downright dishonesty. It has the logic of; I can find an stick that looks like Elvis Presley, but I would be wrong to claim that Elvis looked 'stick-like'. You are just plain wrong, and you try the most dishonest contortions to try to get out of it.\n \n But then, you have no sense of embarrassment. Ask your 7 year old to draw an egg. If she draws a square, will you say that it is 'correct'?\n \n \n \n Because you are wrong. You are so dishonest as to convolute an argument to cover up a silly mistake.\n \n You did so about 'survival of the fittest'\n \n \n \n Actually Barbarian entered the debate some time after I had left it (19th September 2003). See Post 16 where SLP is complaining that I've not responded. So you could very well say \"SLP\" was the victor. I gave my reasons for leaving at Post 21, In December 2003.\n \n I did re-visit it, but Barbarian was just going over the same issues I'd already gone over. Then the argument changed completely to one about literal interpretations by Orthodoxy which was being argued on another post, so you're dishonest again, Hank. (see posts 46, 47, 48, of the Eye for Make-believe thread) In fact, you changed the subject too, when asking there about whether there's a forum on-line, that gives serious debate. So, does this mean that you lost to me?\n \n In fact what it means to you is, that whomever has the last post, has won. This means, by your logic, that as you've now stopped arguing about the egg-shaped earth, I've won the debate. Thank you!\n \n Again, as you stopped arguing about \"survival of the fittest' that means I won that debate too. Thanks again.\n \n Oh wow, you stopped arguing on \"The Many Faces of Science\" thread, too. That means I won that as well. Thank you. Doesn't it hurt to get your arse-kicked by someone who knows less science than you.\n \n You're so amazingly funny.

   "I always admire passionate people. Even if it's misdirected :) Too many people are way too PC.\nI don't. I often dislike passion intensely when I disagree with the passion's viewpoint.\n \n \nThe only problem with your line of reasoning is that once you say that all the triumphs that we've experienced, following your supposed destruction/lessening of religious pressure has happened, then the I can introduce all the bad things that have happened.\nSorry, where is the problem? Science and progress has given us many bad things too as you suggest, I do not deny that. Your warfare examples I do not agree with: I was refering to humanistic progress, not military progress. Medical progress has brought increased populations and thus enviromental problems for example.\n \n \nSo when we deal with the amount of poverty in the world, it may be drawn upon that evolution ('survival of the fittest') permeates capitalist thinking. Progress can be seen in the faces of the starving of Ethiopia.\nQuite the opposite: the starving of Ethiopia highlight that whilst we are making progress, more needs to be made (and sadly the likes of capitalism gets in the way at times).\n \n \nCertainly some of it has been superseded by more modern notions of physics. Newtonian physics is too simple an explanation.\n \n I don't think that they were poorly expressed, but there's still confusion, if something is no longer taught as true, because it's been superseded by a new truth, then I would count it (that which has been replaced) as being made false, which is what untrue is.\nWhat beautifully naive black and white thinking! An example:\n Young children are taught that 4 -5 cannot be done. If I have 4 oranges, I cannot take 5 away.\n Older children are taught 4 - 5 = -1. Oranges are mentioned (unless the concept of debt is being taught).\n Does the second one render the first false?\n \n \nPerhaps science has a different understanding of 'false'. This seems to be the case, that things can both be true, and uncertain at the same time. False, and true at the same time, etc.\nYes it does. You have a naive view of true and false: that they can only be absolute. As you keep refering to being knowledgable about law, I'm puzzled as to how you can hold such a view. True and false are absolutes in maths and \"good enoughs\" in reality.\n \n \nHowever, in saying that... the Piltdown Man remains as a fake, whether it occurred 10 years ago, or 100 years ago. It is like when people attack the church over Galileo, and my defence is \"Oh, but that happened 400 years ago\"... this would be an invalid defence (and hence I've never used it - as far as I can recall).\nIt is a valid defense. What happened in the church 400 years ago is not something that I would automatically assume the church still did. If you do not use such a argument, how do you defend the actions of the church is burning of \"witches\" etc?\n \n \nHowever, if you want more recent ones, I had, some time ago given links to the archaeoraptor, which was faked quite recently. \nAnd found to be a fake, by scientists, just 3 months after National Geographic (a non scientific publication) went to press with their story (even though the paper on the fossil had failed its peer review in Nature). \n \n And what a fake it turned out to be! Instead of one transitional dinosaur/ bird fossil, it turned out to be two transitional fossils instead. As far as science is concerned, this \"fake\" fossil turned out to be a goldmine of evolutionary evidence.\n \n G.",

It was put together by the Chinese peasant who discovered it. The pieces were assembled to make the fossil more marketable to collectors, not to researchers. This peasant may or may not have known that the tail came from a separate fossil. [Simmons, 2000] \n \n Archaeoraptor was published in the popular press, not in peer-reviewed journals. The main author of the article about it was National Geographic's art editor, not a scientist. Nature and Science both rejected papers describing it [Simmons, 2000]. Normal scientific procedures worked to uphold high standards. \"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC352.html\n \n \n I acknowledge quite readily that\n a) it's a fake\n and\n b) scientists uncovered it as a fake\n \n However...\n \n \"In the autumn months of 1999, Canadian palaeontologist Phil Currie and dinosaur sculptor Stephen Czerkas announced the discovery of an unbelievable new \"missing link\" between dinosaurs and birds in National Geographic magazine. This specimen, which they named Archaeoraptor, was discovered to be a fake, composed of a long tail from one dinosaur and a body of another. Scientists pledged to name these two pieces individually, and now this is the case.\"\n http://www.dinohunters.com/History/Microraptor.htm\n \n I understand that at least, a palaeontologist could be a scientist.\n \n Thus\n \" Over the next two years, the composite fossil made its way into the hands of a loose association of amateur dinosaur enthusiasts, professional palaeontologists and National Geographic editors.\"\n http://www.strangescience.net/stfor2.htm\n \n But the story is given by Cornell University as this....\n \n It was smuggled to the USA by scientists...\n \"I have no doubt that the dealer knew he was smuggling, though he went to great pains to explain his way around Chinese law. Through a \"partner\" at a scientific institute in the city of Guilin, he obtained a paper titled \"certificate,\" which states that the fossil was \"legally acquired\" and \"is legal to be exported from China\" as part of a \"specimens exchange program.\"\"\n http://ceirp.cornell.edu/Review/NGArtHlt.html\n \n The buyers...\"the Czerkases discussed it with an old friend, Philip J. Currie, a renowned Canadian scientist based at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Alberta. The couple wanted Currie to join them as co-author of a paper they would write. Currie was interested. Since he often consulted for NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, he mentioned it to Christopher P. Sloan, the magazine's art editor. Sloan thought there could be a story in the little fossil.\"\n Ibid.\n \n National Geographic's involvement is explained next... \"The association of Sloan and Currie would prove to be star-crossed. As a first-time writer, Sloan committed the journalist's cardinal sin--he assumed that since Currie's reputation was so outstanding, there was no need to stay on top of him or question him. Currie became a collaborator rather than a source. Worse, Currie was so distracted by other commitments around the world that he gave the Archaeoraptor project short shrift.\"\n Ibid.\n That is, a scientist didn't do his best to be scientific, and National Geographic, in their haste to print a scoop, didn't press him too hard.\n \n Thus it is unfair to blame solely National Geographic. Scientists professional, and amateur were involved along the way.\n \n This is shown by the following...\n \"In a most damaging lapse of responsibility, Currie did not tell Sloan about his concern. He said he assumed the Czerkases would. They say there was no reason to. In May, Sloan visited the Czerkases himself and had his own look at the fossil. An avid dinosaur enthusiast but no scientist, Sloan was very excited. \"I had no doubt that it was a weird animal,\" he said, \"but I had no reason to suspect that it wasn't legitimate. I'd worked with Phil for years, and he'd seen it.\" Blindsided by his esteem for the scientist, Sloan neglected to question Currie thoroughly.\n  Currie's involvement was key to NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC's own\" \n Ibid\n \n National Geographic relied on the reputation of scientist Currie. They assumed as a scientist, he'd follow scientific method.\n \n Thus the way the story is presented by talkorigins.org is deceptive. It tries to suggest that scientists were only involved in uncovering the wee birdie as a fraud. Triumph of scientists again!\n \n \n An interesting footnote...\n \"Over the past one hundred years, Darwin?s Theory of Evolution has dominated. Many phenomena cannot be explained according to the theory, but scientists still try to defend it. People try to find the missing links in order to validate the theory of evolution, but so far, no conclusive intermediate species fossils had been found. The ?Archaeoraptor? fossil is just another case of this.\"\n http://www.pureinsight.org/pi/articles/2003/1/20/1348.html\n \n \n \nTypical dishonesty of the creationist. \n\n \n Nope. Just you've got a weird idea that the moment a man dons a white lab-coat he becomes some type of Ubermenschen.\n \n Do you think that remark of yours deserves an apology?\n \n \n \n Certainly I can see that saying the scientists 'faked' it is perhaps too strong a term as it stongly suggests a deliberate hoax. However, as to strong allegations, so is blaming National Geographic for the mess. It would be more accurate to say that scientists were so eager to have this example as a true example that they did not much bother with actually analysing it. But this is, not the fault of National Geographic.\n \n How about we all agree to say ...?\n \"That non-scineitifc magazine, National Geographic relied on scientists, pros and non-pros, who did not do their work properly.

   "The story is fun, the idea is fun, but even santa has a finite belief, so come on, lets just enjoy the story as we enjoy the tooth fairy, santa clause and the easter bunny. \n \n By the way, how did those traditions get started?\n\n The Easter Bunny comes from the fact that Easter celebrations are ancient pagan fertility festivals. Hence baby animals, eggs, etc., especially bunny rabbits- symbols of fertility. \n \n Tooth fairy I don't know about, but there are lots of different sources for Santa Claus from all over Europe. The current North American Santa image was created by Coca Cola for an ad campaign. I don't know if they still had cocaine in the drink at the time... emoticon_xangel \n \n I had these \"Noah's Ark\" pillowcases when I was a kid, and I used to wonder things like-\n \n What happened if Ms Gorilla didn't think Mr Gorilla was cute? Did they have to \"do it\" anyway?\n \n Did frogs and other amphibians stay in the water, or go on the boat? Either way, they wouldn't do well, because they need land and water...\n \n Who cleaned their poop up? That's a lot of animal poop... Yuck.\n \n How did they deal with carnivores? Wouldn't the carnivores eat the pairs of herbivores, making all herbivores extinct? If not, what did they feed the carnivores?\n \n You can see how I would not have made a very good Catholic.\n \n *****\n I have to admit how bored I was tonight- I read this entire thread. Okay, I read pretty quickly, but still... Point being, this has been a really entertaining read, and I'm glad to see the discussion has come full-circle.\n \n I do really think this debate about science with montalban, although highly amusing, is getting tired. \n \n Montalban, \"science\" is just study in depth, according to a particular methodology- that is, the scientific method. Science isn't out to get you, or your God. It's just a method. Some people use it for their own devices, according to their twisted philosophies (Nazi scientists and sexist scientists), and many people use it badly, ie incorrect methodology (pseudo-science or \"false science\", such as \"creationist science\"). In fact, most acclaimed and reknown scientists have made errors in methodology, many \"mistakes\" of science are based on bad methodology. However, this does not mean that \"science is contradictory\"- because science is only a method, or a set of methods, used for the purpose of study. Human science is always fallible, but that doesn't mean that nothing in science is true. As someone else said, certainly you can't subtract 5 oranges from 4 in a first grade level math class, but as my credit record shows, there are places where numbers can fall into the negative. Both are \"science\", both are \"true\". \n \n I hope this helps. I really think it's too bad that you want to throw out the baby with the bathwater and reject everything you see as \"science\" because you disagree with physical anthropology and see it as threatening. I can tell, though, that this doesn't stop you from accessing other sciences, such as computers (and I'm assuming other electronic equipment), medical science, etc. So do reconsider sweeping generalizations about \"science\". I guess it's no use asking you to stop debating that science is flawed... but you really don't seem to be arguing about science at all in these debates, you're talking about something else.",

Conservatively calculating the cubit as 44.5 cm (17.5 in.) (some think the ancient cubit was nearer 56 or 61 cm), the ark measured 133.5 m by 22.3 m by 13.4 m (437 ft 6 in. \u00d7 72 ft 11 in. \u00d7 43 ft 9 in.), less than half the length of the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2. This proportion of length to width (6 to 1) is used by modern naval architects. This gave the ark approximately 40,000 cu m (1,400,000 cu ft) in gross volume. It is estimated that such a vessel would have a displacement nearly equal to that of the mighty 269-m (883 ft) Titanic of this 20th century. No cargo vessel of ancient times even slightly resembled the ark in its colossal size. Internally strengthened by adding two floors, the three decks thus provided gave a total of about 8,900 sq m (96,000 sq ft) of space.\n it-1 164-5\n The \"kinds\" of animals selected had reference to the clear-cut and unalterable boundaries or limits set by the Creator, within which boundaries creatures are capable of breeding \"according to their kinds.\" It has been estimated by some that the hundreds of thousands of species of animals today could be reduced to a comparatively few family \"kinds\"-the horse kind and the cow kind, to mention but two. The breeding boundaries according to \"kind\" established by Jehovah were not and could not be crossed. With this in mind some investigators have said that, had there been as few as 43 \"kinds\" of mammals, 74 \"kinds\" of birds, and 10 \"kinds\" of reptiles in the ark, they could have produced the variety of species known today. Others have been more liberal in estimating that 72 \"kinds\" of quadrupeds and less than 200 bird \"kinds\" were all that were required. That the great variety of animal life known today could have come from inbreeding within so few \"kinds\" following the Flood is proved by the endless variety of humankind-short, tall, fat, thin, with countless variations in the color of hair, eyes, and skin-all of whom sprang from the one family of Noah.\n it-1 165\n These estimates may seem too restrictive to some, especially since such sources as The Encyclopedia Americana indicate that there are upwards of 1,300,000 species of animals. (1977, Vol. 1, pp. 859-873) However, over 60 percent of these are insects. Breaking these figures down further, of the 24,000 amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, 10,000 are birds, 9,000 are reptiles and amphibians, many of which could have survived outside the ark, and only 5,000 are mammals, including whales and porpoises, which would have also remained outside the ark. Other researchers estimate that there are only about 290 species of land mammals larger than sheep and about 1,360 smaller than rats. (The Deluge Story in Stone, by B. C. Nelson, 1949, p. 156; The Flood in the Light of the Bible, Geology, and Archaeology, by A. M. Rehwinkel, 1957, p. 69) So, even if estimates are based on these expanded figures, the ark could easily have accommodated a pair of all these animals.\n Can you provide sound evidence that the Global flood never happened? Makes for a good discussion that way, other wise its just another religion beating thread!!! Thanks.",

   "Probably the same thing they fed the lions in London Zoo during the food rationing in WW2 - hay bails, and they stayed healthy. Think they prefer meat though, LOL\n\n I presume that you mean \"hay bales\".\n \n I'm not sure where you got your information but like most creationist just-so stories, it isn't true. You imply that it is possible to sustain health in a cat by feeding it hay. Actually, not only do lions prefer meat, they are, like all cats, obligatory carnivores. What that means is that without a source of animal protein they will die a very unpleasant death. To remain healthy a cat requires a diet that is very high in animal protein and fat, almost half of each. They need only 1-2% carbohydrate. In the wild, they get that by eating the internal organs of their prey.\n \n This is because a cat's metabolism is unable the synthesize, or is able to synthesize only inefficiently, some nutrients that other carnivores can. For example, a cat cannot synthesize two amino acids, arginine and taurine. Other nutrients necessary are the essential fatty acid arachidonic acid, the vitamin niacin, the vitamin pyridoxine (B6), and vitamin A. None of the above is available in hay or other vegetable sources.\n \n Most other carnivores, (like dogs) can convert linolenic acid (available from vegetable sources) to arachidonic acid. As far as diet is concerned, a dog is an omnivore. Dogs don't have the metabolic limitations of cats.\n \n Cats are known as obligate carnivores because they CANNOT survive on a vegetarian diet, and will get sick if the percent of animal protein is too low.\n \n So your story about the London Zoo is twaddle. Possibly hay was used in some manner to bulk up the diet for a very brief period, but the implication that the lions were fed only hay for a long period of time and remained healthy is silly. They were fed meat protein from some source.\n \n Another creationist crowed about a lion that was a vegetarian once, eating fruits and vegetables. He also claimed that this was evidence that carnivores weren't a problem for Noah. It was even verified from a couple of sources on the internet - a real lion that likes his veggies. It was baffling until someone found a bit more information. The lion is fed dozens of eggs every day.\n \n So now the question remains, how did Noah deal with the carnivores?",

Explain!\n Earlier this century, a female African lion, born and raised in America, lived her entire lifetime of nine years without ever eating meat.1 In fact, her owners, Georges and Margaret Westbeau,2 alarmed by scientists' reports that carnivorous animals cannot live without meat, went to great lengths to try to coax their unusual pet ('Little Tyke') to develop a taste for it. They even advertised a cash reward for anyone who could devise a meat-containing formula that the lioness would like. The curator of a New York zoo advised the Westbeaus that putting a few drops of blood in Little Tyke's milk bottle would help in weaning her, but the lioness cub refused to touch it-even when only a single drop of blood had been added.\n The more knowledgeable animal experts among the many visitors to the Westbeaus' 100 acre (40 hectare) ranch also proffered advice, but nothing worked. Meanwhile, Little Tyke continued to do extremely well on a daily diet of cooked grain, raw eggs and milk. By four years of age she was fully grown and weighed 352 pounds (160 kg)\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/magazines/docs/v22n2_lion.asp\n \nSo now the question remains, how did Noah deal with the carnivores?\n\n I've discussed this with many people before and the thing is if you believe in survival of the fittest then your absolutely correct.

   "Lurch,\n \nI always like to help non-natives to learn English.\n\n Does this mean you are an expert in grammar? Fantastic. Perhaps you could help my Trinitarian friends. See \"who is Jesus\" thread.\n \n \nDo you mean \"non-existent\" meat? The thing is that a lion will die fairly quickly without animal protein.\n\n I'm not sure if quotation marks are required in such a self invented statement! \n Anyway this would be one of those catch me out debates then. Hum. emoticon_mad \n \n \nActually a carnivore is a member of a order of placental mammal, the carnivora. The word means meat eater, but of course not all meat eaters are members of the carnivora. The order has 10 families: Canidae (wolves, coyotes, foxes and dogs), Felidae (cats), Herpestidae (mongooses), Hyaenidae (hyenas and aardwolf), Mustelidae (weasels), Odobenidae (walruses), Otariidae (sea lions and fur seals), Phocidae (seals), Procyonidae (raccoons, coatis, cacomistle, and relatives), Ursidae (bears), and Viverridae (civets, genets, linsangs, and relatives).\n \n As I explained, cats are obligatory carnivores, while others may be omnivores. The Ursidae and Canidae are actually omnivores. Eggs have lots of high quality protein. If fed to a cat in an appropriate form the cat can survive.\n\n Your point being?\n \n \nTyke was probably the lion that the creationist was crowing about. Of course, Tyke got animal protein and the necessary nutrients from the eggs and milk. Cats do not survive on hay.\n\n I thought it might be, just didn't know if you had seen the site before. I realise that lions today need animal protein and fat to survive I never said they didn't, don't run away with a non-existent argument. \n \nHow many eggs did Noah have on the ark?\n\n Silent Bible syndrome, or did you think Noah was a chicken, goose or some other kind of bird. (define \"have\") emoticon_wow \n \nThat doesn't make sense. You think that believing in mythology is being realistic?\n\n Well you do,\n Collins dictionary;\n Mythical or mythic.\n 1. of or relating to myth\n 2. imaginary or fictitious\n Myth.\n 2.a) an idea or explanation with is widely held but untrue or unproven.\n Or. Chambers dictionary;\n Myth.\n A commonly held belief that is without proof or without foundation.\n Mysticism.\n Theory that explains miraculous stories as myth.\n \n The following made interesting reading;\n \n Evolutionist Loren Eiseley acknowledged: \"After having chided the theologian for his reliance on myth and miracle, science found itself in the unenviable position of having to create a mythology of its own: namely, the assumption that what, after long effort, could not be proved to take place today had, in truth, taken place in the primeval past.\"-The Immense Journey (New York, 1957), p. 199.\n \n Can you show me by demonstration (in text obviously) following the 'scientific method' (see below) the method in which the first living cell spontaneously arose on this planet? If not it would seem that your whole Mythology is flawed and can be called into question. In fact the entire mythology of evolution rests on your scientific answer. If however you can! I will retract the above statement, and I'm all ears. \n Can you keep your theories short for a creationist to grasp?\n \n \"Astronomer Robert Jastrow says \"to their chagrin [scientists] have no clear-cut answer, because chemists have never succeeded in reproducing nature's experiments on the creation of life out of nonliving matter. Scientists do not know how that happened.\"-The Enchanted Loom: Mind in the Universe (New York, 1981), p. 19. \n \n The \"scientific method\" is as follows: Observe what happens; based on those observations, form a theory as to what may be true; test the theory by further observations and by experiments; and watch to see if the predictions based on the theory are fulfilled.\n As I've said the whole Noah story comes to an abrupt halt when you mix it with evolution, so the question now has to be how did life arrive on this fine planet, Myth or intelligent design?\n Richard.",

Are you sure you have read the Bible?\n \n Verse 11 says that the flood began on the 17th day of the second month. It rained for 40 day and nights. Then after describing this 40 days of rain the chapter ends at verse 24 where it tells us that the earth was flooded for 150 days.

But it wasn't until the 1st day of the 10th month that the mountain tops became visible. That's another 73 days (2 1/2 months).\n \n But at verse 6 we are informed that Noah waited 40 days after that before sending out first the raven and then the dove, and still Noah waited.

So that brings us back to the original question. What did Noah feed the carnivores for the year that they were shut up?\n\n Lurch I feel you need try harder to keep up with the pace of this debate, repetition is boring. To clarify my position; If your mythology proves correct that Noah's Ark is blown out of the flood water, whereas if I hold the case that the first cell did indeed have an intelligent designer, as it must have, then this intelligent designer logically holds power over every living cell, and can easily manipulate the digestive system of any animal if he needed to. This power is shown in his creation of the first man with quite clearly says that he was \"formed out of dust of the ground\" Gen. 2:7. Which, when tested with 'science method' clearly shows that the chemical elements needed for human bodies are easily found in such a place. Indeed the person that did all this creating must be extremely cleaver to carry out such an amazing task, someone even goes on to say that he is \"perfect in knowledge\" Job 36:4, there's nothing that you can teach this Intelligent designer about a living mechanical cell that he doesn't already know.\n \n \nWho is Loren Eiseley and why should we care what he said 47 years ago? What is he talking about?\n\n Your worst nightmare, because such a statement made with limited technological achievement still can't be proven wrong today.

How can technologically advanced people easily not recreate what was supposed to have happened by accident?\n \n \nHow is it meaningful to the theory of evolution that every step can not be recounted?\n\n Hang on, no steps can be scientifically accounted for, it's a theory.\n \n \nHow does that apply to a discussion of Noah's ark?\n\n As above!\n \n \nWhat mythology?\n \n What proof?

It's noteworthy to point out that your mythology can't even follow a simplified version.\n You need to defend the foundation of you designer free theory, if not the whole thing is so weak it's untrue. Do you accept that such an intelligent designer must be required? If so, fantastic, but evolution is still logically flawed.\n I will present my case as to why a designer is an absolute must if you follow 'scientific method' soon.

   "Plotter, (and indeed all)\n My evidence for the Flood of Noah's Day is as follows:\n Quotes 'Insight on the Scriptures' (WBTS)\n Flood Legends\n Samples from six continents and the islands of the sea; hundreds of such legends are known...\n The case against the Noachian flood is not just against the Bible but against the whole of the ancient world (almost), just thought I'd point that out. \n\n So, which of those non-biblical flood myths are identical to the bible version?\n How many pre-date it?\n\n  'How did they fit all those animals in the ark?'\n it-1 164 = 'Insight on the Scriptures' published by Watchtower Bible and Tract Society (WBTS)\n In size the ark was 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. Conservatively calculating the cubit as 44.5 cm (17.5 in.) (some think the ancient cubit was nearer 56 or 61 cm), the ark measured 133.5 m by 22.3 m by 13.4 m (437 ft 6 in. \u00d7 72 ft 11 in. \u00d7 43 ft 9 in.), less than half the length of the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2. This proportion of length to width (6 to 1) is used by modern naval architects. This gave the ark approximately 40,000 cu m (1,400,000 cu ft) in gross volume. It is estimated that such a vessel would have a displacement nearly equal to that of the mighty 269-m (883 ft) Titanic of this 20th century. No cargo vessel of ancient times even slightly resembled the ark in its colossal size. Internally strengthened by adding two floors, the three decks thus provided gave a total of about 8,900 sq m (96,000 sq ft) of space.\n\n \n What about the support for those two floors? A 'floor' 133mx22m is going to need some bracing - and lots of it. All that bracing takes up space as well.\n Not to mention how much would need to be used for storage.\n\n it-1 164-5\n The \"kinds\" of animals selected had reference to the clear-cut and unalterable boundaries or limits set by the Creator, within which boundaries creatures are capable of breeding \"according to their kinds.\" \n\n And what aree these boundaries? What is the criterion? Is there a boundary between lynxs and house cats? \n\n \n It has been estimated by some that the hundreds of thousands of species of animals today could be reduced to a comparatively few family \"kinds\"-the horse kind and the cow kind, to mention but two.\n\n 'Estimated'? I think they mean just-so storied. The 'cow' kind. Cute. And so from the 'cow' kind, in the mere couple thousand years since the flood (which, darn it, nobody else seems to have noticed) we get brahmas and heifers, guernseys and angus, jerseys and etc....\n Yeah, just like that.\n \n Now, how did all that variation happen? \n\n \n The breeding boundaries according to \"kind\" established by Jehovah were not and could not be crossed. With this in mind some investigators have said that, had there been as few as 43 \"kinds\" of mammals, 74 \"kinds\" of birds, and 10 \"kinds\" of reptiles in the ark, they could have produced the variety of species known today. \n\n Wow - so the 'bat kind' popped out 950+ species! How in the world did that happen in so short a time???\n\n \n Others have been more liberal in estimating that 72 \"kinds\" of quadrupeds and less than 200 bird \"kinds\" were all that were required. That the great variety of animal life known today could have come from inbreeding within so few \"kinds\" following the Flood is proved by the endless variety of humankind-short, tall, fat, thin, with countless variations in the color of hair, eyes, and skin-all of whom sprang from the one family of Noah.\n\n \n Yeah, it is proved alright...\n \n Short tall fat thin humans sure are proof that fruit bats and leaf-nosed bats are all from the same kind, but chimps and gorillas a seperate kinds...\n\n \n it-1 165\n These estimates may seem too restrictive to some, especially since such sources as The Encyclopedia Americana indicate that there are upwards of 1,300,000 species of animals. (1977, Vol. 1, pp. 859-873) However, over 60 percent of these are insects. \n\n So? Insects 'breathe', too. And they 'creepeth'. AND they actually eat a lot...\n\n these figures down further, of the 24,000 amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, 10,000 are birds, 9,000 are reptiles and amphibians, many of which could have survived outside the ark, \n\n How?\n \n What did they eat for the year that all the ground was covered? Or is this more 'magic' from Yahweh?\n\n \n and only 5,000 are mammals, including whales and porpoises, which would have also remained outside the ark. Other researchers estimate that there are only about 290 species of land mammals larger than sheep and about 1,360 smaller than rats. (The Deluge Story in Stone, by B. C. Nelson, 1949, p. 156; The Flood in the Light of the Bible, Geology, and Archaeology, by A. M. Rehwinkel, 1957, p. 69) So, even if estimates are based on these expanded figures, the ark could easily have accommodated a pair of all these animals.\n\n Can you provide sound evidence that the Global flood never happened? \n [/QUOTE]\n \n What you presented is not evidence that a global flood did happen, it is ad hoc speculation, at best.\n What evidence there is, in fact, points to there having been no such flood at all.",

   "I think part of the problem here Richard, is that you are confused over what a scientific theory is.\n \n Which now affords you a fantastic opportunity to demonstrate to me your application of Theory to the facts to convince me of just one of your unfailing conclusions.\n \n \nScientific theories come into existence because the evidence is already there.\n\n Again, Explain!\n \n But the rest of the problem is your reluctance to start a new thread to discuss evolution. This thread has nothing to do with evolution, its to do with how silly the whole Ark story is.\n\n Don't tell me that! Tell the person who put this tread in such a weird section. emoticon_xgood \n \nAs you have demonstrated yourself, it only works with a hefty dose of \"goddidit\".\n\n This would be similar to the Big Bang Theory then, which I must say sounds reasonable, observable theory seems to suggest this. Although I wouldn't make it sound like an explosion they generally tend toward disorder. Also similar is the fairy tale script of spontaneous generation. emoticon_emb \n \n \nIf you want to discuss evolution, please start a new thread.\n\n Yes please. I will in due course.\n \nIf you want to explain why you didn't stop believing in the Ark story around the same time as the Santa story, please do so in this thread.\n\n Simple I never used to believe the Ark Account, but now I do. Right about the same time I stopped banging the old Evolution drum.\n \n \n \nYou have already screwed up the definition of the scientific method,\n\n No I haven't. There's that annoying counter again Lurch.\n \nand now you display more ignorance. \n \n Where?\n \nIf what you say is true, then germ theory is a myth, atomic theory is a myth, heliocentric theory is a myth, and plate tectonics is a myth. Even more mythical are the laws of thermodynamics, since they are not even theories but observations that seem to be true.\n\n Take the time to explain to me Lurch how the Theory of Evolution is on an even par with these observable theories. This should make interesting reading. \n \nI did that many years ago. But your popular dictionary doesn't usually do a very good job on scientific terminology. For example, Merriam-Webster says that a theory is \"5. a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena.\" Even though that isn't a very good definition of a scientific theory, it is aimed at those who are scientifically illiterate, like you. But still, there is no mention of proof, even in the other 5 definitions that aren't relevant. Only scientific illiterates think that scientific theories are proven.\n\n This would be such a sound answer Lurch if only you had actually answered my original question, which was how is the Theory of evolution by definition NOT mythology. It's a very amusing time when someone takes your point, changes it round, answers it, then gives it back.\n It seems that your poor use of vocabulary when you originally called my beliefs 'mythology' has run full circle on you. Both of our unproven theories are by definition mythology. FACT. Out of respect I will refrain from calling your flawed theories Mythology. Can we cut this poor effort at ego-debate from our discussion? It's funny but not very adult.\n \n \nBut as Gormless suggests, you seem to be trying to distract from the fact that you cannot defend the Noah mythology.\n\n Much in the same way you cannot defend the Theory of Evolution, we both have sound reasons within ourselves for believing what we do. Simple. \n \nYou offer no evidence and when shown evidence to the contrary you claim miracle. It's quite childish.\n\n What must I be so seriously missing.\n \n \nIf you want to discuss it, then start a thread.\n\n In due course Lurch, patience. \n \nIf I haven't grown tired of your failure to offer any evidence for your assertions, and your inability to offer any argument against whatever it is that you oppose - you don't even make that clear\n\n Just to clarify. I hereby oppose your flawed designer free Theory of Evolution because it has no starting point. It's futile to try to separate Evolutionary Theory from another Theory namely abiogenisis, because you would be holding to a very odd belief, you would indeed have to concede that there must be a designer for the foundation but then would become irrelevant for the latter. Indeed my children don't appreciate me telling them a story from the middle onwards. You see it would go down in history as one of the most inconclusive beliefs of all time. Modern religion would always seem more attractive because it attemps to tell the whole story.\n \nReally though. You're a bust. Nothing but assertions without any thought, followed by recorse to miracle when you have no answer.\n\n Lurch, you seem to miss the point of flawed designer free Evo Theory. \n Richard\n \n Though I started this thread, I have not been here for some time, and I may have missed you fact-filled explanation for this statement already, but coul dyou give me a quick run-down for why the 'first cell' must have had a designer? I am also curious to know what you posit the 'first cell' to have been.\n\n Hi SLP, welcome back. \n The designer free cell Theory is inconclusive to say the least, for one to exist it would indeed need an original designer, other wise it wouldn't be able to produce diverse proteins or pass on hereditary info and the like. Simply I know but I will present a full case soon. It seems that abiogenisis is the Theory of a single cell starting point not mine, in an amazing amount of simplicity. Could you explain your views on this? I'm not into ego-debate (although it is quite amusing with Lurch) I just want to reach a solid conclusion.\n \n \nReally? So I can find triglyderides, amino acids, cholesterol, ribose, phosphate - all that stuff and more in 'dust of the ground'?\n \n I feel I must clarify what the verse means. The things you mention can indeed be processed from the soil... A legalistic approach to simplified account is crude.\n \n \nAnd what is that that was supposed to have happened by accident?\n \n Our existence.\n \n \nCan't wait.\n\n I'm looking for a sincere discussion of the facts. \n A good rebuttal of my original post (the only rebuttal), I will have to do some research on the legends part, but as for the rest, attacking simplified account from the Bible is not a proven science, it is always proven true eventually. FACT, (with faith). \n Richard,",

More probably, this story is some sort of Jungian archetype that resonates with people in many human societies. \n \n In terms of actual physical evidence of a global flood- \n \n \nA global flood would have produce evidence contrary to the evidence we see.\n \n How do you explain the relative ages of mountains? For example, why weren't the Sierra Nevadas eroded as much as the Appalachians during the Flood?\n \n Why is there no evidence of a flood in ice core series? Ice cores from Greenland have been dated back more than 40,000 years by counting annual layers. [Johnsen et al, 1992,; Alley et al, 1993] A worldwide flood would be expected to leave a layer of sediments, noticeable changes in salinity and oxygen isotope ratios, fractures from buoyancy and thermal stresses, a hiatus in trapped air bubbles, and probably other evidence. Why doesn't such evidence show up?\n \n How are the polar ice caps even possible? Such a mass of water as the Flood would have provided sufficient buoyancy to float the polar caps off their beds and break them up. They wouldn't regrow quickly. In fact, the Greenland ice cap would not regrow under modern (last 10 ky) climatic conditions.\n \n Why did the Flood not leave traces on the sea floors? A year long flood should be recognizable in sea bottom cores by (1) an uncharacteristic amount of terrestrial detritus, (2) different grain size distributions in the sediment, (3) a shift in oxygen isotope ratios (rain has a different isotopic composition from seawater), (4) a massive extinction, and (n) other characters. Why do none of these show up?\n \n Why is there no evidence of a flood in tree ring dating? Tree ring records go back more than 10,000 years, with no evidence of a catastrophe during that time.

   "\n \n Hi SLP, welcome back. \n The designer free cell Theory is inconclusive to say the least, for one to exist it would indeed need an original designer, other wise it wouldn't be able to produce diverse proteins or pass on hereditary info and the like. Simply I know but I will present a full case soon. It seems that abiogenisis is the Theory of a single cell starting point not mine, in an amazing amount of simplicity. Could you explain your views on this? I'm not into ego-debate (although it is quite amusing with Lurch) I just want to reach a solid conclusion.\n \n\n \n Well, your explanation thus far was to re-state the assertion. What the 'first cell' actually was would have a major impact on how 'implausible' it was to have evolved, and as far as I know, nobody has suggested what such a 'first cell' might have been. I know that many creationists have come up with what they believe are minimum requirements - based on extant cells. Then they contrive some 'impossibility calculations' to prove that it could not have happened in one fell swoop by chance, therefore, evolution is wrong.\n But such activities are erroneous on a number of fronts, as I'm sure you can tell. \n Abiogenesis, best I can tell, is the notion that 'life' - again, whatever that might be - arose via natural means from non-living things. Which has nothing to do with evolution as such.\n\n \n I feel I must clarify what the verse means. The things you mention can indeed be processed from the soil... A legalistic approach to simplified account is crude.\n\n \n They can be?\n I suppose, if by 'soil' you mean thiings like peat, ores of various types, etc...\n\n \nAnd what is that that was supposed to have happened by accident? \n\n \n Our existence.\n\n Ummm.... no.... Not quite. Making caricatures of evolution is not a good way to examine the issue.\n\n \n \n I'm looking for a sincere discussion of the facts. \n A good rebuttal of my original post (the only rebuttal), I will have to do some research on the legends part, but as for the rest, attacking simplified account from the Bible is not a proven science, it is always proven true eventually. FACT, (with faith). \n Richard,\n\n I have never seen or heard of anything from the bible being proven true.\n But yes, facts are nice.",

   "THE MYTH OF THE GREAT FLOOD1\n \n Louis W. Cable\n \n Modern investigative scholarship has shown the Genesis accounts (there are two of them) of the ?Great Flood? and its hero, Noah, to be pure fiction. Much of it was plagiarized from older cultures such as Sameria and Babylonia. To accept this story as fact flies in the face of practically all of the archaeological, historical, literary, and geological research ever conducted in the middle east. Yet, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary many Christians, both clergy and lay people, do just that. They insist on the historical truth of this story. So let us briefly review some of the more obvious reasons to regard the Biblical story of the Great Flood simply as another myth.\n \n In Sumerian clay tablets dating from the third millennium BCE there is an account of a great flood whose hero is called Ziusudra. There is also a flood story in the second millennium BCE Babylonian legend of Gilgamish. In the Babylonian legend, preserved in much greater detail than that of Sumeria, the hero is named Utnapishtim. It is interesting that elements of these two flood stories appear almost verbatim in the Genesis account of the Noachan flood. In all three stories the heroes receive divine warning of an impending flood. The reason was that god was displeased with man and wanted to start afresh. They were told to build an ark and take aboard it living creatures in pairs. In the Sumerian and Babylonian accounts birds were sent out after the rains ceased. In all stories the arks landed in mountainous areas and sacrifices were made to their gods for a safe landing. Fragments of the Babylonian flood story were found in excavations at Megiddo at the fourteenth century BCE level. So the Great Flood legend was already firmly established in the middle east long before there was an Israelite kingdom or a Bible.\n \n Archaeological research has also made other discoveries regarding the origin of the flood myth. For example, there is ample evidence that in the distant past the Tigris and Euphrates rivers periodically overflowed their banks causing great damage. Excavations clearly show silt layers, sometimes as much as seven feet thick, overlying civilization and over all of that, civilization begins again. So devastating, but natural, floods did occur in that region in the past and could have provided the inspiration for the myth. However, this type of natural flooding would never have occurred in Israel because the Jordan, the only river of any consequence in that region, flows for most of its length below sea level. So, here we have a borrowed tale.\n \n As one examines the biblical version of this story, conflicting statements become clear. The most obvious concerns the numbers of creatures Noah is to bring with him. In Gen. 6:19-20 God tells Noah to bring one pair of \"every living thing including birds.\" But in Gen.7:2-3 God gives a different set of instructions. Here he tells Noah to bring with him seven pairs of ?clean? animals and only one pair of the unclean. He also tells Noah to bring seven pairs of all birds. Why this discrepancy in numbers? Well, the truth is that the flood story in the Bible is a composite of two separate stories each with different origins2. The earliest account (J) was probably written during the time of King Solomon (10th cent. BCE). The later one (P) is believed to have been written in the sixth or fifth century BCE. In J seven pairs of clean animals are taken aboard so there will be some for sacrifices. But P, more concerned with covenants than with sacrifices, specifies that pairs of animals be brought with no exception made for clean animals or birds.\n \n At the end of the story in P there is a covenant wherein God promises never again to flood the entire earth. Because he tended to be somewhat forgetful, God puts a \"bow in the clouds\" to remind him of this promise (Gen. 9:16). Is the Bible saying that there were no rainbows before that time? Did the atmospheric laws of refraction, which have operated for millions of years, suddenly change on that day? Not likely.\n \n There are no waters above the earth and none below as stated in Genesis 1:7. This myth stems from the biblical assertion that the earth is a flat disk covered by a rigid hemispherical dome. All ancient near eastern creation myths are based on this primitive astronomical concept. The flat earth and its dome-shaped covering are said to exist as an enclosed bubble of air suspended in a universe filled with water. So when God feels like it, all he has to do is to open the windows of heaven and/or unplug the fountains of the deep and the water pours into this little saucer-shaped planet. Such assertions can only be construed as more biblical nonsense.\n \n The Ark, so decreed that great naval architect in the sky, was to be built entirely of Gopher wood, and its dimensions were to be 300 cubits long by 50 cubits wide by 30 cubits height (Gen. 6:14-15.) Based on 18 inches per cubit, that translates into 450x75x45 feet. This presented our farmer-turned-ship-builder with a daunting problem because the Ark would have broken apart with the first wave. According to Robert A. Moore (Creation/Evolution XI, vol 4, no. 1, pages. 4-5) there is an upper limit, in the region of 300 feet, on the length of a wooden ship. Beyond this a wooden ship is subjected to great stress and the hull cannot be maintained watertight. This is the major reason why the naval industry turned from wood construction to iron and steel in the 1850s. In that regard, the largest wooden ship ever built, the six-masted schooner U.S.S. Wyoming, measured 329 feet in overall length. It required diagonal iron strapping for support and leaked so badly that it had to be pumped constantly. It was declared unseaworthy and too long for wood construction. Yet the ark was deemed to be over 100 feet longer.\n \n As far back as the seventeenth century Sir Walter Raleigh realized that even at its great size, the ark could not have held the cargo of animals assigned to it. Also, where did they get the food and fresh water needed to sustain all of those animals? Who cleaned up their mess? These important questions are conveniently ignored in the Genesis accounts.\n \n Another real-world problem for those believing this story is meteorology. Genesis 7:19-20 state that all earth was covered by 15 cubits (approximately 25 feet) of water. In order to cover Mt. Everest by 25 feet--over 29,000 feet above sea level--during a span of 40 days -- it would have had to rain an average of 6 inches per minute for the entire time. The record for rainfall for any one-minute at any one location is 1.5 inches. Also, if all that vapor was in the air before the rain started, the air pressure at sea level would be an astounding 13,000 psi instead of the normal 14.5 psi.\n \n In the literature of ancient Egypt, the most powerful and most advanced nation in the world at the alleged time of the Great Flood, there is no mention of a catastrophic flood of world wide proportions. If such a flood had occurred, all of the Egyptians would have been drowned. That obviously didn't happen.\n \n However, the most devastating problem facing believers in the flood myth surfaces in Numbers 13:33. Here the Israelites encounter the sons of Anak. The Anakites came from the Nephilim (giants) who, according to Genesis 6:2-4, originated in pre-flood times as a result of the sexual union of male angels (sons of God) and the daughters of men. Therefore the presence in post-flood Canaan of Anakites, the descendants of the Nephilim, would mean that not all who lived on earth, other than Noah and his family, were killed in the flood. This stands as a direct contradiction of Genesis 6:17 where God vows to, . . . bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.\n 1.Compiled by Louis W. Cable in part from G.Larue; Fundamentalist Assault on Liberty, a Free Inquiry Conference; Orlando, FL, January, 1995. See also The Noah?s Ark Nonsense by Howard M. Teeple.\n \n 2.

Howard Hughes flew it during WW2. Wait no... :p\n \n Another thing the size of the Ark. Cubits are Hebrew units Noah was not remotely Hebrew. If NASA can loose multi million dollar spacecraft messing with the metric system who was the bright chap that converted Noachian units to Hebrew standard units. \n \n About the number of clean animals before the law there was no unclean animal since the Hebrew religion was not invented, and Noah was a vegan (I guess). I am not knocking the story, but it has classic biblical continuity written all over it. Things that don't exist yet are appearing in prehistory.\n \n Also note God said 3 things I am killing everything; it is going to rain for a more than a month, and build a boat. To me logically all you need to prove that it can rain for 40 days and find some type of really large flood plane remotely in the middle east around 10k or so years ago. From what I have looked up yeah there was a multi-continent mass extinction around that time but it was probably too spread out chronologically to count. Would be neat if you could link the two that's one cheap masters thesis.\n \n Who is telling the story? It is not God and it is not Noah. Most people believe it is Moses. This makes sense Egyptians were really into floods and since he was Hebrew too it makes sense him wanting to have a flood, but how did he get all this unknown detail from the since stories God never told him about Noah.",

Now, just for the heck of it I'm gonna chime in on this one. There is ONE other way of looking at it-maybe that's the wonder of the Bible and that perhaps it IS the word of God? I know, sounds strange coming from a cynic, but maybe that reflects that I have an open mind. I heard this one guy give a talk during which he said something about God asking someone if they could count the stars, to which the person said yes. God then said they couldn't-well, how would this person have known there were countless stars if it werten't for God telling him. Also, there was some other reference to no stars being North, and supposedly there is a cone north of earth where there is some relative absence of stars for some distance. Again, how would this person have known?",

It says that it had two of every kind (and 7 of some kinds) of living thing. And if you are going to reject some parts of the Bible if it is convenient for you, why would you believe that other parts are literal?\n \nThat would explain the dying out of many dinosaurs, preserving their fossils in the rocks today.\n\n Except that there are lots of dinosaur fossils that are not preserved in marine strata. So how is their preservation explained by the flood?\n \nAlso, the sea creatures would not have to be taken aboard as well as the freshwater creatures because of the fact that the entire planet would be covered with water.\n\n Right. And the salt water animals did OK with the reduction of salt and the fresh water animals weren't bothered by the salt because they weren't \"specialized\" yet. So what you are proposing is evolution on a grand scale since the flood. Isn't it funny that creationists need to claim hyperevolution in order to support the flood story in an effort to defeat evolution. How silly.\n \nFor plants, only seeds would be needed.\n\n And Noah and the boys ran around the world introducing the various plants to the various continents where they grow. You are aware, aren't you, that very few plant species grow around the world? Your idea is so mindless as to be laughable.\n \nAlso, one theory that is commonly overlooked is the creation \"evolutionist\" theory. This theory states that God created \"mutts,\" animals with the entire genetic code and no specialization (basically he created the genus or order, not the individual species except for man). Thus, two dogs could give rise to many other mutts that, when they moved or faced hard times, would like Darwin's finches weed out undesirable genetic code for the environment.\n\n The problem is that a theory is based on observations of real facts that have been explained by hypotheses and then tested. Your \"theory\" is yet another appeal to hyperevolution without any evidence to support it.\n \n It may be of interest to you to learn that current analysis of the human genome indicates that there is an average of 14 alleles for every active gene. Two people can carry no more than 4 - and considering that Eve was essentially a clone (what happened to her Y chromosome?), that reduces the initial genome to only 2 alleles for any gene. So what is the source of the other 12 alleles in a mere 6000 years? That's evolution at rates that are never claimed by evolutionary biologists. Besides, don't those other 12 alleles carry different information from the original two? That's an increase in information, isn't it?\n \nAll in all, it's more likely that all of the animals came from an ark than from nonliving matter.\n\n But no one is claiming that all animals spring from nonliving matter. And the story of the ark is a myth. You don't even agree with the Bible story and you want us to accept it? You claim to oppose evolution and then claim hyperevolution to solve problems with your flood story.\n \n It's all pretty silly.",

Same principle.\n\n \n Christian liberals\" have attempted to avoid this problem by saying that the story of Jonah was only an allegory and was never meant to be understood as actual history. However, whenever the Bible writers used allegories or parables or other symbolic stories, they always either said so or else made it evident in the context. The book of Jonah is certainly written as though it were actual history. Jonah was a real prophet who is mentioned also in II Kings 14:25. None of the ancient Jews or early Christians ever doubted the authenticity and historicity of the book of Jonah and its story.\n \n \n JESUS CHRIST\n \n Most importantly, the Lord Jesus Christ accepted the account as true. He said that the people of Nineveh repented of their sins as a consequence of his preaching (Matthew 12:41). He even said: \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40). Thus Christ actually compared Jonah's experience to His own coming death and resurrection, pointing out the miraculous nature of both. One cannot deny the factuality of Jonah's experience, therefore, without charging the Lord Jesus Christ with either deception or ignorance, either of which is equivalent to denying His deity.\n \n A MIRACLE\n \n There is little question that the event was a miracle, but this fact certainly does not disprove it! The account, in fact, says as much:\n \n \n \"Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.\" -Jonah 1:17 (King James Version) \n Later it says:\n \n \"And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.\" -Jonah 2:10 (King James Version) \n God was certainly able to accomplish this if He wished; to deny the possibility of miracles is atheism. The actual occurrence of this particular miracle is adequately attested by the very fact of its record in the Holy Scriptures, and is doubly confirmed by the testimony of Christ.\n Whole animals as large or larger than a man have been found in the stomachs of the sperm whale, the whale shark and the white shark.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n WHAT WAS THE \"GREAT FISH\"?\n \n The \"great fish\" may have been either a whale or a shark or even a fish specially prepared by the Lord for this purpose. (The Hebrew and Greek words that are used merely mean \"a great aquatic animal.\") Some species of whales and some species of sharks are quite capable of swallowing a man whole. Among these are the sperm whale, the white shark, and the whale shark, all of which have been found with whole animals as large or larger than a man in their stomachs.\n \n HOW DID JONAH SURVIVE?\n \n As to whether a man could survive \"three days and three nights\" under such conditions, there are three possible answers that could be suggested in defense of the Biblical narrative.\n \n \n NATURAL. In the first place, it has been well established that the phrase \"three days and three nights\" in ancient Hebrew usage was an idiomatic expression meaning simply \"three days,\" and was applicable even if the beginning and ending days of the period were only partial days. Thus it could refer to a period as short as about 38 hours. There is always some air in the whale's stomach, and, as long as the animal it has swallowed is still alive, digestive activity will not begin. Thus, Jonah's experience could possibly have happened entirely with the framework of natural law.\n \n MIRACLE. It is much more likely, however, that the event involved a divine miracle, as the Scripture strongly implies. The \"great fish\" was prepared and sent by God, as was the intense storm that threatened the ship on which Jonah was traveling. The storm ceased as soon as Jonah was cast overboard (Jonah 1:4, 15). In like manner, it was quite probable that God preserved Jonah's life miraculously all through the horrifying experience.\n \n RESURRECTION. A third possibility is that Jonah actually suffocated and died in the great fish and then God later brought him back from the dead. There are at least eight other such \"resurrections\" recorded in the Bible, as well as the glorious bodily resurrection of Christ -- of which Jonah's experience in particular was said by Christ to be a prophetic sign.\n \n This is also implied by Jonah's prayer, when he said: \"...out of the belly of hell (i.e. \"sheol,\" the place of departed spirits) cried I, and thou heardest my voice\" (Jonah 2:2). In any case, it was a mighty experience, evidently well known and certified in his day, probably contributing in significant degree to the fact that all people of Ninevah repented and turned to God (Jonah 3:5) when Jonah returned \"from the dead,\" as it were, to preach to them.\n \n Well, this doesn't prove that it did happen, only that it could have.

You may call God petty and evil, but you are the only one here with zip for evidence.\n\n \n Are these your own words? Why have you posted this apologetic XXXX as your own? Circular logic, personal incredulity handwaving and 'just so' stories is pretty much all this garbage that you lifted from http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-t004.html amounts to.\n Had you critically read the book of Jonah and analysed its historical veracity you would see that it is indeed nothing more than a fabrication.\n Lets examine the facts. \n \n According to II Kings, Jonah lived during the reign of Jeroboam II and was active during the early part of that reign, or sometime around 780 BC. Now Nineveh, a city by the northern part of the river Tigris indeed was a \"great city\" once, for it was the capital of the Assyrian empire. However, by the time of Jonah, Assyria was no longer the power it was, and Nineveh was little more than a small provincial town. Thus here we have an anachronism, a city that was no longer one in any sense of the word being called \"great\" by an author who got his history mixed up. Now the whole story of Jonah centers around this city- a city that simply did not exist during the supposed main character's lifetime!\n \n This is not all. According to chapter three of Jonah, the whole city of Nineveh repented when they heard the prophet's warning. The people of Nineveh all put on sackcloth and fasted as a sign of repentance.

   "Are these your own words? Why have you posted this apologetic XXXX as your own? Circular logic, personal incredulity handwaving and 'just so' stories is pretty much all this garbage that you lifted from http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-t004.html amounts to.\n Had you critically read the book of Jonah and analysed its historical veracity you would see that it is indeed nothing more than a fabrication.\n Lets examine the facts. \n \n According to II Kings, Jonah lived during the reign of Jeroboam II and was active during the early part of that reign, or sometime around 780 BC. Now Nineveh, a city by the northern part of the river Tigris indeed was a \"great city\" once, for it was the capital of the Assyrian empire. However, by the time of Jonah, Assyria was no longer the power it was, and Nineveh was little more than a small provincial town. Thus here we have an anachronism, a city that was no longer one in any sense of the word being called \"great\" by an author who got his history mixed up. Now the whole story of Jonah centers around this city- a city that simply did not exist during the supposed main character's lifetime!\n \n This is not all. According to chapter three of Jonah, the whole city of Nineveh repented when they heard the prophet's warning. The people of Nineveh all put on sackcloth and fasted as a sign of repentance. Such a conversion, a truly miraculous victory for the Jewish God, is neither recorded in Kings nor in any extra-biblical or secular documents. This lack of corresponding documentation of such an unusual event in other sources (including Biblical ones) showed that the supposed event never happened. [5] Without even needing to consider the absurd case of Jonah surviving for three days in the belly of a \"great fish\", it is obvious that the book of Jonah is fiction, not fact.\n 5. Asimov, Asimov's Guide to the Bible: p642-647 \n \n http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/ruth.html\n \n Perhaps instead of resorting to the apologetic press as your primary source of information, you could do some research. Saying that it could have happened really doesn't amount to much now, does it.\n\n \n First off, chill out.\n \n Second off, I was trying to make a point not prove that it happened. I was only pointing out to lurch that saying it didn't happen, in his opinion, doesn't mean it did. I provided some ready information (and simply missed the source part on my copy and paste function) to show it was possible, only. Not even probable. \n \n The point was that Lurch made an assertion as fact and it was clearly his opinion. Lurch calls people on this all the time and insults them frequently in the process. It was his turn. As for you, you are simply attacking me and assuming a great deal about what I am doing. I have no desire to do the research to prove such things as I know full well they are not provable. So do you. It is simply innappropriate to represent things as fact that are clearly belief or opinion. They carry different weight in an argument. I have not misrepresented anything. I did leave out the source. Not intentionally, although that does seem a bit convenient. I cant't prove it to you. You can believe me or not. But state it as you don't believe me not that I did such and such a thing and you know why I did it. I suppose your psychic abilities are \"obvious\" or \"well known\" or \"it's silly to believe otherwise\" or something to that effect. Talk about logical fallacy! ;)",

   "So your argument is that unless your wild claimes can be shown to be wrong, they are right?\n \n Bad theology. Your petty little god that makes wagers with an evil being. Your evil little god allows lots of people to be killed without reason, just because he can. And all of those who died came to an understanding of just just your petty little god is, didn't they. The story is the man must fear god because god will allow evil on a whim.

   "Hey Lurch what do you mean mythology? Also how are humans above mythology now? Why Is the Aeneid or the Iliad for ignorant people if they believe in them? Think of this Hercules was a \"real\" man that existed to the Greeks. Yet nobody saw him even thought he lived on earth at the same time as people that believed in him did. \n \n In other words the popular religions all \"happen\" long ago. So believers say this was real unproven human history from long ago. The only reason we can't find proof is time erased it.\n \n Now look at the Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses, or scientologist. They live at remotely the same time they believe all their beliefs happen just like the Greeks for example. They believe their beliefs are true. Yet they leave or present no tangible proof. For example I can't find Satan or his Demon army that came to earth in 1914. I just proclaim they are here because someone told me or I read it some place. Am I ignorant? \n \n I believe in Job. Not because of proof, but because I deliberately believe a myth. Something I know \"never happened\", but I believe it did. If I was a Greek for example I may just assume there is a half mortal man running around killing mutant animals because some guy told me about it. Heck there may even be a real guy I know that's strong and named Hercules (btw I know this is not the Greek spelling) so maybe the other stuff is \"true\".\n \n If you know about ancient culture you know about the idols the Greeks or whoever would feed, dress, and take care of. Then parade them out on holidays. These things were literally giant dolls. The Greeks were smart they knew they were giant dolls, but they were holy giant dolls. People would do all kids of crazy things for these big holy toys. \n \n Lurch has modern humanity lost the simple concept of giant holy dolls?",
