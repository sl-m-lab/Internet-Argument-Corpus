   "From National Geographic:\n \n Has the World Already Passed ?Peak Oil??\n \n \nHas the World Already Passed \"Peak Oil\"?\n New analysis pegs 2006 as highpoint of conventional crude production\n \n \n The year 2006 may be remembered for civil strife in Iraq, the nuclear weapon testing threat by North Korea, and the genocide in Darfur, but now it appears that another world event was occurring at the same time-without headlines, but with far-reaching consequence for all nations.\n \n That's the year that the world's conventional oil production likely reached its peak, the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Vienna, Austria, said Tuesday.\n \n According to the 25-year forecast in the IEA's latest annual World Energy Outlook, the most likely scenario is for crude oil production to stay on a plateau at about 68 to 69 million barrels per day.\n \n \nIn this scenario, crude oil production \"never regains its all-time peak of 70 million barrels per day reached in 2006,\" said IEA's World Energy Outlook 2010.\n\n\n \n Last year, the IEA pegged the most likely year for \"peak oil\" as being somewhere between 2020 and 2035. Now the data shows it was....uh...4 years ago. This aint good.\n \n I bought the report from the IEA. The high points are pretty much summed up in this graph:\n \n http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1329/5167720983_0bf1f590ed_z.jpg\n \n There are a couple of horrifying things about this graph. First, they put a LOT of reliance on fields yet to be developed and fields yet to be found. Filling that much space with \"fields yet to be found\" is pretty much faith based energy forecasting. Even the \"Fields yet to be developed\" is problematic because most of the fields yet to be developed are ultra deep water, in many cases in locations that we do not have the technology to drill. Brazil has such a field, and Chevron found one with their Jack II find a couple years ago. They know there are large deposits of oil there, but the best they can do is hope that nanotube technology develops enough for them to be able to implement it, because we do not have materials that are light enough for a riser thatr big and strong enough to withstand the pressure at those depths. The technology they need to exploit those wells is predicted to be about 20 years out from where we are now. \n \n It requires that those \"yet to be developed\" fields be developed at a rate never before seen in the oil industry. Here is a chart from The Uppsala Global Energy Systems Group showing probable development timeline for \"yet to be developed\" projects based on historic data:\n \n http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn29/aangelinsf/IEARealisticProduction.gif\n \n Yea...that dotted line is what the IEA is counting on.\n \n Their assumed depletion rate has similar problems. They use an average based on historic depletion data to come up with their depletion rate. The problem is that enhanced recovery techniques used over the last decade have allowed maximum production for a longer period of time, but then a much faster crash. Prior to enhanced recovery, field typically depleted post peak at a rate of about 4.3% per year. With enhanced recovery, that decline rate is anywhere from 13.8 to 21% per year. By basing their calculations on a composite of all years that there is data (50+ years) they fail to account for the fact that enhanced recovery is used in virtually ALL fields now, meaning their depletion rates are far to low. \n \n We are boned.",

   "Is the flattening of production consistent with demand or is it 100% due to the production capabilities?\n \n From what I understand demand in the US has dropped over the past few years and places like China are fairly stable.\n\n \n 100% due to production capabilities. Keep in mind that a 70 million barrel/day peak in 2006 includes $140 oil in 2007 and part of 2008. In their report they cite failure of the worlds major oil producers to increase production in order to maximize profits as a pretty solid indicator that they were unable to do so. \n \n One of the problems with coming up with concrete models or models that can be verified independently is that in most nations in the ME oil reserves and production capability are considered matters of national security. Several years ago a Saudi oil engineer revealed that the water cut in Gewhar was almost triple what the Saudi government admitted and the guy vanished off the face of the earth. He just disappeared. \n \n One of the things that originally got me looking at peak oil as a potential real problem was the fact that the DOE and Military kept commissioning peak oil related studies. At that point (2003-2004ish) there were only a few industry insiders like Matt Simmons talking about it, and the big question was what Saudi Arabia could actually produce. It stood to reason that our intelligence agencies would likely have better information on that than anybody, so when I saw the military studying ways to operate post peak oil, I could not help but wonder if they were preparing for an eventuality that they actually had reason to believe was coming soon as opposed to their normal \"Plan for EVERYTHING\" lunacy.",

The fact is that all commodities rely on the laws of supply and demand to first determine the value and then the market price.\n\n \n Whether it is $100 or $150 is pretty much irrelevant. It exceeded their target price significantly, we should have seen producers bringing excess production online to take advantage of the higher prices. This is true both in OPEC and in non OPEC nations since, in theory, when OPEC raised quotas prices should have headed back down. They didnt because nobody could actually raise production to meet the new quotas. \n \n \n \n\n Can you show when and where I ever suggested the sweet spot for production was $140 a barrel? And can you document when that price per barrel \"CRASHED THE WORLD ECONOMY?\" I would love to see that piece of fiction.\n\n \n Oil was at $140, Transport prices were through the roof (remember gas at $4.50??), food prices were driven up due to increased costs as well as the idiotic steps we took to turn our food into fuel. This caused disposable incomes to go NEGATIVE (meaning that not only did people not have any \"spare\" money, they could not afford to pay their basic costs of living) and we started to see massive defaults in mortgages, credit cards, car loans, and pretty much everywhere else that banks had loaned money to people. \n \n \n \n \nThe first thing you've said I can agree with is that the production sweet spot is around $75 a barrel.

There was no spare production at that point, and our maximum output was simply not enough to keep up with demand. \n \n If your price target is $75, and you have an organization like OPEC trying to enforce that target, and the current market price is over $75, you try to produce more in order to maximize your profits.

I tell them it won't \"run out\" unless price controls are instituted, the price will just go up. The more rational of them accept this, and then point out the troubles a very high oil price will bring.\n\n \n Oil will never \"run out\". The cost of extracting it will just get too high for the market to bear. \n \n \nTo them I say \"buy oil\". If you really believe the value of oil will go up very high very fast, you would be an XXXXX not to invest in it. Put some leverage into it and you could make a fortune.\n\n \n Already done here. I have been buying up every oil lease I could get my hands on for about the last 5 years. Now I cant afford to buy any more because I literally have to bid against companies like BP and Shell for a little 10 hole lease in the middle of kansas. Lease prices have more than tripled since last year. 2 years ago none of the oil majors were at all interested in the kind of little piecemeal leases I was looking for. \n \n \nAlternately, if you believe oil will fail to be our source of energy for the future, invest in the alternatives that will - whether they're nuclear, \"natural\" or some other variant.\n\n \n At this point, there are no alternatives that will. None of our \"alternatives\" are mature enough to make any kind of rational judgment as to what is likely to survive and what is not. Currently the best \"alternative\" to oil is coal. \n \n \nI haven't yet come across a peak oil enthusiast with the conviction to put their money into it and hold, it appears to serve more as a political tool than a consistent belief.\n\n \n I think that is because you have been looking at too many peak oil \"enthusiasts\". That is actually a good term. I know the kind of people you are talking about. There certainly seems to be a lunatic fringe out there attached to the peak oil concept. They seem to fall into 2 groups....either people whose credit sucks so they hope the world ends, or people who cant wait for the day when their gardening and basket weaving skills land them a job as king of their own outlaw army. \n \n As far as putting your money into it and holding it, that is trickier than it sounds. You cant just buy a 10 year futures contract. Standard contracts dont go out that far and frankly finding and negotiating a direct or private contract is beyond the skills of most people. That leaves either direct physical investment, like I have done with my leases, or stocks. A direct physical investment requires either a lot of cash, or a long track record of successful project management that you can take to your banker. Most people have neither. That pretty much leaves oil stocks, which is not a bad place to go if you can invest and sit on it. I personally bought the heck out of oil stocks when the market was low, and then invested heavily in BP when their stock was beat down due to the deepwater horizon fiasco.\n \n Currently my primary business is mining, namely quarrying and crushing limestone for construction and road use. Believe it or not, that was actually my biggest peak oil related investment to date, and it has paid off incredibly well. Crushed rock is pretty much the foundation of every building project, and we put millions of tons of it on and under our roads in the US every year. The \"accepted\" business model essentially says that you find a good location, put in the biggest crusher and equipment you can afford, and go to town producing flat out as fast as you can.\n \n With the run up in transportation prices we have seen over the last several years, I decided to try something different. I run production quarries that are fully mobile. I negotiated leases with landowners in several locations, pay then anywhere from $0.40 to $1 per ton for what I crush and move off their land (payable when the customer pays me to keep out of pocket expenses down). \n \n My first complete plant consisted of 2 crushers, 2 wheel loaders, 1 track loader, 1 screen plant, and a dozen conveyors. Total acquisition cost was just over $2 million. It paid for itself in just under 6 months. Since then I have added 2 more plants, and am in the process of adding a third. The third plant will not be a quarry, it will be for concrete recycling. I am leasing a piece of land in downtown Kansas City and will allow people to dump concrete there. I will then crush it, and resell it as class I construction aggregate. I charge $80 per truckload to dump concrete and have already made enough off of dumping fees to pay for the entire project.\n \n With transport costs where they are, in most places it cost more to transport a truckload of aggregate than the value of the aggregate. On one site that I am just breaking ground on the county was paying $6.50 per ton for their road rock, but having to transport it over 80 miles. They contracted with me for 75,000 tons of that same rock produced locally. I am charging them $9.50 per ton, but they will still save over 35% due to the decrease in transport costs. \n \n Is that a \"peak oil\" investment? I made it on the assumption that transport costs were going to be permanently high due to supply not being able to keep up with demand in the oil markets. If so, I think you are SORELY mistaken about the number of people making such investments. Business models created primarily to combat rising oil prices, or dependent on rising oil prices for success, are pretty much the norm anymore. There are factories being built right now in the US that pretty much only make economic sense if transport costs from china continue to increase.",

   "Under my mattress! Probably has a better return too...who knows what is hidden in there. \n \n Yeah, to be honest, I'm looking at foreign investments and maybe even Asian index funds. I'll be keeping an eye on the oil supply but I'm not ready to buy the bunker yet.\n\n \n I think we have a ways to go before a bunker will be required. What we WILL have is opportunities, for those who recognize them and are willing to act. \n \n \nI honestly don't think they see if that way. They just hear \"taxes up\" and assume it's game over for everyone. You own a business right? Tell me, how many people do you plan to lay off if your taxes go up 8%? Or maybe the more likely scenario is that if you could have laid off workers to save money you probably would have already gotten rid of them. Tell me, how much more will you charge your customers if your taxes go up 8%? Or is it more likely that you will eat the cost since raising prices in a competitive industry is idiotic if you are now above your competitors price. \n \n My taxes are going up and the result is be buying or saving less. That's just what happens when you spend future money(the now) in the present (the 1950-90s)....it kills spending in the future.\n\n \n I can tell you with 100% honesty that I have never considered my tax rate, or where it was likely to be in the future, when deciding whether to hire or fire people. Either an employee is making you money or they are not. It is that simple, regardless of the tax rate. Either you can make money expanding or you can not, and frankly if an 8% increase in your tax rate is enough to make or break the enterprise, only an XXXXX would choose to expand. \n \n One of the problems that easy money for XXXXXX has brought that is going to make it particularly difficult for any kind of job recovery to occur is that we have largely abandoned prudent business growth practices. It was not THAT long ago that if you wanted to start a business you did it at home, in your \"spare\" time, and then grew it until it was self supporting. That is how I did mine. Over the last half decade or so, that model has changed. We got to the point that you had a business idea, pitched the idea to bankers until you found one willing to lend you hundreds of thousands of dollars essentially on faith, so you could hit the market with a BANG. \n \n We saw this in larger companies as well. They would essentially staff and equip with the expectation of expansion, even when there was no real reason to expect that expansion was eminent. \n \n This is going to impact the job market for a long time because most companies are still overstaffed. Sure, they cut deadwood, but most companies have been reluctant to let good, trained (read that \"useful\") people go. \n \n As it becomes more clear that our \"recovery\" is not a recovery, those people will be let go as well. If they cancel the tax cuts for the wealthy, you can bet your bottom dollar that the anti intelligent tax crowd will claim the lapse led to the loss of those jobs.",

The circle jerk in the religion forums is not interesting to me when we got a country who is fighting their way towards finding an answer on the God question rather quickly.\n\n \n Hmmm....not really on the oil supply front so much, but world food prices recently hit a record high, driven by corn, vegetable oil, and sugar prices, not surprisingly those are the things we have decided to make fuel out of.\n \n One good thing about peak oil is that you dont have to follow the issue very closely. Check in every few months and you can consider yourself up to date. It has been called \"the long emergency\".",
