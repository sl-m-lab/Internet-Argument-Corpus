   "Dear friends and foes and others:\n \n This appears to be something important. I'm pretty sure it's important. But. . . .\n \n What is it?\n \n First of all, it is a concept currently discussed:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/03/opinion/l03tierney.html\n \n December 3, 2005\n Wal-Mart and the Social Contract (4 Letters) \n To the Editor:\n \n \"The Good Goliath\" (column, Nov. 29), John Tierney's defense of Wal-Mart, misses the point. Nobody denies that Wal-Mart offers low prices to consumers. What opponents of Wal-Mart's practices argue is that the social good of low prices must be balanced against other important values. \n \n Putting our children to work in factories would cut costs to consumers, but we all believe that this is morally unacceptable and would hurt our country in the long run. \n \n In the same way, many of us believe that Americans working hard at full-time jobs should not be receiving wages that keep them living in poverty without health care.\n \n James Dawes -- St. Paul, Nov. 29, 2005\n \n To the Editor:\n \n John Tierney is certainly right that Wal-Mart has done a lot to make life more affordable for those living in poverty, especially in rural areas. But it has done relatively little to improve the living standard of its own employees during a time when middle-class jobs are increasingly hard to come by in this country. \n \n It really is not too much to ask that employees be provided with decent health care. Indeed, this was an integral part of the social contract between businesses, workers and the government for the better part of the 20th century. \n \n If Wal-Mart truly wants to do something for its workers, it can prove it to the rest of us by either providing them with quality health care or by acknowledging that the nation's health care system is broken and petitioning the government for reform. \n \n Could it be that Wal-Mart fears that nationalized health care would erode its price advantages over its more considerate rivals? \n \n Charles Paul Hoffman -- New York, Nov. 29, 2005\n \n To the Editor:\n \n John Tierney hints at the unacknowledged reality that the Wal-Mart controversy is class based. Activist leaders who protest Wal-Mart are affluent enough not to have to shop there. The elite National Trust for Historic Preservation, the retailer's most persistent nemesis, advertises million-dollar homes in its glossy magazine. \n \n Target stores, similar in their local impact, are spared from attack because they cater to the tastes and budgets of more upscale shoppers.\n \n Working-class families may benefit more from Wal-Mart's lower prices than they would from higher wages. A dollar added to the wages is taxed, while every dollar saved on purchases is tax-free. \n \n John L. Gann -- Glen Ellyn, Ill., Nov. 29, 2005\n The writer is an urban development consultant.\n \n To the Editor:\n \n John Tierney says that Costco \"needs\" to pay higher wages than Wal-Mart because \"it requires higher-skilled workers to sell higher-end products to its more affluent customers.\" Excuse me? Costco is a warehouse! There is very little in the way of one-on-one shopping help. \n \n The last time I shopped at Costco, there was no one to help me distinguish between a Sony computer and a Hewlett-Packard. But there were lots of forklift operators, butchers, pharmacists, cash-register clerks and a slew of retirement-age men and women giving out samples of food. Is it this last group that Mr. Tierney considers \"higher skilled\"?\n \n Wal-Mart pays its full-time employees $9.68 an hour on average. Last year it paid its chief executive $17.5 million in total compensation, about twice the average pay of leading American chief executives. The company made a profit of $10.3 billion. \n \n Mr. Tierney says that if Wal-Mart were \"forced\" to provide minimal health care benefits for employees, it \"would probably cut the cash wages of the workers\" to remain competitive. Why? It seems to have profits to spare. \n \n Roberta Rosenberger -- Miami, Nov. 29, 2005",

   "But, noted conservative pundit George Will hath said on April 28, 2005:\n \n \nThomas Hobbes was born in 1588, the year Protestant England defeated the armada of Catholic Spain. He lived 91 years, through the sectarian strife of England's Civil War and the regicide of Charles I. Hobbes wanted tranquillity. His project was to establish the philosophic foundations of government that could guarantee safety.\n \n He said that without government -- in what Hobbes called the ''state of nature'' -- even sociability itself was problematic because life was ''solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.'' To escape such horrors, people would make a rational, if stark, social contract. They would consent to surrender their natural rights in order to empower a severely strong government that would at least release them from fear of violent death.\n\n http://www.asylumnation.com/asylum/_r/showthread/threadid_41160\n \n Who am I to quibble with the likes of conservative pundit George Will?",
