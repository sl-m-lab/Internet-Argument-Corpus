   "There is a lot of talk going around about a dissent Alito wrote in a 1996 machine gun case, U.S. v. Rybar. Rybar was a FFL who sold two fully-automatic rifles at a gun show in Pa. Rybar was prosecuted for violating 18 U.S.C.\n section 922(o), which makes it \"unlawful for any person to\n transfer or possess a machinegun.\"\n \n The Brady Campaign has already issued two press releases about Alito's opinion in this case. In one of them they refer to Alito as \"Machine Gun Sammy.\"\n \n In Rybar, the defendant raised two claims. 1. Congress exceeded its authority to regulate interstate commerce when it enacted the statute he was prosecuted under. 2. the statute violated his 2nd. Amendment RKBA.\n \n The two judge majority rejected the commerce clause claim. By doing so, it was then required to also look at his RKBA claim. In a very short opinion on the subject, the majority rejected that claim as well and gave a very clear indication that it tracked the then-Clinton DOJ position on the 2nd. amendment: that it only protects the militia arms possessed by militia members.\n \n Alito dissented and argued that congress exceeded its authority under the interstate commerce clause. Because he viewed the statute to be unconstitutional for this reason, he was not required to address the second RKBA claim. His opinion deals only with the authority to regulate interstate commerce, and is silent about the 2nd. amendment. \n \n The full text of the decision can be found here: \n \n http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/wbardwel/public/nfalist/us_v_rybar.txt",

   "That raises an interesting question. \n \n On the face of what the Constitution says, I don't see a federal authority to ban the personal posession of machine guns, grenades, tanks, mortars or other \"arms.\" On the other hand, at the time the Constitution was adopted, the arms in question were mostly smoothbore muskets used in peacetime for hunting and self-defense, but readily available as military weapons in time of war. Even privately owned merchant vessels carried cannon as protection from pirates and could be pressed into service as naval vessels.\n \n I don't see any need to allow unrestricted individual ownership of weapons of war, but it could be an unusually interesting constitutional debate.",

   "The key argument here is the \"interstate commerce\" clause. It's sort of a catch all for \"anything\" the Feds want to charge you on.\n \n For some legal clarification....machineguns are legal to own as long as they are registered.\n \n Ever since May of 1986 it's been illegal to make a new machinegun. The law that keeps civilians from making new (and then registering them) MGs is the \"interstate commerce clause\". \n \n There is currently a case (Stewart vs US) where he was charged with possession of homemade MGs. He was found guilty then appealed to the Circuit Court where they found him innocent as his defense was they were constructed of non-regulated materials and he built it himself and it did NOT nor was intended to cross state lines therefore it would not have an effect on interstate commerce.\n \n Since the law that enforces the MG ban of 1986 is only based on \"interstate commerce\" it should have ended there. However the ATF appealed and it went to the Supremes but when the ruled against Raich the SUpremes kicked it back to the Circuit without and disent. Now it's currently sitting there and hopefully it will go back to the Supremes in a more favorable setting.\n \n If Stewart wins then it means that new-made MGs could then be built and transfered to civilians. THey would still be regulated and it would still be illegal to posses one that was not registered.\n \n However the interstate commerce clause has far reachin implications in many factors of life.\n \n If you grew your own pot could the Feds arrest you?\n Refine your own oil?\n Etc etc...",

   "Here is the code sub-section that Rybar was prosecuted under:\n \n U.S. Code 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 (Paragraph o)\n \n (o)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun.\n \n (2) This subsection does not apply with respect to -\n \n (A) a transfer to or by, or possession by or under the authority of, the United States or any department or agency thereof or a State, or a department, agency, or political subdivision thereof; or\n \n (B) any lawful transfer or lawful possession of a machinegun that was lawfully possessed before the date this subsection takes effect.\n \n \n SCOTUS has declared that one of the ways Congress may use its interstate commerce power is by regulating \"activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\" One of the things said by the majority was that the weapons involved must have been machineguns in interstate commerce because one originated from out of the country ad the other was a U.S. military weapon. \n \n Interestingly for the Stewart case, Alito makes mention of home-made full-auto conversions and suggests these weapons might be lawfully purchased through interstate commerce as semi-auto devices and then be beyond congress' regulatory authority for possession of a machinegun because the conversion and subsequent possession would not affect interstate commerce.",

In the case of free speech, the court understood that the original intent referred to reasonable discussion and did not extend to speech that was followed by the immediate onset of public disorder (i.e., you can't yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater) - the same reasoning could be applied to the second amendment.",

   "I see both points but I think possesing automatic weapons is a constitutional right. I think the founding father's established the right of individuals to bear arms because....well what did we do against england? We didn't take out swords and daggers but the best guns and rifles we had to claim America for ourselves. I think the founding fathers foresaw the possibility of such an even arising in the distant future that the civilians of the country might need to rise up again. So they eloquently interjected that amendment to fit as needed. I don't have a history degree though...so it's MHO.",
