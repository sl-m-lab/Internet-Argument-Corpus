   "In that case it should have made you realise that conciousness isn't the defining factor you are looking for. I think the main problem here is that whilst everyone has an opinion on this, not everyone is really qualified to make a sensible definition and this unfortunately includes those poiticians' whose job it is to actually make them law. Conciousness and self aware are terms we are familiar with but really have often have very little idea what they mean outside of judging an alien off star trek. I suppose you could have it defined more precisely with rather than a simple rank of 'human' and 'non-human' you have a varying degree of rights depending on the mental abilities of the individual involved. Course there will be some side effects, but with any luck they will tend toward denying mental patients the vote or politicians being required to pass a test before taking office rather extreme cases than giving cows the vote or serving up alzheimers patients in burgers. \n I think human or person is sadly going to be one of those terms that is like art, you can extend it to include a huge number of things, but its really a subjective opinion which doesn't really have any clear basis that can be universally defined. \n Or at least not without the country becoming vegetarian, and pigs are tasty...",
