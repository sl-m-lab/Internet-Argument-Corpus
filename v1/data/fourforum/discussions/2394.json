   "SOME THOUGHTS ON THE RIGHT to KEEP and BEAR ARMS.\n \n 'A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed'.\n \n 'A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state'\n \n What does this mean? It has been described by many noted Constitutional Scholars to be no more than a preamble, if you will, to the principal statement of the reason behind the Second Amendment. Firstly, none of the AMENDMENTS grant or give rights. They guarantee those rights, the founders or framers of the Constitution, if you will, deemed endemic to all free men. By no means, are the individual freedoms and rights the first eight amendments enumerate and guarantee, the only rights to be enjoyed by the people. The Ninth Amendment says; 'The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.' The founders recognized any government, no matter how benevolent could be corrupted by an unscrupulous leader or leaders. They had lived under the yoke of such a government for years, and wanted every safeguard possible against such to happen again.\n \n As Sanford Levinson states in his treatise, 'The Embarrassing Second Amendment', the preamble is, for all practical purposes, UNDERSTOOD for all the Amendments. His treatise can be found at  http://www.firearmsandliberty.com/embar.html\n \n Robert Cottrol, another Constitutional Scholar promotes basically the same idea. Though I have his treatise saved, the original link no longer works, but if interested. I will be happy to see if I can send it to anyone that wishes. Roy Copperud was another scholar, though of language and journalism, that explains what the wording meant.\n Try http://www.firearmsandliberty.com/unabridged.2nd.html\n \n Now the courts have held in some instances, the right to keep and bear arms is an individual right and in some instances, it is a states right. ( as an interjection here, government has no rights, only powers ) This can get very confusing and as all know, somewhat unpredictable. Though, the Supreme Court has been somewhat quiet on the matter, they have held, in other cases, by inference, the right to keep and bear arms is as much an individual right as any. The Fourteenth Amendment is pretty much self explanatory as to the validity of an individual right. \n \n We now come to the thought of infringement. Exactly what does it mean to be inalienable, or shall not be infringed. If a Constitutional Right is restricted in any manner, is that an infringement. If the right to infringe or to set limits, on a Constitutional Right is a POWER of the legislative branch, then does that not become a privilege? If a privilege can be granted, can it not also be regulated and eventually repealed?\n \n \n WHAT IS THE MILITIA?\n \n The militia is the body of armed civilians, and because they are armed, they are the cornerstone of American Freedom. Let me explain why. The civilians of the colonial and revolutionary times were mostly farmers, shopkeepers, laborers, etc. They were the everyday people. They were armed. They were armed because they had recognized their right to be able to protect their lives and the lives of their loved ones, as well as their property and homes. The threats to their continued ability to protect their lives and property was real. Every day, they may be forced to fight roving gangs of criminals, marauding bands of Indians, and wild and carnivorous beasts. They were NOT armed just to furnish the militias their manpower. BECAUSE the people were armed, the militias could draw upon that source of armed yeomanry, to protect the community, the immediate surrounding areas, and the state against either invasion by foreign principalities or an unscrupulous central federal government. While the latter two threats may be considerably lessened today, especially the invasion by a foreign principality, the threat of an unscrupulous government rising to power, is always a reality. Not necessarily an imminent one, but one in which the possibility is always there.\n \n WHAT THE FOUNDERS THOUGHT OF THE MILITIA.\n \n  http://www.cmlc.org/cmlc/2amend.htm \n \n As one can plainly see, the framers thought the militia was that great body of armed citizens, well equipped and trained to be called upon if the need arose.\n \n The militia, therefore, is the whole of the armed populace of the United States. It exists because the people are armed. The people are not armed so the militia may exist. There is actually two militias in existence. One is the Organized Militia, which has morphed into the National Guard, The Navy Reserve, and The Air National Guard. The other is the Unorganized militia, which consists of those not associated with the organized militias. There are some age limitations as to requirements, but basically any and all are the unorganized militia.\n \n WHAT DOES A 'WELL REGULATED' MILITIA MEAN?\n \n Simply put, it means well trained in tactics, marksmanship, and well equipped. It was a requirement of the early militias for each man to have a weapon of the type in use by the armed services, so much powder and shot, flints, so much food, and a blanket. This was to be furnished at the expense of the militiaman himself. If he could not afford the expense, or not be able to borrow the money for said expense, he could be forced into servitude until the necessary expenses were paid back. This was the earliest form of conscripted service in this country, to my knowledge.\n \n WHAT CONSTITUTES BEARABLE ARMS?\n \n Does this mean tactical nukes, explosive devices, cannons, jets, ect. Not to the best of my knowledge. It does include automatic arms, inspite of or because of the ruling in US v Miller in 1939, depending on which side of the coin you're on. Generally, nukes, jet aircraft, tanks, and the like are used as strawman arguments, based on no reality whatsoever.\n \n IS IT POSSIBLE TO CONSTITUTIONALLY INFRINGE THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS?\n \n Let's see what St George Tucker, one of the most noted of early Jurists had to say. St George Tucker was a Virginia Supreme Court justice and later a US District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. He published an edition of Blackstone's Commentaries, discussing English law and how it applied to our own beginnings and justice in this country. His comment on the Second Amendment was; \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.......and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government.\" In his appendix to the Commentaries he goes a little farther by stating, \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible. Whenever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. \n \n Comments and discussion are very welcomed.",

Sure, its much harder to make a change in the constitution, but this doesn`t really affect wether the change should  be done or not. \n\n \n The difference, Eddie is simply this. If the Constitution needs to be changed, the founders instigated a means to do so. Said means is doubly hard as to make sure what is done, has been given much thought and study. The plan afoot today by the Gun Grabbers is to incrementally usurp the rights of free men, until, the fait accompli has been established. If the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, or any of the other rights guaranteed by the Constitution are to be abridged, they must ne done so by legal means, i.e. constitutional amendment. \n \n \nAnother argument I don`t really understand is that about protection from the govenment.

Civil discourse and unrest, is in and of itself, not necessarily bad. Criminal misuse of that freedom , as with all freedoms is.\n \n I was struck by the inconsistancy of your tag line; \"All rights are positive, freedom of speech or the right to property depend on a vigorous government as surely as the right to an income or an education\" - Stephen Holmes and Cass R. Sunstein \"Why liberty depends on taxes\"\n \n I would suggest the right to freedom of speech or the right to property, are useless without the right to defend them.

Thanks.\n\n \n Sinjin, I will see if I can find a link for you. As for the National Guard being the militia of old, I would suggest to you, inspite of the Guards insistence it is the replacement, I would merely point out this fact. One of the early militias duties was to stand tall against an usurperous federal government. Oh, the feds could use the militia in case of invasion by other forces, but the militia belonged to the states in case of federal intervention into the states business.This was another check and balance against an overly active federal government. We have seen, this is no longer the case. If a state activates,the National Guard to stand in the face of armed dictatorial intervention by the feds into the affairs of the state, the feds simply 'nationalize' the Guard, removing it from the jurisdiction of the state/s. The precedent has been set and has been secured, so for any state National Guard unit to be used against the Feds, it would have to be by their ( the Feds ) permission. Uh-huh, and pigs fly too.\n \n Another little fact. The militias of old  REQUIRED each man to be armed, at their expense, with the small arms in use by the military at the time. The Guard now furnishes the weaponry to the citizen soldiers. The Guard is also a military unit of the US armed services, as well.",

Lenin rose to power with a large support of heavily armed groups and the whole thing turned into a bloodbath when the civil war between the reds and the whites (both heavily armed groups).

   "[QUOTE=Eddie]Sure, but my question is more regarding why you believe your country should be run like the founding fathers intended? \n \n Hmmmn! How else would I believe it to be run. The system has been tried, and with basically minor 'tweaking', has withstood 200+ years of those willing to undermine it.\n \n \nYou mean that the confiscation of the guns would cause civil unrest? That`s an interesting thought. \n\n \n Consider. There are approximately 80 million Americans that own firearms. That has been interpreted by some to read 80 million households which would extend that number of 'owneres'. While not all would take to the streets in protest, suppose only 10% did, or even only 5%. That is still somewhere around 4+ million Americans in protest. Supposing another 10%, which I believe would be on the low side, refused to turn in their weapons, that becomes a sizable number of US citizens, immediately transformed from law abiding citizens into criminals by the stroke of a pen. Carry that into the next election, and I guarantee every gun grabbing SOB of a congresscritter that voted for such a BS law would be turned out to pasture in a heartbeat. Look what the gun owners in this country accomplished in '94.\n \n That, of course, is the main reason, gun control discussions and debates are somewhat shied away from by politicians in election cycles. If the laws against private ownership of firearms ever became nationwide in one fell swoop, I shudder to think what, by then, our country had become, and what it was headed for.\n \n \nYes, but as it is \"my\" tag line, and as I don`t believe that the right to keep and bear arms is important, I don`t see how I am being inconsistent?\n\n \n You are right, of course, and though it seems inconsistant to me, it is still your perogitve. My apology.\n \n \nI have never said anything about not defending it through armed force. I just don`t believe that you need an armed populace.\n\n \n How else is it to be defended? What keeps the benevolence of your government, truly benevolent? If the people, being armed, is not the final arbiter of your freedom, what is? Governmental promises? History has shown those to be as useless as teats on a boar hog..",

If the dissent in this country ever reaches the level of civil disobedience required to dispose of a usupous dictatorship, it will be for the simpl reason all else has failed. One thing our fight for independence taught us is NO GOVERNMENT IS EVER SO GOOD AS BEING BEYOND CORRUPTION. No government can be given carte blanche when dealing with it's people. Any governmentr, instituted of men can and will be corruptible. Our founders and the framers of our Constitution, which stands as the beacon for a successful experiment in governance, such as the world has never seen before, always cautioned against becoming too complacent with any government. Luckily, this great experiment had a hundred and fifty years of fair success, except for the debacle of the War of Brother Against Brother, and only in the last 60 or 70 years, has our government began to unwind at the seams. \n \n \n\n Well, there are other threats to your freedom of speach and right to property than the government...

Draw your own conclusions.\n \n A Framer Under every government the [last] resort of the people, is an appeal to the sword; whether to defend themselves against the open attacks of a foreign enemy, or to check the insidious encroachments of domestic foes. Whenever a people ... entrust the defence of their country to a regular, standing army, composed of mercenaries, the power of that country will remain under the direction of the most wealthy citizens. \n \n Samuel Adams The said constitution shall never be construed to authorize congress to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms. \n \n Samuel Adams If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or your arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen. \n \n And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms; or to raise standing armies, unless necessary for the defense of the United States, or of some one or more of them; or to prevent the people from petitioning, in a peaceable and orderly manner, the federal legislature, for a redress of grievances; or to subject the people to unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons, papers or possessions. \n Cesare Beccaria False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put an end to personal liberty... and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventive but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree. \n \n James Bovard  As we learned from the Clinton administration and much of the media, a machine gun in the hands of a federal agent is now a symbol of benevolence and concern for a child's well-being. \n \n William S. BurroughsAfter a shooting spree, they always want to take the guns away from the people who didn't do it. I sure as hell wouldn't want to live in a society where the only people allowed guns are the police and the military. \n \n Bill ClintonThe purpose of government is to rein in the rights of the people. \n \n When we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of individual freedom to Americans ... And so a lot of people say there's too much personal freedom. When personal freedom's being abused, you have to move to limit it. That's what we did in the announcement I made last weekend on the public housing projects, about how we're going to have weapon sweeps and more things like that to try to make people safer in their communities. \n \n We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans...\n \n Cockrum v. State The right of a citizen to bear arms, in lawful defense of himself or the State, is absolute. He does not derive it from the State government. It is one of the high powers\" delegated directly to the citizen, and `is excepted out of the general powers of government. 'A law cannot be passed to infringe upon or impair it, because it is above the law, and independent of the lawmaking power. \n \n Rev. Nicholas Collin While the people have property, arms in their hands, and only a spark of noble spirit, the most corrupt Congress must be mad to form any project of tyranny. \n \n Tench CoxeThe militia of these free commonwealths, entitled and accustomed to their arms, when compared with any possible army, must be tremendous and irresistible. Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American ... the unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people. \n \n Whereas civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as military forces, which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms. \n \n Dianne Feinstein Banning guns addresses a fundamental right of all Americans to feel safe. \n \n Mahatma Mohandas K. GandhiAmong the many misdeeds of British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. \n \n Alexander HamiltonBut if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people, while there is a large body of citizens, little if at all inferior to them in discipline and use of arms, who stand ready to defend their rights \n \n The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed. \n \n Patrick HenryThe great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able may have a gun. \n \n Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands? \n \n Hubert H. HumphreyCertainly one of the chief guarantees of freedom under any government, no matter how popular and respected, is the right of citizens to keep and bear arms.... The right of citizens to bear arms is just one guarantee against arbitrary government, one more safeguard against the tyranny which now appears remote in America but which historically has proven to be always possible. \n \n These are just a few.",

May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen. \n \n And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms; or to raise standing armies, unless necessary for the defense of the United States, or of some one or more of them; or to prevent the people from petitioning, in a peaceable and orderly manner, the federal legislature, for a redress of grievances; or to subject the people to unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons, papers or possessions. \n \n Cesare Beccaria False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put an end to personal liberty... and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventive but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree. \n \n James Bovard  As we learned from the Clinton administration and much of the media, a machine gun in the hands of a federal agent is now a symbol of benevolence and concern for a child's well-being. \n \n William S. BurroughsAfter a shooting spree, they always want to take the guns away from the people who didn't do it. I sure as hell wouldn't want to live in a society where the only people allowed guns are the police and the military. \n \n Bill ClintonThe purpose of government is to rein in the rights of the people. \n \n When we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of individual freedom to Americans ... And so a lot of people say there's too much personal freedom. When personal freedom's being abused, you have to move to limit it. That's what we did in the announcement I made last weekend on the public housing projects, about how we're going to have weapon sweeps and more things like that to try to make people safer in their communities. \n \n We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans...\n \n \n \n Cockrum v. State The right of a citizen to bear arms, in lawful defense of himself or the State, is absolute. He does not derive it from the State government. It is one of the high powers\" delegated directly to the citizen, and `is excepted out of the general powers of government. 'A law cannot be passed to infringe upon or impair it, because it is above the law, and independent of the lawmaking power. \n \n Rev. Nicholas Collin While the people have property, arms in their hands, and only a spark of noble spirit, the most corrupt Congress must be mad to form any project of tyranny. \n \n Tench CoxeThe militia of these free commonwealths, entitled and accustomed to their arms, when compared with any possible army, must be tremendous and irresistible. Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American ... the unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.\n \n Whereas civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as military forces, which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms. \n \n \n \"The right was in the context of the citizen soldier of the conscript militia. In the eighteenth century private arms were never strictly private. The public had a claim for public purposes. Coxe was a strong Federalist. He was employed in Hamilton's Treasury Department during the Whiskey Rebellion.

George Washington and Alexander Hamilton didn't agree.

   "This is funny, they attempt to refute a quote specifically by taking an article out of context. What was specifically being debated in this instance was whether or not the government was obligated to provide every person in the militia (which had been defined at the time as basically every male of fighting age) with a fire arm. ven more specific, they were debating whether the federal government was required to provide one as well as the state governments. basically, should every male in America be issued a rifle? If so, should they be issued one, or two? It was actually primarily an argument on states rights and whether or not the Federal Government had the right to appoint officers in the militai (wich is theoretically reserved for the states).\n \n The argument was that it was the responsibility of the federal government to arm the militia, but the responsibility of the states to provide for their command and control structure. IF the federal government decided to prvide for the scommand and control strucure, does that mean that it is the states responisibility to arm them? DOes this mean that everybody gets two guns? Henry was pointing out htat the point was for every man to have a rifle, and there was no point in ever man having two. HE points out that providing every man 2 rifles from the public coffers is likely to be very expensive.\n \n They ended the argumet by having neither the federal OR state governments provide the rifles. INstead, they required that every man provide his OWN rifle, shot, and powder, and that they be assembeled periodically to ensure that they posessed the required implements. This ended the debate, ensured that every man was armed, and cost the government nothing. \n \n I just spent some time looking around the web page of the Potowmack Institute, and it seems that before buying into their views on things, you would do well to look up the full text of whatever they are quoting. They do some interesting editing as far as preserving context goes.",

   "He is not qouting him out of context. What Hnery was debating in this case was whether the federal government was required to provide a weapon to every man of militia age a firearm. \n \n Thisi s wat the GG's are missing about the militia of the time. IT WAS EVERBODY, with the EXCEPTION of most government employees. The militai these gus keep referencing could not have been a national guard type unit, because by their definition, as federal employees, the national guard members would have most likely been exempt (not allowed to participate).\n \n What patrick henery was arguing in that case was whether the federal government should provide a rifle AND the state provide a rifle, or whether one was sufficient. \n \n \"The great object is that every man be armed and everyone who is able may have a gun\" - Patrick Henry\"\n \n HE was arguing that while every militia aged man in America needed a gun, there was no reason to go to extremes and issue each of them 2 guns, since you could only use one at a time anyway. HE was saying that every man needed a gun, but that they shouldn;t go overboard because providing every man with 2 guns would be too expensive.\n \n They eventually scrapped the whole idea, and just passed a federal law requiring that every man have his own rifle and a set amount of powder and shot. This is just another of those areas where those who wish to focus on the unimportant (unimportant because it was simply a justification clause following in the writing style of the time) militia section of the second ammendment come up dry. THe militia f the day wa not a military force. The Miklitia was the total numbe of men they could drag in to fight if needed. It was the private citizens who could be conscripted should the need arise.\n \n So, VOR is somewhat right. HE was talking baout the militia. Jeffersonian is also right, since the militia was every able bodied man. By referring to evry man without using the term \"militia\" is not quoting out of context. TO argue that he was only talking baout the militia, without acknowledging that the militia was composed of every man is somewhat misleading.",

   "Let me respond to the first post of this thread.\n This is from a book review on amazon.com\n I think it's a pretty good summation of many of the best arguments against the NRA theory of the second amendment.\n \n \"Although the second amendment is often used by the pro-gun lobby to justify its opposition to gun-control, no second amendment challenge to a gun control law has ever been successful in the federal court system. In fact, gun control laws have been around for over 200 years so apparently the founding fathers didn't see the second amendment as a barrier to such laws. Examples of early gun control laws are the forbidding of carrying concealed weapons and disarming anyone who would not swear loyalty to the state they lived in. The first article in a law journal advocating an individual right to bear arms was published in the 1960's. Before that, the consensus had been in law journals that such a right was exercised only in connection with a well regulated militia. Just what is the well regulated militia of the present day? Federal law and the Supreme Court have defined it as the National Guard. \n\n There was no National Guard when the Constitution was written, so how can the Supreme Court rule that the National Guard IS the militia? Our Forefather's lacked a crystal ball.\n United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542 (1876). The Supreme Court ruled that the right to keep and bear arms existed BEFORE the Constitution and wasn't dependent on the Constitution.\n Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252 (1886) The Supreme Court affirmed that the right to keep and bear arms.\n \n \n The second part of the second amendment speaks of the people. What did the founders mean when they referred to the people? Some would like to think that they meant each adult individual. However, this understanding is not consistent with the way the word is used in other parts of the constitution. In the preamble of the Constitution, the founders refer to themselves as 'We the People.' Obviously not each adult individual in America was involved in writing the Constitution. The first amendment speaks of 'the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.' The word 'assemble' lets us know that such a right is exercised by the people collectively and not by an individual person. \n\n United States v. Verdugo-Urquirdez, 110 S. Ct. 3039 (1990). This case involved the meaning of the term \"the people\" in the Fourth Amendment. The Court unanimously held that the term \"the people\" in the Second Amendment had the same meaning as in the Preamble to the Constitution and in the First, Fourth and Ninth Amendments, i.e., that \"the people\" means at least all citizens and legal aliens while in the United States. \n http://www.tsra.com/2ndamend.htm\n \n\n The term 'bear arms' usually referred military service at the time of the writing of the second amendment. This is evident from the first draft of the second amendment in which James Madison states, 'no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.' Although the pro-gun lobby likes to equate 'bearing arms' with carrying a gun, to James Madison the term meant 'to render military service.' Lastly, what arms were they founders referring to? Muskets, not machine guns, semi-automatic assault rifles nor Uzis. Obviously, using the second amendment to oppose laws regulating such weapons is highly questionably.\" \n\n Cases v United States, 131 F. 2d 916 (1st Cir. 1942), cert. Denied sub nom., Velazquez v. U.S, 319 U.S. 770 (1943). Basically, The US Curcuit Court upheld that the Second Amendment didn't apply to weapons that couldn't be carried by an individual.\n \n \n\n Also check out this thread where Lurch makes a very good case for the collective theory of the second amendment. \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=1105\n\n \n \n \"The advantage of being armed . . . the Americans possess over the people of all other nations . . . Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several Kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.\" (James Madison, author of the Bill of Rights, in his Federalist Paper No. 46.)",

   "I've never heard of A Framer is, but that quote by Samuel Adams was an amendment that Samuel Adams proposed to the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention. It was rejected by the Convention, so obviously there were many that disagreed with Adams. They were likely influenced by the recent Shay's rebellion and the chaos and disorder that armed rebels had caused during that rebellion. \n\n \n Oddly enough, the Mass constitution reads:\n \n Article XVII. The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it. \n \n So apparently they came to their senses later.\n \n \n\"The right was in the context of the citizen soldier of the conscript militia. In the eighteenth century private arms were never strictly private. The public had a claim for public purposes. Coxe was a strong Federalist. He was employed in Hamilton's Treasury Department during the Whiskey Rebellion. He expressed no concerns that the enrollment and inventory requirements of the Militia Act would infringe on right of the people to keep and bear their private arms.\"\n http://www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html#coxe\n\n \n Private guns were completely private. They were personal property and could not be seized. It was the man that carried the weapon who was required to provide service, and required to provide his own weapon. Since the enrollment and inventory requirements were specifically to ensure that every man had his own private rifle, shot, powder, kit to fight with, it would seem rather stupid to worry that it was infringing on peoples right to bear arms, wouldn't it? Contrast this with today, where registration schemes have been used in places like new york to provide lists for seizure or surrender of firearms. In the one case, you have a law that is meant to insure that everybody has a weapon, i the other, it is a law determined to limit the accessibility of weapons. You really don't see the difference here?\n \n \nSo Tench Coxe put quite a bit a faith in the power of the militia? George Washington and Alexander Hamilton didn't agree. They thought that the militia was no match for a regular army. \n \n \"Regular troops alone are equal to the exignencies of modern war, as well for defense as for offense....

The facts which, from our own experience, forbid a reliance of\n this kind, are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such a\n suggestion. The steady operations of war against a regular and\n disciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the\n same kind.\" -Alexander Hamilton\n http://federalistpapers.com/federalist25.html\n \n \n You have to look at the war these guys were familiar with. Two armies lined up on a field about 100 yards (or less) apart and fired at each other with muskets. As much as we like to think of the AMerican forces during hte revolution as geurilla fighters, the vast majority of our army was doing this idiotic line up and shoot at each other a little, then follow up with a bayonette charge thing. IT took a very diciplined (read that...all the sense trained out of them) man to stand demurely while a thousand of the enemy rushed him. From a realistic standpoint, we never would have won the Revolutionary War without the geurilla fighters harassing the british supply lines.\n \n Hamilton and Washington were both comissioned officers in the Continental Army. Their idea of war was this line up and shoot at each other thing. Others (including cox) had a fairly high opinion of the militia, recognising that the battles won by the Continental Army were as a direct result of militia action.\n \n \n\" 'Arms' in this context were military arms not the personal weapons of private individuals. The context of 'depriving of the whole nation of arms' was the refusal of the British to conscript Indians into the British Army during the First World War. Gandhi was an extreme anti-militarist. The statement is odd coming out of him, but he used the circumstance for political purposes to advance the cause of Home Rule and Independence.\"\n http://www.potowmack.org/thequotes.html#gandhi \n \n \n I don;t really know anything about british gun control in colonial india, and don't really see it's relevance, since colonial india is gone. I DO know that this had nothing to do with the British refusal to conscript indians into the British Army. This was directed at the disarming of the Indian Army under british rule. The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies).",
