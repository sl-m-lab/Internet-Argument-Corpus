Scientists who don't believe in man-made global warming cite the cooling as evidence for their case. Those who do believe in man-made warming dismiss the cooling as a blip triggered by fleeting changes in ocean currents; they predict greenhouse gases will produce rising temperatures again soon.\n Fight Over Global Warming Heats Up - WSJ.com\n \n",

There's a fine line between the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere that raises the temperature of the globe and the amount in the atmosphere that actually cools it. When it's hot, water evaporates, causing X level of evaporative cooling as it evaporates. The clouds created, initially act as an insulating blanket, holding heat IN. As clouds thicken, they start to blanket the atmosphere and PREVENT transmission of heat from the sun to the planet. And when it rains, you once again, get evaporative cooling as well as the scrubbing of CO2 out of the local atmosphere. And what is the biggest driver for moisture generation? The oceans. And right now, we don't have a clue about their temperature profiles. \n \n Add, to this complexity, the effect that plant and animal life have on the balance of CO2 in the atmosphere. As CO2 levels rise, so does the growth of most plants, since CO2 is a food source for plant life. Animal respiration, flatulence and defecation all produce CO2 and other greenhouse gases. I haven't seen an accurate modeling these effects as a system, have you?\n IMO, the science is far too weak to justify spending $Trillions for tinkering around the edges with CO2. \n \n Oh, one more point. The amount of moisure fluctuation in the atmosphere day-to-day is HUGE. One pound of air at 50% Humidity level @80F holds 0.011 pounds of water in it. @20% RH, it only holds 0.005pounds. At 90%RH, it hold 0.02pounds of water.",

The KT extinction event did not trigger an ice age.\n \n 2. We are currently in an ice age, which began about 2.58 million years ago. It is commonly called the quaternary glaciation. This current ice age has seen approximately 80 glacial cycles. We are curently in an interglacial period, meaning the ice has retreated (not millions of years ago, more like 12k years ago). It is likely that we will experience more cycles of glaciation.\n \n 3. The Great Lakes (as well as many others) were formed due to the retreat of these glaciers. The last retreat began approximately 12000 years ago, marking the begining of the Holocene period. This is about the time (or 1-2k years after) that the clovis culture first migrated to and inhabited the North American Continent. It is highly unprobable that they had anything to do with our transition to an interglacial period. \n \n 4. Being that the earlist Hominids were around approximately 6-7 million years ago, they existed ~4 million years before the current ice age began. If you want to further narrow it down, the first Homo species (Homo habilis) appeared about 2.2 million years ago, shorlty after the start of the quaternary glaciation. Our species (Homo sapiens sapiens) appeared about 200k years ago, meaning we first appeared between the middle to end of an interglacial about 200-180k years ago. We lived through another interglacial about 120k years ago, and are currently in the interglacial that began about 12k years ago. \n \n 5.

The evidence points to deforestation at the foothills which has depleted the contribution of humidity which was carried up the slopes on the wind. \n Nature Study Debunks Kilimanjaro Glacier Myth - by James M. Taylor - Environment & Climate News\n Nature Study Debunks Kilimanjaro Glacier Myth\n \n Environment & Climate News < February 2004\n Written By: James M. Taylor\n Published In: Environment & Climate News < February 2004\n Publication date: 02/01/2004\n Publisher: The Heartland Institute\n \n \"The icecap atop Mount Kilimanjaro,\" reported a 2001 New York Times article, \"which for thousands of years has floated like a cool beacon over the shimmering equatorial plain of Tanzania, is retreating at such a pace that it will disappear in less than 15 years, according to new studies.\" The article created a media sensation with its alarmist claim and with its emphasis that global warming was surely to blame.\n \n In truly poetic language, the Times reported, \"The vanishing of the seemingly perpetual snows of Kilimanjaro that inspired Ernest Hemingway, echoed by similar trends on icecapped peaks from Peru to Tibet, is one of the clearest signs that a global warming in the last 50 years appears to have exceeded typical climate shifts.\"\n \n Global warming, however, is not to blame for the retreating Kilimanjaro ice cap, according to a November 24, 2003, article published in Nature magazine.\n \n \n Deforestation \"More Likely Culprit\"\n \n According to Nature's Betsy Mason, \"Although it's tempting to blame the (Kilimanjaro) ice loss on global warming, researchers think that deforestation of the mountain's foothills is the more likely culprit.\"\n \n Forests at the base of Kilimanjaro have been steadily disappearing for decades. \"Without the forests' humidity,\" Mason reports, \"previously moisture-laden winds blew dry. No longer replenished with water, the ice is evaporating in the strong equatorial sunshine.\"\n \n \"Why has [the Kilimanjaro ice cap] been melting so relentlessly?\" asked climatologist John Daly. \"The greenhouse industry say 'global warming,' but then they would say that, wouldn't they?\n \n \"The only problem with that knee-jerk explanation is that there has been no measurable atmospheric warming in the region of Kilimanjaro,\" noted Daly. \"Satellites have been measuring temperature since 1979 in the free troposphere between 1,000 and 8,000 meters altitude, and they show no tropospheric warming in that area. None.\"\n \n According to Daly, human-induced global warming should not have been named the primary culprit, even before a connection to deforestation was made.\n \n Said Daly, \"Kilimanjaro is above most of the weather and is thus exposed to the equatorial sun, a sun that has been hotter during the twentieth century than at any time since the medieval period. That would be a sufficient explanation in itself for the depletion of the ice cap.\"\n \n \"The advance/buildup or retreat/melting of glacial ice is often interpreted as a sign of climate change,\" reports the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change (CO2 Science). \"Climate alarmists have already rendered their verdict: There has been a massive and widespread retreat of glaciers over the past century, which they predict will only intensify under continued CO2-induced global warming. This assessment, however, may be a bit premature.\"\n \n According to the Center, \"Following the peak of Little Ice Age coldness, it should come as no surprise that many records indicate widespread glacial retreat, as temperatures began to rise in the mid- to late-1800s and many glaciers returned to positions characteristic of pre-Little Ice Age times.\n \n \n Some Glaciers Shrinking, Others Growing\n \n \"What people may find surprising, however, is that in many instances the rate of glacier retreat has not increased over the past 70 years; and in some cases glacier mass balance has actually increased, all during a time when the atmosphere experienced the bulk of the increase in its CO2 content.\"\n \n A study published in Progress in Physical Geography (Braithwaite, R.J., 26: 76-95 (2002)), analyzed mass balance measurements of 246 glaciers from around the world between 1946 and 1995. According to the study's author, \"there are several regions with highly negative mass balances in agreement with a public perception of 'the glaciers are melting,' but there are also regions with positive balances.\"\n \n Within Europe, for example, \"Alpine glaciers are generally shrinking, Scandinavian glaciers are growing, and glaciers in the Caucasus are close to equilibrium for 1980-95,\" according to Braithwaite. Significantly, regarding this most recent 15-year period of time, Braithwaite noted \"there is no obvious common or global trend of increasing glacier melt in recent years.\"\n \n Daly predicts that because of mountain base deforestation, and all other things being equal, \"What happens on Kilimanjaro will also be happening on countless mountains all over the world where forests on lower slopes have been replaced by open pasture.\n \n \"Blaming it all on 'global warming' was just too glib and convenient for an industry desperate to convince a skeptical public that the end of the world was nigh,\" said Daly. \"With a more down-to-earth cause like this identified, other 'global-warming-did-it' phenomena should be looked at again for simple local causes like this.\"\n \n \n \"Not a Thermometer\"\n \n \"The Kilimanjaro ice cap is not a thermometer,\" said S. Fred Singer, professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and president of the nonprofit Science & Environmental Policy Project in Arlington, Virginia. \"It may well be melting, but this is simply a delayed consequence of a natural climate warming during the early part of the twentieth century. Moreover, it will continue to melt as long as the climate doesn't return to the temperatures of the Little Ice Age of past centuries.\"\n \n Added Singer, \"The National Academy of Sciences published a report (in 2000) that defines the geographic regions of warming and cooling during the last 20 years. Surface measurements of East Africa show no warming trend. Weather satellites show a pronounced cooling trend of the atmosphere there. No one has questioned these data.\"\n \n \"One of the endlessly fascinating aspects of modern journalism is the absolute lack of critical insight tendered towards environmental scares,\" said Pat Michaels, research professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a past president of the American Association of State Climatologists. \"A cursory inspection of (Kilimanjaro) data shows that Kilimanjaro's glaciers would be dying even if Homo sapiens were still just hanging around the trees of the Rift Valley, a few hundred miles to the West.\n \n \"From 1953 through 1976, 21 percent of the original (ice cap) area was uncovered. This was during a period of global cooling--yes, cooling--of 0.13\u00ba F,\" said Michaels. \"Around Kilimanjaro, satellite data show a cooling of 0.40\u00ba F since 1979 Still, Kilimanjaro's glaciers continued to shrink.\"\n \n Added Michaels, \"Kilimanjaro turns out to be just another snow job, precipitated by a journalistic community that has lost its desire for critical factual investigation when it comes to our globe's environment.\"\n \n James M.

CLOR has a \"Special Liaison\" relationship with the US National Council on Radiological Protection and Measurements (NCRP). In the past, for about ten years, CLOR closely cooperated with the US Environmental Protection Agency, in research on the influence of industry and nuclear explosions on pollution of the global environment and population. I published about 280 scientific papers, among them about 20 on climatic problems. I am the representative of Poland in the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), and in 1980-1982 I was the chairman of this Committee. \n \n .....\n The data from shallow ice cores, such as those from Siple, Antarctica[5, 6], are widely used as a proof of man-made increase of CO2 content in the global atmosphere, notably by IPCC[7]. These data show a clear inverse correlation between the decreasing CO2 concentrations, and the load-pressure increasing with depth (Figure 1 A) . The problem with Siple data (and with other shallow cores) is that the CO2 concentration found in pre-industrial ice from a depth of 68 meters (i.e. above the depth of clathrate formation) was \"too high\". This ice was deposited in 1890 AD, and the CO2 concentration was 328 ppmv, not about 290 ppmv, as needed by man-made warming hypothesis. The CO2 atmospheric concentration of about 328 ppmv was measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii as later as in 1973[8], i.e. 83 years after the ice was deposited at Siple. \n \n An ad hoc assumption, not supported by any factual evidence[3, 9], solved the problem: the average age of air was arbitrary decreed to be exactly 83 years younger than the ice in which it was trapped. The \"corrected\" ice data were then smoothly aligned with the Mauna Loa record (Figure 1 B) , and reproduced in countless publications as a famous \"Siple curve\". Only thirteen years later, in 1993, glaciologists attempted to prove experimentally the \"age assumption\"[10], but they failed[9]. \n \n The notion of low pre-industrial CO2 atmospheric level, based on such poor knowledge, became a widely accepted Holy Grail of climate warming models. The modelers ignored the evidence from direct measurements of CO2 in atmospheric air indicating that in 19th century its average concentration was 335 ppmv[11] (Figure 2) . In Figure 2 encircled values show a biased selection of data used to demonstrate that in 19th century atmosphere the CO2 level was 292 ppmv[12]. A study of stomatal frequency in fossil leaves from Holocene lake deposits in Denmark, showing that 9400 years ago CO2 atmospheric level was 333 ppmv, and 9600 years ago 348 ppmv, falsify the concept of stabilized and low CO2 air concentration until the advent of industrial revolution [13]. \n \n Improper manipulation of data, and arbitrary rejection of readings that do not fit the pre-conceived idea on man-made global warming is common in many glaciological studies of greenhouse gases. In peer reviewed publications I exposed this misuse of science [3, 9]. Unfortunately, such misuse is not limited to individual publications, but also appears in documents of national and international organizations. For example IPCC not only based its reports on a falsified \"Siple curve\", but also in its 2001 report[14] used as a flagship the \"hockey curve\" of temperature, showing that there was no Medieval Warming, and no Little Ice Age, and that the 20th century was unusually warm. The curve was credulously accepted after Mann et al. paper published in NATURE magazine[15]. In a crushing criticism, two independent groups of scientists from disciplines other than climatology [16, 17] (i.e. not supported from the annual pool of many billion \"climatic\" dollars), convincingly blamed the Mann et al. paper for the improper manipulation and arbitrary rejections of data. The question arises, how such methodically poor paper, contradicting hundreds of excellent studies that demonstrated existence of global range Medieval Warming and Little Ice Age, could pass peer review for NATURE? And how could it pass the reviewing process at the IPCC? The apparent scientific weaknesses of IPCC and its lack of impartiality, was diagnosed and criticized in the early 1990s in NATURE editorials [18, 19]. The disease, seems to be persistent. \n \n Conclusion \n \n The basis of most of the IPCC conclusions on anthropogenic causes and on projections of climatic change is the assumption of low level of CO2 in the pre-industrial atmosphere. This assumption, based on glaciological studies, is false. Therefore IPCC projections should not be used for national and global economic planning. The climatically inefficient and economically disastrous Kyoto Protocol, based on IPCC projections, was correctly defined by President George W. Bush as \"fatally flawed\". This criticism was recently followed by the President of Russia Vladimir V. Putin. I hope that their rational views might save the world from enormous damage that could be induced by implementing recommendations based on distorted science. \n Zbigniew Jaworowski on CO2 measurements \n\n \n And speaking of radiative forcing:\n NOAA/ESRL Global Monitoring Division - THE NOAA ANNUAL GREENHOUSE GAS INDEX (AGGI)[/QUOTE]\n \n Did you notice the careful crafting of the language? It stated that CO2 was responsible for 63% of the increase. That means that CO2 is responsible for <1degreeC of warming while they roll the dice on what the water vapor is doing to contribute to the rest of the greenhouse effect. IMO, if your model can't predict 95% of the greenhouse effect, it is meaningless. Assuming that 95% of the effect is held constant throughout time is a pipedream. \n Add to that a questionable determination on pre-industrialization CO2 levels and you have a massive redistribution of wealth program with no scientific, but great political, value.",

Here's a list of 31,478 American scientists that disagree with the \"consensus\"\n Global Warming Petition Project\n \n From that site:\n \n\n Why is the Petition Project necessary?\n \n In December 1997, then U. S. Vice-President Al Gore participated in a meeting in Kyoto, Japan during which he signed a treaty to ration world energy production based upon fear of human-caused global warming. This treaty was not, however, presented to the United States Senate for ratification.\n \n Since before that Kyoto meeting and continuing to the present day, Mr. Gore and his supporters at the United Nations and elsewhere have claimed that the \"science is settled\" - that an overwhelming \"consensus\" of scientists agrees with the hypothesis of human-caused global warming, with only a handful of skeptical scientists in disagreement.\n \n Moreover, for more than 10 years these proponents of world energy rationing have consistently argued that, in view of this claimed scientific \"consensus,\" no further discussion of the science involved in this issue is warranted before legislative action is taken to heavily tax, regulate, and ration hydrocarbon energy.\n \n Since, however, these claims were not successful in convincing the United States government to initiate energy rationing, the United Nations has held a series of international meetings attended by a central group of about 600 scientists, some additional scientists outside of this group, and a large number of political and bureaucratic representatives - approximately 2,000 in all. The United Nations has also hosted larger meetings, including many non-scientist participants from environmental, business, and political organizations.\n \n During and after each of these meetings, there have been further publicity campaigns claiming that the \"science is settled\" - that the \"consensus\" of scientists in favor of the hypothesis of human-caused global warming is so overwhelming that further examination of the science is unnecessary.\n \n Realizing, from discussions with their scientific colleagues, that this claimed \"consensus\" does not exist, a group of scientists initiated the Petition Project in early 1998. Thousands of signatures were gathered in a campaign during 1998-1999. Between 1999 and 2007, the list of petition signatories grew gradually, without a special campaign. Between October 2007 and March 2008, a new campaign for signatures was initiated. The majority of the current listed signatories signed or re-signed the petition after October 2007. The original review article that accompanied the petition effort in 1998-1999 was replaced in October 2007 with a new review incorporating the research literature up to that date.\n \n The renewed petition campaign in 2007 was prompted by an escalation of the claims of \"consensus,\" release of the movie \"An Inconvenient Truth\" by Mr. Al Gore, and related events. Mr. Gore's movie, asserting a \"consensus\" and \"settled science\" in agreement about human-caused global warming, conveyed the claims about human-caused global warming to ordinary movie goers and to public school children, to whom the film was widely distributed. Unfortunately, Mr. Gore's movie contains many very serious incorrect claims, which no informed, honest scientist could endorse. \n \n The campaign to severely ration hydrocarbon energy technology has now been markedly expanded. In the course of this campaign, many scientifically invalid claims about impending climate emergencies are being made. Simultaneously, proposed political actions to severely reduce hydrocarbon use now threaten the prosperity of Americans and the very existence of hundreds of millions of people in poorer countries.\n \n As Professor Seitz states, in his Petition Project letter which speaks of this impending threat to all humanity, \"It is especially important for America to hear from its citizens who have the training necessary to evaluate the relevant data and offer sound advice.\"\n \n The Petition Project is a means by which those citizens are offering that advice.\n \n",

In other words, bias is generally seen as a 'one-sided' perspective. The term biased refers to a person or group who is judged to exhibit bias. It is used to describe an attitude, judgment, or behavior that is influenced by a prejudice. Bias can be unconscious or conscious in awareness. Having a bias is part of a normal development.

   "The cult of global warming is a cult built around some scientific evidence.\n Why did you not address the hysterical ad?\n Do you not want a sensible and measured discourse about global warming from our governments or not?\n\n \n \n \n Asked how he reconciles that realization with the wonkish content of the book, Gore at first seems stymied. But then, when I prompt him, he points to pages on the spiritual dimension of climate change, the idea that God gave man stewardship over the earth, and that preserving it for future generations is a sacred obligation. Then he opens his laptop to show a commercial by his Alliance for Climate Protection, in which the Revs. Al Sharpton and Pat Robertson make an odd-couple plea for \"taking care of the planet.\" Gore allows that he's been tailoring the slide-show training he gives to faith-based volunteer groups. \"I've done a Christian [-based] training program; I have a Muslim training program and a Jewish training program coming up, also a Hindu program coming up. I trained 200 Christian ministers and lay leaders here in Nashville in a version of the slide show that is filled with scriptural references. It's probably my favorite version, but I don't use it very often because it can come off as proselytizing.\"\n \n http://www.newsweek.com/id/220552/page/2\n \n \n Ladies and gentlemen the cult of global warming",

   "Thank you for volunteering me Archie. It's certainly not your place to do so, but hey...would I expect less?\n \n I pretty much consider what we have been doing here as debate. I have never and will never engage in a \"formal\" debate, as I really see no need. I post here for fun, to educate myself (and others on occasion), and to learn about different points of view. You can ask me any questions here that you can in a formal debate. I don't consider this to be a contest, merely a chance to present and defend points of view. As long as 2 people honestly believe what they are saying, there are no winners or losers. \n \n And just to be clear:\n \n 1. I do believe what I have posted. Why do I believe it? Because I have taken the time to read, research, and educate myself. Believe it or not I used to think \"global warming\" was a bunch of hoodoo, until I took the time to actually learn about it. It is up to each person to examine the evidence and decide for themselves. If you take a position without fairly considering all of the evidence, you are only cheating yourself. \n \n 2. You cannot prove that I am full of doodoo, just as I cannot prove that you are full of doodoo. You may believe that I am wrong, and I may believe that you are wrong, but in the end, neither of us can prove it. I'm not here to prove anything. If you can prove that global warming is false, I will be the first to admit I was wrong. Good luck. \n \n 3. I don't run around here saying that the sky is falling. I am not paranoid about global warming in any way, shape, or form. I don't believe that global warming is going to effect me during my lifetime in a significant way. \n \n 4. I believe that humans will eventually be gone from the earth, whether by our own actions or some sort of catastrophic natural disaster. The earth will heal itself, and life will go on. I however do not believe that this in any way means that we should not be good stewards of the earth while we are here.\n\n \n I respect your position. Formal debates aren't for everyone and this one has been far more civil than most free-for-alls.\n As you probably have guessed, AGW is an issue that I have done my research on and have found the populist opinion to be nothing more than Chicken Littleism. There is no scientific consensus and its major proponent, the IPCC, is one of the most corrupt pseudo-scienticic organizations in the world.\n If you do nothing else WRT this topic, read how the IPCC functions, how its reports are generated, etc., It is a politically-, not scientific-driven organization.",

DONE. \n\n \n I thought that we had both put that to rest and therefore I have no idea what you are talking about. If you are confused or suspicious about something I've said about you or to you.

And again, you have quoted nothing \"in context\" that you can base this assertion upon. Unlike a lot of other posters on these forums, I am diligent in staying on topic. I take pride in my ability to do so. And I promise you that whenever I make comparisons, analogies and the like it is NEVER to change the subject or to divert anyone's attention in any way. \n \n You may not like or appreciate my style, logic, methods or sense of humor... That's fine. But you are wrong if you think I am here for anything other than a focused debate on the issues and to see that my own opinions have a fair consideration along with the ideas of others.\n \n \n Objective responses, humor, anything that pertains to the topic is welcome, but turning a civil debate into one about over all ideals and personalities is not productive. That's why I suggested a formal debate, void of the emotionalism that is being engendered in this thread. \n\n \n And in case you missed it, I stated that I BENEFIT from your debates as many of your facts have helped to re-enforce some of my own observations.\n \n \n Defend your view with supporting facts, not Molotov cocktails. emoticon_xhoho\n\n \n Subjective and emotive. \n \n You seem to have an axe to grind with me and I no longer have one with you. But I won't sit quietly and be accused of anything I haven't done.\n \n If you have a specific quote you want clarification about,... let's have it.",

But it was not an \"attempt to lable.\" And here's the logic. \n \n 1: Typically, the global warming crowd is composed of left leaning, tree hugging, carbon aware anti-capitalism, anti-religion, tree hugging baby billing flag burning, gun grabber, gay marriage, recreational druggies.... right?\n \n Not all of them,.... but enough to make the generalization.\n \n That would be \"one side of the isle.\"\n \n 2: One the other side of the isle we have the right. Pro-life, pro-gun, protect the flag, Prayer in school, school choice, eat meat, don't buy that global warming XXXX because it's more about grabbing your wallet than it is saving a snail darter so we can feel better about our stewardship.\n \n Now, is Snakespit actually pre-emptive when it comes to war (be it in defense of the environment or in defense of a nation?)... It appears he is.\n \n But that doesn't take away from the point that I was trying to make.... That \"typically\" those on his side of the isle even when narrowed down to only THIS issue.... would oppose Bush and his- preemptive strikes.... even as they demand that we act preemptively against \"man made warming\" that is NOT based upon any more reliable information than Bush had.\n \n \nThank you, but I'm not looking to be stroked. I would prefer that we stay on topic and not get into personalities, if possible. \n\n \n I was not stroking your ego. I was merely making the point to Snakespit that his having further debate with you likely only further strengthen my own position.\n \n \n And stop being so darned defensive! I wasn't attacking you.
