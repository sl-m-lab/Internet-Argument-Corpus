Can we all say hypocrites?\n\n \n So why do you keep trying to interfere in 2A, 14A rights and why does a \"gun dealer\" even need a license to exercise a right?\n \n As for doctors, (btw, you still seeing your pediatrician :) ? ), we all know that medical records are intended to be fiat ordered and open to review of any and all of government or the medical field. Pretending that guns are a pandemic which has been disproven so many times it hurts, and collecting information on mere children and forcing them to testify against their parents is stuff Hitler, Mussolini and other tyrants would love.\n \n You got your brownshirts (ATF) SELLING OR APPROVING sales to known gun trafficers and NARCO THUGS just to drive up the pretense of illegal sales by dealers and lay the blame on citizens exercising their rights. So, you support TWO WRONGS for the price of one.\n \n Why did Helmke quit your mommie's anti constitutional .org? Did he finally see the light?...or did you just run out of money and decided to keep Henigan?\n \n Tell me more about the criminal acts perpetrated by the ATF'S fast and furious scheme to arm known foreign criminals to try to get more money to attack gun owners by breaking the law themselves and lay the blame at the feet of the Constitution.",
