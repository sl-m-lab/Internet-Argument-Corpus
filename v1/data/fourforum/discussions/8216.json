   "Yes indeedy!\n \n I can't believe I didn't start this thread myself. The greatest sporting event in the world is once more upon us and my exams are over and I'm gonna be sitting around in the bars of Brighton watching every game I can.\n \n We should keep bouncing this thread to the top so that the Americans can learn something about this awesome competition which is watched by over2 billion people around the world! \n \n And the USA got to the quarter finals last time...\n \n But they've already been thrashed 3-0 by Czech Republic so there you go...\n \n Anyway, having watched tonight's Brazil-Croatia game I've gotta say it doesn't look like it's in the bag for Brazil yet. I know it's only the first game and maybe they were holding back, but they had quite a few chances and mucked them all up but one. If that had been the 2002 squad it would have been about 6-0. They looked tired and uninterested, Ronaldo especially.\n \n England were appalling against Paraguay, don't know why given our pre-comp friendly results. I know Paraguay are a little better than Jamaica but they played pretty shoddily and we only beat them 1-0. And what in God's name is up with Ericsson taking Owen off and brining bloody Hargreaves on? I am praying that he's not going back to the old \"Get one goal, then defend, defend, defend\" strategy because we won't get past the second round, with or without Rooney.\n \n Italy, Argentina and Germany are always contenders, Germany especially as they are on home territory, but conceding two goals to Costa Rica isn't a great start even though they won. The others both won their opening matches pretty easily.\n \n France look as bad, if not worse than they did last time. Switzerland are hardly a major football power and Les Bleus just couldn't get past them! There were a couple of good balls into the Swiss area where I swear I saw blue shirts just standing around and every time Henry was left out on his own, twenty or thirty yards ahead of everyone else and of course could not keep the ball.\n \n Other than former champions, both Mexico and South Korea look like they can cause some trouble as usual, and of course there is always Spain. Spain, Spain, Spain. They always look so good but never quite make it.\n \n My main hope was for a USA vs Iran game (!) but the only way it can realistically happen given the groups is in the final, which I just can't see happening somehow.\n \n \nI would hate it if they won it this year, we would have to put up with it for another 40 years.\n\n \n But can you imagine how insane the party will be? It'll go on for weeks! \n \n It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming.....",

Argentina had some problems with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and I wished to see a Remis... and Germany, well, if their problems in their defence continue, they can have as many Ballacks as they want, but they'll have no chance against Argentina, Italy, Spain, Brazil or the Netherlands...",
