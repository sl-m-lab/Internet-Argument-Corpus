   "Dates have different meanings to different people and also at different times. For instance the 11th of September to Americans means the terrorist attack in New York City, an attack they euphimistically called 9/11 . Americans also like to shorten words using just letters such as VCR for video cassette recorder, where Australians and Poms use diminutives such as 'telly\" to denote a television set, which the Americans call a \"TV\".\n \n But going back to dates for me the 11th of September is the 11th of September 1973, when Salvador Allende was deposed and the incipient Marxist revolution ended for good. \n \n Another example is the 9th of November to Germans.\n November 9 is a key date in Germany's chequered 20th century history. It isn't just the 20th anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall. On this day in 1938, Nazi Germany launched a pogrom against its Jewish population in which more than 1,300 people died. SPIEGEL ONLINE looks at three events that occurred on this fateful date before 1989.\n Two other historical events fell on that date in 1918 and 1923 respectively -- the German Revolution that removed the monarchy, and a failed coup attempt by Adolf Hitler in 1923 known as the Beer Hall Putsch.\n \n \n A Fateful Date: November 9 Marks Highs and Lows in German History - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International\n \n \n German magazines such as Der Spiegel are quality magazines",

   "Charles Birch started out as an agricultural scientist, switched to biology and ecology and soon confronted questions that were to occupy him for the rest of his life: where humankind was really going, preoccupied as it was with its its eternal conflicts and relentless pursuit of wealth. The world could not sustain this forever and he believed progress could only be made when spiritual values were married to the empirical world he probed as a scientist.\n \n These were fundamental questions, he believed, which had to be asked in a century which saw 2 billion people on the planet and 6 billion, and counting, at the end of it, where resources obviously were finite, the global ecology was being rapidly depleted and the harmony that Christianity preached appeared further from reach than ever.\n \n A man of science and religion",

   "Since the mushroom cloud rose over Hiroshima in 1945, nuclear weapons have been the fearsome symbol of U.S. military might.\n \n But President Barack Obama's Nuclear Posture Review, tabled Tuesday, has shifted the military centre of gravity away from nuclear weapons, while retaining the hard core of nuclear capability that conservatives demand and anti-nuclear campaigners decry.\n \n And it sets a tone of 21st century realism ahead of a Prague summit aimed at closing another chapter of the Cold War, as Obama signs a major arms-reduction agreement with Russia on Thursday. \n \n That will be followed by a 47-country Washington summit that focuses on nuclear security in an age of terrorism, when \"loose nukes,\" backyard bombs and viral atomic manuals are riskier than a fatal feud between nuclear weapons states.\n \n \"We are taking specific and concrete steps to reduce the role of nuclear weapons, while preserving our military superiority, deterring aggression and safeguarding the security of the American people,\" Obama told reporters at the White House.\n \n The policy - for the first time - makes it clear that atomic weapons would not be used against non-nuclear states that comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, even if they launched a chemical or biological attack on the U.S. And it maintains that nukes are defensive weapons of last resort.\n \n But the outliers are Iran and North Korea, still potential nuclear targets because they haven't followed the treaty's guidelines, including inspections of their nuclear sites and clear reporting of their nuclear activities.\n \n \"If you're not going to play by the rules ... then all options are on the table in terms of how we deal with you,\" warned Defence Secretary Robert Gates.\n \n The policy paper also pointed a finger at Beijing's military buildup, which includes nuclear weapons.\n \n It was part of a set of wide-ranging policy objectives, aiming to cut the number of nuclear weapons systems worldwide, eliminate the prospect of testing to develop new generations of nukes, clamp down on production of weapons-grade nuclear materials, and tighten rules preventing the spread of nuclear arms and materials.\n \n In Washington, the months-long review drew both praise and blame, following Obama's landmark speech in Prague last April that declared the U.S. has a \"moral responsibility\" to lead a worldwide effort to rid the planet of nuclear weapons. The speech galvanized the anti-nuclear movement and put Obama on the path to the Nobel Peace Prize.\n \n \"The review is a big step in the right direction,\" said Joseph Cirincione, a veteran arms control campaigner and president of the Ploughshares Fund in Washington. \"It takes us from Cold War policies of massive retaliation, to a new era, and lays out a clear road map on how we get to a world with fewer nuclear weapons - and eventually eliminate them.\"\n \n And, he added, a triumph of the policy was to get Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff behind an effort to ratify a test-ban treaty making the development of new nuclear weapons virtually impossible.\n \n \"It's a 180-degree turn,\" he said.\n \n But Obama has also disillusioned some anti-nuclear advocates with a boost in the budget for maintaining the U.S. nuclear stockpile by $5 billion over the next five years.\n \n \"It's one of the largest increases in warhead spending history,\" says Greg Mello, who heads the Los Alamos Study Group in New Mexico. \"It's a question of credibility for Obama. He may talk about a world without nuclear weapons but so far there is no material basis for it in the real world.\"\n \n The success or failure of Obama's nuclear policy will depend on Congress's support and the negotiation of ongoing treaties to downsize the U.S. and Russian arsenals, which contain up to 90 per cent of the world's atomic weapons. \n \n The upcoming Prague treaty would cut the strategic nuclear warheads on each size to 1,550 from the 2,200 agreed by the previous treaty. Obama wants to follow it with others that make deeper cuts.\n \n \"That's where the real substance lies,\" said Trevor Findlay, who directs the Canadian Centre for Treaty Compliance at Carleton University. \"Declarations are only helpful first steps, and they may be reversible. But no one has ever reversed deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals.\"\n \n Obama limits nuclear weapons use - thestar.com",
