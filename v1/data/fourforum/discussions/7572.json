If a woman becomes pregnant for whatever reason the choice of abortion should be hers, and hers alone, just as is tubal ligation. \n \n I can't imagine why anyone would object to providing sonograms to those pregnant women desiring it, but forcing a sonogram on any woman without choice as a standard medical procedure is tyrannical. Why even bother offering it to a woman who has made the decision, for whatever reason, to abort? Abortion clinics are similar to fast food franchises, in/out with a minimum of fuss to lessen emotional strain. Why complicate that decision? If a woman is carrying a pregnancy to term, if desired two sonograms are standard procedure even under state Medicaid programs for those who have no funds.",

They have it pretty easy to understand, the US charts are complicated and I can't find XXXX.\n \n Look at this link:\n http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ab-ukenglandwales.html\n \n Since making it legal there, abortion has increased 160,000, that's like a increase of 800%, has your UK population increased 800% since 1968?\n \n Look at that chart and it speaks volume. I went to another website and I couldn't see the financial status of women, but the majority are between 20 and 24, which is young.\n \n I don't understand, prevention is so easy, but yet so many of our \"sisters\" find themselves in this predictament more than ever. I'm not casting any judgment I just want women to really feel empowered and for most young women who do get pregnant, and this is my opinion only, I feel, abortion is the only option they feel they have, because raising a child as a single mother, first of all has a stigma, then being strapped to raise a child on her own, is equally devastating. Her future will look bleek because her career will be limited to her education, her future spouse will be limited to those who want an already-made family. So knowing very well she can't change the \"system\", she choses an option the \"system\" gave her, her ONLY option if she wants a better future and that is to take the option of abortion and start over.\n \n Women need to demand a better \"system\". We need better laws providing for financial support from the father of the child. We need the corporate companies and universities we attend to offer free or low-cost daycares and more of them, we need more universities to have better hours, day, evenings, and weekends, where women can pursue and finish any type of degree she wishes.\n \n No where in this world is it easy raising a family. Having a baby doesn't limit a womans career ambitions, traveling ambitions, or educational goals, its the network set up in our society that limits a woman with a child.\n \n Women need to DEMAND more, they deserve it. They don't deserve to kill their own flesh and blood.\n \n Women have been treated unequally in this world and in this world TODAY, our countries, yours and mine, deal with other countries that suppress women, torture women, kill women, consider women property, and being that the US is about 50% women we should be appauled to do business with these countries. If slavery was going on in a differnt country, our country wouldn't do business there, the UN wouldn't tolerate it, but yet women are still being killed and harmed and that's OKAY????\n \n Women, killing our own babies for a decision we made is not liberating us, it is not making us stronger, in fact, its making our sisterhood weaker and divided. \n \n I only want the best for women, I want women to rule half the world, being that they make up half of the population. I want half of the seats in the UN to be occupied by women, I want half of the seats on the US Supreme Court to be women, I want 25 women governors in the US. \n \n We have a long ways to go, Women will not be treated equally to men until she is equally represented in all branches of government. \n \n Okay, now you all can tear me apart because thats the nature of the beast.",

Second, How does a sonogram help to make an informed choice? What does a sonogram actually inform a pregnant woman about...that she is pregnant? I would think that if she was going to get a sonogram, that she would know that she is already pregnant. Seems like simple logic to me. \n \n By saying it would help them make a better choice, don't you really mean to say that it might influence them to not have an abortion, which is actually your choice for them?

The first trimester, where most abortions occur, most women believe and told its a \"clump of cells\" are told that phase is insignificant and no formation or anything has occured.\n \n I try to keep an open mind and I try to search the internet for credible places to see the actual development, and as a pro-lifer I refuse to believe some of the photos out there, so if I have doubts, could you imagine what a pro-choicer would think. More importantly what would a woman with an unwanted pregnancy think, she would be a skeptic too of photos, thinking it may be from a religious group or other party with an agenda to lie. Why won't planned parentood, and other clinics have detailed brochures, professionally designed, no gore, no blood, just accurate, actual photos of the baby's stages of development???? Why? Women who are pro-choice, believe in organizations like Planned Parenthood, I don't have anything against planned parenthood, they do many great things, but if they really care about the WOMAN, give her knowledge of what her actual pregnancy stage is. That's empowering!!!!\n \n So here are two links, the first one will raise skepticism but I placed the 2nd link from the museum. \n \n Why can't we have a detailed brochure, with actual photos, showing the developmental stages. \n \n No, I'm not suggesting to place photos of the baby so the mother can fall in love like in the example of your puppies.

   " I don't understand, prevention is so easy, but yet so many of our \"sisters\" find themselves in this predictament more than ever. I'm not casting any judgment I just want women to really feel empowered and for most young women who do get pregnant, and this is my opinion only, I feel, abortion is the only option they feel they have, because raising a child as a single mother, first of all has a stigma, then being strapped to raise a child on her own, is equally devastating. Her future will look bleek because her career will be limited to her education, her future spouse will be limited to those who want an already-made family. So knowing very well she can't change the \"system\", she choses an option the \"system\" gave her, her ONLY option if she wants a better future and that is to take the option of abortion and start over.\n \n Women need to demand a better \"system\". We need better laws providing for financial support from the father of the child. We need the corporate companies and universities we attend to offer free or low-cost daycares and more of them, we need more universities to have better hours, day, evenings, and weekends, where women can pursue and finish any type of degree she wishes.\n \n No where in this world is it easy raising a family. Having a baby doesn't limit a womans career ambitions, traveling ambitions, or educational goals, its the network set up in our society that limits a woman with a child.\n \n Women need to DEMAND more, they deserve it. They don't deserve to kill their own flesh and blood.\n \n Women have been treated unequally in this world and in this world TODAY, our countries, yours and mine, deal with other countries that suppress women, torture women, kill women, consider women property, and being that the US is about 50% women we should be appauled to do business with these countries. If slavery was going on in a differnt country, our country wouldn't do business there, the UN wouldn't tolerate it, but yet women are still being killed and harmed and that's OKAY????\n \n Women, killing our own babies for a decision we made is not liberating us, it is not making us stronger, in fact, its making our sisterhood weaker and divided. \n \n I only want the best for women, I want women to rule half the world, being that they make up half of the population. I want half of the seats in the UN to be occupied by women, I want half of the seats on the US Supreme Court to be women, I want 25 women governors in the US. \n \n We have a long ways to go, Women will not be treated equally to men until she is equally represented in all branches of government. \n \n Okay, now you all can tear me apart because thats the nature of the beast.\n\n \n Wow!

If the unborn is not a human then what is the unborn and since when does something go from nonhuman to human?\n\n One argument (and the one that I guess I most subscribe to) would be that when the fetus is capable of survival outside of the womb, then abortion absolutely should not happen, since the child could be just as easily removed from the mother and life continued.

   "Caprii, do you think it would seriously matter to a woman who wanted an abortion what the development looked like? Do you think that a woman seeking out an abortion has done so without serious thought, going through some mental anguish? Do you think she has not already visualized a child, a baby, a grown adult? Do you think she walks into an abortion clinic light of heart, looking forward to the day's activities? Do you think has not considered the weight of her decision? Do you think she doesn't think about the post-abortion effects? The \"could of's\"? The \"would of's\"? And even after all that fanciful thought, she has still decided the best thing for her is to have an abortion.\n \n Do you think that she needs to see a fetus in development to make the best decision? Why does it matter? I honestly don't understand your point. \n \n Out of curiousity, you said \"Let HER be the judge\". So if you get this decision, these correct pamplets with accurate photos, descriptors, etc. shown to women, would you then let her be the judge? \n \n We agree! We agree!

   "One argument (and the one that I guess I most subscribe to) would be that when the fetus is capable of survival outside of the womb, then abortion absolutely should not happen, since the child could be just as easily removed from the mother and life continued. However, until the fetus reaches an age of viability, I see abortion as the right of the mother. Obviously there is no hard and fast number of days to determine viability, so a wise guidline should be chosen.

Either way, there is a way to satisfy the majority of views (this is not a stance I support by the way but lets roll with it). If 20% of people believe life is from conception until brain dead, 20% think from vitabilty until brain dead, 20% from conception until no heart beat and brain dead, 20% believe from birth until brain dead....etc...you get the idea....then at some point you could take all the views and get a timeline in which 98% of peoples view on life would fall in. Call it time X and time Y. So if you have time X and Y then why not just make that the best solution? You make sure that well over 90% of people have there views fit in this timeline and since we can't agree it seems like that would work out nicely.
