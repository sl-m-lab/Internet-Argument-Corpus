Unfortunately, despite those precautions, I became pregnant. We aren't that rich, and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden. He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child. \n \n I think this is one of the many circumstances in which abortion is absolutely justifiable, especially because I think that except for rare circumstances, abortion should be allowed up to the third trimester (the exceptions would be if the woman's life was in danger, etc. for a later abortion)",

Either way, it is forcing the intimate use of a woman's body against her will.\n \n There is a point that is often brought up by pro-life proponents that claim that women who have unwanted pregnancies have acted irresponsibly and that the only responsible action is to take the pregnancy to term. I would agree that most women with unwanted pregnancies have not been sufficiently responsible to protect themselves with proper birth control (excluding those who suffer rape, incest, etc. or whose contraception fails). However, I disagree that carrying the pregnancy to term is the only responsible response to an unwanted pregnancy. Abortion in the early stages of pregnancy is also a responsible response. Pro-life proponents just happen to think it is morally wrong because of their unsupported proclamation that \"all human life is precious\". Where human life in the form of zygotes or early embryos is concerned, many, if not most, don't view it as being nearly so precious. What arguements would you personally propose to describe specifically why the human zygote or early embryo is precious?",

   "Perhaps it should then be restated that pro-life proponents insist on forced continuation of pregnancy. Either way, it is forcing the intimate use of a woman's body against her will.\nYeah, that is fairly accurate...although it is not always against her will.\n \n \n\n There is a point that is often brought up by pro-life proponents that claim that women who have unwanted pregnancies have acted irresponsibly and that the only responsible action is to take the pregnancy to term. I would agree that most women with unwanted pregnancies have not been sufficiently responsible to protect themselves with proper birth control (excluding those who suffer rape, incest, etc. or whose contraception fails). However, I disagree that carrying the pregnancy to term is the only responsible response to an unwanted pregnancy. \n It's not a strong argument..I agree.\n \n \n\n Abortion in the early stages of pregnancy is also a responsible response. Pro-life proponents just happen to think it is morally wrong because of their unsupported proclamation that \"all human life is precious\". \nI guess any valuing is really unsupported...We had a conversation about this :p Nevertheless, If you choose to say not all human life is precious then you must admit to some criteria for discriminating against certain humans. You have done this but others seem to get offended by the idea that this is what they do.\n \n \nWhere human life in the form of zygotes or early embryos is concerned, many, if not most, don't view it as being nearly so precious. What arguements would you personally propose to describe specifically why the human zygote or early embryo is precious?\n",

   "Yeah, that is fairly accurate...although it is not always against her will.\n\n Of course, in cases where a woman is continuing her pregnancy based on her own will, then there is no dispute between pro-life and pro-choice proponents. Remember, all (or nearly all) pro-choice supporters are quite supportive of those women who choose to carry out their pregnancies. This may be a point that is lost amid the arguements about unwanted pregnancies. Wanted pregnancies can be wonderful events. It is only about unwanted pregnancies where the dispute arises. I know you know this, but it is worth stating nonetheless.\n \nI guess any valuing is really unsupported...We had a conversation about this :p Nevertheless, If you choose to say not all human life is precious then you must admit to some criteria for discriminating against certain humans. You have done this but others seem to get offended by the idea that this is what they do.\n\n I believe that the reason people hesitate in stating that they are \"discriminating against certain humans\" is that it conjures up images of discrimination based on race or sex - mainly because there are various images that come to people's minds when one mentions \"humans\" or \"human beings\", etc. That is part of what makes these discussions so tricky - official definitions of terms such as \"a human\" vs. common use definitions (including assumptions of mental existence) that confuse the issue. To be meticulous, I would admit to discriminating against human life forms based on whether or not they have a mental existence. I think that statement carries no unintended connotations.",

   "emoticon_xdonno emoticon_rolleyesAh, really? So the girls that use contraception and it fails (it did for me - I was on the pill and my fiance was using a condom) have a choice of not getting pregnant? The girls that are attacked and raped get choice of not getting pregnant? The girls whose fathers, brothers, uncles, etc. make them have sex with them get a choice of not being pregnant?

I had it close to a year ago, and while it was an extremely hard and emotional decision, I chose what was best for me. I was and still am engaged (planning our marriage to be next fall), and both my fiance and I were on birth control (I was on the pill and he used condoms). Unfortunately, despite those precautions, I became pregnant. We aren't that rich, and both of us our still finishing up our college degrees and are under enormous student loan burden. He supported my decision to abort as neither of us would have anywhere near the time or money to support a baby (hence our use of contraception), and neither of us have taken a full job in our fields yet to be able to provide that money to pay for the loans let alone a child. \n\n \n What about adoption?

   "It's called abstinence, you may have heard of it. Millions of people are doing it.\n\n Sources for this claim? Besides the ridiculousness of your statement - you do know that people won't be abstinent unless they really want to (like me).\n \n \n All of this besides the fact that you only spoke about the part where contraception fails. Are you claiming that women and young girls who are attacked and raped, and the girls whose uncles, fathers, etc. force them to have sex with them, have a choice of abstinence? If you are, you have lost any shred of credibility.\n \n \n\n \n And adoption isn't?\n \n \n \n What about adoption? That solves time, and the majority of the money issue.\n\n \n Adoption, while okay for some, just wasn't for me. First of all, the pregnancy itself is expensive (doctor visits, checkups, amnio, hospital bills for your stay, bills for the doctor's time during the delivery, etc., etc.) It is really damn expensive, and money wasn't something we had the luxury of spending. All of this is besides the physical expense of pregnancy - it is extremely taxing to the woman, her body, and her health, and that wasn't something I was willing to go through at the time (not to mention miss my classes, and not go to work).\n \n Maybe you didn't realise it, but just the delivery procedure through vaginal birth is around 5,000 dollars at my local public hospital (10,000 or so at some of the private ones). Then you have to add the fees for your hospital stay while you are recovering. Plus, if there was a complication, and a premature birth, it could run up into the tens of thousands of dollars for preemie care. Finally, if there was a complication that requires a C-section, that raises just the deliver cost to close to ten grand. All of this is besides, as I said, the costs before the actual birth, and the loss of wages (My job in an exploration company invovles a hell of a lot of physical work - hiking around, etc.) and due to the nature of my job, we figured I'd have to spend around half of my pregnancy without that job.\n \n For the record, I don't really care what you think of my decision to abort, because it was just that: my decision. The fact that I shared it with my fiance only says a lot about our relationship. And so you know, I have no regrets whatsoever about my decision to abort (and neither does my fiance).",
