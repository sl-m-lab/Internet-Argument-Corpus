I'll show you a living transitional between two species. Go to almost any body of water in northern North America in the summer, or along the coasts of southern North America in the winter and look for birds like this.\n \n http://www.martinreid.com/Image%20files/HEGU18B.jpg\n \n There you go. The American herring gull (Larus argentatus smithsonianus) A transitional between two species. These birds range to the east across Greenland, Iceland, and into northern Europe.\n \n It looks about the same in Europe.\n \n http://www.birdguides.com/html/vidlib/assetPictures/061015a001_j2.jpg\n \n They also range to the west from Alaska into Siberia, across Siberia and Russia all the way to northern Europe. But as you go further and further west their appearance begins to change. But there is never a place where neighboring populations cannot and do not interbreed. But in northern Europe the populations from the west look a bit different.\n \n http://www.birdguides.com/html/vidlib/assetPictures/061018a001_j2.jpg\n \n That's the Lesser black-backed gull (L. fuscus). Even though it shares the same range as the herring gull it does not interbreed with herring gulls. So here is one large population that has become two different species at the extremes of its range, and those extremes overlap. So the American herring gull is a transitional between the Herring gull and the Lesser black-backed gull. It is even thought that the original population from which all of these birds descended lived in North America.",

   "But I am pretty sure that WarrierPoet wasn't looking for something so simple as a ring species. The reason that these gulls differ is because they have accumulated genetic mutations at the extremes of the range. Even though neighboring populations can and do interbreed (Herring gull, American herring gull, Vega herring gull, Birula's gull, Heuglin's gull, Siberian lesser black-backed gull, Lesser black-backed gull), the extremes of a population that has encircled the globe do not. But it is suspected that they are interfertil but choose not to interbreed. These are known as insipient species. So speciation does happen because we can see it before our eyes.\n \n For more information you can read Observed Instances of Speciation and Some More Observed Speciation Events.\n \n But the way WarriorPoet stated the question leads me to believe that he considers evolution to be a series of steps, as on a ladder. Species A changes into species B which changes into species C, and so on. In other words, the entire species becomes by some magic another species. But that doesn't seem to be the way it works very often. The fossil record indicates that species A becomes species A and species B or even species B and species C. And then the process is repeated again and again, some species going extinct and others surviving for a time, always changing in response to the environment.\n \n But WarriorPoet wanted to see an example of a transitional fossil so I will go one better and give him two. These transitionals are a bit above species to species transitions. These transitions happened so long ago that they are transitionals between taxonomic classes.\n \n First, a dinosaur with feathers.\n \n http://research.amnh.org/vertpaleo/feather1.jpg\n \n You can see more pictures at The American Museum of Natural History site.\n \n And here is a bird that would be a dinosaur without it's feathers.\n \n http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/graphics/Archaeopteryx_lithographica_1.jpg\n \n If you want to challenge my assertion that these are transitional you will need to understand a bunch of words that you may have never heard before, like furcula, carina, hallux, gastralia, pubis, fibula, fenestra, pygostyle, and so on.\n \n And, of course, we await your definition of transitional, proof, evidence and your requirements for what you may accept as convincing. I suspect that you already think that you know the truth beyond doubt and will accept no evidence that conflicts with that belief.",

Please do not judge so quickly or harshly.\n\n I haven't read that much of your stuff so I can't say what you have proved about the openness of your mind on this board. I don't have much opinion in the matter. I can only go by the nature of the post. In my experience it is typical of creationists to demand \"proof\" of transitionals, and then, because they don't understand evolution, science, or the definitiion of a transitional, reject anything that is presented and refuse to listen. Hopefully you do have an open mind but, truthfully, the rest of your post doesn't reassure on that point.\n \nPlease go here. There are some good points on the Archaeopteryx, including a fossil find that shows a more modern bird-like fossil that may predate the Archaeopteryx.\n\n Here's a picture of it\n \n http://www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galleri/montre/161_632.jpg\n \n The specimens have been dated between 120 & 140 my. If at the upper end of that range that puts it very close to the age of Archaeopteryx (140 to 170 my).\n \n But contrary to what creationists like to claim, this isn't a problem. There is no claim that Archaeopteryx is ancestral to Confuciusornis. If you look at birds now you will see lots of different species. They have a common ancestor but are not descended from one another. Archaeopteryx is just the oldest example of a bird that we have, and considering the distance between the sites where the fossils were found, and possibly several million years in time, I would expect them to be different.\n \n \nAlso, from http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/1352.asp (GASP!!! A CREATIONIST SITE!!!):\n\n \n Yes, a creationist bible ministry site. They do such a poor job in trying to report science. But of course their purpose isn't to report science but to report evidence that casts doubt on scientific theory. You see, the people at AIG agree to reject any scientific data the contradicts their religious dogma. They know the answers from mythology and are trying to make science fit around it. They don't actually do any science themselves.\n \n \nIn Eichst\u00e1tt, Germany, in 1984 there was a major meeting of scientists who specialize in bird evolution, the International Archaeopteryx Conference. They disagreed on just about anything that was covered there on this creature, but there was very broad agreement on the belief that Archaeopteryx was a true bird. Only a tiny minority thought that it was actually one of the small, lightly built coelurosaurian dinosaurs [small lightly framed dinosaurs].\n\n \n 1984, huh? I'm sure that is all still very relevant. Actually there is a lot of discussion about the nature of Archaeopteryx. Much of it deals with whether it could fly and what it teaches us about how birds came to fly - ground up or trees down. But what they all agreed on, even back then, was that Archaeopteryx is a transitional. Taxonomic debates aren't really very meaningful, really. Creationists like to make a big deal about the fact that most taxonomists and ornithologists classify Archaeopteryx as a bird. But where else would it go? That's a limitation of the Linnean classification system - everything is put somewhere, even if it doesn't exactly fit. The only debate about the evolution of Archaeopteryx among experts is whether it evolved from theropod dinorsaurs or from archosaurs. It's still a transitional.\n \nThe first bird link did not work, so I cannot look into that one.\n\n Power out. That was a link to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Go back and look later if you want.\n \nLurch, I don't appreciate your condescending tone. If you want to challenge my assertion that you are a pompous XXX that jumps to conclusions, you will need to be a little less judgemental and start thinking outside of Darwin's Black Box.\n\n Well it wasn't actually condescending but a challenge. Are you saying that you aren't up to it? If you want I'll start calling you names too. Isn't it funny how creationists begin that sort of thing when someone doubts their dogma? As for thinking outside the box, I can guarantee that evolutionary biology requires more thinking and encountering of new and difficult ideas than creationism does. To study science no one begins by signing an agreement to believe only religious dogma or to reject any scientific fact that disagrees with the mythology of bronze age herdsmen. In fact, you make a name in science by challenging established dogma. Just think about the famous scientists.\n \n Besides, how can I speak to you on an equal level about science when you don't seem to understand it very well. Anyone who demands proof has no idea what science is or how it works.\n \n Then shall we start with a discussion of the carina? I wasn't sure that you were familiar with the terms and it makes the discussion easier to use the correct terms. Without discussing these structures and comparing them to theropods and birds you really can't understand why it is so clearly a transitional.\n \n But if you don't want the condescending tone, then you need to pay attention. Perhaps if I told you to follow with your finger as you read it would help. If you can call me a pompous XXX the it should be OK if I call you ignorant, isn't it? Why else would you be asking me at the end of your post I claimed exactly the opposite of what I actually claimed. I'll explain at the risk of hurting your feelings again.\n \n Herring gulls and Lesser black-backed gulls do not interbreed. They are reproductively isolated. They fit quite nicely into the definition you gave of an insipient species. So Herring gulls don't reproduce with Lesser black-backed gulls but herring gulls can reproduce with American herring gulls to the west, which can reproduce with gulls to the west and so on until you get to the Lesser black-backed gull (which don't reproduce with Herring gulls) They are classified as separate species even though they are at the extreme ends of a single population. They illustrate one way that species develop. There are other examples of ring species, the most famous being a salamander in California and a bird around the Tibetan plateau.\n \n So how about this? Genetic studies were done of Brown bears from around the world. Their DNA was very similar and they seem all populations seem to be able to interbreed as far as we know. Except for the Brown bears of the ABC Islands Although they look like other Brown bears, the have distinctive differences in their DNA. It is closer to Polar bear DNA, even though the Polar looks quite different and has characteristics not found in Brown bears. But guess what. All these bears can interbreed, including Polar bears with Grizzly bears.\n \n OK. Your turn for a few insults. I have come to expect it from creationists.",

Truly, the custody of multiplied thousands of transitional fossils ought to be the cornerstone of evolutionary science.\n\n I suspect that no matter how much evidence was presented it wouldn't be enough for you. We are, in fact, hauling in fossils faster than they can be described. And the story of transitionals is a roar except to those with their fingers in their ears.\n \n Isn't it handy for you that fossilization is such a rare event. Just the conditions that might preserve a fossil are extremely rare. Add to that the rarity of an organism dying and ending in a location where it can be fossilized before the scavangers have scattered the remains. Add to that the fact that most remains don't fossilize easily anyway, even in the right conditions. I'll give you an example. How many fossils of passenger pigeons have been found? Have you found any? Just over 200 years ago passenger pigeons were so numerous that the darkened the sun. It took the whole day for a flock to pass. Whey aren't we up to our eyeballs in passenger pigeon fossils?\n \n Other processes destroy fossils. Geology and erosion. Generally we don't find fossils until they begin eroding out of the matrix. Then there is only a small window of opportunity before the fossil itself erodes. How many fossils have been destroyed and how many are deep in strata that aren't accessable?\n \n But I know. You know what you believe and demand absolute \"proof\" from the evidence in order to convince you otherwise. You prefer to accept the mythology of bronze age herdsmen based on no evidence at all.\n \n So tell me this, if we should be finding all kinds of fossils as you claim, why is there no trace in the fossil record of the passage of animals away from the ark to the areas where they are now found? Why is there no trace of Koalas, the Platypus, kangaroos between Ararat and Australia? What about the Pronghorn? Found only on the Great Plains of North America with no fossil trace anywhere else.\n \n The reason that I reject the mythology of Genesis as fact is not just because there is insufficient evidence to support it, not just because there is no evidence to support it, but because there are library stacks full of evidence against it.\n \nI'm sorry, but your observation that \"...the vast majority of life does not fossilize when it dies,\" is beside the point. Earth's strata has captured enough evidence of past life in fossilized form to keep us busy for generations and to unequivocally prove evolution if it has a basis in fact.\n\n Again, science doesn't \"prove\". But of course demands for proof allow you to continue to \"believe\" mythology without ever subjecting it to any sort of verification. Of course, science must meet far stricter examination than mythology.\n \n And of course, it is true that we are finding enough fossil material to keep us busy for generations. That is much of the problem. There is a shortage of qualified paleontologists and preparers. Much of the work is done by volunteers and amateurs. It sometimes takes years to prepare and then describe a fossil and then it may not reveal anything new. Besides that, the only fossils you are likely to hear about are the spectacular finds, since most are described only in the scientific literature. Unless you pursue the information, you won't know about it. So the answer is, we have the evidence you demand but you haven't looked for it. Somehow you think that every scientist should be bringing the information to you personally with no obligation on your part to invest any effort in learning.\n \nI would be very interested in seeing this cache of transitional fossils you say exists.\n\n Well, I'll name a few that I can easly reference.\n \n Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, Elginerpeton, Ventastega, Metaxygnathus, Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, Hynerpeton, Greerpeton, Tulerpeton and Sinonyx, Artiodactyla, Pakicetus, Ichyolestes, Ambulocetus, Rodhocetus, Dahlanistes, Rhodocetus, Takracetus, Gaviocetus, Basilosaurus, Dorudon. The above are transition between lobed fin fish and tetrapods and between terrestrial land animals and whales. The transition between Globigerinoides trilobus and Orbulina univera is fine grained and found universally in all ocean basins. Several transitions in trilobites have been found. One of the first was found by Niles Eldridge and was what lead him to the development of the theory of punctuated equilibrium with Stephen Jay Gould. Several transitional sequences over millions of years have been described in planktonic foraminifera. They show long periods of stasis interspersed by short periods of more rapid (but still gradual) and fine grained evolution. Ciclid fish in Lake Victoria show rapid diversification in a relatively short time. There is the sequence of Sinosauropteryx, Caudipteryx, Microraptor, Protarchaeopteryx, Archaeopteryx, Confuciusornis, Sinornis, and Apsaravis ukhaana, which show the transition from feathered dinosaurs to birds. And finally there are the following examples of hominids that show several transitions between an apelike ancestor and modern humans. Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Orrorin tugenensis, Ardipithecus ramidus, Australopithecus anamensis, A. afarensis, Kenyanthropus platyops, A. africanus, A. garhi, A. aethiopicus, A. robustus, A. boisei, Homo habilis, H. georgicus, H. erectus, H. ergaster, H. antecessor, H. (archaic)(also[i] H.heidelbergensis), H. neanderthalensis (/i]also[i] H. sapiens neanderthalensis), H. sapiens sapiens.\n \n Well, there's a few. But of course, that won't be enough to \"prove\" it for you even though no scientists claims \"proof\". Science isn't a matter of proof but of offering the bese explainations we can for the observed evidence. The best explanation for the above is evolution.\n \n OK. Now your turn. What evidence do you have for any of the Genesis mythology? What evidence that light was created before the sun and stars (or that light without a source is even possible). What evidence for a firmament (what is a firmament). Since we have observed the record of events that took place at such great distances from earth that God must have created the history rather than the physical objects, how is that not deception. Where did the water for a flood to cover the earth come from? There isn't enough on earth to produce that flood. And if there was a flood, where did the water go? Why is there not layer of flood deposite that is contiguous through the entire earth? Since structures like the vast chalk strata across Europe are actually the remains of small animals, how could all of them have been alive in such a short period before the flood. Since the consolidation of these organisms produce heat, where did all of that heat go? Condensation of vapor into rain produces heat, The condensation of enough water from vapor to flood the earth to a depth 15 meters above the highest mountains would release enough latent heat to boil the oceans. We know of no mechanisms sufficient to disipate that heat in the years since the flood.\n \n Your turn.",

   "You're right in saying that I and others may not think these lists really prove that much. At first blush, it doesn't appear that we have made much headway in advancing evolution from a collection of theories to convincing paleontological evidence since Darwin termed the fossil collection \"paltry\" in his day.\n \n Your list: Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, Elginerpeton, Ventastega, Metaxygnathus, Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, Hynerpeton, Greerpeton, Tulerpeton and Sinonyx, Artiodactyla, \n \n The \"Frasnian Gap\" describes the lack of information following the emergence of Panderichthys until the arrival of Acanthostega and Ichthyostega. The advance from lobe-finned fish to tetrapod requires more convincing revelations than fragmentary fossils of Elginerpeton (who seems to have returned to the water) and Obruchevichthys, both regarded by some as an evolutionary side-branch.\n \n Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, with their retention of gills and morphologies that kept them water-bound, make for disappointing tetrapods. With only a shoulder fragment and jawbone scientists believe that Hynerpeton could have borne weight on all fours and have been more terrestrial. However, the creature's feet still remain to be seen by scientists and its breathing apparatus verified. \n \n Coates and Clack reveal that Acanthostega, is \"...anatomically closest to osteolepiform fish [and] Ichthyostega is reinterpreted as having a seal-like postcranial skeleton. Tulerpeton [resembles] more recent Carboniferous tetrapods.\" They conclude, \"There is little support for an exclusively freshwater tetrapod origin.\"\n \n Then, considerable controversy over Devonian tetrapod trackways has kept scientists guessing about exactly when \"terrestriality\" was acquired by aquatic animals. This is because the strata containing the trackways often predate recovered tetrapod body fossils.\n \n Your list: Pakicetus, Ichyolestes, Ambulocetus, Rodhocetus, Dahlanistes, Rhodocetus, Takracetus, Gaviocetus, Basilosaurus, Dorudon. The above are transition between lobed fin fish and tetrapods and between terrestrial land animals and whales.\n \n The list of \"whale ancestors\" brings to mind our own varieties of dual land and water dwellers, each with either four flippers or webbed feet - otters, the platypus, fur seals, sea lions and walruses. All are mammals, and except for the platypus, are found in both fresh and ocean waters. Though extinct, some of the land and marine life in the species list does not look so surprising in our day and age.\n \n Whereas only the skull of the Pakicetus has been recovered, it has not kept paleontologists from giving the small, four-legged creature hooves to walk on - a vital ancestral link to furry, hoofed carnivores. And the fierce some looking Ambulocetus might much more easily pass for a hungry crock lying in wait than it would for a \"whale-in-progress.\"\n \n In the race to become whales, the miracle of evolution moved the Pakicetus along to seafaring creatures in less than ten million years. On the geologic clock, this could be termed \"overnight\" and seems incredulous. In this short time frame, the breathing hole had to mitgrate to the top of the head, hearing had to become internalized, and legs had to be transformed into flippers. Allowing for errors in dating, which could well be within a range of + or - 10 million years, it is more credible that all the species listed here were contemporaries and give witness to the vast biodiversity of ancient land and sea life now extinct.\n \n Your list: There is the sequence of Sinosauropteryx, Caudipteryx, Microraptor, Protarchaeopteryx, Archaeopteryx, Confuciusornis, Sinornis, and Apsaravis ukhaana, which show the transition from feathered dinosaurs to birds.\n \n There is just not enough information to prove that dinosaurs ever flew. And evolutionary biologist at Brown University, Ted Goslow, includes the \"flying Archaeopteryx\" in that dubious list. Goslow gives real birds test flights in wind tunnels while he records bone and muscle movements used during takeoff, flight, and landing, capturing single-wing beats with high-speed film and electrodes. He concluded that Archaeopteryx \"...lacked the shoulder structure necessary for rapid wing upstroke\" and thus could not remain airborne. This information points to a gap that further distances these feathered dinos from true flight by several million years.\n \n The protofeathers of Sinosauropteryx advanced by some presents the scientific world with real problems when faced with transforming reptilian skin into feathers. Follicles, reaching the underlying bone in the case of primary feathers, are the tubular growth vehicles of feathers, whereas reptilian scales are nothing but leathery folds in the epidermis. Not surprisingly, differences are seen in \"...morphogenesis, gene structure, protein shape and sequence, and filament formation and structure.\" \n \n But the \"weakest link\" in the evolutionary stages to flight presented above is that there is really no sequential linkage at all. Hou Lianhai, a specialist in avian fossils at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, complains that paleontologists don't seem to be able to identify appropriate ages associated with the given order of \"missing links.\" He says, \"The majority of dinosaurs considered most birdlike are younger than Archaeopteryx.\"\n \n Your list: And finally there are the following examples of hominids that show several transitions between an apelike ancestor and modern humans. Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Orrorin tugenensis, Ardipithecus ramidus, Australopithecus anamensis, A. afarensis, Kenyanthropus platyops, A. africanus, A. garhi, A. aethiopicus, A. robustus, A. boisei, Homo habilis, H. georgicus, H. erectus, H. ergaster, H. antecessor, H. (archaic)(also[i] H.heidelbergensis), H. neanderthalensis (/i]also[i] H. sapiens neanderthalensis), H. sapiens sapiens.\n \n Lee Berger, professor of paleoanthropology at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa says, \"Because the fossil record for early hominids is so fragmentary, inferences and predictions [must] fill in the gaps.\" He admits, scientists \"...assemble broad theories from small piles of bones.\" After studying fossils of A. afarensis and A. africanus, he became convinced that the shorter arms and legs of africanus spoke of a more chimplike structure in the conventionally held later species. Thus began a wrangling among peer scientists and a rearranging of our ancestral tree by some.\n \n A skull found in Qafzeh, Israel was dated using electron spin resonance and was found to be 100,000 years old - just too old to bear the modern sapiens characteristics that it did. Now modern humans are thought to have co-existed with Neadertals! But not surprising news at all to an anthropologist who studies current cultures. If he lined up modern-day human skulls from Europe, the middle-East, Scandinavia, Africa, Asia, Russia, China, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Pacific Islands, Hawaii, and America, he would have no trouble building his own varied, and in some cases, quite odd-looking, human family tree.",

   "The point was to answer your claim that there are few transitional fossils. But as I predicted, you require a sequence of thousands of fossils that show every detailed change over a reletively short span of years. Essentially your whole argument is just, \"I just can't believe...\"\n \n None of your comments even address the question of whether they are transitional. Why is it important that Acanthostega had gills. How does that indicate that it is not transitional? Why would an aquatic tetrapod be dissappointing? Why would an anatomy closest to osteolepiform fish be meaningful. That's the point, isn't it? All you have done is give a list of things in insolation and object to them for faulty reasons. A dissapointing tetrapod because it was aquatic. A dissappointing argument.\n \nAnd the fierce some looking Ambulocetus might much more easily pass for a hungry crock lying in wait than it would for a \"whale-in-progress.\"\n\n But it wasn't a crock, was it. It was a whale. It was an animal in transition between land and water. If you don't like Pakicetus then \n look at Rodhocetus, lots of the postcranial skeleton has been found including parts of the hind limbs. It was also a whale.\n \n Isn't it significant the you offered not a single bit of evidence or a single reason why any of these are not transitional. It is more significant that you offered no explaination for a creationist standpoint as to why they should exist.\n \n Your ideas about skulls in Israel are XXXX. Modern humans appeared in the fossil well before 100,000 years ago. They are known to have co-existed with Neandertals in the levant before that time. We have known that they co-existed with Neatdertals in Europe from about 40,000 years ago.\n \nIf he lined up modern-day human skulls from Europe, the middle-East, Scandinavia, Africa, Asia, Russia, China, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Pacific Islands, Hawaii, and America, he would have no trouble building his own varied, and in some cases, quite odd-looking, human family tree.\n\n Besides the fact that it just isn't true, to even hint that some modern humans have skulls similar to those I mentioned is racist to the extreme. There is no skull from a modern human the would not be recognized as a modern Homo sapiens sapiens by any competent anatomist or paleoanthropologist.\n \n Explain this picture and why none of these are around today. Where they on the ark?\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/images/hominids2.jpg\n \n I think that it is quite revealing that you failed to show why any of the fossils that I listed isn't a transitional. In most cases you only mentioned selected features as if they were meaningful.\n \n But more important, you offered no evidence for your position. Isn't that telling! You just can't believe the thousands of transitionals found in the right places and of the correct age that are logically explained by the theory of evolution. Instead you believe mythology based on no evidence that explains nothing. Where is you evidence? And please be as critical when presenting it as you are of the evidence for evolution.",

   "I thought I made myself perfectly clear. Where did I lose you? Let me run through it again.\n \n First, I explained how the lobe-finned fish did not make it to the tetrapod stage soon enough to create the Devonian tracks. The best chances for doing so were with Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, or Hynerpeton. All were really too late in time to be plausible candidates. As well, the first two were too clumsy and fish-like to walk on all fours; the last is still not fully verified as an able-bodied tetrapod. Something is wrong with the links and timing.\n \n Second, I told how paleontologists want me to agree that a four-footed, land-based carnivore was transformed into a whale in a matter of 10 million years - nothing short of a miracle by evolutionary standards! Too many links in too short of a time span.\n \n Third, I demonstrated how the \"flying dinosaur\" actually ante-dates the dino links that are supposed to bring him about. Dating has made nonsense out of the proposed links.\n \n Fourth, I complained that just when paleontologists convince me of where humans came from and want me to buy into my new family tree, they dig up another skull (which, by the way, I am to always accept as \"human\") and propose major changes to my ancestry. Their wrangling and tampering with the links are losing them and their science credibility. \n \n I added that a skull described in structure as modern H. sapiens has been dated at 100,000 years making us backyard, over-the-fence, neighbors with Neandertals. This makes a myth of the idea that Neandertals are our ancestors. I implied that their ethnic affiliation probably best explains their odd-shaped cranium, facial, and jaw structure. \n \n Does that make it clear?",

But that has been covered. You asked for transitional fossils and I gave you a bunch. You had not reasonable response other than your incredulity so I just moved on. You asked for something and you were answered.\n \n But I understand. You don't have any evidence and have to use excuses to duck the question.\n \nEspecially when I know the Achilles heel of the evolutionists: the lack of transitional fossils to backup their claims.\n\n Actually, you just don't like the volumes of transitional fossils so you either invent or parrot standard answers. \"Acanthostega was aquatic and had gills so it must be a poor tetrapod,\" you declare. Really? Why? Tetrapods evolved as aquatic animals. Why would they not have gills?\n \n Let's see. Devonian trackways that are older than tetrapod fossils. Why is that significant? Is there a rule that an actual fossil must be found before any trace fossils? I didn't know that. Maybe that is a rule of \"creation science.\" Moreover, the tracks are difficult to date and may not predate the earliest tetrapods (Clack, Jeffifer A., Gaining Ground, Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 2002, p.92). Even more astounding is the fact that Genoa River tracks in Australia have been assumed to have been made on dry land. However, there is no evidence of body drag, at least shallow water is reasonable. And close examination of the tracks indicate that they were not made by any known tetrapod. So it seems that your claim is that Acanthostega, an evolutionary side branch, had to have existed in what became Greenland before some unknown creature could have existed in what became Australia could have made tracks. Can you offer any sort of sane reason why?\n \n So maybe you were discussing the Valentia Slate trackways. They were certainly made by tetrapods. The problem is that the dating of those tracks is even less secure and the tracks themselves are not as good. These tracks have been distorted by geological events and required computer analysis to restore them, but there is at least one trackway that shows a furrow between the track, indicating body drag, and therefore shallower water than the \"dry land\" tracks at Genoa River. The general impression is that the indistinct nature of the tracks is an indication that they were made in water.\n \n So I'm not sure what your point is? Why is it necessary that we have found fossils of Acanthostega older than these trackways? Did you have a point? \n \nWarriorPoet started it, but when I saw what the subject was, I could not resist.\n\n Right. Possibly you didn't notice that I gave WarriorPoet several examples of evolution and transitions between species. And I gave you a bunch of examples of transitionals between higher taxonomic clasifications. But you \"just can't believe.\"\n \n So let's see what else your cut and paste \"I just can't believe\" response had to say. It seems that Coates and Clack \"reveal\" that[,] '...Acanthostega, is \"...anatomically closest to osteolepiform fish...\"' Really? Exactly how? You see, I happen to know that it isn't the entire anatomy. Coates and Clack were talking about a specific anatomical feature. My bet is you don't know what it is.\n \n So I guess whales are next. Sadly, we've already passed your best \"I just can't believe\" objections.\n \nSo, if you're ready to discuss Flood waters again, etc., then maybe we should close this thread?\n\n You already closed this thread when you couldn't offer a rational explanation for the transitional fossils presented. You haven't answered a single point with evidence. Only your incredulity.\n \nI think the Creationists won this one. What do you think?\n\n I think you revealed that you have no rational arguments against evolution and you are unable to present any evidence that supports creationism. If I feel the spirit I may continue with your babble about whales. I've got another bet, in fact two. I bet that you don't know the single anatomical feature that identifies a whale because it exists in all whales and only whales, both living and fossil.\n \n I also bet that you won't respond to either of my above bets.

A CREATIONIST SITE!!!):\n \n In Eichst\u00e1tt, Germany, in 1984 there was a major meeting of scientists who specialize in bird evolution, the International Archaeopteryx Conference. They disagreed on just about anything that was covered there on this creature, but there was very broad agreement on the belief that Archaeopteryx was a true bird. Only a tiny minority thought that it was actually one of the small, lightly built coelurosaurian dinosaurs [small lightly framed dinosaurs].\n \n The first bird link did not work, so I cannot look into that one.\n \n \n\n \n \n So many errors, where does one begin? The entire specious claim that there are pygostylian Avialae which pre-date Archaeopteryx lithographica stems from Chatterjee's most dubious fossil, \"Protoavis texensis,\" and Confuciusornis sanctus, which was initially described as dating from Tithonian horizons of the terminal Jurassic--although subsequently Hou et al (1996) presented more conclusive evidence placing the confuciusornid material from the Barremian (much to the chagrin of Alan Feduccia, who made much of Confuciusornis being from the Jurassic). As for \"Protoavis,\" the holotype and paratype are almost certainly composed of material which is not conspecific, and the material seems to correspond to a coelophysoid/drepanosaur chimera (Paul 2002), or a coelophysoid chimera (Gauthier & Rowe 1990). \n \n As for the Eichstatt Conference. It hardly concluded that Archaeotperyx was a \"true bird,\" it concluded that as opposed to the hypotheses of some (e.g., Thulborn 1976), Archaeopteryx was indeed the most basal avialian, and not a less derived member of Coelurosauria. One would actually suggest referring to the published data from the conference, in Hecht et al 1985, before continuing to make such assertions.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "\n Here's a picture of it\n \n http://www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galleri/montre/161_632.jpg\n \n The specimens have been dated between 120 & 140 my. If at the upper end of that range that puts it very close to the age of Archaeopteryx (140 to 170 my).\n \n \n 1984, huh? I'm sure that is all still very relevant. Actually there is a lot of discussion about the nature of Archaeopteryx. Much of it deals with whether it could fly and what it teaches us about how birds came to fly - ground up or trees down. But what they all agreed on, even back then, was that Archaeopteryx is a transitional. Taxonomic debates aren't really very meaningful, really. Creationists like to make a big deal about the fact that most taxonomists and ornithologists classify Archaeopteryx as a bird. But where else would it go? That's a limitation of the Linnean classification system - everything is put somewhere, even if it doesn't exactly fit. The only debate about the evolution of Archaeopteryx among experts is whether it evolved from theropod dinorsaurs or from archosaurs. It's still a transitional.\n \n \n\n \n \n The research from the Eichstatt conference, published in Hecht et al 1985, is actually still quite useful and is regularly cited in any major review of the questions pertaining to avian phylogeny. As for the matter of the Linnean terminological infrastructure and the concomitant system of typological classification, it is precisely for that reason that systematists have by and by adopted a clade-based approach for reconstructing the phylogeny of birds, hence the introduction by Gauthier in 1986 of the taxon Avialae (=Aves sensu Linne, emended by Chiappe 1999). In this cladistic manner, Archaeopteryx can be classified as both bird and theropod, as that is precisely what it is. \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "I thought I made myself perfectly clear. Where did I lose you? Let me run through it again.\n \n \n Third, I demonstrated how the &#8220;flying dinosaur&#8221; actually ante-dates the dino links that are supposed to bring him about. Dating has made nonsense out of the proposed links.\n \n Does that make it clear?\n\n \n \n Ah, the Feduccian argument which will not die no matter how often it is shown to be absurd. Whether one argues for a classic exaptation scenario in which Deinonychosauria and Avialae represent a nice example of bifurcating cladogenesis, or a neoflightless hypothesis whereby Dromaeosauridae at least, represents a clade more closely allied with Avialae than does Archaeopteryx, this temporal discontinuity is a non issue. We know that Maniraptora originated somewhere in the medial Jurassic, perhaps following the Pliensbachian event in the early Jurassic, and thus the argument that this clade post-dates the urvogel is specious rot. Indeed, in the neoflightless hypothesis, modified in large part from Olshevsky's initial suggestions (1994), the temporal distribution of basal dromaeosaurs may be more parsimoniously explained, than that of the exaptational model. If this should be correct, then the \"temporal disparity\" will be even more of a non-issue that it currently is.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "\n \n There is just not enough information to prove that dinosaurs ever flew. And evolutionary biologist at Brown University, Ted Goslow, includes the &#8220;flying Archaeopteryx&#8221; in that dubious list. Goslow gives real birds test flights in wind tunnels while he records bone and muscle movements used during takeoff, flight, and landing, capturing single-wing beats with high-speed film and electrodes. He concluded that Archaeopteryx &#8220;&#8230;lacked the shoulder structure necessary for rapid wing upstroke&#8221; and thus could not remain airborne. This information points to a gap that further distances these feathered dinos from true flight by several million years.\n \n The protofeathers of Sinosauropteryx advanced by some presents the scientific world with real problems when faced with transforming reptilian skin into feathers. Follicles, reaching the underlying bone in the case of primary feathers, are the tubular growth vehicles of feathers, whereas reptilian scales are nothing but leathery folds in the epidermis. Not surprisingly, differences are seen in &#8220;&#8230;morphogenesis, gene structure, protein shape and sequence, and filament formation and structure.&#8221; \n \n But the &#8220;weakest link&#8221; in the evolutionary stages to flight presented above is that there is really no sequential linkage at all. Hou Lianhai, a specialist in avian fossils at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, complains that paleontologists don&#8217;t seem to be able to identify appropriate ages associated with the given order of &#8220;missing links.&#8221; He says, &#8220;The majority of dinosaurs considered most birdlike are younger than Archaeopteryx.&#8221;\n \n \n\n \n First and foremost, the evidence that Archaeopteryx flew is rather conclusive. See Feduccia & Tordoff (1979) on asymmetry values in archaeopterygiform remiges, and Hecht et al (1985) for general reviews of the pectoral girdle in Archaeopteryx. The real question is not whether the urvogel flew, it is how skilled a flier was it? The lack of a robust, carinate sternum, ossified uncinate processes, a basal sternocostal morphology, the incipient nature of the acrocoracoid and acromion process, and lack of a triosseal canal system indicating that the supracoracoideus and pectoralis major were still fairly generalized comparative to Pygostylia, suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a skilled aerialist, its ability to fly notwithstanding. I might add that multiple par-avian Maniraptora display flight adaptations more derived than those seen in the urvogel, and in multiple Maniraptora, the orientation of the glenoid permits a flapping arc to be described (Jenkins 1993, Novas & Puerta 1997, Paul 2002). \n \n Your second paragraph rather argues the cherished myth of feathers being nothing more than scales gone frayed, which has most recently been advanced in Regal (1975), whose work more or less represented the last gasp of this classical hypothesis. Modern research indicates that feathers are novel structures derived via relatively simple alterations in the expression of developmental genes and their regulatory proteins (namely Sonic Hedgehog, and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2), and from these data a scenario for feather development over time has been formulated, which in turn, has meshed quite well with the fossil data (Spearman & Hardy 1985, Chatterjee 1997, Prum 1999, Maderson & homberger 2000, Brush 2000, Harris, Fallon & Prum 2002, Prum & Brush 2002, 2003). Even Alan Feduccia--the paragon of intellectual obsolescence, has argued as much (see Feduccia 1996, 1999a). Therefore, your strawman argument concerning feather origin is entirely invalid.\n \n The last paragraph deals with the same tired problem of alleged \"temporal discontinuity\" that I have already addressed elsewhere.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Well, I cant find that book at the moment to look at each of these different schools of thought, but let me make a guess at each of them to see if I am correct.\n \n 1. Uniplanar school - (i.e anagenesis) - this implies that the evolution from the earliest hominids to humans follwed a direct ancestor to descendant relationship (i.e no branching of lineages, directly from A to B to C to D\n \n 2. Polyphyletic school - implies that human evolution involved lots of branching events and side lineages which eventually went extinct. \n \n 3.Preneandertals school - I assume that this means we evolved from Neandertal\n \n 4. Presapiens school - if anything, I think I remember my teacher referring to this as the multi-regional hypothesis, in that modern humans evolved not from a single recent ancestral african population, but rather simultaneaously from multiple groups of H. erectus  throughout the Old world. Gene flow between populations was sufficient for all groups to evolve together.\n \n Now, hopefully I am correct or remotely close on these to make comments. \n \n Uniplanar school - wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! IT has been documented numerous times that many species of hominids coexisted together for years. For example, Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans coexisted for 5,000 - 10,000 years before they disappeared. Also, H.habilus, A.robustus and A. Boisei  also coexisted for hundreds of thousands of years. Source: Reconstructing Human Origins, Conroy, 1997\n \n Preneanderthals school - Most likely, Neandertals did not contribute any genetic material to modern European populations, though this is obviously an ongoing debate. There has been recent finds of possible hybridization between the two species, however. http://www.athenapub.com/8zilhao1.htm \n However, if there was interbreeding bewteen the two, would we expect to find neanderthal mtDNA in at least some populations? Also, we would expect to see at least a few Neanderthal Y chromosomes running around in Europe.\n \n Presapiens school - here genetic evidence works against this theory. Obviously, we have all heard of mtDNA sequencing. Though this may come under fire, further analysis of other human DNA is backing this up as well. I refer to \n 1. Y chromosome analysis : Whitfield et al Sequence variation of the human Y chromosome. Nature Vol 378: November 1995 p379-380\n 2. Tishkoff et al : Global Patterns of Linkage Disequiblibrium at the CD4 locus and Modern Human Origins: Science vol 271: March 1996 p1380-1387\n \n Obviously that leave us with Polyphyletic(though i am sure that this is not the term used any more). All evidence points to this, that the human lineage is a series of branching events and replacements of populations rather than of a single unified population changing through time. This is generally the agreed upon hypothesis for modern human origins, thouhg there are still a few clinging to the multiregional hypothesis.\n \n By the way, how does this not apply to the rise of man?",

Do you actually expect that a specific ancestor and descendant for every fossil should also have been found? Archaeopteryx looks very much like a small theropod dinosaur with feathers. In fact, it looks like a Compsognathus. If the hypothesis that birds descended from theropod dinosaurs is correct, then it is logical to expect that there existed organisms that had a mixture of dinosaur and avian characteristics and that some examples would be more dinosaur like and others would be more bird like. Guess what has been found.\n \nAnother smoke and mirrors job is done using the word ancestral. It plainly suggests it is related to 'ancestor' but is in fact used instead of the word archaic. Archaeopteryx is often portrayed as ancestral of modern birds. To most peoples minds this suggests that it was the 'ancestor' of modern birds.\n\n I don't doubt that discussions have been a bit sloppy. But we aren't talking about the use of the word \"ancestral\", we were talking about a transitional. In fact, declaring that a fossil is transitional does not make a claim that it is ancestral to some specific organism. This seems to be related to the creationist misunderstanding of what evolution is. Populations evolve, and in this case what is being discussed are several populations of maniraptorian, theropod dinosaurs that had derived characteristics that were bird-like. Most of these populations went extinct, but some survived, or at least one, survived.\n \n\"An early fossil bird from the Jurassic, ca 150 mya: Archaeopteryx, Greek for \"ancient wing,\" the link between birds and reptiles, looked like a small dinosaur with feathers preserved in fine-grained limestone.\"\n\n True. It is a link but not the only one.\n \nHere the key word is 'link' which is a connection.\n\n Yes. And it is.\n \nAgain this suggests movement, or transition, but again, when hard-pressed evolutionaries will retreat away from such a normative description and move into more vague terms such as those in...\"Archaeopteryx :An Early Bird\"\n\n The problem seems to be your ignorance. Instead of demanding that evolutionary biologists use all of the terms in the way that you want them to, why don't you learn what is being discussed. The issues are complicated and sometimes confusing. There are even sometimes differences among qualified experts. But who are you to demand that evolutionary biologists use words to mean what you want them to mean.\n \nCan I draw your attention to \" It is actually intermediate between the birds that we see flying around in our backyards and the predatory dinosaurs like Deinonychus.\" 'Intermediate' is another vague notion that also suggests between (how else did it come to have bits of one and bits of the other?)\n\n You think that is vague to say intermediate? Strange. An intermediate in this case is an organism that morphologically shows characteristics of two groups of organisms, sometimes characteristics of one, sometimes characteristics of the other, and sometimes characteristics that are a mixture. So do you want to talk about the preorbital fenestra, gastralia, carina, hallux, beak, teeth, pygostyle, uncinate processes, sacrum...that should be enough to get the discussion started.\n \nOr \"It has long been accepted that Archaeopteryx was a transitional form between birds and reptiles, and that it is the earliest known bird. Lately, scientists have realized that it bears even more resemblance to its ancestors, the Maniraptora, than to modern birds; providing a strong phylogenetic link between the two groups. It is one of the most important fossils ever discovered.\"\n\n How is that a problem? You have been crying about ancestors and when it mentions the Maniraptora you seem to have some unspecified objection to that.\n \nNo wonder so many people are confused... look at the wording around Figure 1 at \"Figure 1 Archaeopteryx an ancient ancestor of modern birds\"\n\n I assumed by the way that you set that up that the figure went with the quote above. When I followed the link I found out that the link was to an Australian page about waterbirds. But still, you have a point. It does call Archaeopteryx an ancestor. That's pretty sloppy. In point of fact, there are few who are informed who think that Archaeopteryx is actually the ancestor of modern birds. It is an intermediate - a transitional species.\n \nIs it the 'ancestor' or is it 'ancestral'? This is more clearly a case of an evolutionary statement having gone to far, because this time the meaning is perfectly clear, Archaeopteryx lead to modern birds.\n\n I think the use of the word is careless. Archaeopteryx is neither an ancestor of nor ancestral to (I'm not sure of your distinction) modern birds. And the site isn't even aimed at those who might actually be informed about the topic.\n \nThis is a way that evolutionaries set up a system of language that suggests that they have solved problems, when in fact they haven't.\n\n Nonsense. That would imply that the intent was to deceive, as when you made claims as to what was contained in a book you didn't read, or several other statements you have made.\n [qute]Similarly evolutionaries will say Evolutionary Theory is proven, or is a fact (these terms too seem to be rather fluid).[/quote]\n No they won't. Is that your ignorance or are you being decietful. Proof is not a matter of science. Only scientific illiterates claim that science proves something. \n \nWhen pressed for 'proof' they say, 'oh, we've got evidences' but evidences don't necessarily point to anything, unless you interpret it so, so saying you've got lots of evidences sounds impressive, but is another hollow term.\n\n You are pretty much a scientific illiterate. Here is how an observation becomes evidence. First there is an observation. An explanation is devised to explain the observation. The explanation is called an hypothesis. Then a prediction of some fact or further observation is made from the hypothesis that must be true if the hypothesis is correct. A test is then devised to verify or falsify the prediction.\n \n But that still isn't \"proof\". There is also the possibility that additional data will not fit the explanation and that the hypothesis will have to be revised. When an hypothesis has been strongly tested, usually many times, it is called a scientific theory. The theory of evolution is now about 150 years old and it has been tested many, many times. Evidence from paleontology, population genetics, genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry and others has been found and tested and it continues to support the theory of evolution.\n \nI have to agree then with this statement \"Moreover, there is such an astonishing diversity of contradictory opinion on the physiology of Archaeopteryx that claims of its status as an evolutionary transition may be all but meaningless.\"\n\n I'm sure you do agree, but the author of that site is so ignorant and uninformed. \n \n\"Tie two birds together and though they have four wings, they can not fly\" (from \"The Silent Flute\" movie)...\n \n What about the four-winged dinosaur?\n\n What about it? Not sure what your point is. How is this evidence against Archaeopteryx and other transitionals between dinosaurs and birds?",

   "In opposition to Vindex Urvogel at the request of \"God Fearing....\"\n \n So many errors, where does one begin? \n \n This obviously means that \"God\" is about to speak.\n \n The entire specious claim that there are pygostylian Avialae which pre-date Archaeopteryx lithographica stems from Chatterjee's most dubious fossil, \"Protoavis texensis,\" \n \n Here, he begins to play with your mind using the lofty langue of science, and you're swallowing it whole. Whereas Sankar Chatterjee's Protoavis texensis might stump Vindex and remain \"dubious\" in his mind, it is not at all dubious in the minds of hundreds of scientists who now recognize that Protoavis has usurped Archaeopteryx as the earliest bird, predating the latter by 75 million years. With debates raging right now about the origin of birds, I cannot believe that you are going to let this self-proclaimed \"God\" do your thinking for you.\n \n and Confuciusornis sanctus, which was initially described as dating from Tithonian horizons of the terminal Jurassic--although subsequently Hou et al (1996) presented more conclusive evidence placing the confuciusornid material from the Barremian (much to the chagrin of Alan Feduccia, who made much of Confuciusornis being from the Jurassic). \n \n More of the same haughty jargon. But we already know that Confuciusornis follows Archaeopteryx, so what's the point? It must be that Vindex wants to berate a recognized scientist: \"...much to the chagrin of Alan Feduccia....\" Here, the \"Vindex God\" has fooled you into thinking that perhaps he has some overweening right to label a good scientist \"chagrined\" and apparently find some pleasure in the process.\n \n As for \"Protoavis,\" the holotype and paratype are almost certainly composed of material which is not conspecific, and the material seems to correspond to a coelophysoid/drepanosaur chimera (Paul 2002), or a coelophysoid \n chimera (Gauthier & Rowe 1990).\n \n I am not impressed, Vindex. Protoavis is dated as the earliest bird at roughly 225 million years overthrowing your accusation that to do so is a \"specious claim.\" Thus far in your discussion, the specious claims have been yours. Morphological and evolutionary gaps in avian history are wide open at this scientific juncture and some paleontologists would caution you to save yourself some embarrassment and not to try to fill them right now. \n \n As for the Eichstatt Conference. It hardly concluded that Archaeotperyx was a \"true bird,\" it concluded that as opposed to the hypotheses of some (e.g., Thulborn 1976), Archaeopteryx was indeed the most basal avialian, and not a less derived member of Coelurosauria. One would actually suggest referring to the published data from the conference, in Hecht et al 1985, before continuing to make such assertions.\n \n Notice the exclusive \"Eichstatt Conference.\" I wasn't invited to attend. Were you? But I'm sure \"God\" was there, and he will help us mortals by filling us in on the details we missed.\n \n Did you call Archaeotperyx a \"true bird?\" Did Lurch call Archaeotperyx a \"true bird?\" Well, if you did, shame on you both! \"[\"God\"] would actually suggest [you] referring to the published data from the conference...before continuing to make such [ignorant] assertions.\"\n \n The research from the Eichstatt conference, published in Hecht et al 1985, is actually still quite useful and is regularly cited in any major review of the questions pertaining to avian phylogeny. As for the matter of the Linnean terminological infrastructure and the concomitant system of typological classification, it is precisely for that reason that systematists have by and by adopted a clade-based approach for reconstructing the phylogeny of birds, hence the introduction by Gauthier in 1986 of the taxon Avialae (=Aves sensu Linne, emended by Chiappe 1999). In this cladistic manner, Archaeopteryx can be classified as both bird and theropod, as that is precisely what it is. \n \n The point of this paragraph must be to impress weak minds with an in-depth science lesson on avian phylogeny. That Archaeopteryx is both bird and therapod is old news. But just in case we didn't know that already, \"Vindex God\" declares, \"...that is precisely what [the creature] is.\" \n \n Ah, the Feduccian argument which will not die no matter how often it is shown to be absurd. \n \n \"Absurd\" is an unfair word. Sometimes scientific thought \"will not die\" because there is reasonable strength supporting its claims and sufficient doubt about its opponents' claims. But \"Vindex God\" called it \"absurd,\" so I guess we will just have to obtusely comply with his terminology. Right? Wrong! We will search out who and what is really absurd here.\n \n Whether one argues for a classic exaptation scenario in which Deinonychosauria and Avialae represent a nice example of bifurcating cladogenesis, or a neoflightless hypothesis whereby Dromaeosauridae at least, represents a clade more closely allied with Avialae than does Archaeopteryx, this temporal discontinuity is a non issue. \n \n All the foregoing is the obscuring of plain language. Though scientific, it's all show. Pure fluff. It is an ostentatious trick of argument that softens the opponent so that the next blow penetrates. Such manipulation and ambiguity usually means that the \"next blow\" is not such a good punch. Sometimes it can mean that which follows is an outright fabrication which the perpetrator hopes will remain unchallenged.\n \n We know that Maniraptora originated somewhere in the medial Jurassic, perhaps following the Pliensbachian event in the early Jurassic, and thus the argument that this clade post-dates the urvogel is specious rot. \n \n There's the punch - \"specious rot.\" Let's see if it did the damage it was meant to do. Nowhere did I ever make the claim that the clade Maniraptora post-dated Archaeopteryx (a member of the clade itself), so immediately, without much effort at all, we have established that this \"Vindex God\" knows how to deceive. Or maybe he was continuing an argument with someone from another Forum? Or maybe he has been arguing with himself? In any case, I would have to award his discussion the ignominious title \"specious rot.\"\n \n Indeed, in the neoflightless hypothesis, modified in large part from Olshevsky's initial suggestions (1994), the temporal distribution of basal dromaeosaurs may be more parsimoniously explained, than that of the exaptational model. If this should be correct, then the \"temporal disparity\" will be even more of a non-issue that it currently is.\n \n More science indeed, but also more fluff to impress and obscuring of plain communicated thoughts.\n \n First and foremost, the evidence that Archaeopteryx flew is rather conclusive. See Feduccia & Tordoff (1979) \n \n Remember the \"chagrined\" scientist above? Well, now Vindex wants to cite him.\n \n on asymmetry values in archaeopterygiform remiges, and Hecht et al (1985) for general reviews of the pectoral girdle in Archaeopteryx. The real question is not whether the urvogel flew, it is how skilled a flier was it? \n \n \"...Evidence that Archaeopteryx flew is rather conclusive\" is a misleading statement and will cause weak minds to conjure up pictures of dinosaurs flapping their wings like birds. I earlier quoted an evolutionary biologist who concluded that Archaeopteryx could not have done this. But I really don't care if the beast DID fly! All I asked for in my earlier posts was a traceable transitional trail of fossils that explained the evolution behind Archaeopteryx. No one to this day has provided that.\n \n The lack of a robust, carinate sternum, ossified uncinate processes, a basal sternocostal morphology, the incipient nature of the acrocoracoid and acromion process, and lack of a triosseal canal system indicating that the supracoracoideus and pectoralis major were still fairly generalized comparative to Pygostylia, suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a skilled aerialist, its ability to fly notwithstanding. I might add that multiple par-avian Maniraptora display flight adaptations more derived than those seen in the urvogel, and in multiple Maniraptora, the orientation of the glenoid permits a flapping arc to be described (Jenkins 1993, Novas & Puerta 1997, Paul 2002). \n \n Here's the part that really impressed \"God Fearing....\" Just look at all the anatomical science in this paragraph! But, how has he said any more than what I asserted in my post? He says, \"Archaeopteryx was not a skilled aerialist\" and I said the same. He added, \"...its ability to fly notwithstanding,\" but this is misleading. Jumping from a cliff and soaring or running fast enough to become airborne is a much smaller matter and less complicated anatomically than flapping wings and remaining aloft. That is where the heated disagreement between real scientists enters.\n \n But \"God Fearing....\" still liked his scientific prowess here. Somehow, to you, they eclipse my reasonable, well-founded views.",

   "continued....\n \n Your second paragraph rather argues the cherished myth of feathers being nothing more than scales gone frayed, which has most recently been advanced in Regal (1975), whose work more or less represented the last gasp of this classical hypothesis. Modern research indicates that feathers are novel structures derived via relatively simple alterations in the expression of developmental genes and their regulatory proteins (namely Sonic Hedgehog, and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2), and from these data a scenario for feather development over time has been formulated, \n \n Well, shut me up! Those scales did turn into feathers after all! And all because \"...a scenario for feather development over time has been formulated....\"\n \n which in turn, has meshed quite well with the fossil data \n \n I'm sure it \"meshes\" very well to eyes that desperately want it to. Notice that \"Vindex God\" does not bother to point out that this is an intensely debated theory with vociferous advocates as well as opponents in the scientific mainstream.\n \n (Spearman & Hardy 1985, Chatterjee 1997, Prum 1999, Maderson & homberger 2000, Brush 2000, Harris, Fallon & Prum 2002, Prum & Brush 2002, 2003). Even Alan Feduccia--the paragon of intellectual obsolescence, has argued as much (see Feduccia 1996, 1999a). \n \n This poor scientist, Alan Feduccia, has been round and round with \"God\" today. First he got pummeled, then he was cited, now he is being used to advance the evolution of feathers - though at the expense of being termed \"the paragon of intellectual obsolescence.\" That's \"God's\" way of calling him stupid. \n \n Therefore, your strawman argument concerning feather origin is entirely invalid.\n \n Ok, if Vindex thinks I constructed a straw man suggesting the difficulty of scales evolving into feathers, then I invite him to thrust his fist through the face of my straw man. In doing so, he is liable to punch a fellow scientist square in the jaw. \n \n But notice how he has played with your mind: \"...your argument...is entirely invalid.\" This kind of language always works on weak minds because they seldom have the resolve, resources, or courage to either affirm or dispute the claims.\n \n The last paragraph deals with the same tired problem of alleged \"temporal discontinuity\" that I have already addressed elsewhere.\n \n Oh dear. \"God\" is distressed. If no one has asserted \"temporal discontinuity,\" then no alleged \"temporal discontinuity\" exists! We will henceforth leave your clade Maniraptora alone and leave you to your almost-able-to-fly Archaeopteryx as well. If you believe that in some \"God-like\" manner you have sustained a smooth evolutionary continuum for early flight in the fossil record by speaking up for Archaeopteryx in the upper-Jurassic and downplaying his ancestor, Protoavis texensis, your work is far from over. But I could tell you didn't really know all that much - your language gave you away.",

When Archaeopteryx was first found, it was hailed as a direct 'link' now it is not seen as one. So, when you started calling it 'ancestral' that made sense in the actual meaning of the word, but now it is no longer part of a link, the term ancestral leads to natural confusion... and scientists themselves don't know where they're up to in retaliation to Archaeopteryx... you have so many competing theories.\n \n \n When I said \"Evolutionaries will, when hard pressed say that their fave archaeopteryx is not in the link from anything to anything... but it 'is' transitional!\"\n \n It is exactly like my doctor's analogy (recall using the word 'idiopathic'). By calling it 'transitional' which simply means an odd looking thing which seems to be bits of something and bits of another, it suggests knowledge but is a construct used to hide the fact that evolutionaries really don't know where archaeopteryx lies in the scheme of things.\n \n \n Lurch said...\"Really.

I've read something about bird's breathing systems being totally unlike reptiles. Do you know anything about this?\n \n Lurch: If the hypothesis that birds descended from theropod dinosaurs is correct, then it is logical to expect that there existed organisms that had a mixture of dinosaur and avian characteristics and that some examples would be more dinosaur like and others would be more bird like.

Protoavis is dated as the earliest bird at roughly 225 million years overthrowing your accusation that to do so is a &#8220;specious claim.&#8221; Thus far in your discussion, the specious claims have been yours. Morphological and evolutionary gaps in avian history are wide open at this scientific juncture and some paleontologists would caution you to save yourself some embarrassment and not to try to fill them right now. \"\n \n Lofty language? I use only two terms, which are technical in the paragraph to which, this response is directed: \"Avialae,\" whose meaning has already been explained in other posts, and \"pygostylian.\" A pygostyle, is the term for the fusion of caudal vertebrae into a single unit, which supports the fan of rectrices. Had you taken the time to look up the term, it would not have remained \"lofty language.\" \n \n You continue to claim that \"hundreds of scientists now recognize that Protoavis has usurped Archaeopteryx as the earliest bird...\" Really? Care to name them? Last I recall, Chatterjee has defended the validity of the \"Protoavis\" material (1991, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999), with his most eloquent treatment of his proto bird presented in his 1997 work, published by The Johns Hopkins University Press. Beyond Chatterjee's vociferous advocacy, only Evegny Kurochkin has argued for the validity of the \"Protoavis\" material (1995). \n \n Indeed, wide-scale review of the material has severely challenged the supposition that \"Protoavis\" is a valid taxon. The significant similarities between the temporal region of the skull in both \"Protoavis\" and drepanosaurs has led some authors to suggest that \"Protoavis\" is in fact a drepanosaur/theropod chimera (Paul 1988, Feduccia 1996, Paul 2002). These similarities include the structure of the quadrate, and moreover, the structure of the cervical vertebrae (Renesto 1994, 2000), although further post-crania including the structure of the carpus and manus strongly refute avian affinity. In your callous dismissal of these data, you in fact present no arguments based on the morphology you claim to champion, which would preclude the chimera-status of \"Protoavis texensis\" and merely present it as a given. Because \"Protoavis\" is valid it is therefore not a chimera and is therefore a valid taxon. While this sort of circular reasoning and sham-logic may be acceptable within the creationist camp, it will not suffice in reasoned debate, and you bear the onus of proof for your assertion that the \"Protoavis\" holotype and paratypes are composed of conspecific material. \n \n Critiques of the validity of \"Protoavis\" include the following: Paul (1988), Witmer (1991), Chiappe (1995), Currie (1995), Welman (1995), Feduccia (1996), Ostrom (1996), Padian & Chiappe (1998), Sanz et al (1998), Feduccia (1999), and lastly Paul (2002).

   "Continued:\n \n Now let us consider your next point:\n \n \"Notice the exclusive &#8220;Eichstatt Conference.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t invited to attend. Were you? But I&#8217;m sure &#8220;God&#8221; was there, and he will help us mortals by filling us in on the details we missed.\"\n \n An argument from incredulity? No, I was not at the Eichstatt Conference, however the symposium was hardly a clandestine meeting akin to a gathering of Illuminati numeraries. On the contrary, a marvelous collection of the research presented at the conference and the lectures given there, was published in 1985, and as I actually do have this splendid volume, I have access to the data which was mulled over at Eichstatt. Indeed, so could anyone interested in avian phylogeny. It is hardly a state-secret, this document:\n \n Hecht et al. 1985. The Beginning of Birds: Proceedings of the International Archaeopteryx Conference, Eichstatt, 1984. Freunde des Jura-Museums Eichstatt, Eichstatt. \n \n And on to the next point:\n \n \"The point of this paragraph must be to impress weak minds with an in-depth science lesson on avian phylogeny. That Archaeopteryx is both bird and therapod is old news. But just in case we didn&#8217;t know that already, &#8220;Vindex God&#8221; declares, &#8220;&#8230;that is precisely what [the creature] is.&#8221;\"\n \n Splendid, we are in agreement then on the phylogenetic affinities of the urvogel.\n \n Next points:\n \n \"&#8220;Absurd&#8221; is an unfair word. Sometimes scientific thought &#8220;will not die&#8221; because there is reasonable strength supporting its claims and sufficient doubt about its opponents&#8217; claims. But &#8220;Vindex God&#8221; called it &#8220;absurd,&#8221; so I guess we will just have to obtusely comply with his terminology. Right? Wrong! We will search out who and what is really absurd here.\"\n \n Whether one argues for a classic exaptation scenario in which Deinonychosauria and Avialae represent a nice example of bifurcating cladogenesis, or a neoflightless hypothesis whereby Dromaeosauridae at least, represents a clade more closely allied with Avialae than does Archaeopteryx, this temporal discontinuity is a non issue. \n \n \"All the foregoing is the obscuring of plain language. Though scientific, it&#8217;s all show. Pure fluff. It is an ostentatious trick of argument that softens the opponent so that the next blow penetrates. Such manipulation and ambiguity usually means that the &#8220;next blow&#8221; is not such a good punch. Sometimes it can mean that which follows is an outright fabrication which the perpetrator hopes will remain unchallenged.\"\n \n We know that Maniraptora originated somewhere in the medial Jurassic, perhaps following the Pliensbachian event in the early Jurassic, and thus the argument that this clade post-dates the urvogel is specious rot. \n \n \"There&#8217;s the punch &#8211; &#8220;specious rot.&#8221; Let&#8217;s see if it did the damage it was meant to do. Nowhere did I ever make the claim that the clade Maniraptora post-dated Archaeopteryx (a member of the clade itself), so immediately, without much effort at all, we have established that this &#8220;Vindex God&#8221; knows how to deceive. Or maybe he was continuing an argument with someone from another Forum? Or maybe he has been arguing with himself? In any case, I would have to award his discussion the ignominious title &#8220;specious rot.&#8221;\"\n \n Indeed, in the neoflightless hypothesis, modified in large part from Olshevsky's initial suggestions (1994), the temporal distribution of basal dromaeosaurs may be more parsimoniously explained, than that of the exaptational model. If this should be correct, then the \"temporal disparity\" will be even more of a non-issue that it currently is.\n \n \"More science indeed, but also more fluff to impress and obscuring of plain communicated thoughts.\"\n \n \n Now, this series of replies is most confused. First and foremost, it is internally contradictory. At one moment you uphold temporal problems, and yet you then go on to tacitly accept the validity of clade Maniraptora (very Darwinian of you) to argue that all the while you had never proposed temporal disparity, saying of such that: \"Nowhere did I ever make the claim that the clade Maniraptora post-dated Archaeopteryx.\" \n \n Your equally rambling assault on both the exaptational scenario I outlined and the neoflightless scenario I briefly described in fact address none of the data for or against either of those two hypotheses, and are instead lengthy ad hominems. Nailing down your position on alleged temporal disparity is akin to nailing down fog, which I think is plain to anyone who has read your own internally inconsistent series of replies to this matter. A clarification of your stance is in order, if you wish to avoid the appearance of deliberately obfuscating the matter.\n \n The next point:\n \n First and foremost, the evidence that Archaeopteryx flew is rather conclusive. See Feduccia & Tordoff (1979) \n \n \"Remember the &#8220;chagrined&#8221; scientist above? Well, now Vindex wants to cite him.\"\n \n Feduccia's poor research and questionable conclusions in other matters, have no bearing on his work on asymmetry values in Archaeopteryx, which as the 1979 work he did with Tordoff would indicate to anyone bothering to read it, is in fact excellent. Here, incidentally, is the full citation for this important study:\n \n Feduccia, A. & Tordoff, H. B. 1979. Feathers of Archaeopteryx; asymmetric vanes indicate aerodynamic function. Science 203: 1021-1022. \n \n And the next point:\n \n &#8220;&#8230;Evidence that Archaeopteryx flew is rather conclusive&#8221; is a misleading statement and will cause weak minds to conjure up pictures of dinosaurs flapping their wings like birds. I earlier quoted an evolutionary biologist who concluded that Archaeopteryx could not have done this. But I really don&#8217;t care if the beast DID fly! All I asked for in my earlier posts was a traceable transitional trail of fossils that explained the evolution behind Archaeopteryx. No one to this day has provided that.\n \n Here&#8217;s the part that really impressed \"God Fearing....\" Just look at all the anatomical science in this paragraph! But, how has he said any more than what I asserted in my post? He says, &#8220;Archaeopteryx was not a skilled aerialist&#8221; and I said the same. He added, &#8220;&#8230;its ability to fly notwithstanding,&#8221; but this is misleading. Jumping from a cliff and soaring or running fast enough to become airborne is a much smaller matter and less complicated anatomically than flapping wings and remaining aloft. That is where the heated disagreement between real scientists enters.\"\n \n \n You were in fact provided a significant body of anatomical data which strongly suggests that on the contrary, Archaeopteryx was volant, albeit in a rudimentary way. You utterly failed to examine these data, instead categorically rejecting them. For your argument that the urvogel was incapable of flight to hold, you are obliged to refute the data which suggests it did. Let me reiterate for you, using my original post:\n \n The lack of a robust, carinate sternum, ossified uncinate processes, a basal sternocostal morphology, the incipient nature of the acrocoracoid and acromion process, and lack of a triosseal canal system indicating that the supracoracoideus and pectoralis major were still fairly generalized comparative to Pygostylia, suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a skilled aerialist, its ability to fly notwithstanding. I might add that multiple par-avian Maniraptora display flight adaptations more derived than those seen in the urvogel, and in multiple Maniraptora, the orientation of the glenoid permits a flapping arc to be described (Jenkins 1993, Novas & Puerta 1997, Paul 2002). \n \n And as for your nice phyletic progression from Coelurosauria to Avialae, that is already quite nicely taken care of by the fossil material available. We see the earliest par-avian character states in the basal Maniraptoriformes such as compsognathids and coelurids, as well as in Ornitholestes hermani, and the par-avian osteology which first appears in these taxa is underscored in more derived maniraptorans. The most derived Maniraptora are indeed 'more' avian in their morphology, than is the urvogel. Consider the changes in character state represented by this grouping:\n \n Compsognathus longipes\n Sinosauropteryx prima\n Coelurus fragilis\n Ornitholestes hermani\n Rahonavis ostromi\n Unenlagia comahuensis\n Beipiaosaurus inexpectus\n Sinornithoides spp.\n Troodon spp.\n Oviraptor spp.\n Avimimus portentosus\n Protarchaeopteryx robusta\n Sinornithosaurus millenni\n Microraptor gui\n Bambiraptor feinbergorum\n Deinonychus antirrhopus\n Velociraptor mongoliensis\n \n In which a more or less continual pattern of gradual change is observed indicating the ancestry or possibly subsequent derivation of the character state which is most basal for Aviale: that seen in Archaeopteryx. From Archaeopteryx, we can outline the following changes in morphology:\n \n Confuciusornithidae\n Enantiornithes\n Hesperornithiformes\n Ichthyornithiformes\n Stem-neornithean lineages:\n \n Gaviidae\n Charadriiformes\n Podicipediformes\n Anseriformes\n Gruiformes\n \n In this grouping we again see a more or less continual pattern of gradual change which indicates modification of the bauplan of Archaeopterygiformes, to new demands thereof. \n \n To assert that these fossils, in both groups, show nothing of the sort, demands that one demonstrate that, a) they in no way demonstrate gradual change over time, in the context of ancestry/descent or that b) these fossils are not valid, and therefore mean nothing. Either is a daunting prospect considering the significant data which refutes both. In the debate which should ensue as to the anatomical characters of these taxa, the extensive list of references which will be brought to bear can be enumerated. \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Continued:\n \n You then move on to feather origins:\n \n \"Well, shut me up! Those scales did turn into feathers after all! And all because &#8220;&#8230;a scenario for feather development over time has been formulated&#8230;.&#8221;\n \n I&#8217;m sure it &#8220;meshes&#8221; very well to eyes that desperately want it to. Notice that &#8220;Vindex God&#8221; does not bother to point out that this is an intensely debated theory with vociferous advocates as well as opponents in the scientific mainstream.\"\n \n Typically, you utterly fail to address the data which supports the model of feather origins which I briefly outlined, and presented no data which would refute it, instead categorically dismissing it. Whereas I had provided references pertinent to that very discussion, to support the data I presented. Let me repeat them:\n \n Brush, A. 2000. Evolving a protofeather and feather diversity.

Scientific American 228(3): 84-94.\n \n You go on to say that:\n \n \"This poor scientist, Alan Feduccia, has been round and round with &#8220;God&#8221; today. First he got pummeled, then he was cited, now he is being used to advance the evolution of feathers - though at the expense of being termed &#8220;the paragon of intellectual obsolescence.&#8221; That&#8217;s &#8220;God&#8217;s&#8221; way of calling him stupid.\"\n \n I call Feduccia what he is, a conservative systematist and general anti-cladist. Whether it is stupidity is open to debate, but he advocates numerous classification schemes and ideas long since outdated or shown inaccurate, hence \"obsolete.\" Example? Look no further than his usage of Aves sensu Linne (see Feduccia 1996, 1999, full citations already listed). \n \n Next point:\n \n \"Ok, if Vindex thinks I constructed a straw man suggesting the difficulty of scales evolving into feathers, then I invite him to thrust his fist through the face of my straw man. In doing so, he is liable to punch a fellow scientist square in the jaw. \n \n But notice how he has played with your mind: &#8220;&#8230;your argument&#8230;is entirely invalid.&#8221; This kind of language always works on weak minds because they seldom have the resolve, resources, or courage to either affirm or dispute the claims.\"\n \n And yet that is precisely what you have done. You have presented an argument for feather origins last seriously advocated by Regal in 1975, and now largely discredited such that even its long time proponents Alan Feduccia or Storrs Olson have come to express its dubious accuracy, as current thinking. Moreover you have misrepresented the debate on the early evolution of the feather: nearly all researchers in this matter concede that the feather is an evo-devo novelty (see the references I listed above), the main issue of contention is, novelty status notwithstanding, what was the feather first used for, and was it only exaptated for flight. So, one can feel free to punch through your strawman with ease, confident that with the exception of a Regalite lurking in the shadows here and there, he will not be hitting a \"fellow scientist square in the jaw.\"\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "You continue to claim that \"hundreds of scientists now recognize that Protoavis has usurped Archaeopteryx as the earliest bird...\" Really? Care to name them? Last I recall, Chatterjee has defended the validity of the \"Protoavis\" material (1991, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999), with his most eloquent treatment of his proto bird presented in his 1997 work, published by The Johns Hopkins University Press. Beyond Chatterjee's vociferous advocacy, only Evegny Kurochkin has argued for the validity of the \"Protoavis\" material (1995). \n \n Won't work, Vindex. \"Hundreds of believing scientists\" - excluding creationists - falls well within the bounds of safe assumptions. The verdict may not be in yet for this early bird, but the forensic evidence is too strong to gag the opinion of reputed scientists. Or do you consider it trivial that a paleornithologist of the repute of Evegny Kurochkin is calling this a bird? He alone could sway hundreds by his esteemed opinion and cause hundreds more to re-examine their staunch disbelief. No, forget it. I don't have to provide you a list.\n \n Indeed, wide-scale review of the material has severely challenged the supposition that \"Protoavis\" is a valid taxon. The significant similarities between the temporal region of the skull in both \"Protoavis\" and drepanosaurs has led some authors to suggest that \"Protoavis\" is in fact a drepanosaur/theropod chimera (Paul 1988, Feduccia 1996, Paul 2002). These similarities include the structure of the quadrate, and moreover, the structure of the cervical vertebrae (Renesto 1994, 2000), although further post-crania \n \n Please tell me - just how many definitive ways will the crushed skull be reconstructed and under whose directorship? Are you here denying that Ostrom and others have convincingly stated that the skull is so badly crushed (all pieces being long removed from the matrix) that it renders the creature's cranial reconstruction impossible? Please tell me and others how Paul and Feduccia went about their reconstruction so as to arrive at their claims of \"significant similarities.\" \n \n including the structure of the carpus and manus strongly refute avian affinity. \n \n This paltry offering might be the only anatomical minutiae you have mentioned that is worth considering (other than perhaps the cervical vertebrae, where implications of its potential similarities to drepanosaur or a theropod could be passed over without consequence). But your assertion that they \"strongly refute avian affinity\" flies in the face of a long list of avian affinities that Protoavis does possess. Why do you insist on truncating the evidence for flight?\n \n The humerus gives indication that flight muscles were present. Quill knobs on the arm provided for the attachment of flight feathers. A shortened fibula points to a leg like that of a bird. A perching toe is on the foot, which some believe also possesses an avian ankle joint. A keeled sternum and furcula were obviously for flight. The hips are especially birdlike. \n \n But all this data is what we both already knew, isn't it? Do you insist that I list it as an exercise in futility? It certainly won't sway you or others who find your opinion on this Forum so distinguished. I think the bad science from you is your unforthcoming presentation of Protoavis, a strategy that confines the fossil to the shadowy realm of \"dubious.\" \n \n In your callous dismissal of these data, you in fact present no arguments based on the morphology you claim to champion, which would preclude the chimera-status of \"Protoavis texensis\" and merely present it as a given. Because \"Protoavis\" is valid it is therefore not a chimera and is therefore a valid taxon. \n \n I never denied that the fossil is possibly chimeric in nature. Does chimera pose an insurmountable grade for paleontologists to climb? Does it always prohibit positive taxonomic identification by trained eyes? I wholeheartedly reject your accusation that I am advancing a claim which precludes a potential chimeric fossil thereby establishing Protoavis as a \"given.\" If two creatures are seen superimposed in that Triassic stone, it is of no consequence - if a bird is present (as many believe), it will be discovered. \n \n While this sort of circular reasoning and sham-logic may be acceptable within the creationist camp, it will not suffice in reasoned debate, \n \n I am not guilty of this as you accuse, but I do entertain suspicions about evolutionists. Here's an example: birds are the descendants of dinosaurs, but the admission of Protoavis as a taxon poses severe and irreconcilable temporal discontinuity to this theory, so Protoavis is denied legitimacy. Here's another: human ancestors can be enthusiastically added to the hominid lineup by virtue of several pieces of a badly crushed skull or jawbone, but Protoavis is disallowed because its skull is \"fragmentary,\" though its distinct birdlike features have been positively identified. Here's a third as a hypothetical question: how anxious would paleontology be to dismiss Protoavis as a valid taxon if it were chimeric in nature and badly fragmented, but found in late Jurassic or early Cretaceous stone?\n \n and you bear the onus of proof for your assertion that the \"Protoavis\" holotype and paratypes are composed of conspecific material. \n \n You won't make me bear the onus to prove anything. Besides, the materials do not have to be conspecific to do damage to historically accepted avian evolution. Instead of wasting your energy arguing against what many believe to be the inevitable outcome of this find, I would think a wise man should be working on revising his evolution and making room to welcome Protoavis texensis into avian history or at least making room for the next fossilized bird to come along that antedates Archaeopteryx. The higher you climb up your scaffold of unbelief, the farther and harder you will fall when that time comes.",

   "Continued:\n \n \n \n Next points:\n \n \"\"Absurd\" is an unfair word. Sometimes scientific thought \"will not die\" because there is reasonable strength supporting its claims and sufficient doubt about its opponents' claims. But \"Vindex God\" called it \"absurd,\" so I guess we will just have to obtusely comply with his terminology. Right? Wrong! We will search out who and what is really absurd here.\"\n \n Whether one argues for a classic exaptation scenario in which Deinonychosauria and Avialae represent a nice example of bifurcating cladogenesis, or a neoflightless hypothesis whereby Dromaeosauridae at least, represents a clade more closely allied with Avialae than does Archaeopteryx, this temporal discontinuity is a non issue. \n \n \"All the foregoing is the obscuring of plain language. Though scientific, it's all show. Pure fluff. It is an ostentatious trick of argument that softens the opponent so that the next blow penetrates. Such manipulation and ambiguity usually means that the \"next blow\" is not such a good punch. Sometimes it can mean that which follows is an outright fabrication which the perpetrator hopes will remain unchallenged.\"\n \n We know that Maniraptora originated somewhere in the medial Jurassic, perhaps following the Pliensbachian event in the early Jurassic, and thus the argument that this clade post-dates the urvogel is specious rot. \n \n \"There's the punch - \"specious rot.\" Let's see if it did the damage it was meant to do. Nowhere did I ever make the claim that the clade Maniraptora post-dated Archaeopteryx (a member of the clade itself), so immediately, without much effort at all, we have established that this \"Vindex God\" knows how to deceive. Or maybe he was continuing an argument with someone from another Forum? Or maybe he has been arguing with himself? In any case, I would have to award his discussion the ignominious title \"specious rot.\"\"\n \n Indeed, in the neoflightless hypothesis, modified in large part from Olshevsky's initial suggestions (1994), the temporal distribution of basal dromaeosaurs may be more parsimoniously explained, than that of the exaptational model. If this should be correct, then the \"temporal disparity\" will be even more of a non-issue that it currently is.\n \n \"More science indeed, but also more fluff to impress and obscuring of plain communicated thoughts.\"\n \n \n Now, this series of replies is most confused. First and foremost, it is internally contradictory. At one moment you uphold temporal problems, and yet you then go on to tacitly accept the validity of clade Maniraptora (very Darwinian of you) to argue that all the while you had never proposed temporal disparity, saying of such that: \"Nowhere did I ever make the claim that the clade Maniraptora post-dated Archaeopteryx.\" \n \n Your equally rambling assault on both the exaptational scenario I outlined and the neoflightless scenario I briefly described in fact address none of the data for or against either of those two hypotheses, and are instead lengthy ad hominems. Nailing down your position on alleged temporal disparity is akin to nailing down fog, which I think is plain to anyone who has read your own internally inconsistent series of replies to this matter. A clarification of your stance is in order, if you wish to avoid the appearance of deliberately obfuscating the matter.\n \n The next point:\n \n First and foremost, the evidence that Archaeopteryx flew is rather conclusive. See Feduccia & Tordoff (1979) \n \n \"Remember the \"chagrined\" scientist above? Well, now Vindex wants to cite him.\"\n \n Feduccia's poor research and questionable conclusions in other matters, have no bearing on his work on asymmetry values in Archaeopteryx, which as the 1979 work he did with Tordoff would indicate to anyone bothering to read it, is in fact excellent. Here, incidentally, is the full citation for this important study:\n \n Feduccia, A. & Tordoff, H. B. 1979. Feathers of Archaeopteryx; asymmetric vanes indicate aerodynamic function. Science 203: 1021-1022. \n \n And the next point:\n \n \"...Evidence that Archaeopteryx flew is rather conclusive\" is a misleading statement and will cause weak minds to conjure up pictures of dinosaurs flapping their wings like birds. I earlier quoted an evolutionary biologist who concluded that Archaeopteryx could not have done this. But I really don't care if the beast DID fly! All I asked for in my earlier posts was a traceable transitional trail of fossils that explained the evolution behind Archaeopteryx. No one to this day has provided that.\n \n Here's the part that really impressed \"God Fearing....\" Just look at all the anatomical science in this paragraph! But, how has he said any more than what I asserted in my post? He says, \"Archaeopteryx was not a skilled aerialist\" and I said the same. He added, \"...its ability to fly notwithstanding,\" but this is misleading. Jumping from a cliff and soaring or running fast enough to become airborne is a much smaller matter and less complicated anatomically than flapping wings and remaining aloft. That is where the heated disagreement between real scientists enters.\"\n \n \n You were in fact provided a significant body of anatomical data which strongly suggests that on the contrary, Archaeopteryx was volant, albeit in a rudimentary way. You utterly failed to examine these data, instead categorically rejecting them. For your argument that the urvogel was incapable of flight to hold, you are obliged to refute the data which suggests it did. Let me reiterate for you, using my original post:\n \n The lack of a robust, carinate sternum, ossified uncinate processes, a basal sternocostal morphology, the incipient nature of the acrocoracoid and acromion process, and lack of a triosseal canal system indicating that the supracoracoideus and pectoralis major were still fairly generalized comparative to Pygostylia, suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a skilled aerialist, its ability to fly notwithstanding. I might add that multiple par-avian Maniraptora display flight adaptations more derived than those seen in the urvogel, and in multiple Maniraptora, the orientation of the glenoid permits a flapping arc to be described (Jenkins 1993, Novas & Puerta 1997, Paul 2002). \n \n And as for your nice phyletic progression from Coelurosauria to Avialae, that is already quite nicely taken care of by the fossil material available. We see the earliest par-avian character states in the basal Maniraptoriformes such as compsognathids and coelurids, as well as in Ornitholestes hermani, and the par-avian osteology which first appears in these taxa is underscored in more derived maniraptorans. The most derived Maniraptora are indeed 'more' avian in their morphology, than is the urvogel. Consider the changes in character state represented by this grouping:\n \n Compsognathus longipes\n Sinosauropteryx prima\n Coelurus fragilis\n Ornitholestes hermani\n Rahonavis ostromi\n Unenlagia comahuensis\n Beipiaosaurus inexpectus\n Sinornithoides spp.\n Troodon spp.\n Oviraptor spp.\n Avimimus portentosus\n Protarchaeopteryx robusta\n Sinornithosaurus millenni\n Microraptor gui\n Bambiraptor feinbergorum\n Deinonychus antirrhopus\n Velociraptor mongoliensis\n \n In which a more or less continual pattern of gradual change is observed indicating the ancestry or possibly subsequent derivation of the character state which is most basal for Aviale: that seen in Archaeopteryx. From Archaeopteryx, we can outline the following changes in morphology:\n \n Confuciusornithidae\n Enantiornithes\n Hesperornithiformes\n Ichthyornithiformes\n Stem-neornithean lineages:\n \n Gaviidae\n Charadriiformes\n Podicipediformes\n Anseriformes\n Gruiformes\n \n In this grouping we again see a more or less continual pattern of gradual change which indicates modification of the bauplan of Archaeopterygiformes, to new demands thereof. \n \n To assert that these fossils, in both groups, show nothing of the sort, demands that one demonstrate that, a) they in no way demonstrate gradual change over time, in the context of ancestry/descent or that b) these fossils are not valid, and therefore mean nothing. Either is a daunting prospect considering the significant data which refutes both. In the debate which should ensue as to the anatomical characters of these taxa, the extensive list of references which will be brought to bear can be enumerated. \n \n Vindex Urvogel\n\n \n \n Impressive. The only thing that I can imagine that would shoot down your flying \"phyletic progression\" would be the entrace of Triassic birds. Vindex, please don't misinterpret my refusal to deal piece by piece with your lists above to mean that I do not understand them (I think the revelatory occurrence would actually be to find that YOU don't understand them) or in any way to mean that I agree with your evolutionary continuum surrounding early flight. My intense problem with this whole debate has been that you and others are jumping to conclusions way too soon. Seasoned evolutionists would caution you to not build edifices around pet theories during a whirlwind era of fossil finds that will inevitably leave your structures in heaps of ruins.",

   "\n The higher you climb up your scaffold of unbelief, the farther and harder you will fall when that time comes.\n\n \n \n Your closing advice might be equally applicable to your defense of Protoavis. Let's review the points you have made.\n \n First point:\n \n \"Won&#8217;t work, Vindex. &#8220;Hundreds of believing scientists&#8221; &#8211; excluding creationists &#8211; falls well within the bounds of safe assumptions. The verdict may not be in yet for this early bird, but the forensic evidence is too strong to gag the opinion of reputed scientists. Or do you consider it trivial that a paleornithologist of the repute of Evegny Kurochkin is calling this a bird? He alone could sway hundreds by his esteemed opinion and cause hundreds more to re-examine their staunch disbelief. No, forget it. I don&#8217;t have to provide you a list.\"\n \n \n The \"forensic\" evidence is precisely what has led most authorities to view \"Protoavis\" as an invalid taxon. Your argument from authority (in citing Kurochkin) will hardly serve as a compelling substitute for hard data. The fact remains the multiple independent reviews of the \"Protoavis\" material, which I have cited for all to go and check externally for their benefit, have come to the conclusion that this same taxon is invalid. The \"Protoavis\" material, which you claim is so explosive that it can sway hundreds, has completely failed to do so. Yet, you claim \"hundreds\" feel it is indeed an ornithurine bird which pre-dates the urvogel. Your assertion that you do not need to provide evidence (ergo, a list) to support this argument, is entirely specious. Either uphold the claim, or withdraw it. \n \n Your next point:\n \n \"Please tell me - just how many definitive ways will the crushed skull be reconstructed and under whose directorship? Are you here denying that Ostrom and others have convincingly stated that the skull is so badly crushed (all pieces being long removed from the matrix) that it renders the creature&#8217;s cranial reconstruction impossible? Please tell me and others how Paul and Feduccia went about their reconstruction so as to arrive at their claims of &#8220;significant similarities.&#8221;\"\n \n Ostrom's review, as do those of the others I cited, make note of the following cranial regions which are well enough preserved to permit comparative analysis with other taxa: the quadrate, the occiput, and to a lesser extent the maxillae. Since you obviously have no intention of referring to the material which I ctied, I will detail the conclusions reached by Ostrom, Paul, and others, as to the nature of these materials. \n \n The \"Protoavis\" quadrate (the two preserved quadrates are in fact astonishingly different from each other) when compared to drepanosaur material, exhibits similarities in the form of the bone and the condyle of the proximal articular surface. Both lack evidence of doubling of this condyle characteristics of the modifications necessary for streptostylic kinesis. \n \n The occiput of Protoavis, is notably plesiomorphic comparative to even the most basal Avialae, in that it retains a post-temporal fenestra, which in Avialae is reduced to a fossa or entirely absent, and lacks the strongly twisted paroccipital process characteristic of Eumaniraptora. Claimed synapomorphies for the \"Protoavis\" occiput and that of the urvogel are in fact found in Deinonychosauria as well. \n \n The maxillae of \"Protoavis\" are more difficult to analyze, but they appear to lack the accessory fenestra leading to auxilliary sinuses so apomorphic of the derived Maniraptora. \n \n Any attempt to present \"Protoavis\" as a bird more derived than the urvogel, and pre-dating it, cannot simply dismiss these plesiomorphies in the skull of Chatterjee's specimens.\n \n Your next point:\n \n \"This paltry offering might be the only anatomical minutiae you have mentioned that is worth considering (other than perhaps the cervical vertebrae, where implications of its potential similarities to drepanosaur or a theropod could be passed over without consequence). But your assertion that they &#8220;strongly refute avian affinity&#8221; flies in the face of a long list of avian affinities that Protoavis does possess. Why do you insist on truncating the evidence for flight?\n \n The humerus gives indication that flight muscles were present. Quill knobs on the arm provided for the attachment of flight feathers. A shortened fibula points to a leg like that of a bird. A perching toe is on the foot, which some believe also possesses an avian ankle joint. A keeled sternum and furcula were obviously for flight. The hips are especially birdlike.\"\n \n \n I would first address your categoric dismissal of the stunning similarities between the cervical vertebrae of drepanosaurs and \"Protoavis.\" How does one explain the shared morphology of these elements, if not by arguing that indeed the cervicals of \"Protoavis\" 'are' drepanosaurian? Now, let us see about the carpal and manal osteology. You claim they do not refute avian affinity? Curious. How, then, are the carpal and manal elements in \"Protoavis\" particularly avian? Let us look at them:\n \n The manus is not tridigitate, digit I is not medially divergent, the distal carpals lack a semilunate element, stiffening and elongation of the proximal phalange of digit II is absent, and there is no posterolateral flange on the base of the proximal phalange in this digit. All of these characters are difficult to account for, if \"Protoavis\" is indeed as birdlike as has been claiemd. \n \n Your further claims about the humerus and ulna are curious. The humerus is not particularly avian, and it lacks a hypertrophied deltopectoral crest, and the alleged ulnar quil nodes are entirely unlike the quil nodes seen in Avialians or par-avians, and appear to be preservation artifacts. The fibula is no more reduced in the avian manner than those seen in Maniraptora. The reversed hallux restored by Chatterjee has not been supported by the fossil material, since the hallux has not been preserved in articulation with the pes, and there is a lack of in site documentation as to its initial position upon recovery. Your argument that \"Protoavis\" has an \"avian ankle\" is amusing--advanced mesotarsal ankles are shared by 'all' Ornithodirans, and are of no phylogenetic relevance in formulating synapomorphies with which to link \"Protoavis\" to birds. A carinate sternum, is present in \"Protoavis,\" and the furcula, though not as initially claimed displaying a hypocleidium or particularly hypertrophied, is present as well. This is all well and good, but considering that both features are present throughout Theropoda, they hardly serve as diagnostic synapomorphies which permit \"Protoavis\" to be allied with Avialae. The pelvic girdle of \"Protoavis\" is most avian in the presence of an antitrochanter, although such is known in Maniraptora as well, thus refuting its advancement as a synapomorphy of \"Protoavis\" and Avialae. Furthermore, the pubic orientation of this specimen is as yet unknown due to the incomplete preservation of the pelvis, and at best, statements to the effect that the pubis was retroverted remain speculative. \n \n How do you account for these discrepancies if \"Protoavis\" is as closely allied to Avialae as you insist?\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Continued:\n \n Your next point:\n \n \"But all this data is what we both already knew, isn&#8217;t it? Do you insist that I list it as an exercise in futility? It certainly won&#8217;t sway you or others who find your opinion on this Forum so distinguished. I think the bad science from you is your unforthcoming presentation of Protoavis, a strategy that confines the fossil to the shadowy realm of &#8220;dubious.&#8221;\"\n \n \n Bad presentation of \"Protoavis?\" On the contrary, I have catalogued the anatomy at hand, and listed in entirety the pertinent literature so that individuals reading this thread can externally check my posts for accuracy. How is this \"unforthcoming\" in presentation?\n \n Your next point:\n \n I never denied that the fossil is possibly chimeric in nature. Does chimera pose an insurmountable grade for paleontologists to climb? Does it always prohibit positive taxonomic identification by trained eyes? I wholeheartedly reject your accusation that I am advancing a claim which precludes a potential chimeric fossil thereby establishing Protoavis as a &#8220;given.&#8221; If two creatures are seen superimposed in that Triassic stone, it is of no consequence &#8211; if a bird is present (as many believe), it will be discovered. \n \n \n If \"Protoavis\" is a chimera than it lacks any nomenclatural reality, and the specimen is useless for phylogenetic analysis since it is not conspecific. This is phylogenetic reconstruction and Linnean protocol 101 here. \n \n Your next point:\n \n I am not guilty of this as you accuse, but I do entertain suspicions about evolutionists. Here&#8217;s an example: birds are the descendants of dinosaurs, but the admission of Protoavis as a taxon poses severe and irreconcilable temporal discontinuity to this theory, so Protoavis is denied legitimacy. Here&#8217;s another: human ancestors can be enthusiastically added to the hominid lineup by virtue of several pieces of a badly crushed skull or jawbone, but Protoavis is disallowed because its skull is &#8220;fragmentary,&#8221; though its distinct birdlike features have been positively identified. Here&#8217;s a third as a hypothetical question: how anxious would paleontology be to dismiss Protoavis as a valid taxon if it were chimeric in nature and badly fragmented, but found in late Jurassic or early Cretaceous stone?\n \n \n \"Protoavis\" present in intractable temporal dilemma to theropod origin? Curious, since Chatterjee who has most exhaustively presented phylogenies based on \"Protoavis\" came to no such conclusion. On the contrary, his 1997 tome was largley based on the assertion that \"Protoavis\" presents compelling data for a Triassic derivation of Avialae from Theropoda. For someone claiming familiarity with this work, that you would assert such a temporal discontinuity issue, is puzzling. As for the hominid material you mention, I hardly claim any particular familiarity with hominid evolution and thus will leave that to others more competent in that area. Your last hypothetical question is easily answered: \"Protoavis\" would have been treated exactly the same way, and building conspiratorial castles of sand such as you have in your last question, will not change that.\n \n Your next point:\n \n \"You won&#8217;t make me bear the onus to prove anything. Besides, the materials do not have to be conspecific to do damage to historically accepted avian evolution. Instead of wasting your energy arguing against what many believe to be the inevitable outcome of this find, I would think a wise man should be working on revising his evolution and making room to welcome Protoavis texensis into avian history or at least making room for the next fossilized bird to come along that antedates Archaeopteryx.\"\n \n Oh, but the burden of proof is indeed on you. You have made sweeping claims about avian phylogeny and \"Protoavis texensis\" and yet provided little data to support those claims. It is elementary, however, that if one is to claim something, they must substantiate it. The remainder of this last paragraph I addressed elsewhere.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

The plain fact remains that according to creationism, there should be no such taxa in the first place.\n \n Point 2: No phyletic progression from early theropods to Avialae, merely chronologically listed or clade based approach to naming dinosaurs.\n \n To be sure, there is not anagenetic or phyletic progression--the derivation of birds is an example of cladogenesis. However, while the list I presented is by default chronological (after all, evolution proceeds over time and cladograms are mapped with time as the x-axis), that list is based on the quantifiable morphologic change in these taxa, which steadily approaches the avian condition. It is not a clade-based approach, though had I chosen to list clades, it would have been just as valid as clades themselves are delimited on anatomical grounds. \n \n Point 3: Triassic tridigitate prints are those of birds\n \n This is possible, but it is extraordinarily hard to identify prints to the species level, or even higher levels in the Linnean hierarchy, and considering that there is no diagnostic difference between the print of an archaic bird and a standard tridactyl theropod, any attempt to definitively say that these Triassic prints belong to birds is wholly speculative. \n \n Point 4: Scales-to-feather evolution is still a valid model\n \n I have already extensively listed the data which renders this nothing more than a myth, and if you wish to still hold to it, you must produce data to support it. \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

Any list you present could be said to be 'chronological'. Archaeopteryx itself has undergone moving on the lines of evolution. It was once hailed as a direct link between birds and reptiles, now it is in a cul-de-sac.\n\n \n \n Let us address your first point, that Archaeopteryx may have just been designed by God to look like it was an anatomical intermediate between Theropoda and Aves. This is a most curious argument that creationists make. It is in fact nothing more than special pleading--here we have a specimen which precisely fits the bill for transitional in the evolutionary sense, and yet, instead of accepting the clear-cut and parsimonious conclusion, you insist that no, it was just made by God to look that way. If the latter option is correct, one can only conclude that God is doing one hell of a job to trick man into thinking his creation evolved. \n \n You furthermore claim that Archaeopteryx is not transitional because it is not the phyletic progenitor of anything. If evolution were merely anagenetic, this would be a problem. As it were, the derivation of birds is a sterling example of cladogenesis, and Archaeopteryx is the sister clade of all other Avialae. It is not the species but its character state which is the most basal known for birds, and which is therefore considered ancestral. To claim that the outgroup status of Archaeopterygiformes somehow precludes its being transitional, is, frankly, indicative of a misunderstanding as to how cladogenesis works.\n \n Your last point, is twofold: that any list is chronological, and that Archaeopteryx was once considered the phyletic progenitor of birds. Both need to be addressed. To former, the answer is actually quite obvious. 'Of course' any list of taxa is going to be chronological...any phylogenetic map must be graphed against time as the x-axis. Now, if one were merely to gather up a group of dinosaurs, starting with medial Jurassic forms and proceeding to the early-medial Cretaceous, and say, voila, here are transitionals, that would be a specious presentation. However, my list (which you can find in earlier posts in this thread--I think pg. 4) is not merely a hodgepodge of dinosaurs assembled by increasing age. It is a list comprised of quantifiable morphologic change over time, which steadily approached and then elaborated on, the avian bauplan. Such a list, grounded in anatomy, cannot merely be waved away. It requires explanation.\n \n Lastly, I find it stunning that you claim Archaeopteryx was once considered the direct ancestor of birds. The first two individuals to extensively review the osteology of the urvogel, Sir Richard Owen and Thomas Henry Huxley both made no such claim. Huxley considered Archaeopteryx an enigmatic side-branch of avian evolution, and Owen of course rejected its status as anything but a bird--albeit strange. A similar treatment runs throughout the work of Seeley, Baur, etc. So, I am at a loss to find where your claim originates. \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

Let us review the basic argument. According to some, the fossil record fails to support gradualistic morphologic change over time, and this assertion was largely at the heart of \"punctuated equilibrium.\" The concept was first implied by Mayr, and later Stanley (1975, 1981, 1982), Gould & Eldredge (1977), Eldredge (1984, 1985), Eldredge & Stanley (1984) and Gould (1980, 1982) modified Mayr's work and promoted a model of evolutionary change in which any given lineage exhibited morphologic stasis over time, followed by rapid ontogenetic changes and diversification. Most vociferously championed by Gould, this viewpoint practically rejected the adaptive power of natural selection, but most egregiously of all, Gould presented it as revolutionary--a breathtaking new development hitherto unthinkable. Like any scientific postulate, tests explicitly geared to uphold or refute this concept of punctuated equilibrium have been carried out, and ironically, none have been more damning thereto, than quantitative analysis of morphologic change in fossil taxa. Considering that Gould and his colleagues claimed the fossil record as their staunchest support, this is most curious. If we give the Gouldian argument the benefit of the doubt, and exclude invertebrates (in which there are literally scores of gradualistic changes over time), and restrict our argument solely to the vertebrates, we can isolate a host of studies which have utterly failed to corroborate Gould's ideas. The most thorough and significant, are those of Paul Gingerich. His 1977, 1980 and 1982 reviews of Cenozoic megafauna entirely failed to demonstrate the sort of punctuational nature of evolutionary change that Gould et al would have predicted. Instead, Gingerich found a persistent trend towards gradual morphologic change over time. The same has been found in multiple studies of Cenozoic mammals, including: Hurzeler (1962), Chaline & Laurin (1986), Fahlbusch (1983), Harris & White (1979), MacFadden (1985), Cronin et al (1981), Maglio (1973) and last but not least Krishtalka & Stucky (1985). Furthermore, similar results have been observed in studies of freshwater teleosts from Miocene deposits of Nevada (Bell et al 1985). The natural question, then, is how does the presentation of punctuated equilibrium advanced by Gould et al, and subsequently parroted by creationists stand up to scrutiny of the fossil record? It doesn't at all. The salient lesson of these studies herein cited is that it is attention to morphology, and not taxonomic detail, which reveals the true nature of evolutionary change over time. How do you account for the significant amount of data refuting the punctuational argument that you have advanced?\n \n As a side note, it must further be stressed that this entire argument forces a false dichotomy on evolution: it is either punctuational, or entirely gradualistic. Yet reality does not conform to this limited view. Indeed, G. G. Simpsons terms: bradyteyly, horoteyly, and tachyteyly are by far superior in expressing the plastic nature of rate of change amongst taxa (Simpson 1944, Carroll 1988). \n \n Here are the appropriate references:\n \n Stanley, S.

I&#8217;m sure you can see how such a discovery would serve to pull the scientific world together, begin to galvanize your theories, and start to make believers out of skeptics.\n \n Ok, so here it is &#8211; the question. Can you do it? From the fossil record, can you show me and others the gradual development of the furculum and the large, deep sternum in dinosaurs that would be essential for eventual flight?\n\n \n First and foremost, I find it sublimely ironic that you should be urging attention to morphology, which is something I have been doing from the get-go. The irony is made all the more sublime considering that your previous arguments for punctuated equilibrium being a disproof for gradualistic evolution, are entirely contigent upon attention to taxonomic convention, and 'not' anatomy. This aside, let us address your challenge: provide evidence from the fossil record of the gradual development of the furcula and carinate sternum in dinosaurs. Excellent, and not at all hard. Let us look at the phylogenetic map of Theropoda, and isolate the taxa where these characters appear, their initial morphology, and their subsequent ontogenetic variation over time, leading first to the par-avian and then the bona fide avian condition. \n \n Furculae first appear in the Allosauroidea, being present in Allosaurus fragilis itself. In Allosauroidea the furcula is shallow and incipient. The presence of furcula in Allosauroidea indicates that it may be a synapomorphy of Neotetanurae itself, which pushes the origin of the structure back to the terminal Triassic at earliest and early Jurassic at latest. \n \n The earliest appearance of a furcula in Coelurosauria--the containing clade for Maniraptora and thus of more phylogenetic relevance than Allosauroidea--is in Scipionyx samniticus, from the Aptian. The furcula is rather more robust in this basal coelurosaur than in its larger allosauroid cousins, although it is still not as hypertrophied as later maniraptoran furculae. Further derivation of furculae in the coelurosaurian lineage includes their presence in Tyrannosauroidea, the sister clade of Maniraptora. Tyrannosauroids displaying furculae include Gorgosaurus libratus in which the furcula is nearly as robust as that of velociraptorines, and Daspletosaurus torosus, in which the furcula is more gracile and may indicate a character reversal to the earlier furcula morphology observed in basal coelurosaurs. \n \n The most par-avian of furculae, appear within Maniraptora. They are present in Sinornithosaurus millenni, in which the furcula is as robust as that of Archaeopteryx, in Ingenia yanshini where indeed the furcula exhibits a 'greater' degree of hypertrophy than that seen in the urvogel, in Oviraptor spp., in which the furcula is equally robust as that seen in Ingenia, and finally, robust furculae are known from multiple velociraptorine specimens. \n \n Thus traced, we have gradualistic variation following the derivation of the furcula, in which it progresses from the basal state, to the par-avian, to the avian. You must find a way to explain away the clearly preserved furculae of multiple theropod lineages, to refute these data. \n \n Now let us turn to sterna. Ossified sterna lacking carinas first appear amongst the basal Neotetanurae and Allosauroidea, particularly in Xuanhanosaurus qilixiaensis and Sinraptor spp. In these taxa the sterna are fairly small, and lack derived sternocostal articulations. Nevertheless, as early as Sinraptor spp. we see an incipient carina of the sternum, hinting at the hypertrophy of this element in Coelurosauria.\n \n Sterna are persistent elements of the pectoral girdle throughout Coelurosauria, and are seen in both Tyrannosauroidea (namely Gorgosaurus libratus), in basal form, and in Maniraptoriformes and Maniraptora in increasingly par-avian morphology. The sterna of oviraptors are largely ossified and no longer cartilaginous, and display an incipient carina. Indeed, the oviraptorosaur sterna are more robust than those of the urvogel and are no smaller than those seen in archaic avian lineages, such as the confuciusornithids. The same holds true for the sterna of velociraptorines, which are indeed larger than those of oviraptorosaurs (and they dwarf those of Archaeopteryx). Perhaps most daming is the fact that Rahonavis and the Alvarezsaurs, possess sterna which are more strongly carinate than the earliest Avialae. \n \n And here we are again, a nice, gradualistic change in character state for the sternum. To refute these data one must somehow account for the presence of sterna in these dinosaurs, and moreover, why they should appear to grow increasingly avian in form, over time. The same holds true with the case of the furculae.\n \n Last but not least, you make a statement about quantifying the characters which make a bird, a bird, and then working backwards as it were to isolate taxa which were and were not, birds. I fully concur, and eagerly await your list of autapomorphies of birds.\n \n And finally, references. For the discussion of the furculae I really must refer the reader to Fig. 10.10 in Paul (2002), but a full list of the most important work on dinosaurian furculae includes the following, whose full citations I will have to provide in another post subsequent to this: \n \n Barsbold 1983, Chure & Madsen 1996, Norell et al 1997, 1998, Ji 1998, Makovickyu & Currie 1998, Sasso & Signore 1998, Xu, Tang & Wang 1999, Xu, Tang & Wu 1999, Burnham et al 2000, Downs 2000. \n \n The references for the data on dinosaur sterna:\n \n Burnham & Zhou 1999, Xu, Wang & Wu 1999, Perle et al 1993, Currie & Zhao 1993, Paul 1988, Paul 2002. \n \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

The presence of furcula in Allosauroidea indicates that it may be a synapomorphy of Neotetanurae itself, which pushes the origin of the structure back to the terminal Triassic at earliest and early Jurassic at latest. \n \n The earliest appearance of a furcula in Coelurosauria--the containing clade for Maniraptora and thus of more phylogenetic relevance than Allosauroidea--is in Scipionyx samniticus, from the Aptian. The furcula is rather more robust in this basal coelurosaur than in its larger allosauroid cousins, although it is still not as hypertrophied as later maniraptoran furculae. Further derivation of furculae in the coelurosaurian lineage includes their presence in Tyrannosauroidea, the sister clade of Maniraptora. Tyrannosauroids displaying furculae include Gorgosaurus libratus in which the furcula is nearly as robust as that of velociraptorines, and Daspletosaurus torosus, in which the furcula is more gracile and may indicate a character reversal to the earlier furcula morphology observed in basal coelurosaurs. \n \n The most par-avian of furculae, appear within Maniraptora. They are present in Sinornithosaurus millenni, in which the furcula is as robust as that of Archaeopteryx, in Ingenia yanshini where indeed the furcula exhibits a 'greater' degree of hypertrophy than that seen in the urvogel, in Oviraptor spp., in which the furcula is equally robust as that seen in Ingenia, and finally, robust furculae are known from multiple velociraptorine specimens. \n \n Thus traced, we have gradualistic variation following the derivation of the furcula, in which it progresses from the basal state, to the par-avian, to the avian. You must find a way to explain away the clearly preserved furculae of multiple theropod lineages, to refute these data. \n \n Now let us turn to sterna. Ossified sterna lacking carinas first appear amongst the basal Neotetanurae and Allosauroidea, particularly in Xuanhanosaurus qilixiaensis and Sinraptor spp. In these taxa the sterna are fairly small, and lack derived sternocostal articulations. Nevertheless, as early as Sinraptor spp. we see an incipient carina of the sternum, hinting at the hypertrophy of this element in Coelurosauria.\n \n Sterna are persistent elements of the pectoral girdle throughout Coelurosauria, and are seen in both Tyrannosauroidea (namely Gorgosaurus libratus), in basal form, and in Maniraptoriformes and Maniraptora in increasingly par-avian morphology. The sterna of oviraptors are largely ossified and no longer cartilaginous, and display an incipient carina. Indeed, the oviraptorosaur sterna are more robust than those of the urvogel and are no smaller than those seen in archaic avian lineages, such as the confuciusornithids. The same holds true for the sterna of velociraptorines, which are indeed larger than those of oviraptorosaurs (and they dwarf those of Archaeopteryx). Perhaps most daming is the fact that Rahonavis and the Alvarezsaurs, possess sterna which are more strongly carinate than the earliest Avialae. \n \n And here we are again, a nice, gradualistic change in character state for the sternum. To refute these data one must somehow account for the presence of sterna in these dinosaurs, and moreover, why they should appear to grow increasingly avian in form, over time. The same holds true with the case of the furculae.\n\n \n I have not even begun to research your claims here and am readily identifying gaps and reverse evolution and temporal discontinuity. Why do you solidly claim a \"nice gradualistic change in character state\" for these features? Here is just one contradiction from your post several days ago (after some research, other conflicts with regard to gradualism will be shown):\n \n The lack of a robust, carinate sternum, ossified uncinate processes, a basal sternocostal morphology, the incipient nature of the acrocoracoid and acromion process, and lack of a triosseal canal system indicating that the supracoracoideus and pectoralis major were still fairly generalized comparative to Pygostylia, suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a skilled aerialist",

The simple fact of the matter is that Theropoda have furculae, and sterna, and in some, they are indeed as robust or more so, than those of Avialae proper. You have yet to demonsrate how they do not, or how there is not gradual morphologic change in these features leading to the avian condition. \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

How will you definitively show me and others that the Allosaurus fragilis furculum was really a \"robust-furculum-in-progress?\" 2) Was or was not the furculum of Allosaurus fragilis a development of Neotetanurae and how will you prove your answer by the fossil record?

Have we now shifted to Coelurosauria and Scipionyx samniticus? If so, we are left with a major gap or are you counting on the \"incipient\" furculum found in a \"cousin\" Allosaurus fragilis to address this problem? I am not sure you should be allowed to do this. What if we were dealing with kiwis and emus, both of the order Struthioniformes, where, say, kiwis were progenitors of true flight but emus were a bifurcation? Should I not insist that you stay with kiwis and demonstrate the gradual development of avian features through its lineage alone? I see your change in direction as a problem.\n \n Aside from that however, you are still faced with a gap. How will you move Allosaurus fragilis along in the fossil record to Scipionyx samniticus and convincingly present the gradual development of the furculum from \"incipient\" to \"rather more robust?\" And, in a temporal sense, will this be a lateral movement or a forward movement? \n \n \nalthough it is still not as hypertrophied as later maniraptoran furculae.

Why has our train of thought jumped tracks over to Tyrannosauroidea, unless it is to include a few instances of a near robust furculum in antecedents of Sinornithosaurus millenni and Archaeopteryx? Again, I do not know that you should be allowed to do this. Why are you not able to trace a single line of fossil data from Coelurosauria to Avialae without introducing offshoots and parallel branches within clades and families? And please offer a full explanation of why the \"gracile\" furculum in Daspletosaurus torosus apparently throws the evolutionary movement into regression, yet you do not view it as problematic. If you are counting on Daspletosaurus to fill a slot in your continuum, then you are presented with a temporal inconsistency.\n \n But parallel and reverse evolution aside, you are still faced with gaps. Here, your argument has taken us from Scipionyx samniticus and thrown us into a \"sister clade of Maniraptora\" where we must more or less come to some vague agreement with you that the fossil record bears out a smooth, gradualistic development of the furculum from \"rather more robust\" in Scipionyx samniticus to exactly who knows what in Tyrannosauroidea - Gracile? Robust? Remember my clear initial request: can you present \"the non-existence of, then the gradual development of, and finally, the full arrival of a furculum [for flight]\" in these creatures? Here, I must insist that you gradually move us from Scipionyx samniticus all the way through Tyrannosauroidea and use the fossil record to do so, otherwise, one might assume you do not have a clear roadmap to follow.\n \n \nThe most par-avian of furculae, appear within Maniraptora. They are present in Sinornithosaurus millenni, in which the furcula is as robust as that of Archaeopteryx, in Ingenia yanshini where indeed the furcula exhibits a 'greater' degree of hypertrophy than that seen in the urvogel, in Oviraptor spp., in which the furcula is equally robust as that seen in Ingenia, and finally, robust furculae are known from multiple velociraptorine specimens.\n\n \n After trudging through a related clade, we suddenly arrive at Maniraptora where \"robust\" furcula exist in number. Are we to think that the avian lineage came through the related clade or do we need to insist that you lay out clear fossils from Scipionyx samniticus to Sinornithosaurus millenni? If passing through the related clade is acceptable procedure, are we then to believe that you arrived at Sinornithosaurus millenni, who has a furculum \"as robust as that of Archaeopteryx,\" after the \"gracile\" furculum of Daspletosaurus torosus?\n \n Here is the question: Can you or can you not provide a fossil record which plainly and unmistakably establishes the non-existence of, then the gradual development of, and finally, the full arrival of an avian furculum in dinosaurs? If you are unable to do this as you claimed you could, and instead, you begin arguing from a gradualistic clade-to-clade or family-to-family approach, we will have no choice but to suspect that, whether intentionally or by default, you espouse punctuated equilibrium. To be sure, your argument here smacks of punctuated equilibrium already.\n \n A final note. Creationism and punctuated equilibrium are not bedfellows. Somehow or other, I feel, you have been led to believe that creationists adopted that theory after having applauded Gould's admission of serious gaps in the fossil record. Nothing could be further from the truth. Creationists and Gould remained antagonists until his demise. Though some splinter group of creationists may hold to the theory of punctuated equilibrium, I do not nor does any creationist I personally know. \n \n I do not intend to address the sternum or any more anatomical features until I am satisfied with answers to my questions or until we both agree that the fossil record is too scanty at present to prove your assertions.",

   "\n \n \n As always, let us address the points offered. \n \n Your first:\n \n \"You have already started with assumptions. 1) &#8220;Shallow and incipient&#8221; are your words hinting at an infant state of the furculum. How will you definitively show me and others that the Allosaurus fragilis furculum was really a &#8220;robust-furculum-in-progress?&#8221; 2) Was or was not the furculum of Allosaurus fragilis a development of Neotetanurae and how will you prove your answer by the fossil record?

In the case of Allosaurus fragilis, there is no other way to describe the furcula--it 'is' both shallow and incipient. Had one looked at the element, which I highly doubt you have done, one would see this. \n \n Now, you proceed to make several demands: first, how will one demonstrate that from the incipient level seen in Allosaurus fragilis, a robust furcula may have been derived. The answer is most obviously by comparative analysis with other clades. If furculae are apomorphic of Neotetanurae the fossil record should demonstrate that furculae are limited in distribution to members of this lineage. And that is precisely what we see. Furculae remain exclusively neotetanuran traits. The implications, are such: if furculae are synapomorphic of Neotetanurae, then in derived members of this clade they would be symplesiomorphies. The common ancestor of the major neotetanuran lineages would have possessed a furcula, as evidenced by its immediate presence in basal Carnosauria (i.e., Allosauroidea) and basal Coelurosauria (e.g., Scipionyx samniticus). The shared presence of this trait allies Neotetanurae as a clade (among other such synapomorphies). Thus is settled the question of whether furculae are indeed characters of Neotetanurae.\n \n You then demand that one provide the outgroup of Neotetanurae, in which furculae were absent, and data to support their affinity. The outgroup taxon to Neotetanurae is Spinosauroidea (sensu Sereno), and the shared tetanuran status of these sister clades is based on the following list of synapomorphic characters (after Dodson et al 1990):\n \n a) Lack of an enlarged dentary fang\n b) Presence of a maxillary fenestra\n c) Dentition restricted to the antorbital region of the skull\n d) Scapula straplike\n e) Proximal half of metacarpal I contacts metacarpal II\n f) Fourth manal digit absent\n g) An obturator process of the ischium is present\n h) A pubic \"boot\" is present\n i) Metatarsal III proximally compressed\n j) Ascending process of the astragalus well-developed\n \n Compare this to the synapomorphic list of Neotetanurae:\n \n a) Foramen or foramina opening laterally at the angle of the lacrimal\n b) Surangular deep\n c) Axial neural spines reduced\n d) Chevrons possess craniodorsal prongs\n e) The glenoid is expanded from the narrow and parallel/subparallel scapula\n f) The brevis shelf of the ilium is narrowed\n g) The femoral head is inclined dorsally from the greater trochanter\n h) The lesser trochanter is winglike\n i) The extensor groove of the distal femur is well-developed\n j) Furculae present\n \n Spinosauroidea, while possessing the characters listed as synapomorphic of Tetanurae (and thus qualifying as tetanurans) do not possess the characters present in the latter list, and thus cannot be grouped with Neotetanurae--they are the outgroup thereto. That should wrap up your first point. \n \n You then assert that:\n \n \"Exactly what line do you intend on developing the avian furculum through? Have we now shifted to Coelurosauria and Scipionyx samniticus? If so, we are left with a major gap or are you counting on the &#8220;incipient&#8221; furculum found in a &#8220;cousin&#8221; Allosaurus fragilis to address this problem? I am not sure you should be allowed to do this. What if we were dealing with kiwis and emus, both of the order Struthioniformes, where, say, kiwis were progenitors of true flight but emus were a bifurcation? Should I not insist that you stay with kiwis and demonstrate the gradual development of avian features through its lineage alone? I see your change in direction as a problem.\"\n \n \n This entire diatribe is wholly irrelevant--I have not \"shifted\" anything. Coelurosauria is a component clade of Neotetanurae, and I have been explicit all along that furculae are neotetanuran traits. Your lack of familiarity with the phylogenetics of Theropoda will not underwrite attempts to inject non-existent ambiguities and cladistic waffling into my argument. Had I argued something along the lines of discussing furculae in, say, Spinosauria, and Neotetanurae, and claiming a gradualistic progression from one to the other, THEN my argument would be inexcusably \"shifting\" the phylogenetic map to fit my conclusion. However, as I have done no such thing, the allegation you present in this paragraph is entirely specious. \n \n You then go on to say:\n \n \"Aside from that however, you are still faced with a gap. How will you move Allosaurus fragilis along in the fossil record to Scipionyx samniticus and convincingly present the gradual development of the furculum from &#8220;incipient&#8221; to &#8220;rather more robust?&#8221; And, in a temporal sense, will this be a lateral movement or a forward movement?\"\n \n \n Since both are Neotetanurae, one has no need to artificially ally Allosaurus fragilis and Scipionyx samniticus--they are both members of the same containing clade. The physically more robust furcula of the latter is congruent with the prediction of theropod origin that in Coelurosauria, the furcula became hypertrophied, in the par-avian and finally avian manner. Graphically speaking, this is both a movement along the y-axis of the cladogram, and the x-axis of the cladogram.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Continued:\n \n Your next point:\n \n \"Gaps, parallel evolution, and reverse evolution, suggesting temporal discontinuity, all plague your paragraph. Why has our train of thought jumped tracks over to Tyrannosauroidea, unless it is to include a few instances of a near robust furculum in antecedents of Sinornithosaurus millenni and Archaeopteryx? Again, I do not know that you should be allowed to do this. Why are you not able to trace a single line of fossil data from Coelurosauria to Avialae without introducing offshoots and parallel branches within clades and families? And please offer a full explanation of why the &#8220;gracile&#8221; furculum in Daspletosaurus torosus apparently throws the evolutionary movement into regression, yet you do not view it as problematic. If you are counting on Daspletosaurus to fill a slot in your continuum, then you are presented with a temporal inconsistency.\"\n \n \n First and foremost your assertion that homoplasy and parallelism reflect \"temporal discontinuity\" must be addressed. It is, quite frankly, entirely unsubstantiated. These processes of yielding similar yet non-homologous traits channeled by either function or shared ancestry (respectively), have 'nothing' to do with any given temporal distribution. They refer to morphological variation alone, and your claim to the contrary, demands that you produce citations to support such a radical conflation of temporal distribution and homoplasy/parallelism. \n \n Now we can address why Tyrannosauroidea are discussed. As the outrgroup of Maniraptora, they are crucial in determining character polarity in the latter clade, and establishing synapomorphies with which to unite Maniraptora such that it is holophyletic. Together, Tyrannosauroidea and Maniraptora constitute Maniraptoriformes, and the presence and dervied morphology of furculae in both clades, supports arguments that furculae were further developed by selective pressures above the basal neotetanuran level. Your serious lack of familiarity with the phylogenetic map of Theropoda is further illustrated by your claim that Tyrannosauroidea are \"antecedents of Sinornithosaurus millenni and Archaeopteryx.\" As Tyrannosauroidea is the sister clade of Maniraptora, this is quite incorrect, and neither I, nor any dinosaur paleontologist of whom I am aware, has made such a claim. If anything, your linking Tyrannosauroidae directly to birds (via the urvogel) smacks of Alan Feduccia's vitriolic strawmen. Similarly, your claim that I cannot present a single line from Coelurosauria to Avialae is erroneous--I have done just that, which you would recognize were you more inclined to actually look at the phylogeny of Theropoda. The clades I have discussed are nested within in each other: Allosauroidea and Coelurosauria within Neotetanurae, Tyrannosauroidea and Maniraptora within Maniraptoriformes, Avialae and Deinonychosauria within Maniraptora, and so on. They present precisely the \"single line\" you so vociferously demanded as they represent a robust and morphologically unambiguous lineage. Indeed, do not take my word for it, try actually referring to the sources I have so copiously cited. \n \n Lastly for this paragraph, you address the possible character reversal to a gracile furcula in Daspletosaurus torsus. You will note that I did not authoritatively claim it was such, I suggested it as a possibilty. Compared to the furcula of Gorgosaurus libratus, that of Daspletosaurus is somewhat more gracile, and thus may represent a mild character reversal--though given the uncertainties regarding the exact phylogenetic position of Gorgosaurus vis-a-vis Daspletosaurus, this has yet to be demonstrated conclusively. As it were, this matter is neither a problem of temporal distribution as you claim, nor is it a fatal blow to the gradual derivation of the furcula from incipient state in basal neotetanurans to the avian state in derived Maniraptora.\n \n You proceed to repeat yourself: \n \n \"Here is the question: Can you or can you not provide a fossil record which plainly and unmistakably establishes the non-existence of, then the gradual development of, and finally, the full arrival of an avian furculum in dinosaurs? If you are unable to do this as you claimed you could, and instead, you begin arguing from a gradualistic clade-to-clade or family-to-family approach, we will have no choice but to suspect that, whether intentionally or by default, you espouse punctuated equilibrium. To be sure, your argument here smacks of punctuated equilibrium already.\"\n \n I have already done just that--which your unfamiliarity with theropod phylogeny has not negated. Let me present a simple list, charting the pattern of furcula development over time:\n \n Neotetanurae \n Carnosauria\n Allosauroidea\n Coelurosauria\n Maniraptoriformes\n Tyrannosauroidea\n Maniraptora\n Eumaniraptora\n Deinonychosauria\n Avialae\n Archaeopteryx\n Aves\n \n The character state of the furcula at each node can be summarized as follows: \n \n Neotetanurae: Furculae present; shallow and not hypertrophied.\n \n Carnosauria+Allosauroidea: Furculae shallow though more derived than the neotetanuran norm, as indicated by an incipient cartilaginous ridge homologous to the ossified carina.\n \n Coelurosauria: Furculae displaying incipient carina, and more robust than in basal neotetanurans and allosaurs.\n \n Maniraptoriformes: Angle formed by clavicles increasingly acute, furculae more robust than in coelurosaurian outgroups and basal Coelurosauria, carina incipient or absent in some taxa.\n \n Tyrannosauroidea: Furculae robust, though clavicle-angle shallow. \n \n Maniraptora: Furculae as robust as that of Avialae, with clavicle-angle approaching the acuteness seen in Aves. Carina present and well-developed in some taxa.\n \n Eumaniraptora: Furculae at least as robust as those of modern birds, carina well developed in some taxa.\n \n Deinonychosauria: Furculae more robust in some component taxa, than those seen in basal-Avialae and Aves.\n \n Avialae+Archaeopteryx: Furculae no more robust than those of Deinonychosauria\n \n Aves: Furculae fully avian in morphology, including the derivation of a hypocleidium.\n \n Together these lists should clarify for one not well versed in theropod phylogeny, the progression I have demonstrated and argued for. \n \n On a final note, I hardly see how an argument which has asserted gradualistic change over time, \"smacks\" of punctuated equilibria. Only your introduction of non-existent temporal gaps has suggested anything like that. In reviewing your arguments as to the development of the dinosaur furcula, you have: a)failed to refute the presence of furculae, b)failed to refute the gradual change of the furcula in nested lineages approaching the avian condition, and c)failed to show that the progression I presented is not nested and therefore a \"single line\" to use your term, and moreover, indicated your lack of familiarity with the science of phylogenetic reconstruction for Theropoda.\n \n Your comment on Gould, his version of punk eek, and creationism, interests me. In my many conversations with creationists, and my review of their literature, punk eek as presented by Gould has time and again been hailed as tacit admission by evolutionary biologists that the Darwinian paradigm of gradual morphologic variation is bankrupt. Gould has in fact been indirectly praised for giving creationism such ammunition, by no less than the likes of Morris and Denton (if memory serves, it was Denton, though I may be wrong). While the creationist movement may not have any official position on punk eek, it remains the viewpoint of most creationists I have debated with, that punk eek reflects the failure of evolution to account for the fossil record. \n \n And finally, your refusal to address the derivatio of the avian sterna until you are \"satisfied\" with the discussion as to the derivation of the furcula, is a most excellent filibuster--you can delay ever having to discuss the sternum by endless obfuscating of the current topic. \n \n The only reference cited herein, for which I have not provided a full citation in previous posts, is the following:\n \n Dodson et al. 1990.

I wanted a gap-filler or several gap-fillers from zero \"0\" furcula to the \"incipient\" arrival.\n \n You then assert that:\n \n \"Exactly what line do you intend on developing the avian furculum through? Have we now shifted to Coelurosauria and Scipionyx samniticus? If so, we are left with a major gap or are you counting on the \"incipient\" furculum found in a \"cousin\" Allosaurus fragilis to address this problem? I am not sure you should be allowed to do this. What if we were dealing with kiwis and emus, both of the order Struthioniformes, where, say, kiwis were progenitors of true flight but emus were a bifurcation? Should I not insist that you stay with kiwis and demonstrate the gradual development of avian features through its lineage alone? I see your change in direction as a problem.\"\n \n \n This entire diatribe is wholly irrelevant--I have not \"shifted\" anything. Coelurosauria is a component clade of Neotetanurae, and I have been explicit all along that furculae are neotetanuran traits. Your lack of familiarity with the phylogenetics of Theropoda will not underwrite attempts to inject non-existent ambiguities and cladistic waffling into my argument. Had I argued something along the lines of discussing furculae in, say, Spinosauria, and Neotetanurae, and claiming a gradualistic progression from one to the other, THEN my argument would be inexcusably \"shifting\" the phylogenetic map to fit my conclusion. However, as I have done no such thing, the allegation you present in this paragraph is entirely specious. \n \n You then go on to say:\n \n \"Aside from that however, you are still faced with a gap. How will you move Allosaurus fragilis along in the fossil record to Scipionyx samniticus and convincingly present the gradual development of the furculum from \"incipient\" to \"rather more robust?\" And, in a temporal sense, will this be a lateral movement or a forward movement?\"\n \n \n Since both are Neotetanurae, one has no need to artificially ally Allosaurus fragilis and Scipionyx samniticus--they are both members of the same containing clade. The physically more robust furcula of the latter is congruent with the prediction of theropod origin that in Coelurosauria, the furcula became hypertrophied, in the par-avian and finally avian manner. Graphically speaking, this is both a movement along the y-axis of the cladogram, and the x-axis of the cladogram.[/QUOTE]\n \n This is not good here. The gap is too wide. Never mind that they are of the same clade. The disparity of the anatomy needs more explanation. To graph with x and y coordinates does not solve the problem of gradualism.",

Considering that the clavicles of which furculae are comprised are alreadly splintlike in the basal Tetanurae, the sort of distal fusion of the clavicles yielding an incipient furcula seen in allosaurs, is precisely what should be seen, and is the intermediary stage from unfused clavicles to the first par-avian furcula. If this is not satisfactory, then perhaps you should explicitly detail what a proto-furcula or incipient furcula SHOULD look like.\n \n What gap are you talking about? What anatomical disparity? Explicitly isolate the osteological characters which you feel produce a \"gap\" between the members of the clades I delineated, so as to preclude their presentation as a \"single line\" of neotetanuran descent, in which the furcula from basal condition, was subsequently modified to the avian condition. You utterly failed to refute any of the synapomorphies underwriting holophyly of the clades listed (which is precisely what one must do to discredit the validity of presenting furculae as neotetanuran traits), and moreover you failed to demonstrate how a pattern of punctuational as opposed to gradualistic change is seen in these material. \n \n Needless to say, such a list will be most interesting to see, since a list so damning to the standard phylogenetic map of Neotetanurae has yet to be uncovered by multiple reviews of the taxon.

   "Continued:\n \n Your next point:\n \n \"Gaps, parallel evolution, and reverse evolution, suggesting temporal discontinuity, all plague your paragraph. Why has our train of thought jumped tracks over to Tyrannosauroidea, unless it is to include a few instances of a near robust furculum in antecedents of Sinornithosaurus millenni and Archaeopteryx? Again, I do not know that you should be allowed to do this. Why are you not able to trace a single line of fossil data from Coelurosauria to Avialae without introducing offshoots and parallel branches within clades and families? And please offer a full explanation of why the \"gracile\" furculum in Daspletosaurus torosus apparently throws the evolutionary movement into regression, yet you do not view it as problematic. If you are counting on Daspletosaurus to fill a slot in your continuum, then you are presented with a temporal inconsistency.\"\n \n \n First and foremost your assertion that homoplasy and parallelism reflect \"temporal discontinuity\" must be addressed. It is, quite frankly, entirely unsubstantiated. These processes of yielding similar yet non-homologous traits channeled by either function or shared ancestry (respectively), have 'nothing' to do with any given temporal distribution. They refer to morphological variation alone, and your claim to the contrary, demands that you produce citations to support such a radical conflation of temporal distribution and homoplasy/parallelism.\n\n \n If I seem to be rushing, it's because I am. No, I think we will continue to have a difference of opinion here. \n \n \nNow we can address why Tyrannosauroidea are discussed. As the outrgroup of Maniraptora, they are crucial in determining character polarity in the latter clade, and establishing synapomorphies with which to unite Maniraptora such that it is holophyletic. Together, Tyrannosauroidea and Maniraptora constitute Maniraptoriformes, and the presence and dervied morphology of furculae in both clades, supports arguments that furculae were further developed by selective pressures above the basal neotetanuran level. Your serious lack of familiarity with the phylogenetic map of Theropoda is further illustrated by your claim that Tyrannosauroidea are \"antecedents of Sinornithosaurus millenni and Archaeopteryx.\" As Tyrannosauroidea is the sister clade of Maniraptora, this is quite incorrect, and neither I, nor any dinosaur paleontologist of whom I am aware, has made such a claim. If anything, your linking Tyrannosauroidae directly to birds (via the urvogel) smacks of Alan Feduccia's vitriolic strawmen. Similarly, your claim that I cannot present a single line from Coelurosauria to Avialae is erroneous--I have done just that, which you would recognize were you more inclined to actually look at the phylogeny of Theropoda. The clades I have discussed are nested within in each other: Allosauroidea and Coelurosauria within Neotetanurae, Tyrannosauroidea and Maniraptora within Maniraptoriformes, Avialae and Deinonychosauria within Maniraptora, and so on. They present precisely the \"single line\" you so vociferously demanded as they represent a robust and morphologically unambiguous lineage. Indeed, do not take my word for it, try actually referring to the sources I have so copiously cited..\n\n \n I disagree with your sources. Copiously citing them does not make them correct or necessarily mean the scientific world agrees. This nesting within clades gives a picture of producing gradually developing forms but the idea may not be upheld by all as the answer to the problem with fossils. Please don't get upset here. You have to admit that you \"play\" like a stuck record, because you do seem to have your \"favorites\" that you always read and always quote from, and hence, always believe. But to actually produce a evolutionary continuum for flight in dinosaurs is extremely controversial. Man, if you have really successfully done this or rather, your sources, have done it for you, why am I not hearing the victory shouts all over the scientific world? I am well aware that your sources have handed all this to you and have actually made your job quite easy for these postings, but you are simply going to have to entertain the thought that your sources are not popular with everyone. \n \n \n\n \n Let me present a simple list, charting the pattern of furcula development over time:\n \n Neotetanurae \n Carnosauria\n Allosauroidea\n Coelurosauria\n Maniraptoriformes\n Tyrannosauroidea\n Maniraptora\n Eumaniraptora\n Deinonychosauria\n Avialae\n Archaeopteryx\n Aves\n \n The character state of the furcula at each node can be summarized as follows: ..\n\n \n I'm sorry, but you have gone to a lot of trouble, but I think your entire exercise is one in futility. By sending me clades, you have caused us to arrive again at the impasse we found ourselves in previously. This offering does not fulfull what I have asked of you. Each of these clades represents how many fossils? All more or less have a furcula but not necessarily in the form we are looking for. Oh yes, I know, below you will show me how there \"seems\" to be a gradual development over time, but isn't this just somehow \"picking\" the best fossils from the group to make the point? I know. I know, you will have some kind of academic \"come back\" to try and put me to shame. But here's the long and short of it - why, are you (or rather your sources) the first to discover and piece together such a perfect slice of evolution? Why am I hearing it from you alone? You must understand that that single fact throws suspicion on the entire endeavor. I can only think that what is being offered here is nothing more than a hypothesis that has been advanced. Do you mind if I wait for the peer reviews? Again, I have heard nothing in the scientific community that claims that a set of fossils has conclusively proved an evolutionary continuum. \n \n Neotetanurae: Furculae present; shallow and not hypertrophied.\n \n Carnosauria+Allosauroidea: Furculae shallow though more derived than the neotetanuran norm, as indicated by an incipient cartilaginous ridge homologous to the ossified carina.\n \n Coelurosauria: Furculae displaying incipient carina, and more robust than in basal neotetanurans and allosaurs.\n \n Maniraptoriformes: Angle formed by clavicles increasingly acute, furculae more robust than in coelurosaurian outgroups and basal Coelurosauria, carina incipient or absent in some taxa.\n \n Tyrannosauroidea: Furculae robust, though clavicle-angle shallow. \n \n Maniraptora: Furculae as robust as that of Avialae, with clavicle-angle approaching the acuteness seen in Aves. Carina present and well-developed in some taxa.\n \n Eumaniraptora: Furculae at least as robust as those of modern birds, carina well developed in some taxa.\n \n Deinonychosauria: Furculae more robust in some component taxa, than those seen in basal-Avialae and Aves.\n \n Avialae+Archaeopteryx: Furculae no more robust than those of Deinonychosauria\n \n Aves: Furculae fully avian in morphology, including the derivation of a hypocleidium.\n \n Together these lists should clarify for one not well versed in theropod phylogeny, the progression I have demonstrated and argued for. \n \n \nOn a final note, I hardly see how an argument which has asserted gradualistic change over time, \"smacks\" of punctuated equilibria. Only your introduction of non-existent temporal gaps has suggested anything like that. \n \n\n \n The foregoing remarks regarding PE may or may not be true about your clade list. I am actually going to submit it for review myself to some sources I know. I still think it looks a lot like PE. Sorry again if I upset you with that, but you have actually claimed something in evolution that I have never, ever seen anyone successfully claim, and it simply must go for further review. A more trained set of eyes will doubtless consider major weaknesses that I have easily overlooked. Thanks for trying. This has been fun and informative. You are quite the formidable opponent and I truly feel sorry for the next person who \"takes you on.\" I hope to get back with you in the near future with further comments on your evolutionary miracle! \n \n In submitting the foregoing, I want to make it clear to my opponent and to the Forum and to all who look in, that my comments are in no wise a capitulation or concession. Quite the contrary! It can best be described by this: My opponent and I find ourselves in utter disagreement about the supposed continuity preserved in the earth's fossil record regarding the science of macro evolution. Better minds of academia than either mine or my opponent's have gone to great lengths to verify that no such continuum exists. For me to suddenly break from that safety of knowledge they offer would be far from \"good science\" and to put it bluntly, \"I can't go there.\" My opponent has offered something quite incredulous looking at first blush, and wisdom demands a thorough going over of the hypothesis and assertions before jumping to any conclusion that evolution has finally been proved, albeit on a small scale, i.e., dinosarus to birds. I will be back in the fray just as soon as I hear from some sources I trust. Good day to all.",

Let us make one thing perfectly clear, however. The sources I have cited I have not done so as an argument from authority but rather to make explicit the work which I have used as my reference-base, and to make available the literature concerning therpod phylogeny, and avian origins. Unlike you, who during the \"Protoavis\" debate literally did argue from authority (recall: \"If Kurochkin thinks it's a birds...\"), I have yet to do so, and your implication to the contrary rightly demands that you identify where I have explicitly stated that because one authority says something, it is therefore true. \n \n Next, you maintain that there is profound debate in the paleontological community as to the validity of the theropod origin of birds. There is nothing of the sort. But for a small contingent of paleornithologists, such as Alan Feduccia, Sam Tarsitano, M. K. Hecht and Larry Martin, theropod origin has been almost universally accepted by Paleontology. And the reason? The data--which you so stunningly demonstrate an ability to avoid and run away from. Invoke whatever meaningless conspiracy theories you like, but the fact remains that theropod origin has stood its ground and gained support in the last thirty years of tests thereto. The debate is no longer whether or not dinosaurs are the ancestors of birds, but rather which dinosaurs, and are some of the most par-avian, actually neo-flightless post-urvogels?\n \n \n notsofast:\n \n \"I'm sorry, but you have gone to a lot of trouble, but I think your entire exercise is one in futility.

I offered data to support the monophyly of Neotetanurae, which you called into question (implicitly denying). I, unlike you, have throughout this entire thread explicitly stated the anatomical data which supports or refutes a position. In attempting to deconstruct the evolution of the furcula and the phylogeny of Neotetanurae--in which the origin of birds is included, you have provided no anatomical data to support your conclusions (instead providing categorical rejections and conceptual and personal ad hominems), offered no references for external checks, and instead have either deliberately or uninentionally obfuscated theropod phylogeny due to your complete lack of familiarity with cladistic methods of phylogenetic reconstruction. Your allegation that I have manipulated the clades listed to isolate nice taxa which I feel support my case is outright disingenuousness, I have done nothing of the sort, and in fact have gone out of my way to include as many taxa as possible to provide the most inclusive data-set for a phylogenetic analysis.\n \n I think you entirely fail to realize the enormity of what you are attempting to refute: the entire case for holophyly of Neotetanurae, and component clades. Nothing less will do if one attempts to disprove theropod origin. Your argument begs detailed and point by point refutation of each and every synapomorphy which upholds holophyly of Neotetanurae, and its component clades, including not in the least, refutation of the pathway for furcula derivation I have presented. Your implicit claim that I am merely pulling these data from thin-air is entirely specious, and I have exhaustively cited the appropriate references to show just the opposite.

C. 20560\n 1 November 1999\n \n OPEN LETTER TO:\n \n Dr. Peter Raven, Secretary\n PRaven@nas.org\n Committee for Research and Exploration\n National Geographic Society\n Washington, DC 20036\n \n Dear Peter,\n \n I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society.\n \n With the publication of \"Feathers for T. rex?\" by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue, National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic, unsubstantiated, tabloid journalism. But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature.\n \n Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas \"will later name\" the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis, there is no longer any need for him to do so. \n \n Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen \"accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon,\" the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Article 13a, i). This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists---that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist. Clearly, National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters.\n \n Sloan's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that \"the Czerkases now plan to return it to China.\" In Washington, in June of 1996, more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution, held at the Smithsonian Institution, were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation.\n \n There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message. Thus, at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband.\n \n Most, if not all, major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin. The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material, but has sensationalized, and is now exhibiting, an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally, administratively, and perhaps legally, off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions.\n \n Prior to the publication of the article \"Dinosaurs Take Wing\" in the July 1998 National Geographic, Lou Mazzatenta, the photographer for Sloan's article, invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story. At that time, I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present, but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs.\n \n Sloan's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that \"makes\" the news rather than reporting it. His bald statement that \"we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals\" is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists, so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing. This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology, which, of course, are never mentioned.\n \n More importantly, however, none of the structures illustrated in Sloan's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers. Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact. The statement on page 103 that \"hollow, hairlike structures characterize protofeathers\" is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct, so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical.\n \n The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse, and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers. A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers, all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction.\n \n The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion. If Sloan's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia, it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken. But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed, National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode.\n \n Sincerely,\n Storrs L. Olson\n Curator of Birds\n National Museum of Natural History\n Smithsonian Institution\n Washington, DC 20560",

Let me offer a full list (or as full of a list as I can find): \n \n Gingerich (1973), Osmolska (1976), Kurzanov (1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1987), Barsbold (1983), Thulborn (1984, 1985), Currie (1985, 1987), Molnar (1985), Ostrom (1985, 1990, 1991, 1994, 1995), Raath (1985), Wellnhofer (1985, 1988, 1993, 1994), Weems (1987), Carroll (1988), Paul (1988), Chatterjee (1991, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999), Novas (1991, 1997), Rayner (1991), Elzanowski & Wellnhofer (1992, 1993), Sanz & Bonaparte (1992), Sereno & Rao (1992), Currie & Zhao (1993), Russel & Dong (1993), Olshevksy (1994), Perle et al (1994), Chiappe (1995), Chiappe et al (1996, 1997, 1998), Ji & Ji (1996, 1997), Karhu & Rautian (1996), Horner & Dobb (1997), Larson (1997), Norell & Makovicky (1997, 1999), Novas & Puerta (1997), Brit et al (1998), Dingus & Rowe (1998), Forster et al (1998), Griffiths (1998, 2000), Gower & Weber (1998), Holtz (1998, 2000), Ji et al (1998), Padian & Chiappe (1998), Clark et al (1999), Elzanowski (1999), Garner et al (1999), Schweitzer et al (1999), Sereno (1999), Wagner & Gauthier (1999), Barsbold et al (2000), Brochu & Norell (2000), Burnham et al (2000), Christiansen & Bonde (2000), Farlow et al (2000), Martill et al (2000), Rensberger & Watabe (2000), Sumida & Brochu (2000), Xu et al (2000, 2001), Zhou & Wang (2000), Zhou et al (2000), Hutchinson (2001), Ji et al (2001), Norell et al (2001), Paul (2002)\n \n And that list gives your argument the benefit of the doubt by omitting studies which did not exclusively focus on avian origins/phylogeny, but which nonetheless included conclusions on theropod origin. Such a list would include:\n \n Galton (1970, 1974), Wellnhofer (1974), Ostrom (1973, 1974, 1976), Bakker & Galton (1974), Padian (1982), Paul (1984) Bakker (1986), Gauthier & Padian (1985), Gauthier (1986), Holtz (1994), Sereno (1993, 1997), to pull some of the first ones that come to mind.\n \n I am most curious to see how you reconcile such a substantial list of indepdent corroborating studies with your quaint assertion--as yet substantiated by a single letter from Storrs Olson, not even a study of his, just a letter--that the scientific community has rejected theropod origin.\n \n As for the anatomical refutations requisite to your argument, I noticed they still remain in short supply. I can only imagine, that, had I approached my argument by merely cut and pasting quotes and not dealing with anatomy, you would have rightly cried that I was using specious debating tactics, by not addressing the critical points required for my argument to be valid.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "\n \n While I collect my thoughts and prepare a post, I want to share this open letter (now somewhat dated) from Storrs Olson, Curator of Birds, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. To some of you this is old news, but here it is for those who have not read it. It illustrates the divergent opinions surrounding the theropod to bird hypothesis. I like his comment here: &#8220;This melodramatic assertion [that birds are theropods] had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology.&#8221; He goes on to call the whole idea &#8220;one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age.&#8221;\n \n http://www.trueorigin.org/birdevoletter.asp\n \n National Museum of Natural History\n Smithsonian Institution\n Washington, D. C. 20560\n 1 November 1999\n \n OPEN LETTER TO:\n \n Dr. Peter Raven, Secretary\n PRaven@nas.org\n Committee for Research and Exploration\n National Geographic Society\n Washington, DC 20036\n \n \n ...bald statement that &#8220;we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals&#8221; is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists, so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing. This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology, which, of course, are never mentioned.\n \n More importantly, however, none of the structures illustrated in Sloan&#8217;s article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers. Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact. The statement on page 103 that &#8220;hollow, hairlike structures characterize protofeathers&#8221; is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct, so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical.\n \n The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse, and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers. A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers, all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction.\n \n Storrs L. Olson\n Curator of Birds\n National Museum of Natural History\n Smithsonian Institution\n Washington, DC 20560\n\n \n \n As a prelude to whatever anatomical evasions you intend to bring up in the future, I would like to point out that embryology has hardly falsified theropod origin (for reasons which I'll wait to detail until you regale us with the contrary rationale), comparative anatomy remains the single 'strongest' support for theropod origin, and lastly, that Olson's vitriolic assertion about feathers is curious in two regards.\n \n While Olson and his colleagues may be correct in asserting that Sinosauropteryx prima was not feathered (though this is doubtful), neither Olson, nor Feduccia, have yet to address the clear-cut feathery integument and feather homologues observed in Sinornithosaurus millenii, Microraptor gui, Beipiaosaurus inexpectus, or Caudipteryx zhoui, instead remaining conspicuously silent on the matter as a whole. And furthemore, Olson's deriding the idea of a \"proto-feather\" as a fiction is most curious, since when it came to describing the alleged proto-feathers of Longisquama insignis, a \"thecodont,\" Olson like other opponents of theropod origin practically tripped over each other in the race to exalt the dermal appendages of this specimen as precursors to feathers. I find hypocrisy as reprehensible a practice as sentationalist reporting, and I feel that Olson's letter should have in large part, been directed at himself. \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

In this way embryology is one of the principal means of quantifying ontogenetic change. The fact that embryology has been used to help bolster phylogenies based on conventional morphological analysis is most peculiar, considering your assertion that the two are mutually incompatible. \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Here is an abbreviated submission. It has been shortened for two reasons: \n \n 1) I have already anticipated your answers and am really not in the mood to read through a long anatomical discussion in support of your views, and 2) it seems to me that if a single successful counter to the dinosaur to bird hypothesis can be entered into the debate, it should justifiably end the debate, and I believe my final point below to be that entry.\n \n Some key characters linking theropods and birds that are in dispute:\n \n the pubis (Martin 1983a, 1983b, 1991; Tarsitano 1991; also see Wellnhofer 1985), the pelvic nature (Martin 1991; Tarsitano 1991), the nature of the dental construct (Martin, Stewart, and Whetstone 1980); Martin 1991), the ascent and function of the astragalus (Martin, Stewart, and Whetstone 1980; Martin 1991; also see McGowan 1984, 1985 and reply by Martin and Stewart 1985), digit homology (Hinchliffe and Hecht 1984; Hinchliffe 1985; Martin 1991; Tarsitano 1991), the hallux (Tarsitano and Hecht, 1980; Martin 1991; Feduccia 1993a), and the unique semilunate carpal thought to be shared by Deinonychus and Archaeopteryx and modern birds (Martin 1991; Tarsitano 1991). \n \n From Compsognathus to Archaeopteryx - your list:\n \n Compsognathus longipes, Sinosauropteryx prima, Coelurus fragilis, Ornitholestes hermani, Rahonavis ostromi, Unenlagia comahuensis, Beipiaosaurus inexpectus, Sinornithoides spp., Troodon spp., Oviraptor spp., Avimimus portentosus, Protarchaeopteryx robusta, Sinornithosaurus millenni, Microraptor gui, Bambiraptor feinbergorum, Deinonychus antirrhopus, Velociraptor mongoliensis\n \n Your phyletic group is rejected based on grounds of conflicting data, some of which (but by no means all) are enumerated here. \n \n Archaeopteryx is without a reliable ancestor. Compsognathus longipes is rejected as ancestral to Archaeopteryx because both were recovered from the same formation where they existed as contemporaries. The specialized nature of its two digit manus further distances Compsognathus from Archaeopteryx. Along with Ornitholestes hermanni, Compsognathus is known to be a theropod, and both are probably coelurosaurs, but their phylogenetic affinities remain within the arena of debate and thus the specimens are confined to incertae sedis. But removal of Compsognathus from the avian lineage strikes at the very fountainhead of the theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Outside of Compsognathus, no known theropod seems to have been a suitable ancestor to birds.\n \n Dromaeosauridae possessed features too specialized to be included in avian lineage: a second pedal phalanx talon, well-developed and used for slashing prey; a stiffened tail, no doubt to bring stabilization to this agile predator; large, clawed manus, well-suited for grasping and holding prey; and muscular, dentulous jaws for tearing flesh. The common ancestor of dromaeosaurids and birds almost certainly did not possess the conspicuous feature of the raptorial claw, and since it does not appear in the basal bird, Archaeopteryx, or other early birds - Protarchaeopteryx and Caudipteryx - this specialized claw serves to further divide Dromaeosauridae and Avialae. Instead of reinforcing birds' link to dinosaurs, the presence of the raptorial claw in Rahonavis ostromi is really no help at all, given the fact that birds are a monophyletic group, and more derived birds that possess the feature must exist due to convergence. \n \n The absence of feathers on dromaeosaurids is a strike against the theropod position of bird origins and deserves a full explanation. No trace of feathers has been detected on any of the some twenty unearthed specimens.\n \n Digital homology seen in theropods and birds separates the two groups.\n \n The highly specialized avian lung and its sharp dissimilarities to that of theropod dinosaurs may prove to be the most damaging evidence against the dinosaur origin of birds. After examination of Sinosauropteryx, the science of respiratory physiology concluded that theropods shared the same compartmentalization of organs included in the thoracic and abdominal cavities as that of crocodiles. Upon contraction of the diaphragm, air is drawn into the lungs creating a negative pressure in the thoracic cavity. This is a physiology radically different than that found in birds where air is drawn continuously through the lungs. Any proposal regarding a transitional animal possessing a breathing apparatus between a crocodilian and avian lung is countermanded by the peril of a herniated diaphragm, a life-threatening design. The best preserved dinosaurian organs - found in the Scipionyx samniticus specimen - confirm the \"hepatic-piston system\" of breathing in theropods, and thus draw a dark line of distinction between the respiratory system of theropods and birds. Indeed, no animal is known to have lived who could have given rise to the extremely complex and highly developed avian lung.",

   "Here is an abbreviated submission. It has been shortened for two reasons: \n \n\n \n \n Your disinclination to engage in the requisite anatomical discussions notwithstanding, I have no intention of letting one squirm out of them on the pretext of personal inconvenience. Now let us address what points you offer.\n \n First:\n \n \"Some key characters linking theropods and birds that are in dispute:\n \n the pubis (Martin 1983a, 1983b, 1991; Tarsitano 1991; also see Wellnhofer 1985), the pelvic nature (Martin 1991; Tarsitano 1991), the nature of the dental construct (Martin, Stewart, and Whetstone 1980); Martin 1991), the ascent and function of the astragalus (Martin, Stewart, and Whetstone 1980; Martin 1991; also see McGowan 1984, 1985 and reply by Martin and Stewart 1985), digit homology (Hinchliffe and Hecht 1984; Hinchliffe 1985; Martin 1991; Tarsitano 1991), the hallux (Tarsitano and Hecht, 1980; Martin 1991; Feduccia 1993a), and the unique semilunate carpal thought to be shared by Deinonychus and Archaeopteryx and modern birds (Martin 1991; Tarsitano 1991).\"\n +++++++++++\n \n \n Ah, charming, extracted nearly verbatim from Feduccia (1996), indeed, I can even give you the page number, 68. Well, let us go through these charges, starting with the pubis.\n \n The claim that the pubic orientation of the urvogel displays a greater degree of opisthopuby than is seen in Maniraptora, is entirely spurious. First and foremost, with opisthopuby exceeding 55 degrees in Dromaeosauridae, the most derived of these taxa are 'more' opisthopubic than the urvogel itself, and this is a segue into the next point. The pubic orientation of Archaeopteryx is not less than 55 degrees comparative to the ischium, and not a single articulated urvogel pelvic girdle demonstrates such a degree of opisthopuby for Archaeopteryx. Martin and Tarsitano are demonstrably incorrect in their assertions to the contrary, and indeed this is the reason why in Feduccia's latest assessment of the thecodont origin argument (2002), the matter of pubic orientation has been entirely dropped. How do you explain the 'greater' opisthopuby of some dromaeosaurs if the pubis of said taxa and that of the urvogel are incompatibly different? \n \n Moreover, the claim from Martin and Feduccia that a hypopubic cup is present in the urvogel, has been direclty falsified by demonstrating that the alleged hypopubic symphysis is in fact a preservation artifact in BMNH 37001, a fact strongly underscored by the conspicuous lack of any similar structure in the pelvic girdle of the other Archaeopteryx material. \n \n Moving on to dentition, Martin most especially, has vociferously claimed that the morphology of the tooth crown and details of tooth replacement in the urvogel are diametrically different than that seen in Maniraptora. and Feduccia has gone on to say--showing astonishing ineptitude--that cranially serrated teeth cannot be the precursor or derivative of waisted, peg like teeth. This argument too has been abandoned by the thecodont ancestry camp in recent years, as both troodontids, and basal dromaeosaurs increasingly display teeth which are little differentiated from those of Archaeopteryx. Indeed, in Microraptor gui, the teeth display the similar detailed and general morphology as those of Archaeotperyx lithographica, and combined with the small size of Mircroraptor, this has led to the hypothesis that neoteny was largely involved in the derivation of the urvogel dentition pattern. How do you explain the par-archaeopterygiform dentition of some troodonts and basal dromaeosaurs if in fact, neither group is supposed to display similarities in dentition?\n \n You next question homology of the astragalus, and in copying from Feduccia I might point out that you have done so poorly. The astragalocalcaneal unit and ascending process of the astragalus seen in Theropoda is homologous to that of Avialae, and neither Feduccia nor Martin, nor Whetstone have provided data to support non-homology of these elements, rather suggesting it as possible. Indeed, comparative analysis of the ascending process in both the urvogel and dromaeosaurs shows that they are practically indistinguishable. There is no consistent or quantifiable difference in the orientation and composition of the ascending process in birds and theropods. Indeed, I am quite certain that if you were faced with both, you not be able to tell which was the supposedly immutable bird, and which was the dinosaur. I refer the reader to Fig 10.14j,k in Paul 2002, and Ostrom in Dodson et al 1990, in particular. I would also note that further evidence of your poor copy of Feduccia's words is seen in \"function of the ascending process\" since the function is uniform in both theropods and birds, regardless of their homology.\n \n The reversed hallux argument, is curious for two reasons. First and foremost the hallux of the urvogel is not reversed to the 180 degrees vis-a-vis the cranially oriented digits in the first place. Moreover, there is evidence for dereversal of the hallux in Compsognathus longipes, postmortem (Ostrom 1992) and the halluxes of both Protarchaeopteryx and Sinornithosaurus are differentiated from the theropod norm, indicating partial reversal, the degree of which has yet to be clarified due to the preservation quality of the material at hand. I will give the benefit of the doubt though, and before challenging you to explain why these data should be, point out that should Theropoda be lacking a reversed hallux at any level, it is not synapomorphy crucial to flight function which should by logical requirement be present in taxa basal to Avialae, or basal within Avialae, and thus is arguably an autapomorphy of more derived avialian clades. \n \n You lastly parrot Feduccia, Martin and Tarsitano on the homology of the semilunate carpal element unifying Maniraptora. Two attempts to show these elements non-homologous have been made, Tarsitano's claim that a semilunate was present in Megalancosaurus preonensis, a drepanosaur from the Upper Triassic of Italy (IIRC), and the claim that due to the composition of the distal and proximal carpals, the respective semilunate elements are not homologous in Maniraptora and the urvogel. The former argument is the weakest, since review of the Megalancosaurus material by Renesto in 1994 and 2000 utterly failed to find evidence of a semilunate element in the carpus of this taxon, and Tarsitano has since retracted his claim (a humiliating story that the thecodont ancestry camp has spoken little of). The latter argument, is comparatively better, although still seriously wanting of data to substantiate it. The argument in a way hinges upon digital homology or lack thereof, but moreover, it stems from serious misunderstanding of the structure of the carpal elements in Maniraptora and Theropoda as a whole, and no one has more seriously derailed the argument for non-homology than Padian (1997) and Chatterjee (1998) who have demonstrated that in his summation of Tarsitano and Martin's research, Feduccia entirely misidentified the carpal elements in Maniraptora, upon which he built his argument for non-homology. Suffice it to say that Fedducia et al have never explicity formulated the reasoning by which the respective semilunate elements are to be rendered non-homologous, and have been careful to merely suggest it as a possibility. Feduccia provides the best example in his 1999 revision of \"The Origin and Evolution of Birds.\" For someone who has counseled me on avoiding spectacular conclusions, I find it sublime that you now leap to the conclusion for the thecodont ancestry camp, that the semilunate elements in Maniraptora and birds are non-homologous, the lack of substantiating data notwithstanding.\n \n I find it most curious that you overlooked the fact that Feduccia and other thecodont ancestor proponents have distanced themselves from all of these arguments, as they become increasingly untenable, to the point where Feduccia's lastest attack on theropod origin solely focuses on digital homology, completely ignoring the questions cited in these sources. Digital homology, is a lengthy topic that I will put in the post subsequent to this one (and any continuations I have to post thereof, due to character-count limits). \n \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Continued:\n \n You go on to say:\n \n From Compsognathus to Archaeopteryx &#8211; your list:\n \n \"Compsognathus longipes, Sinosauropteryx prima, Coelurus fragilis, Ornitholestes hermani, Rahonavis ostromi, Unenlagia comahuensis, Beipiaosaurus inexpectus, Sinornithoides spp., Troodon spp., Oviraptor spp., Avimimus portentosus, Protarchaeopteryx robusta, Sinornithosaurus millenni, Microraptor gui, Bambiraptor feinbergorum, Deinonychus antirrhopus, Velociraptor mongoliensis\n \n Your phyletic group is rejected based on grounds of conflicting data, some of which (but by no means all) are enumerated here. \n \n Archaeopteryx is without a reliable ancestor.

Along with Ornitholestes hermanni, Compsognathus is known to be a theropod, and both are probably coelurosaurs, but their phylogenetic affinities remain within the arena of debate and thus the specimens are confined to incertae sedis. But removal of Compsognathus from the avian lineage strikes at the very fountainhead of the theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Outside of Compsognathus, no known theropod seems to have been a suitable ancestor to birds.\"\n ++++++++++++\n \n \n I will first clarify that only you asserted anagenetic, phyletic progression from one taxon to the other in the derivation of birds. I have done so such thing and presented the taxa listed as indicative of a cladogenetic progression whereby birds were derived. The character states of the taxa listed, on the other hand, are rather phyletic in their gradual approach to and acquisition of the avian bauplan. Proceeding to the reasons listed for rejecting taxa, I will first concentrate on Compsognathus longipes.\n \n In my posts I have never once claimed Compsognathus longipes as ancestral to Archaeopteryx lithographica, nor has any dinosaur paleontologist I am aware of, and demand that you produce references which prove both assertions incorrect. Furthermore, Compsognathus longipes has since been shown to be tridigitate, as has its nearest relation Sinosauropteryx prima, thus negating the claim that due to the loss of the third manal digit, Compsognathus cannot be considered at some level related to the urvogel. Furthermore, the status of Compsognathus and Ornitholestes hermani as Maniraptoriformes incertae sedis has little to no bearing on their displaying muliple traits approaching the par-avian condition observed in Maniraptora. Rather it indicates that their exact phylogenetic position within Maniraptoriformes is as yet uncertain, a reflection of their confusing mosaic of derived and plesiomorphic characters. \n \n The argument that Compsognathus is the axis upon which theropod origin revolves, is entirely specious. Compsognathus has 'never' been proposed as the phyletic ancestor of cladogenetic sister clade of birds, or Archaeopteryx since Huxley's argument to that extent in 1868. Rather, it has been explicitly pointed out by Ostrom and Norman (who in 1990 extensively reviewed the Compsognathus material) that Compsognathus is rather one of the first Maniraptoriformes to display characters arguably pre-avian. Your strawman account of the reception and phylogenetic significance of Compsognathus will not stand the review of the literature and I demand you provide references which support said strawman. The very fact that time and again those who advocate theropod origin have advanced Deinonychosauria as the most par-archaeopterygiform of theropods, further underscores the fallacy of your presentation of Compsognathus.\n \n Your last claim, that besides Compsognathus no theropods are sufficiently par-archaeopterygiform to allow a sister clade or ancestral relationship, is wholly unsupported by the detailed osteology of Deinonychosauria, whether one includes or excludes Troodontidae. So similar are dromaeosaurs and the urvogel that no more than seven obscure autapomorphies underwrite the holophyly of Archaeopterygiformes as a clade autonomous of Dromaeosauridae. You utterly failed to present any data supporting holophyly of Archaeopterygiformes, and excluding Deinonychosauria from par-archaeopterygiform status. The cranial anatomy alone, is so astonishingly similar in these two taxa, as to defy coherent attempts to subscribe these similarities to homoplasy or other factors, and that is not even to take into account further synapomorphies of the post-cranial skeleton. I will put it to you this way, identify whether the four following traits of the braincase are seen in the urvogel, or dromaeosaurs:\n \n Dorsal supraoccipital diamond shaped\n Pneumatopore present on the paroccipital\n Paroccipital strongly twisted\n Postemporal fenestra reduced to a foramen or absent entirely\n \n Since as you claim, the urvogel and dromaeosaurs are diametrically different in anatomy, this should be easy. We can do the same for postcranial features:\n \n Bowed ulna\n Posterolateral flange of the proximal phalange of manal digit III present\n Ulnar quill knobs present\n \n Which are urvogel characters, and which are dromaeosaur characters? Easy question, and for you, it should be an easy answer, since once again, you maintain that these two taxa are so different as to preclude their possibly being related at any level.\n \n \n You next go on to say that:\n \n \"Dromaeosauridae possessed features too specialized to be included in avian lineage: a second pedal phalanx talon, well-developed and used for slashing prey; a stiffened tail, no doubt to bring stabilization to this agile predator; large, clawed manus, well-suited for grasping and holding prey; and muscular, dentulous jaws for tearing flesh.

Instead of reinforcing birds&#8217; link to dinosaurs, the presence of the raptorial claw in Rahonavis ostromi is really no help at all, given the fact that birds are a monophyletic group, and more derived birds that possess the feature must exist due to convergence.\"\n ++++++++++++ \n \n \n Your claim that the urvogel did not possess a functionally didactyl pes, with a hyperextendible second pedal ungual, is demonstrably falsifiable by the osteology of the distal and proximal phalanges of the second pedal digits, which show the dorsal expansion diagnostic of hyperextendibility. To explain this away, you need to present a convincing reason why both should have precisely the same modification of the pedal elements, and yet not both display a hyperextendible claw on the second toe. Furthermore the manus and tail of dromaeosaurs and Archaeopteryx display no consistent or quantifiable diferences, but for the 'more avian' nature of some dromaeosaur hands. In particular, the claim that a dynamically stabilizing tail such as that seen in both dromaeosaurs and Archaeopteryx is in fact evidence of phylogenetic disparity, is quite frankly, supremely idiotic. One would have to prove that the tail of the urvogel was not in fact modified in similar fashion to that of dromaeosaurs, or vice-versa, which you have not done.\n \n \n You next claim that:\n \n \"The absence of feathers on dromaeosaurids is a strike against the theropod position of bird origins and deserves a full explanation. No trace of feathers has been detected on any of the some twenty unearthed specimens.\"\n +++++++++++++\n \n \n This is the most curious allegation you have yet made, since both Microraptor gui and Sinornithosaurus millenii ARE dromaeosaurs, and both possess integument which is undeniably homologous to feathers. To support this statement, you will have to do one of three things: either redefine Dromaeosauridae such that neither Microraptor nor Sinornithosaurus are included therein, prove that Microraptor and Sinornithosaurus were in fact not feathered, or admit you clearly have no conception of the cladistic definition of Dromaeosauridae.\n \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Continued:\n \n You go on to assert:\n \n \"The highly specialized avian lung and its sharp dissimilarities to that of theropod dinosaurs may prove to be the most damaging evidence against the dinosaur origin of birds. After examination of Sinosauropteryx, the science of respiratory physiology concluded that theropods shared the same compartmentalization of organs included in the thoracic and abdominal cavities as that of crocodiles. Upon contraction of the diaphragm, air is drawn into the lungs creating a negative pressure in the thoracic cavity. This is a physiology radically different than that found in birds where air is drawn continuously through the lungs. Any proposal regarding a transitional animal possessing a breathing apparatus between a crocodilian and avian lung is countermanded by the peril of a herniated diaphragm, a life-threatening design. The best preserved dinosaurian organs - found in the Scipionyx samniticus specimen - confirm the &#8220;hepatic-piston system&#8221; of breathing in theropods, and thus draw a dark line of distinction between the respiratory system of theropods and birds.

Moreover, there are significant osteological data to suggest that the aerobic capacity of Maniraptora was significantly elevated above the reptilian norm, and par-avian if not equivalent to the avian condition. The structure of the maxillary sinuses and pathway taken by air upon being inhaled through the external nares, combined with the presence of avian pulmonary diverticula, postrcranial pneumatization, and moreover the sternocostal and pectoral modifications for supporting a high-grade respiratory system observed in Maniraptora, cannot be explained away with Scipionyx. Most telling is the presence of ossified uncinate processes in Dromaeosauridae, which are directly correlated to modifying the rib cage to deal with the aerobic energetics of avian style breathing. Why should dromaeosaurs display such characters if their respiratory grade was no more elevated than that of the reptilian norm? To falsify the postulate that Maniraptora approached birds in their aerobic capacity and the level of concomitant osteological modification, one must show that all of the characters observed in Maniraptora supporting this postulate, are incorrect or not present, which neither you, nor Ruben et al, have succeeded in doing.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Continued:\n \n As promised, I now deal with the argument about digital homology or lack thereof. I will first note that this is now the central argument of the thecodont ancestry camp, to the extent that other classical arguments of this theory, have been abandoned. The following is from an essay I authored for the Evowiki project, which can be found at: http://wiki.cotch.net/wiki.phtml?title=Main_Page\n \n The essay can be found off the main page, under \"Controversies\" and under the title \"Avian Phylogeny and Origins.\"\n \n \n Following the work of Ostrom et al, the identity of the avian digits as I, II and III has been widely accepted. However, the research of Tarsitano & Hecht (1980) and more so J. R. Hinchcliffe (1985) on embryology in birds, laid the foundation for contemporary studies on digital identity in birds, carried out by Feduccia & Burke (1997), Feduccia (1999), Feduccia & Nowicki (2002) and most recently Feduccia (2003), which suggest that the digits in birds are indeed II, III, and IV. This has been hailed as a lack of homology, which is fatal to a theropod origin for birds (most vociferously by Feduccia 1999, 2003). \n \n However, the situation is just not that clear-cut. Gauthier & Wagner (1999) have proposed a homeotic frame shift mutation in which developmental processes acted on by evolutionary constraints, led to an identity shift such that digits I, II, and III equal digits II, III and IV. The frame shift hypothesis has gained a wide degree of support in the paleontological community (Larrsson & Wagner 2003), and is bolstered by possible examples of homeotic frame shifts in birds (Galis et al 2003), as well as documented digital variation in various metazoans (Gauthier & Wagner 1999). Nevertheless, the lack of a clear-cut evolutionary impetus for a frame shift of the sort proposed by Gauthier & Wagner (Paul 2002, Feduccia 2002, 2003, Galis et al 2003) undermines this hypothesis (although it by no means invalidates it). \n \n Considering this, alternative suggestions put forward by Galis et al (2003) that assuming digital identities I, II and III for coelurosaurs, may be fallacious, are worth further consideration. Galis et al postulate that the pattern of postaxial reduction yielding a I, II, III hand in Staurikosaurus pricei and Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis is not applicable to Theropoda, and concomitantly, that herrerasaurs are not representative of the ancestral character state for Theropoda, but rather represent a plesiomorphic outgroup to Saurischia. If this is the case, acquisition of a symmetrical pattern of digital reduction yielding an II, III, IV hand in Theropods is plausible. \n \n Feduccia (2003) and Larrsson & Wagner (2003) have categorically rejected this postulate as unsubstantiated, and the latter authors firmly assert that Herrerasauria is a neotheropod outgroup. If this is the case then Galis et al&#8217;s hypothesis is unlikely. However, do the fossils support so definitive a classification of these basal dinosaurs? \n \n Contrary to the contemporary consensus stemming from the work of Paul Sereno (1993, 1997), Sereno et al (1993) and Philip Currie (1997), the phylogenetic status of Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus remains uncertain. While Sereno et al have accepted Herrerasauria (Benedetto 1973, Galton 1985) as a monophyletic outgroup of Neotheropoda, representative of the ancestral character state most closely allied to that seen in neotheropods, this interpretation is untenable. &#8220;Herrerasauria&#8221; is delimited on tenuous anatomical grounds, and the similarities between this clade and Theropoda as a whole, are primarily symplesiomorphic, and of little to no phylogenetic relevance (Brinkman & Sues 1990, Sues in Dodson et al 1990). Indeed Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus display plesiomorphic attributes comparative to Theropoda including a) a robust medial wall of the acetabulum, producing a semiperforate condition for the hip-socket, b) persistent development of metatarsals I and V, c) absence of epipophyses in the cervicals and d) elongation of cervicals three through four (Sues in Dodson et al 1990). \n \n Interestingly enough, it is apparent that some Ceratosauria displayed a more robust metacarpal IV than that seen in &#8220;Herrerasauria&#8221;, and given the difficulties in assuming digital recapitulation, said condition argues a lack of direct-ancestry for Neotheropoda from &#8220;Herrerasauria.&#8221; When combined with other data, it becomes likely that &#8220;Herrerasauria&#8221; constitutes an outgroup of Saurischia, predating the splitting of this clade into Sauropodomorpha and Theropoda. Needless to say, the pattern of postaxial digital reduction evidenced in staurikosaurs and herrerasaurs, can arguably be presented as reflective of an independent evolutionary trajectory from that pursued by Theropoda, characterized by the reduction of digits IV and V to yield a tridactyl manus, nonhomologous to that seen in Theropoda. Considering the ambiguities of placing &#8220;Herrerasauria&#8221; as a neotheropod outgroup, and the evidence to suggest that component taxa thereof are not representative of the ancestral osteology of Theropoda, Galis et al&#8217;s postulate is more than plausible. \n \n Taken together, these hypotheses and the degree of similarity between avialians and coelurosaurs reduce the matter of digital identity so vociferously presented by Feduccia et al to a non-issue, which, while illustrating a previously unknown component of avian evolution, is in no way fatal to theropod origin for birds. Rather, it is indicative of a highly plastic and dynamic evolutionary process in the primary radiation of Ornithodira, and suggestive of the flexibility of the dinosaur morphology in adapting to the conditions presented in the terminal Triassic&#8212;a trait no doubt crucial to the rise of these most spectacular of archosaurs. \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

Introns are not considered junk DNA. There are other non-coding sequences that are known to have function, and there are some transcribed sections that seem to have function although don't become proteins. But there are vast, vast stretches of DNA that are highly repetitive, non-transcribing and therefore non-coding, that seem to expand and contract without any effect.

After examination of Sinosauropteryx, the science of respiratory physiology concluded that theropods shared the same compartmentalization of organs included in the thoracic and abdominal cavities as that of crocodiles. Upon contraction of the diaphragm, air is drawn into the lungs creating a negative pressure in the thoracic cavity. This is a physiology radically different than that found in birds where air is drawn continuously through the lungs. Any proposal regarding a transitional animal possessing a breathing apparatus between a crocodilian and avian lung is countermanded by the peril of a herniated diaphragm, a life-threatening design. The best preserved dinosaurian organs - found in the Scipionyx samniticus specimen - confirm the \"hepatic-piston system\" of breathing in theropods, and thus draw a dark line of distinction between the respiratory system of theropods and birds. Indeed, no animal is known to have lived who could have given rise to the extremely complex and highly developed avian lung.\"\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n \n The argument that Scipionyx samniticus affirms a non-avian grade of respiration in Maniraptora is seriously questioned by most if not all dinosaur paleontologists, the ambiguous preservation of the internal anatomy associated with respiration in this specimen being not the least of the reasons. Moreover, there are significant osteological data to suggest that the aerobic capacity of Maniraptora was significantly elevated above the reptilian norm, and par-avian if not equivalent to the avian condition. The structure of the maxillary sinuses and pathway taken by air upon being inhaled through the external nares, combined with the presence of avian pulmonary diverticula, postrcranial pneumatization, and moreover the sternocostal and pectoral modifications for supporting a high-grade respiratory system observed in Maniraptora, cannot be explained away with Scipionyx. Most telling is the presence of ossified uncinate processes in Dromaeosauridae, which are directly correlated to modifying the rib cage to deal with the aerobic energetics of avian style breathing. Why should dromaeosaurs display such characters if their respiratory grade was no more elevated than that of the reptilian norm? To falsify the postulate that Maniraptora approached birds in their aerobic capacity and the level of concomitant osteological modification, one must show that all of the characters observed in Maniraptora supporting this postulate, are incorrect or not present, which neither you, nor Ruben et al, have succeeded in doing.\n \n Vindex Urvogel\n\n \n This is malarkey. I am finished with this thread. Please do not repost any of your previous replies for my benefit - they will not be read by me. \n \n All you succeeded in \"proving\" with all your cut-and-paste remarks and anatomy out-the-ears, was that theropods gave rise to more theropods and birds gave rise to more birds. \n \n I beg you, please, give me the transitional specimen, in no uncertain terms, that links the lungs of theropods and birds. What is the taxanomic classification of this interesting link? Actually, I would like to view it. Can you please paste the weblink for my and others' benefit?\n \n I gladly accept your above remarks as your concession of this thread, seeing that you have entered the realm of \"ridiculous\" and \"outrageous\" with your current comments.",

I will herein review the claims you have made and offered no support for whatsoever:\n \n 1. That Protoavis texensis is a bird more derived than Archaeopteryx\n 2. That Protoavis is a valid taxon\n 3. That hundreds of authorities agree that Protoavis is both a valid taxon and a more derived bird than the urvogel.\n 4. That no dinosaurs possess furculae\n 5. That no dinosaurs possess sterna\n 6. That holophyly of Neotetanurae is non-existent\n 7. That the pelvic girdle of Archaeopteryx and Maniraptora is entirely dissimilar.\n 8. That the manus, carpus, and manal formulae are non-homologous in Maniraptora and birds.\n 9. That the ascending process of the astragalus in theropods and birds is non-homologous\n 10. That no dromaeosaur is feathered\n 11. That Compsognathus is claimed as the direct ancestor of birds\n 12. That theropod origin claims anagenetic derivation of birds\n 13. That no dinosaur possessed paravian aerobic capability or skeletal modifications indicative of such.\n 14. That the scientific community has explicitly rejected theropod origin as a model for the derivation of birds.\n \n You have failed to address the data offered in refutation of these assertions, have consistently refused to engage in the requisite anatomical review, and generally, have displayed intellectual ineptitude on a scale which is staggering, even for creationists. The best you have been able to manage is outright refusal to argue anatomical points, for the very simple and very valid reason that you are entirely unfamiliar with what you are talking about. You further have accused one of literally stealing from other sites via cut and pasting, and I demand you provide proof via the websites I allegedly cut and pasted from, that in fact I did do so. \n \n To address your last desperate attempt to uphold an argument which from the beginning has been so seriously deluded and deprived of any grounding in scientific data, I will provide a list of taxa which display either via preserved soft-anatomy or osteology, or a combination of both, evidence of incremental advance towards the avian aerobic system:\n \n The Santana formation basal averostran, described but not yet named by Martill et al (2000) and summarized in Paul (2002) and Currie (2003), displays both caudal air sacs, shallow lungs, and tracheal position, with the avian aerobic system.\n \n The Deinonychosauria as a whole display major skeletal modifications permitting the avian aerobic system including ossified uncinate processes, ossified sternal ribs, a hinge joint between the coracoid and sternum, deeply forked rib heads, extensive pulmonay diverticula, extensive vertebral pneumaticity, mediorostral sinuses and extensive maxillary conchae diverting airflow through the external and internal nares into an \"L\" shape path, seen elswhere only in birds. Except for the latter, these characters are not even observed in what creationists claim is a \"true bird\"--Archaeopteryx. The dromaeosaurs most clearly displaying these conditions are:\n \n Sinornithosaurus millenii\n Microraptor gui\n Deinonychus antirrhopus\n Velociraptor mongoliensis\n Dromaeosaurus albertensis\n \n Falsification of these data requires unambiguous proof of a pelvodiaphragmatic septum such as that seen in Crocodylia, in theropods, which Ruben et al, have conspicuously failed to do, and/or the refutation of the extensive osteological modifications seen in the theropod skeleton to permit paravian aerobic capacity. Alternatively one would have to identify why these modifications should not be indicative of paravian aerobic capacity. I have provided references for the sources quoted herein, but for Martill et al, which I will below. Pictures of all of these specimens but the Santana theropod, can be found quite easily via a Google search, or even better, by actually referring to the sources I have gone out of my way to cite. \n \n Martill et al. 2000. Skeletal remains of small theropod dinosaur with associated soft structures from the Lower Cretaceous Santana Formation of northeastern Brazil. Canadian Journal of Earth Science 37: 891-900.\n \n You will either respond to the points made, refute the data presented in response, and substantiate your extensive list of claims with the anatomical proofs they require, or concede, de facto, that you cannot do so and that your entire argument has from start to finish, been one long farce of paleontologic research.\n \n To preclude your egregious attempts to paint my arguments in the same manner in which yours have been made, I ask the individuals following the thread: which of us has consistently addressed every point offered, with as much data as possible, while explicitly listing the pertinent reference material so that external checks could be carried out? Has it been \"notsofast?\" My opponent has been so reticent about dealing with the anatomy at hand that prying what little he has given from him, has been akin to pulling an exceptionally stubborn and impacted tooth from a squirming child. He has utterly failed to produce references to support his assertions, he has consistently failed to address data presented in refutation of his arguments, consistently failed to discuss the anatomy by which both of our arguments are built, and has now, in the end, resorted to accusing me of plaigirism. \"Notsofast\" has indeed given us a sterling example of creationist disingenuousness.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Your assertion that the Santana find, termed SMNK 2349 PAL, \"...displays both caudal air sacs, shallow lungs, and tracheal position, with the avian aerobic system,\" is a sharp deviation from the truth. Martill's article lists the fossil find as \"uncrushed skeletal remains comprising the pelvic girdle, partial sacrum, both femora, and parts of the right tibia and fibula.\" The only possibly identified soft structure was a preserved segment of \"lithified intestinal tract.\" \n \n Martill and his team veer from safe science and reach for far-fetched hopes of linking these theropod bones to birds when they draw attention to a \"vacuity\" behind the left pubic shaft which was preserved in the original matrix but later destroyed during preparation. Martill is so sure that he is not viewing a space caused by \"decomposition-generated gasses.\" When he muses that \"conceivably a urinary bladder or ovaries could have occupied the space,\" he just as quickly rules out these possibilities saying these organs were more likely housed in the anterior abdominal cavity like that of crocodilians. But when he finally does pose an answer for us, it is absolutely wild! He hands us a unique theropod, created entirely of his imagination - and never before seen - when he states, \"the most plausible candidate for a structure occupying this vacuity is a postpubic air sac.\" He continues to hypothesize in an uncontrolled manner as he begins to discuss the ventilation system of this contrived air sac - a system, as one would image, replicates that of birds.\n \n Reasonable science teaches that it would be far better to err on the side of caution and offer an authentic \"plausible\" answer that is in keeping with the information found in previous fossil lithography of theropoda. How about saying the space was left by a fully decomposed part of the intestine? After all, save for the 27 mm long piece that was preserved, most of the intestinal tract was not found. (The idea that this air pocket was the result of intestinal remains is a very real possibility, seeing that the specimen was preserved in 3-D, which fact actually serves to diminish hopes of finding evidence of a pubically-centralized abdominal air sac compressed against the left pubic bone). Or how about guessing that the space was left as a portion of the large abdominal cavity we already know existed in theropods, like that clearly seen in the Sinosauropteryx, where the cavity seems to distend slightly rearward past the pubis? \n \n But particularly disconcerting is the fact that \"Vindex Urvogel\" would even bring up SMNK 2349 PAL in this discussion. The hypocrisy here is that, whereas I could not enter Protoavis texensis as admissible evidence into our debate because of the specimen's questionable taxonomic validity, Vindex wants to bring in the Santana find and herald it as a glowing missing link between dinosaurs and birds, when Martill writes: \"Although excellently preserved, the limited amount of skeletal material in SMNK 2349 PAL, makes precise taxonomic identification impossible.\" Though one can tell that Martill desperately wants his find to \"represent a previously unrecorded taxon,\" close similarities with existing taxon like Coelurus and Compsognathus might spoil that prospect. \n \n Conclusion? Vindex, you have entered into a phase of the debate where your pistol is out of bullets. You are grasping for anything you can find to throw at me (and others) in your attempts to somehow make transitional fossils appear anything but problematic in their support of evolution. To be short, you are no longer practicing good science.",

   "\n Conclusion? Vindex, you have entered into a phase of the debate where your pistol is out of bullets. You are grasping for anything you can find to throw at me (and others) in your attempts to somehow make transitional fossils appear anything but problematic in their support of evolution. To be short, you are no longer practicing good science.\n\n \n \n Your post rests on two central assertions: a)that the Santana specimen is not sufficiently preserved to merit the conclusions drawn by Martill et al (2000), and b)that the only positive proof for paravian aerobic capacity in theropods, is preserved soft anatomy (either in this specimen, Sinosauropteryx prima, or Scipionyx samniticus). \n \n The first assertion is, of the two, the most coherent, though it is by no means accurate. I find it especially curious that you utterly failed to mention that independent reviews of the Santana specimen, and Martill's work concerning this material, has corroborated his conclusions that in the soft-anatomy of this theropod, we see a paravian aerobic system (Paul 2002, Currie 2003). The suggestion that the prepubic vacuity was illusory in the first place is negated by in situ documentation of the structure. Furthermore, the position and size of the vacuity do not conform to that expected of the general vacuity between the caudal gastralia and the pubis, and cannot be explained away as such. Based on these data, Martill's conclusion was hardly the speculative flight of fancy that you and the thecodont camp has maintained, and the distinct failure of Ruben et al to provide positive evidence in refutation of Martill's conclusions undewrites this point. Why should there not be an explicit disproof whereby the vacuity in question can be unquestionably shown to not be an air sac, if the case is so unambiguous as one would maintain? \n \n Ironically, your attempt to paint the Santana theropod material of dubious preservation back-fires on you, and that is perhaps the reason why Ruben and his colleagues have been so reticent in using it. The argument can be just as equally applied to Sinosauropteryx and Scipionyx, the two taxa you made so much of (as did Ruben) and in fact, the internal anatomy of neither of these taxa is preserved to the degree of fidelity seen in the Santana theropod. This curious situation naturally begs the question: if according to you the Santana theropod's internal preservation is unrelialable, why should that of the 'more poorly preserved soft-anatomy' of Sinosauropteryx and Scipionyx be any more reliable? Because J. Ruben says so? Your penchant for argument from authority knows no boundaries. To disprove this point, you must of course show that while the Santana theropod's internal preservation is defficient, that of Scipionyx and Sinosauropteryx is far more clearly preserved and thus not as ambiguous. You have done nothing of the sort. \n \n Your second key assertion is the most egregiously incorrect of the two. While relying on the soft-anatomy alone is not a wholly convincing method by which to either uphold or refute the presence of paravian aerobic capacity in theropods, the osteological data is far less ambiguous. Had I solely made my case with the soft-anatomy, then, my argument would have rightly been undermined by casting doubt on said anatomy. However, I have consistently argued that the osteological data is just as compelling if not more so, in defending the paravian aerobic capacity of theropods. Your tacit allegation that I have advanced soft-anatomy as the sine qua non proof of aerobic capacity approaching the avian level in theropods is a deliberate distortion of my position, as at no point did I advance the Santana specimen as the proverbial smoking gun, nor did I imply such. Your implication otherwise demands substantiation (as does your allegation that I advance this theropod as the \"missing link\" between dinosaurs and birds). I will further call your attention to the fact that you in no way addressed the osteological data which bolsters the argument that theropods approached avian aerobic capacity, nor did you present refutation of the features of the dromaeosaurid taxa listed which suggest such. Indeed, you failed to present any model which might account for these features if theropods did actually lack paravian aerobic capacity. Further consider that assuming the criticisms of all three taxa displaying soft-anatomy are correct, i.e., said anatomy is too ambiguoulsy preserved to draw concrete conclusions, answering the question of theropod aerobic capacity would remain the purview of osteology. And the fact remains that theropods (Maniraptora especially) display stereotypical modifications of the skeleton at all levels, to facilitate high-grade aerobic capability, approaching and exceeding the avian minimum. How does one account for this if, as you claim, no theropod had such a paravian aerobic ability? \n \n Moreover, what if one accepts the soft-anatomy as unconditionally refuting the presence of such an aerobic system in theropods (a conclusion in itself seriously flawed)? How then does one reconcile a diametrically different conclusion drawn from osteology? Ironically, this paradox is not the logical outcome of my argument, but yours, and you either have to a)disprove the presence of the skeletal characters which indicate the presence of high grade aerobic capacity in theropods, or b)show them to have arisen via some form of homoplasy (for which there would be no credible argument). \n \n The credibility of your post is further weakened by the clever, but entirely spurious conflation of the lack of taxonomic validity of \"Protoavis\" with that of the Santana specimen. \"Protoavis\" is a chimera, and therefore by definition it cannot be presented as a taxon which shall receive a formal binomial. The Santana theropod, on the other hand, is not a chimera, on the contrary it has yet to be described and given a formal binomial. There is a distinct difference and to prove the hypocrisy charges you level in your most recent post you must demonstrate that a)\"Protoavis\" is not a chimera, and b)the Santana theropod is. You have glaringly failed to do either.\n \n Seemingly coherent, your entire post falls in on itself not unlike a house of cards once the details and logical extensions of the arguments presented therein, are brought to light.

As \"notsofast\" maintains that there is absolutely no similarity between the aerobic capacity of theropods and birds, it should therefore follow that there are no data which will underwrite a conclusion the contrary. Considering this, I find it exceptionally difficult to account for all of the following characters permitting avian grade aerobic capability in theropods (and elsewhere seen in only in birds):\n \n a)Sternum articulates with the coracoid via a hinge joint\n b)Sternum articulates with ossified sternal ribs\n c)Ribs spaced by ossified uncinate processes\n d)Post-crania intensely pneumatic, due to invasion of pulmonary diverticula\n e)Medial ribs heads placed well below the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae\n f)Gastralia articulating in a zigzag midline, permitting distension ventrally\n g)Depth of the pelvic canal increased above the dinosaurian norm\n h)Pneumatization of the pelvis incipient or equal to that observed in the urvogel\n i)Abdominal surfaces of the pubes insufficiently robust to support diaphragmatic musculature, contary to Ruben et al (1997).\n j)Sternal ribs singular\n k)Mediorostral maxillary sinuses and conchae present\n l)Path taken by air upon inhalation through the external nares, maxillary sinuses, and external nares, \"L\" shaped, as per the avian norm\n \n These data underscore the point that the theropod postcranial skeleton was diametrically unlike that of crocodilians, in that crocodiles display none of the traits listed above, whereas theropods did. Why should this be if both groups shared the same pelvovisceral pump? I think further elaboration of the characters which we should see in theropods, if they did in fact have such a pump (because we see them in crocodiles), is in order:\n \n a)Rib cage ceiling smooth, and not corrugated due to the articulation of vertebral tansverse processes and the rib heads\n b)Gastralia do not meet on midline\n c)Pubes mobile\n d)Excavation of bones by pulmonary diverticula absent\n e)Sternal ribs doubled\n f)Uncinate processes, if present, not ossified\n \n None of these characters are observed in theropods. And yet here you insist that theropods had precisely the sort of pelvovisceral pump that crocodiles have. How do you reconcile this difference? How do you explain why not just some, but ALL of these traits indicative of pelvovisceral pumps, are missing in theropods? How do you explain why all the traits associated with an air sac system, as listed above, ARE present in theropods? Even assuming the validity of any particular soft-anatomy dependent argument, these data will still need to be accounted for, something that you have utterly failed to do. Your refutation of the argument that theropods did possess paravian aerobic capacity is fatally incomplete, so long as it cannot address the osteological data, and solidly refute it. It is further emphasized that your tirade on soft-anatomy has not unambiguously refuted any points made using the data from preserved tissues in theropods, it has rather painted it as ambiguous. Thus, you in all actuality, have yet to solidly refute both aspects of the debate: the soft-anatomy and the osteology. And as mentioned, refuting one but not both, simply will not cut it, unless a credible explanation for why one set of data should entirely contradict the other can be advanced, or it can be shown that both data sets unambiguously support each other--challenges you have yet to surmount, or even address.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "The above is all too easy. By the way, do you realize that you lie constantly? Bottom line is, you fight dirty and I have known it for several posts now. (Makes one wonder what \"science\" you have fabricated as well) I am considering devoting an entire post just to point out your lies for two reasons 1) I want you to know that I know you do it and 2) I want all who read this to know. \n \n Anyway, I am out of time for now, though to rebut the above should prove to be no problem - I guess the reason is, you seem to be out of science entirely. \n \n But, aside from all that, I am going to insist that you do something. Fair's fair. Remember when you insisted that I retract the inclusing of Protoavis as a valid taxon? Then, do you further remember that I did just that, stating that to keep it in the argument was \"not good science and my opponent has asked me to retract it?\"\n \n Now, I insist you do the same.

You claim it is an invalid taxon, and cannot be granted a binomial under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, yet you have presented no reason for such. Whereas \"Protoavis\" is demonstrably chimeric, and thus cannot by protocol be given a binomial, this is not the case with the Santana specimen and you must produce grounds on which to invalidte its taxonomic status, and sources to substantiate your argument thereto. Until such time, I will not retract a valid point which you have utterly failed to produce any data in refutation of (note, it is not ambiguity of the Santana specimen which is being argued in this particular assertion, but rather that for reasons of nomenclatural protocol it cannot be given a binomial and is thus an invalid taxon). \n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "Reposted so that \"notsofast\" cannot evade it by letting it get buried in previous pages:\n Quote:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Originally Posted by Vindex Urvogel\n \n \n Your second key assertion is the most egregiously incorrect of the two. While relying on the soft-anatomy alone is not a wholly convincing method by which to either uphold or refute the presence of paravian aerobic capacity in theropods, the osteological data is far less ambiguous. Had I solely made my case with the soft-anatomy, then, my argument would have rightly been undermined by casting doubt on said anatomy. However, I have consistently argued that the osteological data is just as compelling if not more so, in defending the paravian aerobic capacity of theropods. Your tacit allegation that I have advanced soft-anatomy as the sine qua non proof of aerobic capacity approaching the avian level in theropods is a deliberate distortion of my position, as at no point did I advance the Santana specimen as the proverbial smoking gun, nor did I imply such. Your implication otherwise demands substantiation (as does your allegation that I advance this theropod as the \"missing link\" between dinosaurs and birds). I will further call your attention to the fact that you in no way addressed the osteological data which bolsters the argument that theropods approached avian aerobic capacity, nor did you present refutation of the features of the dromaeosaurid taxa listed which suggest such. Indeed, you failed to present any model which might account for these features if theropods did actually lack paravian aerobic capacity. Further consider that assuming the criticisms of all three taxa displaying soft-anatomy are correct, i.e., said anatomy is too ambiguoulsy preserved to draw concrete conclusions, answering the question of theropod aerobic capacity would remain the purview of osteology. And the fact remains that theropods (Maniraptora especially) display stereotypical modifications of the skeleton at all levels, to facilitate high-grade aerobic capability, approaching and exceeding the avian minimum. How does one account for this if, as you claim, no theropod had such a paravian aerobic ability? \n \n Vindex Urvogel\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n I feel it of further validity to produce a brief character list of the osteological characters I continue to refer to, to be absolutely explicit as to the osteological data which my opponent has yet to address. As \"notsofast\" maintains that there is absolutely no similarity between the aerobic capacity of theropods and birds, it should therefore follow that there are no data which will underwrite a conclusion the contrary. Considering this, I find it exceptionally difficult to account for all of the following characters permitting avian grade aerobic capability in theropods (and elsewhere seen in only in birds):\n \n a)Sternum articulates with the coracoid via a hinge joint\n b)Sternum articulates with ossified sternal ribs\n c)Ribs spaced by ossified uncinate processes\n d)Post-crania intensely pneumatic, due to invasion of pulmonary diverticula\n e)Medial ribs heads placed well below the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae\n f)Gastralia articulating in a zigzag midline, permitting distension ventrally\n g)Depth of the pelvic canal increased above the dinosaurian norm\n h)Pneumatization of the pelvis incipient or equal to that observed in the urvogel\n i)Abdominal surfaces of the pubes insufficiently robust to support diaphragmatic musculature, contary to Ruben et al (1997).\n j)Sternal ribs singular\n k)Mediorostral maxillary sinuses and conchae present\n l)Path taken by air upon inhalation through the external nares, maxillary sinuses, and external nares, \"L\" shaped, as per the avian norm\n \n These data underscore the point that the theropod postcranial skeleton was diametrically unlike that of crocodilians, in that crocodiles display none of the traits listed above, whereas theropods did. Why should this be if both groups shared the same pelvovisceral pump? I think further elaboration of the characters which we should see in theropods, if they did in fact have such a pump (because we see them in crocodiles), is in order:\n \n a)Rib cage ceiling smooth, and not corrugated due to the articulation of vertebral tansverse processes and the rib heads\n b)Gastralia do not meet on midline\n c)Pubes mobile\n d)Excavation of bones by pulmonary diverticula absent\n e)Sternal ribs doubled\n f)Uncinate processes, if present, not ossified\n \n None of these characters are observed in theropods. And yet here you insist that theropods had precisely the sort of pelvovisceral pump that crocodiles have. How do you reconcile this difference? How do you explain why not just some, but ALL of these traits indicative of pelvovisceral pumps, are missing in theropods? How do you explain why all the traits associated with an air sac system, as listed above, ARE present in theropods? Even assuming the validity of any particular soft-anatomy dependent argument, these data will still need to be accounted for, something that you have utterly failed to do. Your refutation of the argument that theropods did possess paravian aerobic capacity is fatally incomplete, so long as it cannot address the osteological data, and solidly refute it. It is further emphasized that your tirade on soft-anatomy has not unambiguously refuted any points made using the data from preserved tissues in theropods, it has rather painted it as ambiguous. Thus, you in all actuality, have yet to solidly refute both aspects of the debate: the soft-anatomy and the osteology. And as mentioned, refuting one but not both, simply will not cut it, unless a credible explanation for why one set of data should entirely contradict the other can be advanced, or it can be shown that both data sets unambiguously support each other--challenges you have yet to surmount, or even address.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

Your list of osteological traits only makes theropods and birds an analogous study. Any effort beyond that - for instance, to \"insert\" air sacs into the internal anatomy of theropods - is tendentious and specious.\n \n \nYour refutation of the argument that theropods did possess paravian aerobic capacity is fatally incomplete, so long as it cannot address the osteological data, and solidly refute it.

And, since I am having to repeat myself, I have decided this time to \"cut and paste\" from Ruben. With regard to theropods lacking specialized skeletal structures necessary to house air sacs, take special care to note this part: \"The theropod ribcage-pectoral girdle complex is devoid of indications of skeletomuscular capacity for inhalatory filling of abdominal air sacs [for example, theropods lacked avianlike jointed or hinged ribs and an expansive sternum, structures without which proper ventilatory airflow cannot be maintained in the modern bird lung].\" Also note his comments about the \"highly elongate pubis\" in the second paragraph.\n \n \"Given their affinity to other sauropsids, dinosaurs probably possessed septate lungs. However, theropod dinosaurs were unlikely to have possessed avian-style, flow-through septate lungs. The theropod ribcage-pectoral girdle complex is devoid of indications of skeletomuscular capacity for inhalatory filling of abdominal air sacs [for example, theropods lacked avianlike jointed or hinged ribs and an expansive sternum, structures without which proper ventilatory airflow cannot be maintained in the modern bird lung]. These modifications first appear in Cretaceous ornithiurine birds, such as Chaoyangia. Moreover, theropods exhibit evidence that, like modern crocodilians, they probably possessed a vertical thoracic-abdominal subdivision of the visceral cavity and relied on a hepatic piston diaphragm to ventilate a bellowslike septate lung.\" \n \n \"Recently described Early Cretaceous theropod specimens [Sinosauropteryx] retain preserved outlines of much of the visceral cavity. The cavity exhibits complete thoracic-abdominal separation, defined by a remarkably crocodilianlike vertically oriented partition coincident with the apparent dome-shaped anterior surface of the liver. These observations, combined with the occurrence among theropods of a distinct, relatively vertical, crocodilelike, highly elongate pubis, as well as well-developed gastralia, provide evidence that theropod dinosaurs, like modern crocodiles, probably possessed a bellowslike septate lung and that the lung was probably ventilated, at least in part, by a hepatic-piston diaphragm that was powered by diaphragmatic muscles that extended between the pubic bones and liver.\"\n \n If you have run out of good science to refute the above, all you can do is disagree with Ruben. In that case, I suggest you take up the remainder of this debate with him. Otherwise, if you and I are to continue, I will anticipate some fresh, new science from you to bolster your assertions. If I see you covering the same, old ground again, I will have to take that to mean you and I are finished with our discussion. I will further conclude that you did not successfully offer any transitional forms in fossils to support the broad theory of evolution.",

You can be sure that one thing you will not reduce me to is a regression into your previous posts where I attempt to sift out mendacity from true science. \n \n \n While your attempt to duck substantiating your personal attack on my credibility is admirable, it will not pass in a moderated forum. You will either produce a list of the alleged \"lies\" I have perpetrated, and the sources which invariably prove that I have been \"lying\" or you will retract the claim. I find it supremely amusing that had I accused you of formulating an explicit, \"consistent\" set of lies, and not offered the reasons and data which corroborate that accusation, you would more or less cry foul and lambast my posts as nothing less than speculative ad hominem designed to shift emphasis away from data to character attack,\n \n \n You go on to say:\n \n \"You really do love to lie. Read back over what I really said. I never claimed that the specimen &#8220;cannot be granted a binomial under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.&#8221; Where and when did you learn to argue like this? Just a personal side note: you are intelligent and produce a lot of good science, actually. But if you are young (say, a student) and hoping to make a career out of this, you simply must cease with the falsehoods. When you lose credibility on a personal level, your good science vaporizes and no one listens anymore.\"\n ++++++++++\n \n You explicitly compared the Santana theropod to \"Protoavis texensis\" in which taxonomic validity is denied on the basis of its being a chimera. If you wish to compare my advancement of the Santana material with \"Protoavis\" you cannot claim that in turn, you are advancing different reasons for the taxonomic lack of validity for said material. Pick one or the other: either the Santana specimen is a chimera, like \"Protoavis\" or the as yet unamed specimen is a junior synonym for Compsognathus longipes or Coelurus fragilis. \n \n Incidentally, both claims are utterly unsubstantiated. From the mere point nomenclatural protocol, as outlined in the ICZN, the Santana theropod cannot be a junior synonym to any taxon, as it has yet to be given a binomial. As one could contend this is just ICZN semantics, let us examine the characters which would ally the Santana theropod with either Compsognathus longipes or Coelurus fragilis. What data suggests that the taxa are synonymous? What explicit character set can be used to ally them? Does the Santana theropod exhibit the diagnostic verterbal osteology of Coelurus? Does it display the same set of diagnostic vertebral characters as does Compsognathus? What of their respective pelvic girdles? And most curiously, whereas the Santana theropod is from the Lower Cretaceous, how can it be that it is synonymous with two taxa which date from the Upper Jurassic? \n \n It is not enough to simply assert that the Santana specimen is nothing but another example of Compsognathus or Coelurus, one must present the data which corroborates this position, something you have completely failed to do. \n \n Lastly I find your hypocritical advice on presenting valid science just that. This is an individual whose arguments have thus far asserted, but provided no evidence for, the following:\n \n 1. That Protoavis texensis is a bird more derived than Archaeopteryx\n 2. That Protoavis is a valid taxon\n 3. That hundreds of authorities agree that Protoavis is both a valid taxon and a more derived bird than the urvogel.\n 4. That no dinosaurs possess furculae\n 5. That no dinosaurs possess sterna\n 6. That holophyly of Neotetanurae is non-existent\n 7. That the pelvic girdle of Archaeopteryx and Maniraptora is entirely dissimilar.\n 8. That the manus, carpus, and manal formulae are non-homologous in Maniraptora and birds.\n 9. That the ascending process of the astragalus in theropods and birds is non-homologous\n 10. That no dromaeosaur is feathered\n 11. That Compsognathus is claimed as the direct ancestor of birds\n 12. That theropod origin claims anagenetic derivation of birds\n 13. That no dinosaur possessed paravian aerobic capability or skeletal modifications indicative of such.\n 14. That the scientific community has explicitly rejected theropod origin as a model for the derivation of birds.\n \n For someone so assured of their intellectual integrity, I find it astonishing that you have utterly failed to address any of these points, or offer data to support them and refute the work which suggests that they are in correct. If, as you have maintained, refuting them is \"too easy,\" then by all means do so. Why the elaborate ad hominems, why the endless dodging?\n \n \n Your next point:\n \n \"It&#8217;s of no use, Vindex. Without a lung in theropods that is reaching for an avian nature, it is pointless to go back into osteology. I don&#8217;t care if theropods were growing lobed-fins. They wouldn&#8217;t be any closer to becoming true fish if their internal physiology did not point to the presence of gills and other specialized anatomy.\"\n +++++++++\n \n And this is the single most convenient way I have ever seen to entirely remove osteology from an argument, which is of course fitting with the pattern of your entire debate. What I find sublimely ironic is that intellectual beau idol in this particular aspect of the debate, John Ruben, hasn't been half so naive as you, to think that he can extract osteological data from his viewpoints. No, instead he has merely trivialized them, or misrepresented them.

   "Continued:\n \n You go on to quote Ruben et al as such:\n \n \"&#8220;The theropod ribcage-pectoral girdle complex is devoid of indications of skeletomuscular capacity for inhalatory filling of abdominal air sacs [for example, theropods lacked avianlike jointed or hinged ribs and an expansive sternum, structures without which proper ventilatory airflow cannot be maintained in the modern bird lung].&#8221; \n \n &#8220;Given their affinity to other sauropsids, dinosaurs probably possessed septate lungs.

Ruben claims there are no skeletal modifications in theropods to permit avian aerobic capacity, and specifically isolates the lack of a sternocostal joint, and the lack of ribs articulations characteristic of birds.\n \n And Ruben could not be more incorrect. Indeed, multiple maniraptoran taxa display not just a sternocostal joint, but ossified uncinate processes which in Aves sensu stricto, do not appear until the derivation of Ornithurae. Examples include Sinornithoides spp., Deinonychus antirrhopus, Velociraptor mongoliensis, Sinornithosaurus millenii, and Microraptor gui. Throughout Theropoda the rib heads articulate with the transverse processes of the vertebrae in characteristic avian style, and do not display the distal articulation with hyperelongated tranverse processes seen in crocodiles, as even cursory examination of any theropod rib cage will demonstrate.\n \n The latter two specimens listed above were recovered after Ruben et al's 1997 study, and your explicit failure to mention Ruben & Jone's far tamer approach to their argument in 2000 is most curious. Ruben has to date offered no data to invalidate the presence of the skeletal modifications listed above and in other posts.\n \n 2. Ruben claims that a pelvovisceral crocodile-like compartmentalization of the thorax is seen in both Sinosauropteryx prima and Scipionyx samniticus\n \n Ruben and his colleagues failed to mention that the Sinosauropteryx type upon which he based his data was symmetrically fractured into no less than 12 pieces during preperation, and subsequently glued back together piece-meal by amateur collectors without the supervision of trained paleontologists. This has largley obscured the carbonized material present in the caudal thorax of Sinosauropteryx and obliterated its original cranial extent. Ruben's infamous photograph of the material in 1996 and 1997, points to a cranial edge which has since been shown to be infilling and molding, and not the original carbonized material. Ruben chose to gloss over this glaring error in his latest review (Ruben & Jones 2000). Considering this, even the initial identification of the carbonized mass as a cranially convex septum is in serious doubt. However, let us give both Ruben and you the benefit of the doubt and say that the cranial margins he isolated are in fact accurate. They display a cranially convex arc on what is either the liver, or degenerative remains of the intestines. Since multiple birds have tall, crocodile like livers (e.g., ratites especially) and both crocodiles and birds display livers with cranially convex arcs, demonstrating such in Sinosauropteryx does nothing to invalidate either the hypothesis that theropods displayed paravian aerobic capability, or lack thereof. Rather, definitive evidence of a diaphragmatic septum must be offered, and to date, Ruben and his colleagues have utterly failed to do so. The best they have managed to do, is argue that vaguely preserved dermal fibers caudal to the thorax in Sinosauropteryx represent diaphragmatic muscles anchoring to the caudodistal margin of the pubis. However, Ruben et al (and Feduccia in 1999) make this assertion contingent on the procumbent orientation of the maniraptoran pubis, which is in fact opisthopubic in orientation (in some maniraptorans, more so than that of the urvogel), this error alone invalidates the hypothesis that such diaphragmatic muscles as seen in crocodiles were originating on the theropod pubis. Moreover, the fibers identified by Ruben et al in their 1997 findings are almost certainly M. obliquus and M. rectus, components of the abdominal wall which have absolutely nothing to do with pelvodiaphragmatic breathing, and thus far they [Ruben et al] have been unable to offer any data to substantiate their argument otherwise. Lastly, the claim that the gastralia of theropods and crocodiles are similar is entirely specious; they are nothing alike. The gastralia of crocodiles do not meet on the midline, instead being anchored to a subdermal cartilaginous sheet. In theropods, they meet not only on the midline, but in a characteristic zig-zag pattern.\n \n The same limitations and errors apply to Scipionyx samniticus, in which Ruben and his colleagues can only argue that the liver was cranially convex, but not offer sine qua non proof that a diaphragmatic, crocodile-like septum was present.\n \n I will actually go one step further than you, in discussing some of Ruben's conclusions. Namely, that the path followed by the nasal airway in both theropods and the archaic birds, follows the lepidosaurian style seen, for example, in a varanid lizard (Ruben 1996). Ruben based this conclusion on an artistic rendering of the skull of Dromaeosaurus albertensis found in Currie (1995), and not the actual diagram of the material as preserved. The argument is demonstrably falsifiable. The presence of extensive mediorostral maxillary sinuses, with ventral shelves extending so far laterally and caudally as to seal off the rostral expanse of the internal nares, physically prevents the nasal airway from following any directly ventral path in either maniraptorans, or the urvogel. The constriction of postantral struts in the rostral margin of the antorbital fenestra forces the exiting rostral nasal airway in a subvertical path ventrally, into the portion of the internal nares not sealed by the mediorotral sinuses, yielding an inverted \"L\" shape path. Ruben more or less retracted his argument to the contrary in Ruben & Jones (2000). This path for the nasal airway is seen elsewhere only in Avialae, and its presence in a supposedly hepatic-piston operating theropods begs explanation.\n \n You then go on to suggest:\n \n \"If I was the first and only to insist this, you might have the beginnings of a solid argument here. But your wrestle is not with me, but rather with John A. Ruben, Terry D. Jones, Nicholas R. Geist, and W. Jaap Hillenius. Do you want to email them and challenge their science (which by the way completely eclipses yours and mine combined x100)? Here is the email they supply: jonest@bcc.orst.edu.\"\n ++++++++++=\n \n Indeed, were I the first and only to severely criticize the factual basis or lack thereof, for Ruben's findings, you might have the beginning of a solid argument here. But you see, your wrestle is not with me, but rather with multiple independent reviews which have called Ruben's findings into question so severely, that in Ruben & Jones (2000), Ruben was less emphatic about his arguments. A list of such studies includes:\n \n Perry (1983, 1989, 1992), Colbert (1989), Paul (1988, 2002), Ruseel & Dong (1993), Chiappe & Calvo (1994), Claessens (1996), Reid (1996, 1997), Britt (1997), Currie (1997, 2003), Larson (1997), Norell & Makovicky (1997), Bramble & Jenkins (1998), Britt et al (1998), Claessens & Perry (1998), Xu, Wang & Wu (1999), Burnham et al (2000), Christiansen & Bonde (2000), Hutchinson (2001).\n \n In these sources, exhaustive refutations of Ruben's work can be found, as well as general refutations of the presence of a hepatic-piston in theropods. As one can see, I have no need of sending off email to Ruben, since others have already done far greater damage to his hypotheses than I would be capable of. \n \n Your last claim is the most curious of all. One has not run out of anything, and repetition is due to your continued failure to address the pertinent points. Your attempt to paint the data you have consistently refused to face, will not permit you to simply brush it aside as irrelevant old-hat. Failure to do so, in all regards, will lead to the conclusion that you indeed cannot argue this matter with any semblance of competence or intellectual integrity, are interested only in personal defamation for lack of ability to refute or uphold anatomical data, and moreover, have failed to falsify the theropod-bird link.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

   "An open letter to all Forum participants:\n \n About two weeks ago, Vindex Urvogel entered into an ongoing debate with me and other creationists about transitional fossils, a thread began by WarriorPoet. As Vindex and I faced of, it seemed that more and more we were centering around the ancestral line of modern birds and the theory that theropod dinosaurs gave rise to avian flight. \n \n Increasingly, in my debates with Vindex, it became apparent that he was lying about me on a personal level in his posts. When he first sent the below list, I knew that it contained lies, but I shrugged it off as some kind of \"hitting-below-the-belt\" debate tactic. After he sent the same list to me several more times, I became concerned that a character who would continue to post lies about another individual, might possibly be posting falsified or exaggerated scientific claims as well. Here is the list that Vindex has continued to post for several days now. My explanation follows below each line.\n \n 1. That Protoavis texensis is a bird more derived than Archaeopteryx.\n Several posts prior, I had already retracted my statements about Protoavis and conceded my arguments. The resubmission of this material under the guise that I was still defending this position was a devious tactic.\n \n 2. That Protoavis is a valid taxon.\n This had already been retracted and conceded. This was a deceitful move.\n \n 3. That hundreds of authorities agree that Protoavis is both a valid taxon and a more derived bird than the urvogel. \n I had already labeled my argument as \"bad science\" and retracted this statement and conceded the argument. Vindex was proving himself disingenuous to the current argument and fraudulent in his accusations.\n \n 4. That no dinosaurs possess furculae.\n This was lie. You will not be able to find where I claimed this.\n \n 5. That no dinosaurs possess sterna.\n This was a lie. You will not find this claim in my statements anywhere.\n \n 6. That holophyly of Neotetanurae is non-existent.\n This was a lie absolutely fabricated in the mind of Vindex. \n \n 7. That the pelvic girdle of Archaeopteryx and Maniraptora is entirely dissimilar.\n This was a lie. I only cited where the anatomy was held in dispute by reputable scientists.\n \n 8. That the manus, carpus, and manal formulae are non-homologous in Maniraptora and birds.\n This was a lie. I only said that digital homology further separates theropods and birds.\n \n 9. That the ascending process of the astragalus in theropods and birds is non-homologous.\n This was a lie. I only said that reputable scientists hold the anatomy in dispute.\n \n 10. That no dromaeosaur is feathered.\n This is correct. I gained this information from an article about the 20 or so specimens of dromaeosaurs unearthed to date.\n \n 11. That Compsognathus is claimed as the direct ancestor of birds.\n This was a lie. Vindex's taxa list began with Compsognathus longipes, so he is the one linking birds with Compsognathus.\n \n 12. That theropod origin claims anagenetic derivation of birds.\n This was a lie. You will not find where I made such a claim.\n \n 13. That no dinosaur possessed paravian aerobic capability or skeletal modifications indicative of such.\n Correct. Though skeletal morphology varies from genus to genus, it does not indicate or prove par avian capabilities a priori.\n \n 14. That the scientific community has explicitly rejected theropod origin as a model for the derivation of birds.\n This was a lie. What kind of reasonable thinking person would assert this? You will not find such a statement that I made.\n \n But Vindex somehow feels that he has a bestowed or inherent right to contemptuously malign those who disagree with him, even if it turns out to be a respected scientist standing in the way. His choice of words for Alan Feduccia, Avian Evolution, Paleobiology and Systematics, Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, was \"paragon of intellectual obsolescence.\" \n \n You make the decision when you read the below e-mail exchange. Did Vindex go too far yesterday and misrepresent an esteemed scientist, John A. Ruben? Ruben, Department of Zoology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, is an expert in paleophysiology and has contributed several articles to distinguished journals which underscore his detailed study of theropod dinosaurs and his sustained opinion that the skeletal design and diaphragm breathing mechanism found in theropods could not have given rise to an avian lung. \n \n It is my opinion that Vindex has falsified a report of reputed scientists (Ruben and Jones) and misrepresented their opinions. He has violated my trust in this and other ways. He has compromised his science and sacrificed his credibility. Personally, I am left with no choice but to regard him less than true to the cause of scientific research and debate. Because of this, I have chosen not to discourse with him at length again about any subject. Though I may interject a comment in rebuttal to a point he makes, any extended discussion is out of the question for me because it would necessarily demand a development of his particular style of science - a science that, at least in my experience, is potentially salted with falsehoods. \n \n Here is what Vindex unabashedly posted about Ruben and Jones yesterday (emphases in quotes are mine):\n \n \n Indeed, were I the first and only to severely criticize the factual basis or lack thereof, for Ruben's findings, you might have the beginning of a solid argument here. But you see, your wrestle is not with me, but rather with multiple independent reviews which have called Ruben's findings into question so severely, that in Ruben & Jones (2000), \"Ruben was less emphatic about his arguments.\" \n \n \"Ruben more or less retracted his argument to the contrary\" in Ruben & Jones (2000). This path for the nasal airway is seen elsewhere only in Avialae, and its presence in a supposedly hepatic-piston operating theropods begs explanation.\n \n The latter two specimens listed above were recovered after Ruben et al's 1997 study, and your explicit failure to mention \"Ruben & Jone's far tamer approach\" to their argument in 2000 is most curious. \"Ruben has to date offered no data to invalidate the presence of the skeletal modifications listed above\" and in other posts. \n\n \n In response to these remarks, I e-mailed John Ruben yesterday and he was good enough to reply. As you will see below, his reply was in no uncertain terms as Vindex would have had me believe. (I deleted my e-mail address and changed my name. Emphases in Ruben's e-mail are entirely his own): \n \n ----- Original Message ----- \n To: rubenj@bcc.orst.edu \n Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2003 5:00 PM\n Subject: Lungs and ventilation in theropods and early birds\n \n Dr. Ruben,\n \n Can you please tell me if you have revised and tamed down your observations you and Terry Jones and Geist and Hillenius made in 1997?\n \n I have heard that you published a later finding (in 2000?) where you and Jones are taking a more cautious approach to your claim that \"the hepatic-piston diaphragmatic lung ventilation in theropods...poses fundamental problems for such a relationship.\" (of course, the relationship being that birds are direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs).\n \n If you have indeed published a later finding, can you email me a link where I can read some about it?\n \n How do feel overall now? Do you suspect now that the skeletal complex of theropods possibly could have housed something akin to avian lungs? Or if not full avian, could they have housed an evolving type of respiratory system using air sacs?\n \n Thank you so much for any help! I would really appreciate it.\n \n You and Jones' studies are critical material in the ongoing theropod to bird debate.\n \n Have a nice day!\n \n Tom F.\n \n \n ----- Original Message ----- \n From: John Ruben \n Sent: Monday, September 22, 2003 4:03 PM\n Subject: Re: Lungs and ventilation in theropods and early birds\n \n \n Tom-- To answer your questions--\n 1. No, we haven't really modified our original objections to directly deriving a bird lung from a diaphragm-breathing ancestor. My basic position has ALWAYS been (contrary to incessant VP gossip) that birds/theropods are related, but not in the overly simplistic, linear fashion that is publicly popular. Much easier to understand the many fundamental differences/time constraints between the two groups if birds were derived from a very basal theropod or theropod-like ancestor sometime in the late Triassic/Early Jurassic.\n 2. No, we see NO good evidence for air-sac (birdlike lungs) in any theropod. The avian, air-sac lung WILL NOT WORK without a functional abdominal air sac. NO theropod/sauropod exhibits even the slightest hint that they possessed the skeletal attributes consistent with having been able to ventilate an abdominal airsac. See our latest review (\"Respiratory and reproductive physiology of dinosaurs and early birds\") in Physiological & Biochemical Zoology (2003).\n \n 'Hopes this is of some help to you...John R",

You will not find such a statement that I made.\n \n \n\n \n Your accusations are baseless. I intend to review each of these specious claims.\n \n 1, 2, 3 (pertaining to \"Protoavis\")\n \n I have not in any post since your capitulation on \"Protoavis\" argued that you were still actively advancing this specimen as a derived bird predating the urvogel. What I did state was that you made those very same assertions with absolutely no evidence, and for that very reason, were forced to retract them. It remains a sterling example of how from the outset, your argument has been not in the least bit based on the data at hand, but rather wild assertions which cannot be supported.\n \n 4 (pertaining to the lack or presence of furculae)\n \n You have explicitly rejected the presence of furculae in theropods. When I presented data from multiple neotetanuran taxa as the sine qua non proof otherwise, and stated that said taxa settled the argument you replied, in post #73: \n \n \"No it does not really. I wanted a gap-filler or several gap fillers from the 'o' furcula to the 'incipient' arrival.\"\n \n When presented with yet more elaboration of the presence and distribution of furculae in Neotetanurae you once more categorically dismissed such data stating in post #75:\n \n \"This offering does not fulfill what I have asked of you\" and \"All more or less have a furcula, but no necessarily the form we are looking for.\" Ergo, a non-homologous pseudo-furcula.\n \n 5 (regarding the presence of lack of a sternum in theropods)\n \n Indeed, I was quite mistaken in stating that you had claimed sterna were absent from theropods. You actually never even bothered to address the matter of sterna in theropods, completely and categorically dismissing it in post #70 with the caveat:\n \n \"I do not intend to address the sternum or any more anatomical features until I am satisfied with answers to my questions.\"\n \n 6 (regarding holophyly of Neotetanurae)\n \n Your entire post #70 implies that Neotetanurae is non holophyletic, by calling into question one of the central synapomorphies of the clade, and moreover, by asserting that I had failed to demonstrate the phylogenetic affinities of the taxa listed therein and their phyletic progression of character states.\n \n 7, 9 (regarding pelvic girdle and ascending process of astragalus in urvogels and dromaeosaurs)\n \n Your list of sources from Feduccia (1996, pg. 68) is prefaced not by a cautionary note that it is only suggested by some that such characters are dissimilar, but rather with the declaration that \"some key characters linking theropods and birds are in dispute\", and indeed the whole of post #83 is presented in defense of these views in a general attempt to argue that dromaeosaurs are in fact most unlike Archaeopteryx. Your support of the the sources cited was implicit.\n \n 8 (lack of digital homology in birds and theropods)\n \n You commented favorably in post #75 on Olson's statement that \"This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative anatomy\" in which Olson was explicitly referring to the studies on manal formulae in theropods and birds. Your attempt to pass off your comment in post #83, that \"Digital homology seen in theropods and birds separates the two groups\" as neither rejection nor defense of the matter of digital homology or lack thereof in theropods and birds is specious and misleading. The comment clearly indicates that you feel that rather than unifying the groups, the digital formulae and structure instead separate them, ergo, they are non-homologous.\n \n 10 (regarding dromaeosaur feathers)\n \n And for this assertion you provided absolutely no data, and completely overlooked the undeniably feathery integument of Sinornithosaurus millenii and Microraptor gui, taxa you did not even deign to mention. You have yet to show that these taxa are not feathered and/or that they are not dromaeosaurs. \n \n 11, 12 (regarding anagenetic derivation of birds from Compsognathus in theropod origin hypotheses)\n \n You devoted an entire paragraph to this very assertion, stating that:\n \n \"Archaeopteryx is without a reliable ancestor. Compsognathus longipes is rejected as ancestral to Archaeopteryx because both were recovered from the same formation where they existed as contemporaries. The specialized nature of its two digit manus further distances Compsognathus from Archaeopteryx. Along with Ornitholestes hermanni, Compsognathus is known to be a theropod, and both are probably coelurosaurs, but their phylogenetic affinities remain within the arena of debate and thus the specimens are confined to incertae sedis. But removal of Compsognathus from the avian lineage strikes at the very fountainhead of the theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Outside of Compsognathus, no known theropod seems to have been a suitable ancestor to birds.\"\n \n 13 (lack of paravian aerobic capacity in theropods)\n \n You have consistently offered absolutely no refutations to the significant amount of data suggesting that Ruben et al's conclusions as to soft-anatomy in Scipionyx and Sinosauropteryx are flawed, you have offered no data to refute or explain the widespread presence of osteological characters associated with avian aerobic systems in theropods, and offered no data to refute or explain why all the osteological modifications for a pelvovisceral pump, are absent in theropods. All you have managed to do is accuse me of academic fraud.\n \n 14 (regarding the rejection of theropod origin by the scientific community)\n \n Your entire post #77 revolves around this point, and you offer Olson's infamous open letter to the National Geographic as proof, prefacing with the paragraph:\n \n \"It has not taken long to find serious problems with your (so-called) homogenous avian lineage. You seemed to write with such an air of authority about the subject at hand, it actually caused me (and perhaps others) to momentarily think that you had stumbled onto something really big in the scientific world that I (we) had missed. A little subsequent research has proven that notion false, however. I have found opponents to your views literally everywhere and at all levels of the scientific community.\"\n \n Your argument that my defense of theropod origin is not upheld by the scientific community is implicit.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

I at no point claimed that Ruben or his colleagues had rejected their argument for a pelvovisceral pump in theropods, but rather explicitly stated that the 2000 paper for all intents and purposes abandoned the argument that in theropods the path taken by the nasal airway in theropods was of the lepidosaurian form (it was specifically compared to varanids). Here are my exact quotes, in context:\n \n \"In which Ruben & Jones abandoned their argument that the nasal airway of theropods was of the lepidosaurian form, which Ruben and his colleagues had specifically argued in 1996 and 1997 (comparing it to that of a varanid lizard).\" \n \n \"I will actually go one step further than you, in discussing some of Ruben's conclusions. Namely, that the path followed by the nasal airway in both theropods and the archaic birds, follows the lepidosaurian style seen, for example, in a varanid lizard (Ruben 1996). Ruben based this conclusion on an artistic rendering of the skull of Dromaeosaurus albertensis found in Currie (1995), and not the actual diagram of the material as preserved. The argument is demonstrably falsifiable. The presence of extensive mediorostral maxillary sinuses, with ventral shelves extending so far laterally and caudally as to seal off the rostral expanse of the internal nares, physically prevents the nasal airway from following any directly ventral path in either maniraptorans, or the urvogel. The constriction of postantral struts in the rostral margin of the antorbital fenestra forces the exiting rostral nasal airway in a subvertical path ventrally, into the portion of the internal nares not sealed by the mediorotral sinuses, yielding an inverted \"L\" shape path. Ruben more or less retracted his argument to the contrary in Ruben & Jones (2000). This path for the nasal airway is seen elsewhere only in Avialae, and its presence in a supposedly hepatic-piston operating theropods begs explanation.\"\n \n It is you who is guilty of academic fraud by purposely disorting my argument in an attempt to attack my credibility, and it is a hallmark of the creationist movement.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

And as always, you have done absolutely nothing nor presented any evidence, to suggest otherwise. All you can do is instead perpetrate elementary flaws in logical reasoning, by arguing that since they are professors and published researchers, they simply must be right. \n \n Vindex Urvogel",
