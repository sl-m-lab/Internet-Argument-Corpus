   "It's interesting how people in the US always belive that gun-control \"doesn't work\".\n Where I live, gun-laws are very restrictive and our crime and murder rates are very low.\n Although I agree that guns are only machines and that what you need to change is the people, I must say that it's naive to belive that fewer guns would not mean fewer armed robberies, murders, accidents with guns and so on. Make unauthorized gun-ownership illegal and have certain requrements for a licence. Then you can get a gun if you feel you really need one for hunting, selfdefense or whatever. (Although carrying a gun in a public place is illegal were I live I think.) And if you were determined as appropriate you would be given the right to own one. What is the problem with that?",

   "Tell us where you live and then we can start with the comparisons.\n \n As for where I live, we have very low crime as well. It's the cities that have the problems, and they're the ones with the strict gun laws. Also, look at it on a size/scale basis. According to CDC, there were 28k firearm related deaths in 2000 for the US. There are approx 100 million gun owners in America owning approx 300 million guns. Is it really that big of a problem or are people making it out worse than it is? If you also look at the site, most of those deaths are self-inflicted suicides, homocides make up a much smaller number.\n \n Also, the problem with letting the government decide who gets a gun can be seen with concealed weapons permit distribution in liberal cities. Just because you need a firearm doesn't mean they'll give it to you. Fienstien, one of the leaders in the banning of weapons in our congress, holds the distinction of being the only person in a California district with a concealed weapons permit. She said it makes here feel safer and if she was going to be attacked she was going to take her life into her own hands, yet she thinks average Americans shouldn't have that right. People in New York who have their stores constantly robbed can't legally obtain weapons to defend themselves because the city won't allow them firearms. That right there is reason enough not to give government absolute control over firearms.\n \n CDC Firearm statistics:\n http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/firearms.htm",

You can legally build your own reciever for these, as long as you modify them for semi auto. One guy was chatting about building a Bren (a belt fed, full auto squad support machine gun, circa 1945). HE was going to build it full auto, because he was from finland and that is not prohibited there.\n \n What gives?

I think they are more concerned with people killing other people. Is there something I am not understanding?\n\n \n Let me see if this old curmudgeon can explain a few things in my, admittedly, poor way of explaining things. In this country, LIB DIM GGs, ( usually the bulk of the anti-gunners ) like to include suicides with murders, when discussing the number of deaths from the misuse of firearms each year. When shown that suicides are a symptom of a mind filled with despair and/or other psycological factors, they somehow or another lose interest. Never the less, if the discussion is in dealing with dfeaths by firearms used in murder, somehow the firearm itself becomes an instument of evil. It magically transforms ( whether by some umn-dega-dega incantations, or some spell cast by the evil gun fairey, is not known ) otherwise law abiding citizens, and of course, poor misguided criminals, wishing to do no more than deprive some citizen of his/her lawful possessions, ( property or life ) to myseriously wish to kill, kill, kill.\n \n In short, when convenient, suicide by any means, is a high probability if one truly wishes to do away with one's self.\n \n The question arises as to whether it's the firearms, or the social factors, that cause the murder rate differences between different cultures. The gun grabbers would have us believe it's the proliferation of firearms in our society. They speak to the high cost in deaths and related costs. I submit to you, with all due respect, the cost of these deaths, many, if not most, caused by criminal against criminal, is outweighed by the prevention of about 2 1/2 million crimes per year by the use of a firearm. Most DO NOT CARE TO BELIEVE THIS, so it's blown off as irrational results, obtained by unsupportable techniques and protocol, and conducted by incompetent people. These results are designed to promulgate an indefensible position by irresponsible groups of people that only wish to continue this charade designed by the nasty old NRA, ( or whatever group sems to fit the bill ) to promote the continuation of profits obtained from the sale of immoral weapons. \n \n Possibly this has wandered from your question, but the soap box was there.....................",

   "YOu have a cople of problems with licensing guns in America. THe first is tat the Supreme court has ruled that you cannot attach a prerequesit to the practice of a right. They cannot require a license before you are allowed to speak, nor is a licence before you are allowed to own a gun constitutional. The courts have gotten around this in constitutional challenges by either citing the \"collective rights\" theory (which would msot likely not hold up to supreme court scrutiny) or by sidestepping the constitutional issues entirely (Such as the recent case regarding DC residents.....The court would not rule on the constitutionality of hte law, they dismissed the cases based on te fact than none of the people had applied for a permit and been refused so they had no grounds for relief, they then said that washington residents don;t have the same constitutional rights as the rest of the nation).\n \n For gun control to be effective, it must address the problems associate with gun use. It can;t be prohibitivley expensive when compared to the benifit it is meant to provide. IT must be acceptable to gun owners (no, it doesn;t really matter what anti gunners WANT, the more important question is what the 100 million armed americans are willing to accept).\n \n An example of a good gun control law can be found right here in my home state. In kansas, a burglar with a gun is subject to a 5 year prison sentence in addition to to the penalty for the burglary. Incidentaly, we have a much lowr rate of burlglary in kansas that they do in amny other states. People who are willing to break into a house are NOT willing to face an extra 5 years just for carrying a gun when they do so.\n \n This is a good, common sense gun law. It doesn;t cost th public much, it punishes the right people, and there are no constitutional arguments raised.\n \n WE have the brady bill, and the background checks that come with it. We have spent millions setting up background checks and millions per year administering the system. It has not done anything to lower violent crime. This is an example of a poor gun control law. IT costs a small fortune, ticks off law abiding gun owners, and does nothing to address the problem (crimainl use of weapons).\n \n We have all seen the surveys of felons where it is made unquestionably clear that they do not buy their guns through noraml outlets. Claims that licensing programs will lower illegal gun usage fly in the face of logic. \n \n \n \nI agree with background checks [when thoroughly performed] on gun buyers. (Just recently, a mentally disturbed man was able to buy another firearm after shooting at people from the interstate bridges around Columbus Ohio for several months. He was captured recently after purchasing another handgun, but it wasn't the meager background check that caught him as it should have been.)\n \n \n Meager background check? The background check currently in place utilizes data from the NCIC, all federal crime databases AND state databases. IT would be nearly impossible to perform a more thorough background check in regards to criminal backgroud without actually assinging an agent to each application and sending them out to ask questions (like they do for security clearances). The simple fact of the matter is, this guy had nothing in his backgrund that would prohibit him from purchasing the guns he was apporved to purchase. \n \n Taking ito account that the background checks currently in place already take advantage of all federal, state, and local criminal background data, as well as state and local data regarding metal condition (if you are involuntarily commited to a mental hospital state records shoudl reflect this), exactly what would you suggest to make the system more thorough? It seems like all available data is already being utilized. Should you need a note from your mother to purchse a gun?\n \n \nHowever, I believe in the unrestricted ownership of handguns, rifles, shotguns and anything short of a machine gun. Armor-piercing ammunition should be restricted, but available to law enforcement and military.\n\n \n \n Why not machine guns? Machine gns are currently legal (despite an unconstitutional tax that is required to purchase one) and there has NEVER been a single case of a private citizen using a legally owned machine gun to commit a crime. The only crime on record that has ever been commited with a legally owned machine gun was commited by a police officer in chicago, who put a burst into a drug dealer that got mouthy.\n \n As far as armor piercing ammo, who decides what is armor piercing? THe only TRUE armor piercing ammo contains either a spent uranium or hardened steel penetrator. Generally, this is used in big bore military cannons. Coating a bullet in teflon will do nothing but lubricate your barrel.\n \n ON the other side, though, a .308 boattail will penetrate most bulltproof vests, as will a acket 30-06. These are two of the more popular rounds out there for hunting deer. \n \n Are you arguing that ammo with hardened pentrators be banned to all but military and law enforcement? IF so, that is certainly fine, as they don't generally make it for guns that a civilian is likely to own anyway. If you are arguing that any round designed to penetrate a bullet proof vest be banned, there is a problem. Body armor is designed to stop primarily big, slow rounds fired by handguns (whihc are generally low powered weapons, even a .357 magnum, when comapred to a high powered rifle). A lighter, high velcity round from a hunting rifle will make pretty quick work of a lot of body armor (unless you hit the tauma plate, in which case it is hit or miss). \n \n I saw a deal on the news the other day I thought was interesting. ONe of the family memebrs of one of hte DC sniper victims was saying that there is no reason for civilians to have high powered sniper rifles like the sniper used.\n \n The DC snipers used a bushmaster .223. This is FAR from being a \"high powered sniper rifle\". IT is illegal in my state to shoot deer with a .223 becasue it is such a low powered round (our law requires a round \"larger than .223......). \n \n THe two strictes countries I know of in regards to gun control are Taiwan and S Africa. In both of these places posession of a weapon can concievably lead tot he death penalty. Both of these places have higher incidince of gun homicide than the US.",

Oh, some of the larger townships may have a marshall, but it fell within the particular area in which one lived, to furnish the 'policing' of their location. Each location, area, or subarea, had its own militia. It was incumbent upon all men attaining age 16, ( heavens, that will blow the antigunners minds ) or just moving into the district to present himself for militia duty. He was required to furnish, at his own expense, a rifle or musket of the type being used by regular troops, so much shot and powder, a certain amount of provisions, and a blanket. Upon being enrolled in the militia, he was to present himself, along with the other militiamen of that district, upon the 'green' for drill and marksmanship training. Hence the term, well regulated. If the young man or the new man in town did not attain unto himself the necessary accoutements, even if he had to borrow the money, he could be put into servitude until the debt was paid.

They actually served as the police in areas where marauding bands of indians and criminals roamed. While the indians are no longer a threat, the gangs of criminals are still with us. \n \n As an aside, and admittedly this will mean little to you, but the militias have a special role of honor for me as my 5th Great Grandfather was a Captain, along with his brother in law that, was involved in the force of 1200 that forced marched from the Wautauga Settlement ( now in Tennesse, but originally part of North Carolina ) to Kings Mountain in North Carolina, engaged a fellow by the name of Ferguson with a superior force, kicked ***, took names, then split the force and some force marched back 'over the mountains', and some went on to Cowpens.

George's grand son Jesse, my 3rd Great Grandfather was a lieutenant in a Captain Ellis's militia from Dickson Co, Tennessee and fought with Andy Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans.
