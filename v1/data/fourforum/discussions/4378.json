   "Where did the concept of \"worship\" of this mythical supernatural power came from? Is this mythical supernatural power egotistical?\n\n in man's perspective, any being with supreme power and authority is necessarily arrogant and egotistical. the only way to demonstrate the superiority of this power is by making oneself as inferior as possible\n \n \nWhere did the concept of immortality and an afterlife (in utopia or hell) come from?\n\n religion is the response to the percieved evil that exists in the world. whenever tragedy strikes hard, people immediately and almost instinctively consider a larger picture. this is especially true when the tragedy is caused by something totally beyond man's control (like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc. to counter this 'evil', there must be some hope that a good greater than such exists, otherwise most people would be totally overcome with despair and wouldnt be able to function. what is the worst thing that can happen to someone? death. what good could possibly overcome this ultimate tragedy? an afterlife of eternal bliss, of course\n \n \nI personally think religion is nothing more than a phycholigical crutch for the weak.\n\n we all are weak at sometime, and, like being strong, being weak is learned and can be unlearned. in religious environments, members are regularly remided of their weaknesses, another ploy that produces more inferiority, worship, and very often manipulation and oppression\n \nPlease, don't start quoting the Bible. That is not the answer.\n\n i think quotes from the bible will add a dimension of first-hand religious mentality and should be welcomed, but its not my topic :)",

   "for a while i thought the same thing. then i realized that religion DOES serve a purpose: it binds the masses together so that they can achieve great (or heinous) works. the pyramids of egypt, for example- these were accomplished not by slaves, but by an entire caste of master artisans- who wants to live forever in a crappy slave-built house that might collapse? then theres the giant stone buddhas that the taliban got in trouble for blowing up in ~'98- do you think the buddhas were built because they'd 'look pretty'? no, they were built because people believed he was a god and wanted to honor him.\n\n \n If you would care to consider an altertative view of what the masses want and how they get it, I recommend \"ATLAS SHRUGGED\" by Ayn Rand. It also addresses the issue of the \"aid\" given to them that you mention below.\n \n The masses believe that their \"need\" outweighs any individual rights and the productive output of any individual effort, belongs to the masses. \n \n Communism is a good example of this. It became a state \"religion\"; focusing on the \"common\" good of the masses. It failed miserably, having wrecked man's spirit and declimated society. Why should one individual give his best effort when he will recieve no more than the laziest of all the mass?\n \n Did the masses invent the light bulb? Did the masses invent the internal combustion engine? Did the masses create the Mona Lisa? Who did the masses build the great pyramids for? Themselves?\n \n You mentioned the stone Buddha. I am not Buddhist, but I was interested in it at one point after having visited a Buddhist counrty (Thailand). I read a \"primer\" on it. Buddha never claimed to be a divinity. Neither did he ever porport that such a divinity existed. He is not revered as a \"god\", but as a teacher. According to Buddha, the meaning of life is suffering and misery, and the only way to acheive happiness was to renounce desire in any form. In a way, that makes sense. If you desire nothing, then you can never be disappointed.\n \n \nthis continues even today: the majority of aid workers are religiously motivated, as are the people you hear about every once in a while who go to college here and then go over to africa to become school teachers or some such profession.\n\n \n And what they are teaching scares me to death.\n \n \nthe good part of all of this is that the need for religion is shrinking as peoples' knowledge-of their world and how it works-grows.\n",

   "And do you have a link to the story about the girl with visions and the clock? It sounds like an urban legend to me.\n\n Will have a look, was on Horizon about the people investigating the phenonom (team that put the helmet on Richard Dawkins) sometime ago rather than a website.\n \n \n Here's the best link, BBC sumamary of the program, has the other sections there too. Go to the transcript and it mentions the clock thing (didn't get it quite right though the actual program makes it seem a bit harsher than the transcript does with just a spirit in the room)\n \n \nNARRATOR: To ensure that it was genuinely the electromagnetic field that caused the sensed presence, Dr Persinger ran the experiment with the field switched both off and on. Crucially no one was told what the true purpose of the experiment was, merely that it was to do with relaxation. When the results came back, they were impressive. When the machine was on, 80% sensed something. Dr Persinger has taken his research a stage further. He believes naturally occurring electromagnetic fields might also be capable of generating the sensed presence. This, he argues, could explain not just our sense of god, but perhaps other supernatural experiences too - like ghosts.\n \n PERSINGER: We were called by an individual who was concerned about her daughter who was having an experience and people were concerned that she was crazy.\n \n NARRATOR: The girl was having terrible trouble sleeping. Every night she was visited by the most horrific supernatural experience. She would become more and more terrified, convinced that a spirit was in the room with her. Increasingly traumatised, she dreaded going into her bedroom. So Dr Persinger decided to visit the house. He was convinced that the girl's hallucinations had to be the result of hidden, fluctuating, electromagnetic fields. These could be caused, perhaps, by an overhead pylon or an underground fault line. The challenge for Dr Persinger and his colleague, Stan Koren, was to track down the source of these fields. The team used their specially adapted measuring equipment - a plastic milk crate and a roll of copper wire.\n \n PERSINGER: What's your beat frequency for the gigahertz - 15?\n \n KOREN: 15 kilohertz - that's right.\n \n PERSINGER: In certain situations electromagnetic fields are being generated that overlap at what the brain normally generates. Certain individuals, if their brains are sensitive, their brains can interact with these fields to produce all kinds of powerful, very meaningful, experiences that can be called a god, or a haunt, depending upon their interpretation.\n \n Talk about quietude!\n \n So we walk about the house trying to find out where the areas are that may be the sources of the signals. Usually the people tell us on the basis of their experience, they'll say: \"This is where it happens.\"\n \n NARRATOR: Initially the readers the team found were inconclusive, but then they noticed a clock radio in the girl's bedroom.\n \n PERSINGER: We went over and measured and we found that she slept near a clock, and we measured the clock, and the clock had a particular, unusual pattern to it. It was the same basic pattern that we were using to generate the presence in the laboratory. The clock was removed, the phenomena itself terminated.\n \n NARRATOR: Dr Persinger's story sounds\n \n",

Religion grows because conditions favour it, rather than because it is providing a discrete benefit (i.e not reality to its place in society).\n \n Its easy to see the negative impact of religion when you focus on the more extreme examples, generally based around brainwashing leaving the victim unable/unwilling to see basic facts placed in front of them, or to lose all empathy for others.\n \n Ignorance and fanatism are very hard to justify, your strong faith distances you from being able to see the negatives effects of a rise and increase in relgion.\n If the question was 'can you see a problem with a rise in Islamic fundamentalism?' would you have answered differently?",
