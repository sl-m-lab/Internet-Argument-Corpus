What they are opposed to is creationism and the intelligent design movement, the religious indoctrination of children, the attempt to subvert the separation of church and state, and the amazing amount of violence that comes about as a result of religious conflict.\n\n \n It's no less wrong-headed to oppose people being creationist or \"indoctrinating their children\" (which EVERYONE does in various ways). There's nothing morally wrong with being a creationist. People should be left alone to believe whatever they want, just as you want religious people to leave you alone to believe whatever you want. Creationism may not be scientific, but that doesn't mean it's morally wrong. It's not morally wrong to believe the moon is made of cheese, either. If creationism is something you're a militant toward, then with all due respect I'd seriously suggest finding yourself a much less benign thing to oppose--maybe something that is a serious problem.\n \n I also find it fascinating (and frankly rather irrational) that you would lump the likes of 'creationism' in with 'religious violence' in terms of what you support being militant toward. \n \n I also disagree with you that people like Dawkins aren't opposed to people having religion. They may not be out to legally infringe upon people being able to do things like worshipping, but do you actually believe they would not prefer the world be atheist? Clearly, they are opposed to religion. Atheists like Richard Dawkins and Chris Hitchens all too often aren't careful to make the distinction between religion and fundamentalism. \"Religious violence\" comes about due to extremism, not religion, because religion usually exists without violence and there are very good things that have come about by people claiming to be inspired by religion. At the LEAST, reason dictates that it is BAD religion rather than religion in general out of which bad things like violence comes about. I certainly hope you will continue to be opposed to the likes of extremist violence--many religious people themselves are opposed to such things as well. But please be careful to remember that religion is not really what is at the heart of those things--it's fundamentalism and extremism. After all, we've had people like William Wilberforce, ML King Jr, Desmund Tutu, Bono, and many others standing for peace having been inspired by religion, according to their own words.\n \n You see, the phrase 'militant atheism' should be somewhat oxymoronic, or at least unrelated. If a-theism is nothing more than a lack of belief in God (as so many atheists insist that it is in response to religious apologists arguing that atheism ITSELF is a belief), then your militancy really has nothing to do with you being atheist. Therefore you assert to be 'militant' over problems like violence, but that's no different than many religious people doing the same thing as well. It's certainly noble of you to oppose \"religious violence\" (which is really just extremist ideological violence), but there's no more of a moral high ground in being an atheist when it comes to opposing it, than in anything else. In a sense you're just joining in with all sorts of people who AREN'T atheist who oppose such violence as well. Call it a form of pacifism, perhaps, that goes beyond whether one is atheist or not.\n \n The somewhat modern aggressive movement in atheism (a la Hitchens and Dawkins) to make atheism some sort of rallying cry and religion out to be a villain rather than blaming 'BAD religion' is fascinating, but very wrong-headed and irrational. These very public atheists have moved past just merely no belief in god to being activists against religion from a PR standpoint. It's a strange form of atheistic evangelism, to some extent. So by all means, oppose the bad things in the world like violence. Again, many religious people opposed violence down through history and do so now. But please don't do what I've seen all too often among atheists and blithely chalk things up to \"religion\" as if it were a one-size-fits-all villain. That's more along the lines of an approach that Falwell would take.\n \n And again, I totally disagree with your approach of viewing creationism as something to be militant toward. As well as \"religious indoctrination of children\". What if religious indictrination for a particular parent involves teaching the ethic of reciprocity? (And I hope you realize that it very OFTEN does.) For that matter, many parents (at least if they're decent ones) indoctrinate their children with something. They're instilling values. I suspect the real problem here is just that you don't like the fact that some people instill the values of religion, 'cause you just don't like religion. Which is kind of strange since so many parents instill GOOD values out of their religion. Why would you be opposed to something like that? Again (same as the other issue), what you should be opposed to is parents instilling BAD values, not necessarily religious ones.\n \n Sorry for the long post. But you touched on some very major and complicated issues here for which simplicity is not really an option.",

If creationism is something you're a militant toward, then with all due respect I'd seriously suggest finding yourself a much less benign thing to oppose--maybe something that is a serious problem.\n\n \n I figured when I said \"creationism and the intelligent design movement,\" and coupled it with the reminder that Dawkins and PZ do not oppose having religious beliefs that what they oppose is not the beliefs themselves but the religious right's attempt to squeeze it into the classroom and government.\n \n \nI also find it fascinating (and frankly rather irrational) that you would lump the likes of 'creationism' in with 'religious violence' in terms of what you support being militant toward. \n\n \n \"Militant atheist\" is a misnomer. When Dawkins and PZ say they're proud to be militant atheists, they envision absolutely nothing having to do with military action or violence. The term has simply come to represent atheists that are assertive about their beliefs.\n \n \nI also disagree with you that people like Dawkins aren't opposed to people having religion. They may not be out to legally infringe upon people being able to do things like worshipping, but do you actually believe they would not prefer the world be atheist? Clearly, they are opposed to religion.\n\n \n Okay, fine. Dawkins and PZ are \"opposed\" to religion just like all Christians are by default opposed to atheism, Islam, and Judaism even though they're perfectly fine with letting such live amongst them as coworkers and friends. That's nothing new, and nor is it something to be ashamed of. Along the exact same lines of reason: Even though I tolerate rap music and people who listen to it, I think the world would be a more pleasant place without rap music, so I am therefore opposed to rap music, apparently.\n \n \nAtheists like Richard Dawkins and Chris Hitchens all too often aren't careful to make the distinction between religion and fundamentalism. \"Religious violence\" comes about due to extremism, not religion, because religion usually exists without violence and there are very good things that have come about by people claiming to be inspired by religion.\n\n \n The religious belief is what facilitates the fundamentalism. You can't have religious violence without religion. Hitchens specifically does make the distinction between people who are non-violently religious and people who are fundamentalists, and the conclusion he draws is that if the passively religious people were to stand up and tell the fundamentalists to #### off like he is, we wouldn't have to deal with fundamentalism in the first place.\n \n The criticism towards ordinary, harmless religion stems from the lack of effort towards extinguishing fundamentalism. The fact is that non-violent people with religious beliefs greatly outnumber the fundamentalists, and if they were to work at it, we could get rid of fundamentalism. This isn't happening, though.\n \n \nYou see, the phrase 'militant atheism' should be somewhat oxymoronic, or at least unrelated. If a-theism is nothing more than a lack of belief in God (as so many atheists insist that it is in response to religious apologists arguing that atheism ITSELF is a belief), then your militancy really has nothing to do with you being atheist. Therefore you assert to be 'militant' over problems like violence, but that's no different than many religious people doing the same thing as well. It's certainly noble of you to oppose \"religious violence\" (which is really just extremist ideological violence), but there's no more of a moral high ground in being an atheist when it comes to opposing it, than in anything else. In a sense you're just joining in with all sorts of people who AREN'T atheist who oppose such violence as well. Call it a form of pacifism, perhaps, that goes beyond whether one is atheist or not.\n\n \n Again, all \"militant atheist\" connotes is a more assertive non-believer -- someone who will stick up for his rights, vocally disagree with religious ideas, advocate rationalism over faith, etc.\n \n But perhaps militant atheism as a term is contradictory or nonsensical. Well, so what? Do you think \"militant\" atheists -- many of whom have probably never touched a gun in their life -- actually consider themselves militant? Do you think atheists coined a term that does so much damage to their position?\n \n \nThe somewhat modern aggressive movement in atheism (a la Hitchens and Dawkins) to make atheism some sort of rallying cry and religion out to be a villain rather than blaming 'BAD religion' is fascinating, but very wrong-headed and irrational. These very public atheists have moved past just merely no belief in god to being activists against religion from a PR standpoint.\n\n \n There are two necessary conditions for violent religion: violence and religion. Although it can be weakened, violence cannot conceivably be removed from our society. Of course, we try. In fact, most atheists are liberal, and many on both sides of the political spectrum are vocal peace activists as well.\n \n But the other necessary component of violent religion can be properly set aside to where to belongs. Religion has no place in government, it has no place in the science classroom or science academia, and it has no place warfare. \"Militant\" atheists want religion gone from those three areas, but unfortunately, there are huge swaths of people in both this country and the world abroad that want it everywhere and more. It's not a problem that will be fixed by \"holding back one's beliefs\". It means having to offend people in the process of fighting back.\n \n \nAnd again, I totally disagree with your approach of viewing creationism as something to be militant toward.\n\n \n When was the last time Dawkins shot a young earth creationist? Are we using the real definition of \"militant\" here, or just a synonym for \"assertive\"? If you don't feel it's reasonable to be assertive against the degradation of America's already dismal science education, I have to ask why.\n \n \nAs well as \"religious indoctrination of children\". What if religious indictrination for a particular parent involves teaching the ethic of reciprocity? (And I hope you realize that it very OFTEN does.) For that matter, many parents (at least if they're decent ones) indoctrinate their children with something. They're instilling values. I suspect the real problem here is just that you don't like the fact that some people instill the values of religion, 'cause you just don't like religion. Which is kind of strange since so many parents instill GOOD values out of their religion. Why would you be opposed to something like that? Again (same as the other issue), what you should be opposed to is parents instilling BAD values, not necessarily religious ones.\n\n \n Anti-religious indoctrination is a distant issue from what we are discussing, and it's not something I want to get too deep into on this thread, but to summarize Dawkin's presentation at the American Atheists conference that he gave here in Minnapolis two days ago, what he wants to see is a heightened consciousness towards religious indoctrination. By this, take for example the sentence, \"Man is stronger than tiger.\" Feminists raised humanity's consciousness to this issue, and now we say, \"Humans are stronger than tigers\" in order to refer to females as well.\n \n In much the same way, Dawkins wants to see the whole idea of \"Christian children\" gone. He finds it ridiculous to refer to a child in a religious regard in much the same way he finds it ridiculous to say \"that child is a socialist\" or \"that child is a Reagan conservative\".",

   "\"Militant atheist\" is a misnomer. When Dawkins and PZ say they're proud to be militant atheists, they envision absolutely nothing having to do with military action or violence. The term has simply come to represent atheists that are assertive about their beliefs.\n\n \n I agree, and I don't mean it in a 'military' sense. I was just using the same language PZ Myers had used. \n \n \nOkay, fine. Dawkins and PZ are \"opposed\" to religion just like all Christians are by default opposed to atheism, Islam, and Judaism even though they're perfectly fine with letting such live amongst them as coworkers and friends. That's nothing new, and nor is it something to be ashamed of. Along the exact same lines of reason: Even though I tolerate rap music and people who listen to it, I think the world would be a more pleasant place without rap music, so I am therefore opposed to rap music, apparently.\n\n \n No. Sorry, but these atheists are not just staying content to limit their opposition to being 'perfectly fine with letting such live amongst them'. They're writing books doing things like calling these peoples' views 'delusions', and intentionally insulting leaders of these movements after they've died and can't speak for themselves (as Hitchens did of Falwell post mortem). A better analogy would be if someone not only disliked rap music, but wrote whole books against it, went around the world doing conferences about it, likening it to being delusional and therefore stating something downright offensive about it. It goes beyond the picture of benign tolerance you're trying to paint here. That's not to let religion off the hook either, but this isn't a comparison. Religion shouldn't be intolerant either. But the point is that atheism as a movement is getting some of the same unfortunate tendencies, and Dawkins and Hitchens are fueling that fire.\n \n \nThe religious belief is what facilitates the fundamentalism. You can't have religious violence without religion.\n \n There are two necessary conditions for violent religion: violence and religion. \n\n \n It's the wrong way to refer to it though. It's really simply extremist violence. Calling it \"religious violence\" is like saying \"patriotism violence.\" There's nothing wrong with patriotism per se; it's when it goes bad and turns into extremist nationalism or some other bastardization that it becomes violent. That's the way religion is. You could just as easily say you can't have patriotic violence without partriotism. So what? It's beside the point because patriotism isn't the problem. Just as it's not really religion that's the problem. It's extremism. Do you understand what I'm saying here?\n \n \nHitchens specifically does make the distinction between people who are non-violently religious and people who are fundamentalists, and the conclusion he draws is that if the passively religious people were to stand up and tell the fundamentalists to #### off like he is, we wouldn't have to deal with fundamentalism in the first place.\n\n \n Yes, that's what often happens--they can't blame non-violent religious people so they resort to blaming them for the NON-action of something rather than action. It's yet another irrational approach, though--you see, people are independently religious. It is no more the responsibility of religious people to 'reign in' badly religious folks than it would be for atheists to reign in the likes of Stalin and Lenin or even admit such examples of extremism (rather than resorting to the unfortunate approach of trying to tie even THEM to religion by implying it's some sort of 'religion of the state' or something, as is the silly defense that's often given). \n \n And for that matter, there are plenty of religious folks that DO stand up to the likes of Falwell and other fundamentalists. Hitchens should know better--it doesn't take much effort at all to see that. \n \n \nThe criticism towards ordinary, harmless religion stems from the lack of effort towards extinguishing fundamentalism. The fact is that non-violent people with religious beliefs greatly outnumber the fundamentalists, and if they were to work at it, we could get rid of fundamentalism. This isn't happening, though.\n\n \n Oh but it is. Fundamentalism is much less entrenched and in control than it was years ago. Evolution is taught in schools now, and is pretty much the norm in acedemia and even broader culture in terms of understanding the natural world. It wasn't that way as recently as 20 years ago. And let's be honest: 'Christian' violence is pretty rare. How many churches do you know of that call on it's members to go blow themselves up in crowded marketplaces? Not only is fundamentalism not so entrenched any more, its danger is really overstated to begin with. What you call religious violence happens more in Islam, simply because extremism is more prevalent in that particular religion. But the problem is still extremism, because plenty of Muslims don't practice violence at all.\n \n Nevertheless, I have to take issue with the idea that it's somehow religion's responsibility to stop fundamentalism and extremism. Extremism should be opposed independently of whether one is religious or not. Religion is not some card-carrying membership; it's more like an \"ism\" itself--ideology. It's like saying 'patriotism' should reign in violence. It just doesn't work that way.\n \n \nBut perhaps militant atheism as a term is contradictory or nonsensical. Well, so what? Do you think \"militant\" atheists -- many of whom have probably never touched a gun in their life -- actually consider themselves militant? Do you think atheists coined a term that does so much damage to their position?\n\n \n Again, I agree with you here. I never intended it to be in the sense of 'military' or violence action. I'll use a different phrase to avoid confusion.\n \n \nBut the other necessary component of violent religion can be properly set aside to where to belongs. Religion has no place in government, it has no place in the science classroom or science academia, and it has no place warfare.\n\n \n Do you actually think removing religion from govt. and schools will stop violence? I agree religion and govt. should be kept apart, but having ID taught in the classroom has nothing whatsoever to do with what you call 'religious violence.' You're conflating a lot of issues here that aren't necessarily related. \n \n I'd also have no problem with any of that, except that it all too often doesn't stop there. There's an unfortunate culture afoot in the scientific world to condescend toward any scientist who even IS religious, much less somehow 'brings it into the classroom.' Right now there is a dangerously growing movement of prejudice and discrimination toward Christian scientists, and there shouldn't be. Especially considering that some of the greatest scientists down through history were religious. The idea that religion and science can't co-exist is downright fallacious; it certainly can and as a theistic evolutionist myself I know firsthand that it can do so. In no way is science compromised in my thinking just because I believe there is ultimately theism behind it. If you oppose the ID movement, then fine. But let's keep it at that, rather than saying something far more broad like 'religion has no place in the science classroom.' Seriously, how is anyone actually harmed if a teacher happens to mention he is religious or happens to be a theistic evolutionist? Oppose bad where there is BAD, not where there is no bad. \n \n \n\"Militant\" atheists want religion gone from those three areas, but unfortunately, there are huge swaths of people in both this country and the world abroad that want it everywhere and more. It's not a problem that will be fixed by \"holding back one's beliefs\". It means having to offend people in the process of fighting back.\n\n \n Then good luck, because you're just going to infuriate people. When you decide to take the tact of being offensive toward people over something they consider dear to them, you're making a serious mistake. You're ceding the moral high ground, and neglecting the high road. Offending people over their religion will do more harm for atheism than it will ever do good.\n \n \nIf you don't feel it's reasonable to be assertive against the degradation of America's already dismal science education, I have to ask why.\n\n \n Because it's a shotgun approach. The approach being taken is just to take anything that might resemble religion and call it 'bad', rather than being rational about it and find out where the REAL problem areas lie. Again, if ID is the problem, then oppose ID. But not just 'religion'. It's not religion that's causing the problem in America's education system--again, (just like the other issues we discussed above), religion can go either way. What if, suddenly, religion started espousing evolution? Would you THEN be anti-religion and say it doesn't belong in our classroom? What if evolution WERE a religious belief? I realize that's a hypothetical, but it's to make a point: that religion is just a broad term that can be any number of beliefs. It's the bad ones that cause the problems. Not all of it. If not, the we wouldn't have had the likes of Issac Newton or Lord Kelvin. \n \n \n... to summarize Dawkin's presentation at the American Atheists conference that he gave here in Minnapolis two days ago, what he wants to see is a heightened consciousness towards religious indoctrination. By this, take for example the sentence, \"Man is stronger than tiger.\" Feminists raised humanity's consciousness to this issue, and now we say, \"Humans are stronger than tigers\" in order to refer to females as well. In much the same way, Dawkins wants to see the whole idea of \"Christian children\" gone. He finds it ridiculous to refer to a child in a religious regard in much the same way he finds it ridiculous to say \"that child is a socialist\" or \"that child is a Reagan conservative\".\n\n \n The question becomes 'does he mean we shouldn't teach our kids religious values?' That's the bottom line. If he does, then it's an absurd position that will never get anywhere and is a waste of time, frankly. If he simply means we should not categorize kids in that way in terms of how we refer to them, then fine, I have no disagreement with that. \n \n I suspect though, that he really believes kids shouldn't be taught religious values--(what he calls 'indoctrination', which of course sounds more ominous! :) ) The question then becomes--what values are ok in religion to teach and which ones aren't? And that's the crux of everything. Sorry, but if so, Dawkins and others will just have to go right on dealing with the fact that my children are Christian children in the sense they've been taught good values (like the ethic of reciprocity) FROM that religion. And yes, I know that ethic is not limited to Christianity, but nevertheless it IS the belief system out of which my children were taught it. If that's bad, then go right on considering me guilty.",

I don't give a rat's XXX if a biology teacher is a creationist as long as she keeps her creationism out of the classroom. Science standards in my state mandate teaching the framework that science deals only with the natural; that the supernatural is beyond science's reach. This should work both ways.

But you forget that most ID people really do believe what they say.

When Ben Stein and his producer purport to be making a documentary so different than their actual intent that they have to lie about what it is, it's lying. There is intent to deceive. When the writers of Of Pandas and People claim that the book has no basis in traditional creationism even though a draft has \"cdesign proponentsists\" as a transitional form, there is intent to deceive. Let's face it: many of the bigwigs know perfectly well that there is lots of lying going on on their side.\n Don't get me wrong: I unquestioningly accept that some people are just too dumb to know that the claptrap of standard creationism is just that: claptrap. People like Kent Hovind claim to have a real science Ph.D when they have nothing of the sort. I'm going to sit in on a lecture on Tuesday by a guy who claims he's a Nobel Prize nominee, even though the names of nominees aren't made public. This is blatant lying specifically designed to dupe people into believing that these hacks are more qualified than they really are.\n And you can look at this forum for more examples. Time and time and time again, I've provided marc with irrefutable information that counters his arguments. Yet (in the past, mind you; I recognize that marc has cleaned up his sloppiness to a major extent) he has many times presented the very same refuted arguments as if he had no idea. Either this is lying, or it is willful ignorance. I see this all the time with creationists, even in person. My freethinker group crushed a local creationist at a seminar because he presented the same arguments we crushed last time. One can't present probability figures based on randomness if one acknowledges that a process is not random, yet this guy kept doing it. When I called him on it, he got defensive, insisted that he knew about non-randomness, and proceeded with the argument without addressing my point.

If somebody is nuts enough to believe stuff not only without evidence but also in spite of the evidence, then that's their right. But such people can't be spouting off \"reasons\" for their beliefs if they really believe that they have no reasoning to support their beliefs. As soon as somebody makes an argument for believing as they do, they open the door to getting their reasoning countered. If someone says, \"I believe that the moon is made of cheese,\" I'm bothered by that person's disconnect from reality. If someone says, \"I believe that the moon is made of cheese, and you should believe that, too,\" I get to ask why. If someone says, \"I believe that the moon is made of cheese, and you should too because our NASA missions actually brought back samples that were mistaken for gouda,\" then I get to beat that person's XXX with the Truth Stick of No Mercy\u0099.\n \n \nThey'll come around eventually, or die off, whichever comes first.\n\n The fact that evolution has been accepted by the scientific community -- and for good reason -- for decades and decades, and creationism isn't really dying off, coupled with my knowledge of many of these people, convinces me that you're wrong.\n \n \nI've know religious scientists who very much believe they've been denied opportunities and memberships due to be openly religious.

I find it interesting that you seem to be taking an approach that will ASSUME endorsement by default, rather than assuming it's personal, by default. I think your view of this is, frankly, unrealistic. Teachers often are more involved with their students (at least some of them) than just a distant and sterile form of teaching that would actually make such effort to avoid the appearance of 'endorsement' by the school. If a teacher is really engaged with his students, he's going to influence them in many ways--that's just reality. It may be some sort of ideal that students are only going to get the raw academic information rather than actually be influenced by the teacher, but students are often looking for role-models. And it's considered a valid model of teaching in many parts of the world (as in, places like Oxford university) to embrace that model rather than try to avoid it. A professor or teacher's views, even their religious ones, are likely to rub off on the students sooner or later. A school that has any sense whatsoever is going to know this and accept it as reality, rather than expecting it's teachers to keep some wall up at all times when it comes to religion. People have to be able to be human. And religion is very much a part of human experience that shouldn't have to be checked at the door of the classroom or cafeteria. He or she just shouldn't have to qualify everything that might be religious in nature by a \"now-this-is-my-personal-belief-ONLY.\" Now, I'll agree with you that, if a teacher is teaching science, he or she needs to limit the teaching content itself to science. And if that's the extent of what you're saying, then fine. But it's very difficult to draw that line all the time, particularly in universities like Oxford where the professors are pretty involved with the students outside the classroom and teaching dialog goes on continuously. American schools tend to put a 'wall' up between the teachers and students. But elsewhere, they don't do that. And guess what: it's OUR education system that tends to be inferior. That's no coincidence IMO. And even in school settings where that 'wall' is there, it still happens more than one might think just on the basis that students are often looking to teachers as role models and observe their every move.

   "My concern comes from having seen it taken too far to the point where people don't even seem to want religion even mentioned in an on-campus setting by a faculty member or teacher.\n\n I don't think that it's that big a deal... except in science classes where the uber-religious are already defensive.\n \n \nI find it interesting that you seem to be taking an approach that will ASSUME endorsement by default, rather than assuming it's personal, by default.\n\n Not true. I \"assume\" that not making it clear that my personal belief is my personal belief is liable to get me in trouble, but that's not much of an assumption. The wildcard is how the students interpret any of my statements, so my philosophy is not to make any.\n \n \nTeachers often are more involved with their students (at least some of them) than just a distant and sterile form of teaching that would actually make such effort to avoid the appearance of 'endorsement' by the school.\n\n I engage my students on a personal level in topics other than religion. I've had only one student ask a question of a religious nature, and the question itself (\"What church do you go to?\") is by default a personal (non-endorsement) question.\n \n \nIf a teacher is really engaged with his students, he's going to influence them in many ways--that's just reality.\n\n I agree, but if I chose to \"influence\" my students with my religious beliefs (or lack thereof), parents would be calling for my head. The most I could see myself doing is sponsoring a freethinker group, but even then I think (a) there's no \"clientele\" (b) someone will want me fired... or dead.\n \n \nIt may be some sort of ideal that students are only going to get the raw academic information rather than actually be influenced by the teacher, but students are often looking for role-models. And it's considered a valid model of teaching in many parts of the world (as in, places like Oxford university) to embrace that model rather than try to avoid it. A professor or teacher's views, even their religious ones, are likely to rub off on the students sooner or later.\n\n And here I'll take a page from your book: If I'm going to influence my kids, it's going to be on something more important that religion, like work ethic, appreciation for science, or -- god forbid -- an understanding of the universe.\n \n \nA school that has any sense whatsoever is going to know this and accept it as reality, rather than expecting it's teachers to keep some wall up at all times when it comes to religion. People have to be able to be human. And religion is very much a part of human experience that shouldn't have to be checked at the door of the classroom or cafeteria. He or she just shouldn't have to qualify everything that might be religious in nature by a \"now-this-is-my-personal-belief-ONLY.\"\n\n I trust that the school district trusts me. Hellbent nutjob parents might not.\n \n \nNow, I'll agree with you that, if a teacher is teaching science, he or she needs to limit the teaching content itself to science.\n\n My point is that this is true especially in science because of its touchy nature with anti-science religio-bots. Frankly, I don't really see any difference in principle with other subjects. We don't inject religious diatribe into the derivation of the quadratic formula. The word big isn't an adjective \"because God said so.\" The content should be devoid of religion (except for history/philosophy classes where religion(s) is obviously topical).\n \n \nBut it's very difficult to draw that line all the time, particularly in universities like Oxford where the professors are pretty involved with the students outside the classroom and teaching dialog goes on continuously.\n\n I think it's a hell of a lot easier to distance oneself from presumed endorsement if the discussion doesn't even happen in the classroom setting. If I go to the coffee shop to help my kids prepare for a test, it's on my own time, and the kids know that. Any comments there probably would be fine... (not that I'd make them without a second thought.)\n \n \nAmerican schools tend to put a 'wall' up between the teachers and students.\n\n Partially because of all the impropriety and alleged impropriety which seems to be on the rise.\n Speaking of which, I should take this opportunity to point out that I am extremely cautious about these sorts of things. A teacher friend of mine thinks I'm \"too\" cautious. But I have no desire to lose my job because someone didn't like a religious comment or because some prom/drama queen thought that I leered at her. (What happens is that when I break the uptight kick and cut loose with a joke, the kids really like it.)\n \n \nAnd guess what: it's OUR education system that tends to be inferior. That's no coincidence IMO.\n\n Correlation does not show causation. Our education system sucks because we keep mucking with it. We can't teach kids what they should know because we're too busy trying to teach kids how to pass dumbass tests.\n \n \nIt's just asking too much for a teacher to have to take a no-religious influence policy. Again, they have to be allowed to be human.\n\n Maybe it's because I'm not very religious, otherwise it's because I'm not human, but I don't think that's asking too much at all. A teacher shouldn't be volunteering that information when it's not on topic.",

   "I never said such. But allow one thing to breach the wall between science and religion and there's no point. \n\n \n Is the wall between science and religion of the same height as the wall between science and atheism? \n \n \n \nI know this, and you know this, but let's call a spade a spade. When Ben Stein and his producer purport to be making a documentary so different than their actual intent that they have to lie about what it is, it's lying. There is intent to deceive. When the writers of Of Pandas and People claim that the book has no basis in traditional creationism even though a draft has \"cdesign proponentsists\" as a transitional form, there is intent to deceive. Let's face it: many of the bigwigs know perfectly well that there is lots of lying going on on their side. \n\n \n You said this above;\n \n \nI shouldn't argue that science disproves the existence of God, \n\n \n and I'm sure you'll say that you don't do that, but you constantly argue that science disproves the book of Genesis, or other parts of the Bible, or just about anything it wants of Christian claims. When I bring up the title of Stengers book \"HOW SCIENCE SHOWS THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST\" you never take much exception to it. Claims of what science can and cannot show vary all over the place. Do evolutionist bigwigs know perfectly well that there is lots of lying going on on their side as well? \n \n \n \nAnd you can look at this forum for more examples. Time and time and time again, I've provided marc with irrefutable information that counters his arguments. \n\n \n It probably won't be possible for you to have much of a discussion here with anyone without kicking my name around, will it? \n \n \nYet (in the past, mind you; I recognize that marc has cleaned up his sloppiness to a major extent) he has many times presented the very same refuted arguments as if he had no idea. Either this is lying, or it is willful ignorance. \n\n \n Was your biggest refutation when you called me a chickenlover? Or was it when you told me to go #### myself? What you should work on, is making a distinction between a factual refutation, and a worldview difference. You have presented the latter a LOT more times than you have presented the former. If you don't recognize that, it is either lying, or willful ignorance.\n \n \n \n I see this all the time with creationists, even in person. My freethinker group crushed a local creationist at a seminar because he presented the same arguments we crushed last time. \n\n \n So it was a group, against one? How many were in the group? Have you ever, as a lone freethinker, faced a \"group\" of creationists? Do you know the difference between \"crushing\" and \"bullying\"?\n \n \n \n \n \nOne can't present probability figures based on randomness if one acknowledges that a process is not random, yet this guy kept doing it. When I called him on it, he got defensive, insisted that he knew about non-randomness, and proceeded with the argument without addressing my point. Being willfully ignorant of a point while claiming to address all of our scientific knowledge is lying. \n\n \n Was he being hammered on by 5 others at the same time? Were you calling him a chickenlover?",

Not from movie pre-screenings where he wasn't invited, mind you, but from their jobs. Too bad the film doesn't show (and I wish it had), his promotion of advice to attack teachers and professors who dare question Darwin's theory. The whole point of Myers is that he is a take-no-prisoners, crusading atheist scientist who has made it his purpose in life to harass people who disagree with him.

Theories of natural selection, it's claimed, were a necessary if not sufficient condition for Hitler's killing machine to get started. The truth, of course, is that the only necessary and sufficient condition for human beings to murder one another is the simple fact of being human. We've always been a lustily fratricidal species, one that needed no Charles Darwin to goad us into millenniums of self-slaughter.\nThat's content-related review, marc, and yes, it's ripping Stein and the movie a new one for making absolutely asinine correlations.\n \n \nIs it tautology when you keep posting the same links over and over?\n\n Nope.

Quit pretending you're well-read when it's clear that you don't even read the links.\n \n \nIn the list that I already posted.\n\n And no response from you.\n \n \nHave you seen the movie? If not, how do you know it's lies?\n\n I'm referring to the fact that the DI's cronies accused Dawkins of crashing the viewing. He was signed up with his real name, and they waved him right in.\n We've also dispatched with the claim that PZ tried to break in, or that Mathis had any honorable reason for expelling him.\n \n \nIf not, are you planning on seeing it?\n\n Not if it means putting money in these nutjobs' pockets. Besides, Dawkins gives a pretty complete review.\n \n \nIn this thread, Collin gave no details about the actual movie.\n\n How about you send him a PM and ask him to post his review?\n \n \nYes, \"Greg\" at pharyngula seems to be in a panic just like you.\n\n Who's panicking? Dozens of sources are ripping this POS to shreds. Mathis has been caught lying about lying. These guys are your heroes, and they're being exposed as complete hacks. Why would I be panicking?\n \n \nYes, more babbling from PZ Myers, so proud that he was thrown out. It was explained in my third link\n\n More like astonished. The behavior of the producers is literally too pathetic to be fabricated. He lays it all out; do you deny his version of the story? I'll send the PM to collin myself, if you'd like...\n \n \nYes, personal attacks against Stein and Mathis, nothing more.\n\n An expose' on Mathis's unfairness, hypocrisy, and dishonesty qualifies as a personal attack? No, it's an attack on his credibility, which is nil.\n \n \nOh look, if you'd bothered to read the first sentence in my third link, you would have seen this [that the movie was being selectively screened];\n\n Another lie. It was not being selectively screened. They begged the public to sign up via website. PZ was sent a confirmation that he could attend. Ask Collin to include this information when you PM him. Go ahead.\n \n \n\"Many films\", even the atheist ones. Your double standards haven't changed I see.\n\n Regardless of whether there are any \"atheist films\" that were selectively screened (which you conveniently failed to post any information about), your source is still lying.

Mathis lied and said that PZ wasn't invited.\n There is no double standard here. I'm not attacking the right of filmmakers to selectively screen their movies. I'm attacking the lie that PZ and Dawkins crashed the viewing with no invitations.\n \n \nThat was already posted by trebor in post #57.

You obviously don't know what a tautology is. Quit pretending you're well-read when it's clear that you don't even read the links.\n\n \n I (sometimes quickly) glance over the atheists links - just because I'm too amused to respond to them doesn't mean I don't read them or know of their existence. I don't think you post them over and over to get me to read them, I think you do it to make it look like there are more than there really are, knowing that most readers of this thread won't check to see all the repetition. \n \n \nAnd no response from you. \n\n \n See above. I may have more to say about them once I actually see the movie. \n \n \nI'm referring to the fact that the DI's cronies accused Dawkins of crashing the viewing. He was signed up with his real name, and they waved him right in.\n We've also dispatched with the claim that PZ tried to break in, or that Mathis had any honorable reason for expelling him. \n\n \n I'm much more interested in the content of the movie than I am about these little political squabbles about the screening. I can understand if not everyone in charge of the screening was on the exact same page concerning who should see it. They may not have wanted Dawkins to see it too soon - they may have missed him because they didn't recognize his little trick of signing up as \"Clinton Dawkins\", but then probably figured he wasn't the political threat that Myers was. Someone could have changed their mind about Myers at the last minute, maybe new information was obtained about his connections to some big atheist money-bag like George Soros or something. Again, I'm more interested in the content of the movie. The one thing I want to take note of more than anything is to compare the movies promotion of ID, vs the way it calls attention to how atheism is so heavily included in science/evolution teaching. Not everyone who opposes the influx of atheism into science is in agreement that ID is the answer to the problem. I don't take a firm position on it - I'd like to learn more about it. \n \n \nNot if it means putting money in these nutjobs' pockets. Besides, Dawkins gives a pretty complete review. \n\n \n How do you know how complete it is, if you haven't seen what he's reviewing? \n \n \n \nHow about you send him a PM and ask him to post his review? \n\n \n Why should I do that? It seems like if he went to the trouble to see it, posted in this thread about it, he wouldn't have to be begged to post something about its content, rather than focusing solely on political squabbles concerning its screening. He's not going to do it anyway as we now see, he's going to hide behind Dawkins, just like you. \n \n \nWho's panicking? Dozens of sources are ripping this POS to shreds. Mathis has been caught lying about lying. These guys are your heroes, and they're being exposed as complete hacks. Why would I be panicking? \n\n \n Maybe dozens of sources are afraid of what this film might expose. You seem to have spent several minutes at least tracking down these links, and posting them. Doubtful you'll ever find me doing that in response to an atheist inspired film. \n \n \nMore like astonished. The behavior of the producers is literally too pathetic to be fabricated. He lays it all out; do you deny his version of the story? I'll send the PM to collin myself, if you'd like...\n\n \n More like proud. From the opening link of this thread, that you later repeated;\n \n \nI'm blogging this from the Apple store in the Mall of America, because I'm too amused to want to wait until I get back to my hotel room.\n\n and\n \nI'm still laughing though. You don't know how hilarious this is. Not only is it the extreme hypocrisy of being expelled from their Expelled movie, but there's another layer of amusement. Deep, belly laugh funny. Yeah, I'd be rolling around on the floor right now, if I weren't so dang dignified. \n\n \n Oh how dignified he must be. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nAn expose' on Mathis's unfairness, hypocrisy, and dishonesty qualifies as a personal attack? No, it's an attack on his credibility, which is nil. \n\n \n I'm more interested in the content of the movie. I hear William Dembski was in it. I'd like to know what he said, and how it blended with whatever references were made to current Darwinist teaching. \n \n \nAnother lie. It was not being selectively screened. They begged the public to sign up via website. PZ was sent a confirmation that he could attend. Ask Collin to include this information when you PM him. Go ahead. \n\n \n I'd rather see Collin's comments about what Dembski said. Should I hold my breath? \n \n \n \nRegardless of whether there are any \"atheist films\" that were selectively screened (which you conveniently failed to post any information about), your source is still lying. Invitations were open to whoever signed up and got approval. PZ and Dawkins got approval. Mathis lied and said that he kicked PZ out for causing a ruckus or for potentially causing a ruckus. Mathis lied and said that PZ wasn't invited.\n There is no double standard here. I'm not attacking the right of filmmakers to selectively screen their movies. I'm attacking the lie that PZ and Dawkins crashed the viewing with no invitations. \n\n \n As I said above, there very well may have been some mistakes and mis-communications concerning the screening process, or late, new information about the political harm Myers could attempt to do. We'll find out if this little screening squabble is still big stuff with atheists a few weeks after the movie has been released to the public. \n \n \n \nNo panic here, marc. I just missed it. Check it again on April 16.\n\n \n April 16th? emoticon_confused",

It is precisely because such a comparison or reference may sometimes be appropriate, Godwin has argued[4] that overuse of Nazi and Hitler comparisons should be avoided, because it robs the valid comparisons of their impact. Although in one of its early forms Godwin's Law referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions,[5] the law is now applied to any threaded online discussion: electronic mailing lists, message boards, chat rooms, and more recently blog comment threads and wiki talk pages.",

We clearly see that Dawkins, and many others give it what it begs for. When the subject of ID comes up in the courts, it's discarded mainly because it has the potential to beg for religious extrapolation. It's thrown out because it has that potential (separation of church and state) even though evolution is proven to actually do it, that is, combine atheism and state. \n \n \nBecause some people use terms incorrectly doesn't mean that the terms have multiple accurate meanings.

   "I could have known it from the links I posted in #58, or the advertisments and promotions I've been hearing.\n\n Try again. Those links don't mention Nazism or eugenics. The only sites that have been posted that discuss those topics are the ones ripping on the argumentum ad Hitlerum.\n \n \nJust because eugenics precedes Darwinism doesn&#8217;t mean Darwinism couldn&#8217;t further support it. Logic?\n\n Ah, so Darwinism isn't a necessary condition for eugenics, even though the movie says it is. Thanks for admitting this. Thank you for also failing to support the argument that Darwinism has anything to do with eugenics.\n \n \nBecause evolution lovers don&#8217;t like to see it associated with past societal problems. They want to live in/establish a society with evolution as its base. A society with church and state separated. Logic?\n\n Even if it were true that Darwinism supported eugenics, how is this evidence that Darwinism is false? (This is like saying that because we despise Nazism, the Holocaust must not have happened.) How is arguing that Darwinism supports eugenics supporting the idea that Darwinists censor dissent? Answer: there is no reason. It's a propaganda piece. \n \n \nNo, because of the inferior way he may have thought they &#8220;evolved&#8221;.\n\n You're not familiar with your history, are you? Can you show where Hitler made this argument anywhere? No, you can't: YOU'RE MAKING SH*T UP AGAIN.\n \n \nWhen the truth comes out, the name calling really gets going, doesn&#8217;t it?\n\n The truth that I mistakenly duplicated a link? You know, you might have a position to complain if I posted the link both times, but I didn't. Your overactive persecution complex may need some psychiatric attention, marc. I stand by my big baby comment because all you're doing is whining like a baby.\n \n \nIt&#8217;s better than attempting to debate the details of a movie with no intention of actually watching it. How can you back up what you say with no first hand information? NOTHING but second hand information from your prophet Dawkins?\n\n First, no, it's actually not. I have plenty of evidence for the claims I'm presenting: numerous reviews mention these things. I'm not making them up, or buying into a single review in favor of several others that don't say the same thing. Second, it's not nothing but secondhand information from a single source: numerous reviews mention these things.\n \n \nWithout first hand information on it. Do you rip lots of things with little information on them?\n\n I have plenty of information, and it's corroborated information. Why do you think we're not allowed to form opinions about things unless we have firsthand information? Were you around when the earth was formed? No? Therefore, by your logic, you can't come to any conclusions? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nI'm not nearly as concerned with filmmakers who are dishonest hacks as I am with scientists who are dishonest hacks. It can call into question the reliability of science if some Darwinist scientists are discriminating and helping get fired other scientists who don't share their atheist religion, who ask questions about Darwinism that they find uncomfortable.\n\n Kenneth Miller rips on these ID hacks. Does that make him an atheist? C'mon, say it again, marc. Call Miller an atheist. Please attack his science as unscientific and explain how it is unscientific. For that matter, pick anybody's scientific article and show how it's atheistic, positively rejecting the existence of all deities. Go ahead. I dare you.\n You can't. It's your persecution complex. Maybe I should stop bringing it up, because it's just not nice to make fun of psychiatric problems. Is this a touchy subject that I should avoid, marc? Or is it not really a mental oddity, and I can continue ripping on you for accusing 99.9% of the scientific community of being frauds without any evidence?\n \n \nUh, it didn't come from me. emoticon_idea I condensed and put into my words what was contained in one of my links from post #58.\n\n So you're allowed to repeat as truth idiotic assertions and then pass them off as somebody else's? No, marc. We're not XXXXXX. You said that the producers may have expelled Myers because he was a potential political issue but that RICHARD DAWKINS HIMSELF would have less of a political effect. I'm sorry, there's just no way to soften this: that's just plain dumb. Even YOU know it's dumb, because before this, you rarely even mentioned Myers, but you always railed against Dawkins as the head of some sort of evil atheist political push.\n But, you know, use that as your defense all you want. Insist that you wouldn't make such an incredibly stupid claim, but that you believe that these groundbreaking hero filmmakers of yours would much such an incredibly stupid claim. Either way, you and your position don't look too good, do they? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nI know, he&#8217;s a bestselling author and is well respected, in spite of the fact that he misapplies science to the degree that he believes it proves that God does not exist.\n\n You're either lying about what he says or lying about what you know about what he says. He says nothing of the sort. In fact, he has repeatedly explained that science strictly cannot disprove the existence of a deity.\n \n \nIf only you could show that ID attempts to prove the existance of a specific God to the same degree. Too bad you can't.\n\n It doesn't attempt to prove the existence of a specific God. Way to make sh*t up again, marc. ID's followers usually think that ID proves a specific God. But I can show that ID isn't science, and I can show that ID even as pseudoscience fails miserably.\n \n \nWow, that one soared WAY over your head. I was talking about creationists who question if ID is the answer to the problem. (oppose the influx- I thought you'd get it)\n\n It didn't soar over my head; I called you on your conspiracy theory nutjobbery. Miller does oppose the influx. It is inexcusable for you to suggest otherwise. But integrity was never your strong point, was it?\n \n \nYou could read the following link, though I'm guessing you probably won't. You should love the title though; The failure of intelligent design\n\"The problem with evolution is not that it is unscientific but that it is routinely taught in textbooks and in the classroom in an atheist way. Textbooks frequently go beyond the scientific evidence to make metaphysical claims about how evolution renders the idea of a Creator superfluous.\"Poppycock. Maybe some reading books try to make this case, but I have never seen a textbook for schools that does this. NEVER.\n \n \nI&#8217;ll bet Collin wishes he would have said that!! He musta forgot! How do you know what he signed? Were you there, looking over his shoulder? The intimacy and support between gang posters just reached new heights!\n\n HOLY PERSECUTION COMPLEX, BATMAN!\n You truly are pathetic, marc. Several of the links made it clear that the producers required the audience to sign confidentiality agreements. You're so persecuted that you now think I'm \"intimately\" aware of what Collin does. What a troll.\n \n \nHe did? He addressed what Dembski said, and how it blended with Darwinist teaching? Which post?\n\n #76. Can't you read?\n \n \nWho knows, maybe it will be short of a lie or two since Myers didn't make it into the screening.\n\n Does this mean that the site won't be able to cram all of the filmmaker's lies onto their site, or are you accusing the site's authors of lying? If the latter, please provide evidence of this assertion.\n \n \nSo in writing books called &#8220;The God Delusion&#8221; and heartily endorsing the one with &#8220;HOW SCIENCE SHOWS THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST&#8221; on it&#8217;s cover, we can say that Dawkins MISAPPLIES much of what he knows about science, and puts it forward as a philosophy.\n\n We've already discussed Stenger's book and how it explicitly claims not to disprove all gods, just the conceptualizations of god that would produce testable effects. That you refuse to understand the plain words used to illustrate this doesn't change this fact.\n I recommend you take up Peeling's newest challenge about the planet Zod.\n \n \nRemember what Kenneth Miller said? &#8220;Evolution almost begs for extrapolation&#8221;.\n\n Right, because the basic concept makes so much sense even just on its face: those organisms that are best capable of producing organisms that can reproduce will become prominent.\n \n \nWe clearly see that Dawkins, and many others give it what it begs for.\n\n If you actually paid attention to what Dawkins says instead of pretending that you know what he says, you'd know that Dawkins actually argues against misapplications of Darwinian ideas like eugenics and social Darwinism. So, once again, you're fabricating a position so that you can argue against it.\n \n \nWhen the subject of ID comes up in the courts, it&#8217;s discarded mainly because it has the potential to beg for religious extrapolation.\n\n No it's not; it's discarded because it is religiously motivated. It therefore fails the Lemon test and is unconstitutional.\n Even if the courts didn't strike it down as unconstitutional, the vast majority of scientist would argue against teaching it in science classes because it's not science. Even if science teachers refused to teach it because it's not science, I'd argue that the specific arguments behind the ID movement aren't even worthy of discussion in a course like comparative religion.\n \n \nIt&#8217;s thrown out because it has that potential (separation of church and state) even though evolution is proven to actually do it, that is, combine atheism and state.\n\n Lie. Evolution does no such thing, troll.\n \n \nDoes DAWKINS use terms incorrectly, in his book &#8220;The God Delusion&#8221;?\n\n Which term does Dawkins use incorrectly?\n \n \nWhy is he a best selling author and well respected, if he misapplies science to his personal worldview, and forwards it as science?\n\n He doesn't, which you'd know if you actually read anything for yourself instead of swallowing the rightwing nutjob tripe whole. Why must you continue to troll by asking presumptuous and fallacious questions?\n \n \nWhy are some ID promoters not permitted to do the same thing in public education?\n\n Permitted to do what? Misapply pseudoscience? Why do you think?\n \n \nName calling, and thinly veiled four letter words are violations of the terms of service also. Which one of us do you think violates the terms of service more often? If you think I do, please report me.\n\n You do nothing but troll around, fabricating positions to argue against and pretending that you know things that actually aren't true. The TOS also say that posts should be informative, not disinformative. You're in no position to complain, although I'll be happy to defend my actions should admin come calling.",
