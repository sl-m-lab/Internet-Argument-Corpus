   "Indeed, Americans are playing with edged tools. I'm astonished at their skill to poke into everything in place but more often out of place. How can they be so sure of themselves thinking everyone esteems their opinion as a revelation given by God?\n http://www.dubaimelt.com/images/melt_asd.jpg \n That's here where I read a document whereof one can see the UNAMA (the United Nations Assistance Mission of Afghanistan) declining the suggestion of the U.S. to arrest Afghan opposition leaders Akhmadzay, Geylani and Pedram. Why, indeed? I think we all know the US has already made a lot of blunders in Central Asia and Condoleezza Rice proved her absolute inadequacy in questions of Oriental Policy. Even those completely ignorant in these matters must know that detention of Afghan opposition leaders will but lead to rise of anti-governmental and anti-U.S. movements and will for sure provoke conflict escalation in the region.",

I guess the point is that Afghanistan has been savaged to the point where the only thing holding it together is its income from dealing opium.",
