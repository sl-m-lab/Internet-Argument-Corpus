   "Maybe in your town dogs don't get rabies shots, but I've never been anywhere or met a dog that DIDN'T have rabies shots (in my life).\n \n\n \n WOW, what a humanitarian, to have personally taken every dog you have ever seen personally to get a rabies shot, becuase frankly, that is the only way you could possibly know one way or the other, unless you have had a VERY sheltered life and have never left your house, which would go a long ways towards explaining the intelligence level displayed in many of your posts.\n \n \nBut if they are pets they are vaccinated.\n\n \n Maybe. Of course, since the rabies vaccine is not 100% effective (more like 73%), even if you are correct (which is incredibly unlikely), that still leaves a fairly large percentage possibly carrying rabies.\n \n \nAre you going to tell me that these bougalee Sheriffs are checking to see if the dogs have tags or not?\n\n \n No, nor should they. Even if only 15% of the dogs is carrying rabies, or some other infectios disease (dogs also carry everythign from cholera to bubonic plague), they should not take the risk. It can be assumed that these dogs have been drinking flood water, which in the city the size of new orleans is akin to eating random bacterial cultures all day. They are better off shooting the dogs then disposing of the bodies as hazardous waste. the last time there was major flooding along the missouri, there was a lot of outrage because they were putting down dogs that were in the flooded areas, even when they were apparently healthy. That is because animals in the area that drank the floodwater were essentially disease incubators. One dog ended up having some 17 different types of disease. That is why why a flood occurs and they sandbag, the sand is treated as a hazardous waste afterwards.\n \n This is what the XXXXXX who are trying to rescue these animals do not understand. There is a reason that people who are working in the flooded areas have to be vaccinated for EVERYTHING. Sure, it is nice to pick old rover out of the floodwater and take him home to the family, until your entire family is wiped out by the black plague (another thing they found after the missouri flooded....apparently the black plague does NOT just show up in prairie dog towns).\n \n \nThey aren't even attempting to use humane rescue methods.\n They aren't attempting to rescue them at all.\n\n \n Why would they? They still have people to rescue, and the country is full of animals in shelters anyway. Why risk getting bitten or spreading a contagion to save a stray, when bullets are so cheap?\n \n \n \nI've been chased by a skunk on more than one occasion.\n They don't just run, they chase you and try to spray you.\n\n \n Hey, city boy, a skunk who is chasing you is not trying to spray you. that is just stupid. Unless they are running backwards, it is not even possible. They spray out the tail end and chase head first.\n \n \nI can't imagine a dog wanting to fight a skunk once they've been sprayed.\n They usually run away and their sense of smell takes a while to recover.\n And I can't imagine a skunk wanting to fight after it has sprayed.\n \n I've never heard of a dog getting into a fight with a wild skunk.\n I've only seen the aftermath of a dog being sprayed by one.\n\n \n More evidence of the \"stayed at home your entire life\" hypothesis. I have yet to see a bird seasaon go by when somebodies dog does not tangle with a skunk. My own dogs drag a dead one into the yard about once a month. The thing about a skunk spraying is that it is not entirely voluntary, and they only have one shot. If you startle a skunk, it will spray involuntarily. If you happen to be on the front end when it happens, thats it, the skunk has lost its best defense for the encounter. Additionally, it takes several seconds for the spray to be effective. A starving dog will have already attacked the skunk before it even realizes that it has been sprayed.\n \n \n \nIt doesn't mean that shooting dogs is the way to do this, or that it's at all right.\n\n \n No, it isn't. Poison woudl be much more effective, just more gruesome.\n \n \nAgain the chances of ANY of these dogs having rabies is essentially zero.\n\n \n And again, you have already proven you know NOTHING about the subject. We will add it to the incredibly long list.\n \n I generally ignore your posts, as I consider you to be something of a spamming troll whose posts are generally heavy on brainless posturing but light on thought provoking, original ideas. When you directly respond to one of my posts, especially with ignorant drivel like this, though, it makes it hard to ignore you. Why don't you go debate another of the spamming trolls and we can continue our (albeit one sided) truce?",

Besides, all I said was that I've been chased by skunks, not sprayed (which they do by flipping their XXX over their head while doing \n\n \n What XXXXX told you that, and why did you believe something so foolish?\n \n They bend themselves into a U shape to spray. I have skinned hundreds of skunks. There is no possible way they can spray without their butt facing forward, and by the time they got it that far forward going XXX over head, they would be upside down.\n \n http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/tmot1/spilputo.htm\n \n \nTheir enemies, other than man, include dogs, coyotes, foxes, cats, bobcats, and owls. Their defensive behavior consists of a rapid series of handstands, which serve as a warning device to aggressors. If approached too closely, they drop to all fours in a horseshoe-shaped stance, lift their tail, and direct their anus and head toward the potential aggressor. The foul-smelling musk can be accurately discharged for a distance of 4-5 m.\n\n \n \n Wow, what do you know, they bend themselves in to a \"horseshoe shaped stance\". Since I am nw firmly convinced you have lived your life in seclusion, I will explain....A horse shoe is U shaped. No animal can wrun bent in a U shape. threfore, if the skunk was chasing you, it was not trying to spray you. Its butt was facing in the wrong direction.\n \n \n \n \nI guess it's not much of a defense then, eh?\n Or you don't know what you're talking about.\n\n \n No, its really not. What makes it even more ineffective is the fact that skunks will often charge a threat if they do not feel they can retreat. This is a deadly mistake for many predators who are unfamiloiar with skunks (like domestic dogs) since during the charge the dog gets a pretty good grab at the skunk (since its butt is facing the wrong way to spray anyway). \n \n You can read more about skunks here:\n \n http://www.saskgamewarden.com/field-spring2004.shtml\n \n \nStartling any skunk will increase the stress felt by the skunk and may cause them to skip over a few of the normal responses. If they are extremely startled they may spray but the majority of times in these situations the spray will be more consistent with a mist rather than a stream.\n\n \n I wasn't going to bring this up, but since now you have forced me to reference 2 articles to highlight your lack of knowledge, and anybody who reads them is going to catch on to it anyway, I will. You stated that you ran from the skunks. That was just about the stupidest thing you could do, and displays your absolute lack of knowledge of the creatures. Walking away slowly is the safest bet, and there is a better than average chance that the skunk will just stand and watch you go. They are not generally agressive by nature.\n \n \nWhy would you even have a problem with that?\n\n \n I wouldn't. It would be much more effective. Sorry, but a happy continuation of life is just not in the cards for these animals. they are all pretty likely to die of disease, and killing them without giving them the chance to spread that disease is just the common sense thing to do. I personally woudl advocate skinning them after they die, then selling the hides to the chinese. They wear dog fur. That would likely pay for the poisoned meat, as well as provide some income for the people charged with carrying out the poisining and skinning, and important consideration in a situation where over 200,000 jobs have been lost.\n \n \n \nThen why did you bother here?\n\n \n Because I was trying to have an intelligent debate with somebody who did have some idea of what they were talking about, then you interjected this ignorant drivel into the middle of it. I thought maybe a sound refutation would send you back to the troll lounge. Instead, you came back and compounded your idiocy. Why didin't you type \"skunk defensive behavior\" into google, look at a couple of pages, realise that you sounded like an idiot, then let it go? Why can't some people learn that? Instead, you don't bother to even check, you just come charging back making the same ignorant claims. You obviosly have an intenet connection, and some rudimentary command of the english language. Why not google and save the embaressment? It boggles the mind.\n \n \nWait, I started this thread and YOU responded to it.\n \n\n \n Yes, becuase there seemed to be some degree of intelligence building. Then you had to come in and ruin it.\n \n \nDon't respond to threads I start and it will be easy for you, dog killer.\n \n\n \n I usually don't, they are generally too ignorant for comment. After a while sometimes they come up to speed and an intelligent conversation begins to emerge.\n \n OOOOHHHHH...dog killer. You are more right than you know. I ahve shot dozens, if not hundreds, of dogs in the last 5 years due to the fact that there seem to be XXXXXX all over the place who believe, not unlike yourself, that domestic aniumals can be dumped to fend for themsleves, then just picked up again as pets. Unfortunatly, a domestic dog that has been left to fend for itseelf is FAR, FAR more dangerous than a wild dog. Wild dogs have an inherent fear of man, domestic dogs do not. I always shoot strays that wander on to my property.",
