   "South Dakota law enforcement and prosecutors are not above breaking the law.\n \n http://www.angeltowns.com/members/southdakota/illegal.html\n \n \n This obviously does not apply to South Dakota.\n \n The First Amendment protects anonymous speech both in our society at large and on the Internet specifically. As described in the Supreme Court's anonymous speech case, McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, 514 U.S. 334 (1995), the United States has a strong tradition of anonymous speech in both literary and political contexts. (3)For example, the Court notes that \"American names such as Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens) and O. Henry (William Sydney Porter) come readily to mind. Benjamin Franklin employed numerous different pseudonyms.\" 514 U.S. at 341, n. 4. Politically, \"[t]hat tradition is most famously embodied in the Federalist Papers, authored by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, but signed 'Publius.' Publius' opponents, the Anti-Federalists, also tended to publish under pseudonyms: prominent among them were 'Cato,' believed to be New York Governor George Clinton; 'Centinel,' probably Samuel Bryan or his father, Pennsylvania judge and legislator George Bryan,\" among others. And ultimately, \"[a] forerunner of all of these writers was the pre-Revolutionary War English pamphleteer, 'Junius,' whose true identity remains a mystery.\" 514 U.S. at 343, n. 6. emoticon_ic",
