   "I do feel that public education is failing. it seems that kids are not learning in schools near what they should. watch WinTuition on gameshow network, or even Jay Leno's Jay walk, most people that he asks are young, and they get stuff wrong that is to me common knowledge. \n \n I think the current education system needs to emphasize more on the actually quality of education, and how it is being taught. my favorite teachers were the ones that pushed me, that gave difficult assignments. I had a teacher that basically let the students do whatever they wanted, he wanted to be the \"cool\" teacher more than teachin us. \n \n I also feel that there is way too much emphasis on social aspects of school. they have so many social activitites that it is sickening, when i went to school, the principle would walk around during classes and talk to students in the halls. he never asked why they werent in class. i think sports in school is a good thing, and dances and that kind of XXXX, but it should never take presendence over the education. also i think teacher are afraid to teach, they are afraid that they might be sued for offend one of their students. not to long ago i was listening to Mike Reagan, and he said that this teacher got sued for using the word Negroid, the teacher was teaching history and simply said that this was a term that was used, as well as caucazoid for whites and another i cant remember for asians. \n \n I think that if teachers got paid more , that education would come up, they would care more. it is not fair that some actor or sports XXX makes millions upon millions of dollars a year for doing something like bouncing a ball or making people laugh, while the people that help to forge the future of america make barely enough to survive.",

   "Yes, I agree that American Public Schools are massive failure. LOL did you know that 11% of American children 18-24 cannot point out the United States on a map of the world? Compare these individuals to European children who are doing college physics in the 8th grade and starting to learn their third language in the 9th grade. Anyway, yes it is obvious to me that INTEGRATION and the social engineering of the federal government has been a colossal embarrassing failure. Here is the article.\n \n http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/11/1120_021120_GeoRoperSurvey.html\n \n \nIn a nation called the world's superpower, only 17 percent of young adults in the United States could find Afghanistan on a map, according to a new worldwide survey released today. \n \n The young U.S. citizens received poor marks generally in geography. But then, as results showed, their counterparts in other countries were hardly star students. \n \n The National Geographic-Roper 2002 Global Geographic Literacy Survey polled more than 3,000 18- to 24-year-olds in Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Sweden and the United States. \n \n \n John Fahey, President and CEO of the National Geographic Society, presented results of the The National Geographic-2002 Global Geographic Literacy Survey, which polled more than 3,000 18- to-24-year-olds in Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Sweden and the United States.\n \n Sweden scored highest; Mexico, lowest. The U.S. was next to last. \n \n \"The survey demonstrates the geographic illiteracy of the United States,\" said Robert Pastor, professor of International Relations at American University, in Washington, D.C. \"The results are particularly appalling in light of September 11, which traumatized America and revealed that our destiny is connected to the rest of the world.\" \n \n About 11 percent of young citizens of the U.S. couldn't even locate the U.S. on a map. The Pacific Ocean's location was a mystery to 29 percent; Japan, to 58 percent; France, to 65 percent; and the United Kingdom, to 69 percent. \n \n Are Young U.S. Citizens Americentric? \n \n Despite the threat of war in Iraq and the daily reports of suicide bombers in Israel, less than 15 percent of the young U.S. citizens could locate either country. \n \n More young U.S. citizens in the study knew that the island featured in last season's TV show \"Survivor\" is in the South Pacific than could find Israel. \n \n Particularly humiliating was that all countries were better able to identify the U.S. population than many young U.S. citizens. Within the U.S., almost one-third said that population was between one billion and two billion; the answer is 289 million. \n \n \"It gives the sense that there is this Americentric thing going on-that we are big and powerful and have all these people in our country,\" said John Fahey, President and CEO of the National Geographic Society. \n \n On the other hand, Pastor suggests that the results could mean that most young Americans just have no idea of the total world population (about six billion). \n \n Poor Geographic Literacy Worldwide \n \n Young adults worldwide are not markedly more literate about geography than the Americans. \n \n On average, fewer than 25 percent of young people worldwide could locate Israel on the map. Only about 20 percent could identify hotspots like Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq. \n \n Of all the young adults in the survey, only about one-third in Germany, Sweden and Japan, could name four countries that officially acknowledge having nuclear weapons. In the rest of the countries that number dropped to less than a quarter. In France 24 percent did not know that that their own country was a nuclear nation. \n \n The survey results are not all bleak, says Roger Downs, head of the geography department at Pennsylvania State University, in State College, and a National Geographic geographer-in-residence in 1995-1996. \n \n Geography Not Valued in Schools \n \n Since the last Geographic-sponsored survey in 1988, said Downs, the percentage of young U.S. citizens who reported taking a geography course in school rose from 30 to 55 percent. And students who had studied geography did better on the current survey. \n \n U.S. schools generally have slighted geography. \"If geography is not in the curriculum,\" Downs said, \"it's not tested-and that says to the students that it is not valued.\" \n \n The schools are not solely to blame, either. \"Wouldn't it be nice if parents also read atlases to their children?\" Downs says. \n \n Questions covering current events or practical activities yielded more promising results. \n \n Most young U.S. citizens knew that Africa was most affected by the AIDS epidemic, and about half knew that El Ni\u00f1o caused erratic weather. \n \n \"When geography and life intersect, people pay attention,\" said Nick Boyon, senior vice president for international research at RoperASW, in Manhattan. \n \n Boosting Geography \n \n Geographic knowledge increases through travel and language proficiency, among other factors. \n \n In the highest-scoring countries-Sweden, Germany and Italy-at least 70 percent of the young adults had traveled internationally in the last three years, and the majority spoke more than one language (in Sweden, 92 and 89 percent, respectively). \n \n In the U.S. and Mexico only about 20 percent had traveled abroad during the same period and the majority spoke only one language. \n \n To fight geographic ignorance, and apathy, among young people in the U.S. and around the world, the National Geographic Society will convene an international coalition of leaders in American business, education and media. \n \n Next year the panel will recommend initiatives to policymakers in those areas-and to parents and children.\n",

A wise man once said that those who create a problem can rarely solve it. I think that is very true in this case.

We also have had numerous Republican Congresses and our schools are in deplorable if not pitiful shape when compared to other countries. \n \n \nPublic school is failing because teachers are failing. \n\n \n I disagree here. Public schools are failing for many reasons, foremost among them. . . \n \n A. Contemporary American Culture\n B. The Students themselves\n C. What the students are learning in the schools\n D. Appeasement of special interest groups by both political parties.\n \n I will agree that today's teachers are of poorer quality, but I find that to a secondary causation.\n \n \nWe need more good teachers in our school systems. \n\n \n Yes, obviously we do. The absolute first thing we need to do is get the federal government of the United States out of the public school system.\n \n \nThe schools don't do a very good job of interviewing the teachers before they let them teach.

   "Actually looking at the situation it has little to do with teachers and everything to do with homelife. I know something about this topic (and I'm running for our school board next year).\n \n Schools are failing those children who are being failed at home.\n \n What does that mean exactly? Look at the situation. Why do we have 4.0 gpa honor students from ghetto schools attending Harvard? Why do we have 1.5 gpa students from rich white suburban school districts failing classes? Why do kids that attend private schools do better then public school kids statistically?\n \n Its the home. I'll use two kids as an example. One we'll call Darin (ME). Darin grew up in a middle-upper income house. His parents both worked and money while tight wasn't in short supply. Darin went to public schools in a middle income neighborhood. When he got home he had to study and do homework before anything else. Even though he was a \"latch-key\" kid and he came home to an empty house Darin made use of his time and managed his schoolwork. If there was something he didn't understand he'd wait til his folks got home and ask them. Darin went on to graduate from high school and entered the US Navy as a \"Nuc\" on submarines. After six years he was discharged and went to college. He earned above average grades and joined MENSA. Leaving college he started a home-based web services company while working nights at a Walmart as a stocker. His business grew and he eventually quit Walmart. He now has a nice house, 12 employees and a successful company with some very hi-profile customers. \n \n Now lets talk about Darins best friend Brian (MY FRIEND). Brian had two parents who while living together really didn't seem to have a clue. He lived in a nice house (same floorplan as Darins in fact) and his parents made about the same money as Darins. He went to the same schools and had the same teachers most of the time. Yet Brian never excelled. He scored higher then Darin on tests (he was very smart) but he just didn't work at anything. He fumbled through jr. high, started drugs and was arrested several times. Eventually he dropped out of high school and at this time he STILL lives with his parents and cleans office buildings at night part-time.\n \n OK, two kids, same IQ (or close), same schools, same teachers, same financial situation............ two very different outcomes.\n \n Darin did well because of his parents. They taught him the value of an education and ALWAYS made sure it was a priority. They accepted the responsibility for having a child and raised him with morals, a sense of duty and responsibility. Darin learned the value of hardwork from his father who earned his BS at age 44 and his mother who went back to school in her early 50's to become an RN. Darin carried this sense of responsibility into school each day.\n \n Brian on the other hand had two parents who were \"average\" at best. They really didn't watch out for Brian (or his brother and sister who are also as messed up as he is) and didn't press him to do anything. So absorbed in thier own lives they had some kids and then forgot about them. They never sat down and talked to them. They never helped them with homework. They never instilled that sense of \"I CAN\" into them.\n \n It would be easy to blame the schools for Brians failure but we really can't. Keep in mind we have situations like this in poor districts as well. Some kids, raised by a single mother, who end up going to Yale or Harvard; while other kids at the SAME SCHOOL end up in prison or dead.\n \n It's got nothing to do with schools and teachers and money. It has everything to do with PARENTING.\n \n Thank you.",

   "Fallingdown,\n \n To be honest I've looked at some of the \"new textbooks\" in schools these days and they are junk. Sure the covers are nice and they are in better shape but math is the same now as math is then. Same with science, were not talking nuclear physics here, basic biology and anatomy and our solar system are the same now as they were 30 years ago when I was in elementary school.\n \n No whats changed is parenting. More parents are getting divorced, more have two earner families, more struggle just to make it in this day and age. \n \n Its sad but schools only have the kids for seven hours a day. If kids aren't sent to school properly PREPARED to learn they won't learn. By prepared I'm not only talking about hungry (which is alot) but prepared with the skills and confidence to achieve. With the grading systems in place nowadays more schools depend on \"personal education plans\" for each student anyway. They are measured by their own overall progress during the school year. They start at point A and end at point B. They aren't really judged in class against overall performance other then for the standardized tests.\n \n Another major concern is the classes these kids are taking. Basic \"education\" has taken a back seat to political correctness. Political parties have tossed their hats into the school board races now more then ever before. I know this to be a fact for in preparation for my run next year for our school board I did some reading. While a good school board race used to require $2,000 or so to conduct it now can take over $10,000. Political parties donate money at this level too and I have seen school board candidates with political consultants. \n \n All these political \"agendas\" (which seem to revolve around two arguments - those being sex and religion with abortion, contraception, education, homosexuality and everything else wrapped in) have overrun the basic purpose of schools - provide an education.\n \n Another problem is the dramatic increase in diagnosed cases of ADHD and all the other \"ritilan\" illnesses. Back when I was a kid there were always \"a couple\" of kids who were trouble makers but not nearly the level of problem children we have now. Parents need to take a look at WHY they have kids with these disorders. Sure some kids DO have mental issues but many do not and are instead just medicated to manage their behaviors when their parents should be managing them instead.\n \n This ties in with the issue of \"special education\". When I was in 1st-3rd grade I attended Speech classes. Basically I couldn't pronounce the \"L\" sound properly. That was special education in those days. Now we have \"vegtable kids\" (as I call them) being mainstreamed into schools. We have kids who literally attack their teachers every day being offered a place at the public education table. These are kids who used to be in institutions or reform schools now being dumped in a public school with our kids.\n \n While I sympathize with parents who have disabled children we need to keep in mind the cost of this care. I read an article in the Arizona Republic a few months back about a girl with an IQ of 53 or so who was in school getting \"therapy\". She was retarded to put it bluntly. Yet the article talked about how her parents had to sue the district to the get the \"help she needed\". This included \"lip therapy\", leg therapy (she couldn't walk) and some other very unusual \"treatments\". She basically laid around and moaned and flailed her arms. Yet her parents basically dumped her on the school district.\n \n Those sound like health concerns to me (those therapy treatments) and I don't feel a school district should be responsible. Keep in mind this \"therapy\" is expensive and if they take money to provide for these kids from the pot that leaves less for everyone else. When school districts are responsible for teaching 18 year olds how to tie their shoes (I'm not making this up) and change their own diapers there is a problem.\n \n The entire \"special education\" industry is made up of kids who used to get help at home or in institutions but have now been dumped on public education. How much do you think one of these full time nurses cost? I know we have several \"veggie kids\" right now in my district who each have one. How much an hour do think \"lip therapy\" costs (answer is $55) ?\n \n This money comes from \"the schools\". The government doesn't give any extra money for these kids. It comes from the budget. These kids will never hold jobs (if they do it'll be some minimal wage job like cart collector at walmart). They'll live \"off the system\" their entire life. People wonder why social security is the largest part of the federal budget, it isnt the elderly, its all the \"disabled\" people (some legit but many not) and the fact we have to support them. \n \n Yet the courts have ruled the schools have to provide this care. Instead of parents and institutions for these kids who will never contribute to our society financially we have some poor teacher and 33 other kids in a classroom who are trying to learn. I've been in classrooms and seen the disruption these \"veggie kids\" and \"ADHD kids\" can cause.\n \n By the way, if you'll look in the Gay Adoption fourm you'll note I'm adopting two boys this year. I've been a foster parent for two years. These boys were ADHD and \"screwed up\" when I got them. A little positive parenting, strict discipline and a sense of \"right and wrong\" has done wonders. No more medications, no more \"special education\" (in 1st grade!!) class, no more wasting the school districts money.\n \n These kids will grow to be educated, well adjusted, healthy and happy adults because they have something many kids do not.\n \n A PARENT who cares enough to be a \"parent\".\n \n AZwebDESIGNER\n Scottsdale, Arizona, USA",

   "I agree. I also have another (partial) solution: the magnet program. It's been instituted in my public school system, which is basically Raleigh and the close surrounding cities. They get kids tested (by flawed standardized tests, I know, but it does at least a minimal job) to identify them as AG, or academically gifted. Then they put all of the programs and teachers to attract these kids into the inner city schools. That way, you don't have all the smart rich kids pouring their money only into the suburbia schools. On top of that, a lot of the kids who wouldn't have to work to be at the top of their class because they're smart, are suddenly challenged by being put in with all the other smart kids. \n \n Don't get me wrong, the AG kids still get the same old textbooks and other things that all the other inner school kids get, they simply get a higher level curriculum and a lot more challenging material, including having math classes ranging from the normal pre-algebra through algebra, geometry, and algebra II.

The high schools in florida are rated (A,B,C,D, or F) by the scores on the FCATS (tests math and reading skills, added science last year.) If a school gets a D or F rating they have to improve they scores or the school will be shut down. I'm not sure about the systems in other states but I feel florida is doing a good job.

   "You'd think that with the $7000 'supposedly' spent on each student per year (in the public school system) we would at least have something to show for it. I'm currently attending a public school and I am appalled at how it is run. Instead of openly encouraging students to challenge themselves and think as an individual, the system is designed to make us machines for the workforce, to drive the hunger for knowledge out of our systems, and to reduce us all to the same level in an attempt to create equality. There is nothing good about the new program of 'no child left behind'. Well, except for more funding going to school, which of course is wasted. It will leave children behind, all right. The advanced students who have a hunger to learn. They will be left behind so the more 'challenged students' can catch up to them...\n They are trying to prove that the more money that is spent on a student, the smarter the student will become. Then how can it be explained that private schools spend less per student and somehow still come out ahead? Is it perhaps that the students are encouraged to learn? Maybe more time and money should be spent on getting the students interested in subjects, rather than on buying more than enough fancy calculators, textbooks, and computers to go around. Maybe these new education programs are focusing on the WRONG THINGS.",

   "Let's look at the school side. The county I live in, about 78,000 people, pays teachers an average of $52,000 per year. It's considered above the norm and subsequently has virtually no turnover. Every outside analysis has\n reported favorably on professional abilities of the teachers. Teacher to student ratio is 1:21. \n \n Using state standards, all 10th grade students undergo testing to determine if they meet or exceed grade-level standards.

Funding is provided for a first-class educational system, 80% of all funds go to teaching salaries/benefits, facilities/staff are deemed well above average and we're churning out a large number of dummies unable to cope with even basic reading. \n \n The consensus is that the lower percentile, 50%, has little personal motivation, no family support or participation and that school for a majority in that group is viewed as basically a baby-sitting service from grades 1-12. Teachers state that parent/teacher conferences in that group are little more than parents blaming teachers, schools and anything else that sounds like a possible target for the failure of their children. They demand and expect the schools to serve as babysitters, teachers and parents. \n \n Without student testing and demographic/personal interpretation of the student body, how else would a community determine effectiveness or lack of in its educational system?",

   "My views.\n \n Firstly I don't think there's just one problem as many people seem to be saying. \"It's the parents\"/ \"It's the teachers\"/ \"It's the money\". It's, imo, a combination of pretty much all of these.\n \n To get someone to learn, they need motivation. That should come from the parents. Without that, no amount of money/help is going to make someone a good student. That's, imo, the most important problem.\n \n Once in school, it's the job of the teachers to teach the children: not to baby-sit them. I'm all in favour of having 'sets'. People learn at different rates. Putting people who learn quickly in the same classes with people who learn slowly is, quite simply, moronic. It makes it impossible for the slow kids to keep up, while the fast kids are still slowed down. If someone is mentally disabled it seems pretty pointless to put them in a class with \"normal\" children. The normal kids will be slowed down, while the disabled kid will have huge problems keeping up.\n \n Onto tests. As I said before, Teachers should teach. That means that they should help the children to learn, not to pass a test. Currently the best ways of doing this, imo, are either hiding the curriculum/what's on the test or having teacher assessments playing a larger role in grades. Both of these have fairly obvious drawbacks, however I feel both of these are better than the current system.\n \n I also feel that teachers should have more legal protection. I have no idea what the situation is in the US, but in the UK the teachers can do very little if there's someone who just doesn't want to learn and only disrupts everyone else.\n \n Now to IT. God how I hate IT in schools. It's ok, if you want to teach basic IT skills to those unfortunate enough not to have a home PC. For the others it's just a chance to ****-around. The time it takes to set up 30computers and keep them running is phenomenal. Personally, I think there should be a few basic IT lessons and then let pupils use the PCs for research under supervision. Other than that, I think the PCs should stay away from school. They cost a lot and are, imo, one of the worst ways to learn.\n \n \ni don't know alot about the skool system in america but i do know i flaw is what the are alowd to teach, because of the censor thing which means that teachers can't teach about dinosuars and evolution cos some religions don't belive in it. in one state it went as far a a book called 'a nice day for icecream' being rewriten without the icecream because its junk food.\n\n Literacy levels, as the quoted text shows, are far more important than worrying about minor issues in schools such as political correctness.\n \n -Wez",

   "I disagree that you don't get good teachers in the state sector. I was educated at a state comprehensive and state FE college, the vast majority of my teachers were very good, especially at the FE college. Private schools pay less than state schools, on average, what happens is that they don't necessarily pick up better teachers, just ones that can't hack a normal school for one reason or another. I'm not criticising them, it takes some guts to admit you don't have the skills to deal with disruptive pupils, and though I've started a bit of teacher training myself I don't know whether I can deal with them either.\n \n State schools in Britain are generally of very high quality. Those that fail usually have become trapped in a cycle of experiencing bad behaviour, finding it difficult to attract the best teachers, results plummet, it becomes last choice for parents so only the worst behaved or whose parents don't much care end up there, which begins the cycle again. My school nearly got trapped in this but just avoided it, mainly because their dip coincided with a demographic bulge that meant more children were reaching secondary age so the 2 schools had to divvy up pupils equally as neither was selective.\n \n All in all I think the state provides a very good academic education, and provides an invaluable social education which the private sector, being as it is self selectively middle class, cannot match.",

I'm not criticising them, it takes some guts to admit you don't have the skills to deal with disruptive pupils, and though I've started a bit of teacher training myself I don't know whether I can deal with them either.\n \n Yeah, that can be true. However, if the teacher cannot deal with disruptive behaviour in a state school, but has no discipline problems in a private school, how are they a \"worse\" teacher? They could actually be teaching to a higher level than the teacher with better crowd control. Its a matter of environment and skills, and how they interplay. I went to a private school (which did actually pay better than the state ones) and I agree, there were certain teachers who would have completely failed in a state school. However, they were very good at passing on their knowledge, just needed the right environment for it. \n Basically, I don't think a teachers merit rests entirely on crowd control. Someone can be bad at that and still a good teacher overall. \n Also, some state schools are mostly middle class, simply due to the catchment area etc. I don't think you can generalise about the state system, it is very diverse.",

   "I didn't say they were necessarily worse, just that they weren't necessarily better, it may seem like the same thing but it isn't. As far as I'm concerned though, being able to handle a class is part and parcel of being a good teacher; with practise almost anyone can pass on ideas to a small, well behaved group, if they're bright enough to have learnt the subject to begin with, and have a bit of enthusiasm. I guess if you want a different label for those who can't manage the crowd control, tutor might be the better one.\n \n Some state schools are mostly middle class, but I think that tends to only be in large cities. In most of the country there is one or two schools serving a large and diverse area. There were rural villages, leafy suburbs, modern housing estates, 50s council housing, pretty much everything in the catchment area of my school.",

Therefore, a high school diploma doesnt mean anything anymore. Because as long as you can read and write you can graduate high school and sometimes even that isnt required.

I will say that public education is failing in the southern United States more so then in the North. This failure does not fall on the hands of the government since everyone over here blames the government for everything. It falls on the parents,teachers, and students. The parents which alot do not have a good education themselves can't expect their kids to. Teachers just want you out of their class period. And most students are just lazy and find no value in education. I go to a school where 80% of the student population does not care about school and sleeps in most of their classes. I also know that once they get out in the real world and can't get a job they will blame the government for their problems and say they never had the resources in school. These kinds of people do not want to accept their own faults. When they know that the media will buy in and blame the government also its all too easy.

If kids took the time, did their homework, and actually turned it in on time, they might be smarter and better kids.\n My father is the principal at a school in Albequrke New Mexico. \n He tells me that kids are the problem. Not the school system.\n They are paying their teachers to teach. But the problem is the kids are taking advantage or not caring about the system.\n Kids don't even try, and they get behind. Some kids do the work, but don't turn it in on time. \n I am a retired teacher. I taught at a college. But, I sub now at high schools and middle schools. In Washington D.C. the kids have this system to help them.\n 1. If a kid is sick, and has an excused absense, he or she has as many days as he or she was sick, plus one extra day to get the work done and turned into the teachers. \n 2. If the assignment is forgotten, turn it in the next day for half credit (an F) or after that day, it becomes a zero.\n 3. Skipping classes to go with your boyfriend, or ditching to hang out with friends, it is considered an unexcused absense. Your parents will be notified, and you will get a zero on all homework assigned that day.\n 4. If a student has drug alcohol problems, we have administrators in the building to help.\n 5. They have study halls so if the child has that class period open, they have the option of going to the ARC (acedemic resource center) or learning center to get help on assignments. \n \n It is not the teachers fault. Most schools have systems like my fathers. But, the problem is, most kids just don't try. If they got their work turned in on time, studied, and showed up for class on time, they would be more successful. The teachers don't make squat. But for that pittance, they are trying to teach our children everything to be sucessful in life. But once again, kids would rather ditch school, not participate, not do assignments, not turn assignments in on time, and not study.\n Parents, if your child is struggling, let me let you in on some advice. \n If you want your child to be more sucessful, take the following steps:\n 1. Make sure your student studies for a minimum of an hour a night. Even if the child has no test, make them read over the chapter in their text books, and study with them.\n 2. Have them spend that hour either studying or doing homework. \n 3. Schools hand out planers or logs of what they are expected to record what they didin each of their classes that day. Have them list all their assignments.\n 4. If you (the parent) has time, check over his or her homework. Study with them when a test is coming up.\n 5. Make sure they are not up late watching those shows that kids are watching now a days. (South Park, Chappeles Show, Mind of Mencia, and other inappropriate shows. Those are the shows that are ruining our childrens minds as it is. They think half the XXXX on those shows is cool and it makes them do stupid stuff.\n 6. Set bedtimes. Example: I make my kids go to bed at nine o clock at night. They have to get up at six thirty, shower, get dressed, and get ready for school at eight.\n 7. Make sure that if a report card still comes in bad, you take televisions away, video games, and everything that your kid does other than his or her homework.\n Parents, if you listen to these steps, your child will be sucessful in school, and will get strait A's and B's like my kids do.\n Now, some of you need to tell your kids to come and ask for help if they don't understand something. Most kdis will just guess and not care if the answer is wrong. \n Follow these steps. \n -John Milosevic",

When I started high school, I ended up with a C average in Algebra 2. I even got a D+ in that class at one point. I never had a C in a class before that. The public high school had much higher math standards than the private grade school. We were expected to have learned a lot more in 7th and 8th grade in regards to algebra and geometry than we did. The public school was well ahead of the private school. The private schools around here do not offer college credit for any of their classes. They don't even offer Visual Basic programming or Japanese classes. These are things the public school has offered for at least 5 and 15 years, respectively. Public school students get a much better education that private school students. We can be bussed to a college and take college classes while still in high school for classes that are just entirely beyond the scope of high school. The credits come in handy. And the school pays for the credits. All we buy are books. There are many classes (Calculus, Visual Basic, Java) that are offered with college credits. It costs $135 to get 3 or 4 college credits. We are taught by high school teachers, but the University of Pittsburgh has approved those teachers. Officially, we have attended Pitt and have transcripts from Pitt with our grades. 3 credits from Pitt should cost us over $1000. The private schools don't have that. We have a lot more opportunities to learn than private schools offer.",
