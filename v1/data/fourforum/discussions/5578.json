   "Hey everyone. I am going to be starting a website that discusses the pros and cons of outsourcing. I thought that some of the politically minded people that are on this forum would have a definite opinion and may want to share it with the world. I won't be able to provide monetary compensation - sorry. \n \n Note: I am looking for articles that take one point of view and stick with it. If you are undecided on the issue and still want to write, why not write on both sides. Facts and numbers supporting your thoughts would be nice.\n \n Extra Note: Sorry if this is in the wrong area.",
