   "David Limbaugh\n Friday, Aug. 10, 2007 \n \n \nThe 2008 election is shaping up to be one of the most important in decades. With every passing day we are seeing a greater contrast between the Democratic Party platform and the national interest - as witnessed by the positions of the leading Democratic presidential candidates in their debates. \n \n Indeed, the unpopularity of the war in Iraq has fueled a remarkable boldness by these candidates in bringing their liberalism out of the closet. Whether the candidates are sincere in advocating some of their radical positions or merely sucking up to the various interest groups, they are parading their extremism on national television. \n \n The Democrats rail against lobbying, as if to suggest they abhor special interest politics and the undue influence of these interests on policy-makers. \n \n Yet they are nothing if not beholden to a collection of special interest groups, from labor unions, to gay activists, to race-baiting civil rights leaders, to illegal immigrants, to feminists, to global warming alarmists to antiwar, antimilitary groups to outright class-warfare-waging socialists. \n \n While the Democrats claim to be uniters, virtually every demand of these groups of their puppet-stringed candidates is inherently divisive. The consequent message the candidates carry forward is one of an alienated, polarized, divided and perpetually agitated America. \n \n A disturbing theme coursing through every policy they promote is that almost every problem in America is caused by a wrong action or inaction of the federal government, which Democrats obviously believe is responsible for everything from people's jobs to their healthcare to global warming - even their happiness. \n \n Read the transcript of the AFL-CIO debate and you'll find that Democratic leaders squarely place responsibility for almost every calamity in America - whether caused by natural forces, human negligence or imperfection, or even excess government intermeddling in the first place - on the federal government or evil corporations.\n\n \n \n =snip= \n \n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/8/10/95748.shtml",

   "This is so true and has been of the Left/dems since at least the 70s when they seemed to determine that throwing out any moral based values system in favor of gaining allies and voting blocks in special interest groups and political action committees was determined to be the most efficient route to re-election. Forget what is true, forget what is best for our economy or National Security in the long term. The immediate agenda of holding on to personal and Party power was all that mattered.\n \n We must also be suspect of the Party that is exposed for doing precisely that which it is accusing the other Political Party of doing. Which is precisely what the Dems do each time they attempt to paint the Republicans as in the pocket of Big Business when it is they themselves who feed at the troth of bribes and pay-offs for personal favors and partisan legislation.\n \n \nThe Democrats rail against lobbying, as if to suggest they abhor special interest politics and the undue influence of these interests on policy-makers. \n \n Yet they are nothing if not beholden to a collection of special interest groups, from labor unions, to gay activists, to race-baiting civil rights leaders, to illegal immigrants, to feminists, to global warming alarmists to antiwar, antimilitary groups to outright class-warfare-waging socialists. \n \n While the Democrats claim to be uniters, virtually every demand of these groups of their puppet-stringed candidates is inherently divisive.

   "The article is almost entirely partisan trash. It does bring up an interesting point...even though it is accidentally. The mention the mine collapse, bridge collapse, health care, etc.. and seem to lambast the democrats for suggesting that these were problem because the federal government was not taking enough action.\n \n The problem is that under our current system, they are RIGHT. They should not be, but under the current system, they are. \n \n The bridge collapse is a pretty good example. Is it REALLY that scary to suggest that when a bridge that belongs to the federal government, and that the federal government is responsible for maintaining, collapses due to lack of maintenance that there is a problem there that needs to be looked at? \n \n If the government is going to make itself the sole regulating authority for health care, highways, mine safety, etc... then when there are failures in those areas, it is pretty much the governments fault. \n \n \nJohn Edwards agreed on Minneapolis and also seemed to blame the Utah mining accident on the federal government. To Edwards, these disasters are not only the fault of the federal government, but of insider, lobby-driven Beltway politics ignoring the needs of \"working men and women.\" But Edwards outdid himself when he suggested that 51-year-old James Lowe's speech-impairing cleft palate is the fault of the federal government in failing to provide sufficient healthcare and the evil \"drug companies and insurance companies.\" \n\n \n Oudid himself?? Lets think about this for a second. WE are the only nation in the world that does not have any control on prescription drug prices. Not only do we not have any controls, there are only 2 industries in the US that are exempt from price gouging laws...the health care industry and the drug industry. It is also the ONLY industry in the US that is granted a monopoly on an essential good or service without price regulation.\n \n As if that is not screwing the US public enough.... 85% of the R&D that the drug companies have managed to convince gullible americans is the reason for such high prices is paid BY THE TAXPAYER via grants from the NIH. That is somewhere else that the health care and drug industry is unique. Typically, the product of federally funded research is public domain. It is the property of the American people since the American people PAID for it. There are 2 real exceptions to this...defense related research where the results are classified...and even that must be released in part and in whole if security concerns are addresses....and pharmaceutical research.\n \n So, the US public pays billions of dollars in research money to develop new medications. Then the drug companies get the patents that are the fruit of that research that WE paid for. Then, with exclusive rights to produce the medication that the American taxpayer paid to develop, they mark it up 5000% and when people complain, they use the fact that the R&D was expensive. \n \n Would you like to discuss how the health care and health insurance industries are regulated, and why it increases our health care costs by 80-110%??? \n \n High health care costs are DEFINATLY the federal governments fault. More specifically, they are Ronald Regan and George Bushs(1) fault and the fault of the republican congress under Clinton. \n \n \nBarack Obama complained that employers are exploiting \"undocumented workers.\" That's right, he said the illegals aren't being paid enough or receiving enough benefits. \n\n \n As far as I can see, this is the only thing in the article that is correct and worthy of outrage. Then again, Obama is an idiot.\n \n \nJoe Biden said the government ought to give us \"100,000 new nurses.\" Oh, boy. When the candidates were not promoting a paternalistic government or demonizing corporations, they were either telling tall tales about taxes and deficits or waxing recklessly about the Iraq war and the global war on terror (GWOT). They never tire of mischaracterizing President Bush's tax cuts as being skewed for the benefit of the wealthy, when the cuts actually made the income tax slightly more progressive and caused the wealthy to pay a higher share of taxes. \n\n \n This is simply a lie. Bushs tax cuts cut the percentage of taxes paid by the wealthiest 10% by roughly 23%. The wealthy are now paying a higher percentage of the nations tax burden because they are much wealthier than before...the overall wealth of the top 10% of Americans has increased by nearly 20% during bushs term. The middle class, on the other hand, has suffered horribly. 17% of previously middle class folks are now lower class folks, so they now pay no taxes. \n \n \nHillary Clinton led the charge in misrepresenting that the federal budget deficit is growing when it has been cut in half as President Bush promised - primarily because of his revenue-generating tax cuts\n\n \n The first part of this is a misrepresentation. The second part is a lie. When Bush took office, there was no deficit (if you count SS as part of the general fund). He ran the deficit through the roof. Today the deficit is roughly half of what it was 3-4 years ago...which was still Buh deficit. \n \n Bush has ctually managed to almost double the operating debt of the united states government in only 7 years. Next year, it will have doubled since he took office. Not only that, but next year (march) the debt service on that debt (interest) will reach half a trillion dollars per year. With debt service at half a trillion per year, we can not ever possibly pay down the debt. In order to do so, government expenditures would have to be cut in HALF and taxes would have to be raised by 8%. Basically, as of right now, due to Bushs excesses, the debt is INFINITE. \n \n Snow warned Bush about this. He warned the republican, rubber stamp congress about it as well. He stood up in front of the US congress and explained that the US was functionally bankrupt and that if they continued approving Bushs deficit ridden budgets and debt service rose to over $350 billion per year, that we would never be able to pay off the debt. Amazingly enouhg, 3 weeks later he was replaced.\n \n As far as the second part, it was the M3 growth at 13-16% per year...largely due to moneterization of the aforementioned debt that increased government revenue. Somebody needs to do a little research on the laffer curve.\n \n \nWhether heartfelt or mandated by their collection of malcontent special interest groups, the Democrats' vision for America is one of surrender in Iraq, denial and appeasement in the GWOT, constitutional rights for enemy combatants, socialized, inferior and rationed medical care, obstruction of entitlement reform, tax code-administered punishment of producers, a command-control economy with the government creating jobs, balkanization of America along ethnic and racial lines in the name of diversity, government intervention to erode traditional values, suppression of speech of those who don't toe the liberal line and more. \n\n \n Most of this is jsut idiotic rambling but the bolded parrt is interesting. In 1930, government spending and emplyment made up 12% of our econmy. In 1947, it made up 22% (WWII costs still being paid). In 2000, it made up 25% of our economy. Under the leadership of Bush and the republican congress, government spending and employment now makes up 44%....FOURTY FOUR PERCENT of our economy. \n \n It is shameful what the neocons have done to this country and what their supporters have allowed them to do. The conservative party has become the spending party and have thrown national security, the economy, and our rights in the toilet. You can not be both bankrupt and strong.\n \n Personally, the only republican I can vote for in good faith is Ron Paul. If he does not get the nominaiton, I am voting for hillary since I think she pretty much has the democratic nomination sewn up. She is FAR more of a fiscal conservative than and of the other republican contenders. Another 4 or 8 years of bush like policies, and this nation will fail. Our economy will cash and the US will either cease to exist, or will be comparable to Brazil. Hillary has a LOT of ideas that I disagree with, but she is the most fiscla conservative of all the canidates (excpet for Paul) and that is what we need.\n \n I can't believe anybody could actually believe the #### in the linked article.",

Look at this writing. \n There is no substance. No specific example to back up any claim. \n Just a lot of inflammatory name-calling. \n I am even arguing whether any of the claims have validity or not, just look at the presentation. That is not the writing of someone who cares about getting at the truth or solving problems. He merely want to raise the heat. Anyone could have written this without an iota of information about what has been said or going on with the candidates. There is no argument being presented here. \n \n It is sensational, childish rhetoric. How can anyone even take this stuff seriously enough to discuss.

The state is supposed to maintain it, with federal blessings and federally supplied money. The state does not actuall have the right to do work on it without the blessing of the federal government.\n \n There was a battle several years ago between the state of Missouri and the federal government regarding the \"heart of america bridge\" in kansas city. Large pieces of the bridge had actually fallen into the river, but the federal government, for whatver reason, would not allow it to be repaired. Even when the state and the city (Kansas City) came up with the money on their own, they were not allowed to repair the bridge.\n \n Ultimatly that is part of the problem. The rules regarding ownership of the interstate highway system are such a mess. Interstate highways belong to the federal government, but the state maintains \"proxy ownership\" (whatever the hell that is supposed to mean). The state is supposed to be responsible for maintenance and upkeep, but that maintenance and upkeep is both fully funded by the federal government AND funded at 60% by the federal government (the law literally specifies both) and the feds are supposed to approve any but ordinary maintenance, which both includes bridge repair, and does not, depending on which set of laws you want to go by. \n \n As usual, the government has managed to take something that is really quite simple and complicate the hell out of it.",
