   "John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential running mate has certainly caused a stir. And the more Gov. Palin is allowed to speak to the press and the public, the more she stirs controversy over her ability to assume the presidency should John McCain die while in office.\n \n Put bluntly by many Republicans and Democrats, she is unfit to assume that office. This is really no fault of her own as, until recently, she's been focused on what she knows best: Alaska.\n \n No, the fault lies squarely at the feet of John McCain. His choice of Gov. Palin shows how cavalier and impulsive he is willing to be with important decisions that impact the lives and livelihoods of all Americans. John McCain has served his country well, and for that he deserves our respect and gratitude. However, that respect and gratitude should by no means include the keys to the White House.\n \n After eight years of bad leadership, we cannot afford another commander in chief who is willing to make - and stick by - such blatantly risky, poor choices of this magnitude.\n \n Though Barack Obama may lack McCain's experience in military affairs and foreign policy, he consistently displays the depth of intelligence and decision-making qualities to navigate these issues of state with more discernment, discretion, tact and insight. Barack Obama is exactly who we need to lead our country through our present challenges and into the future.",

   "I will grant McCain one thing - his choice in Palin has finally shifted talk away from the Democrats to the Republicans. Less people are talking about Obama now - purely because Palin has barged in and forced people to grow an opinion about something Republican. Before this, McCain was unpublicised and failing, but the media frenzy over Palin has put him back up there - temporarily, at least until she runs out of PR.\n \n It seems that there really is no such thing as bad publicity - and Palin was a reviving PR stunt. Hopefully it won't last as far as the voting stations.\n \n EDIT: Palin vs Biden should prove interesting. I predict Palin with the better opening speech, but once it gets past the rhetoric to the un-scripted subject matter, she may well fall on her face. Time will tell.",
