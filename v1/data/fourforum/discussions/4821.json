It changes ability to leave the institution.\n \n \nStraight marriage must produce a child within 1 year, if not marriage is annuled and the two parties are fined heavily\n\n The purpose of marriage is to promote families.

So therefore, we should apply those to straight marriage. \n The purpose of the laws shuld be applied to straights.\n \n \nHow do you like them apples antis?\n\n Who's an anti? I'm not.

   "Divorce is not really an issue. It's promiscuity being the closely related issue.\n\n \n Excellent. As wsm said, there is no relation between sexual orientation and promiscuity. This indicates that both groups should receive the same marriage rights.\n \n \nThe fact that the definition of marriage will be changed is the second closes issue.\n\n \n Since there is no reason to believe that changing marriage is usually better or worse than leaving it the same, we must resort to reason in order to figure this out. A change can be either good or bad; that is, simply stating that marriage will be changed doesn't reveal anything of use.\n \n \nDivorce does not change that definition. It changes ability to leave the institution.\n\n \n If the ability to leave the institution is not a change to the institution, then it would only make sense that the ability to enter the institution is also not a change to the institution. And this makes sense: allowing more people to leave an institution doesn't really change it, and allowing more people to enter the institution also doesn't really change it.\n \n \nThe purpose of marriage is to promote families.\n\n \n This is precisely why families with same-sex parents should be recognized under the law.\n \n \nOf course not all people will have children but you cannot be sure who will and who won't. Just the likelihood. There is not benefit to gay marriage in general. But traditional marriages in general produce children. Almost 95% of children worldwide are born into families. Also in the US almost 90% of marriages produce children.\n\n \n This implies that having children is a benefit, and the only benefit to society that marriage produces. I will call such an implication absurd. Marriage exists not to encourage child birth, it exists to discourage child birth except in situations where that child is going to have parents to raise it. The contribution to society is not having a child; anyone can have a child. The contribution is raising that child. And because same-sex couples very often raise children, they contribute to society in the same fashion as opposite-sex couples. I further would not confine the contributions of a family to only raising children, for surely they do more than that.\n \n Beyond that, the benefits to the same-sex couples themselves are tremendous.\n \n \nWe give benefits to promote a behavior like small business loans. Not every small buisness is going to make it but the loans are for them only to promote business.\n\n \n But the behavior we are promoting is becoming a family and hopefully raising children; that is the difficult part, that is the contribution, and that what is encouraged by marriage. Because both same-sex and opposite-sex couples do this, they have the need for the same benefits.\n \n \nMost don't make use of the 1000 benefits available to them. Most of the main benefits are available to anyone through other legal means.\n\n \n This isn't true. The primary benefits of marriage include expanded health coverage for your spouse and spouse's children, tax breaks for each dependent in your family, naturalization of your spouse, increased welfare, food stamps, social security, or veteran's benefits, and increased opportunity to get a loan, among other things. Even hospital visitation rights can be denied, even though one partner has specifically gone through the legal procedures that allow his loved one to see him. The only benefit of marriage that can be obtained without marriage, that I can think of, is inheritence.",

We will simply have to agree to disagree.\n\n \n Of course straights will have more. They'll have a seperate institution all their own. They'll have a seperate term all their own. It is solid fact, and no set of logic can indicate that this is not true. Straights would not have as much more as they do today, but they would have more. You can say that the title, the institution means nothing, so long as everyone has the same benefits, but if you really believed this, you would allow everyone to have marriage. \n \n The truth is that the legal institution of marriage and the title mean something, and opponents of same-sex marriage want that something all for themselves, whether they realize it or not. As long as the law gives marriage to opposite-sex couples but not to same-sex couples, the law will indeed be giving them something; it gives them a form of acceptance in society. Same-sex couples aren't trying to say that they want to force society to accept them, just that they want the same chance for acceptance that everyone else has. The law cannot in good faith promote one man's religion and lifestyle over another's.\n \n The debate over civil unions is the debate about whether the law will teach people that gays are equals or teach them that they shouldn't engage in homosexuality. That's the real debate here, whether we see it or not. It's only logical reason that the legal definition of the institution of \"marriage\" might be important to anyone, and it's the most important reason that I demand the same access to the same legal institution. The debate is about whether gays truly have an equal chance to be accepted or are only given equal benefits so people can feel that they aren't suffering. One satisfies individual desires to be compassionate; the other is real equality.",

You are.\n\n \n But I am not the one who is holding the knife, for I'm not the one who seeks to harm people. I'm not the one who is passing ammendments banning same-sex marriage and civil unions. It is both absurd and insulting, that you should blame the actions of another upon me. It is horrible for people to hurt millions, then to blame it on the people they hurt. This harm is the fault of every person who votes for that bill which denies same-sex marriage and civil unions. To deny that is to ignore their actions, to allow one man to stab another in the gut in the midst of pleas for him to stop, then to blame it on the man who was killed. It is the tactic used by every criminal to justify his own actions: the victim deserved it. It isn't gay rights activists who are to blame. I don't see how you can believe otherwise.\n \n But it's not bull-headedness which causes me to support same-sex marriage. It is easy to quote one line in my argument where I state that I will continue to support same-sex marriage, but look at my entire argument. I don't have the option of legalizing civil unions; if gay rights activists were to support that, then gay people would truly never see equality. Civil unions would never pass. I know you do not think this of yourself, but had same-sex couples asked only for civil unions from the beginning, I believe that you would right now be demanding that I make a compromise between civil unions and nothing; maybe tax benefits but not child-raising benefits. And you'd call me just as bull-headed for not being willing to compromise there, either. And we'd still see amendments banning gay rights.\n \n I don't want those amendments to come, but if they do, they do, and I will still fight them. Gays would be no more equal if I supported anything less than same-sex marriage. Calling me bull-headed won't change that.",

[source 1, slides 43-44].\n \n \n In 2000, only 31 percent of students completed the 1983 National Commission on Excellence recommendations for college-bound students (4 units of English, 3 units of social studies, 3 units of science, 3 units of mathematics, 2 units of foreign language, and .5 units of computer science). [source 5]\n \n \n Only about half of those who enroll in college earn a bachelor's degree by the time they are 29 years old. [source 6]\n \n \n Among students who sought a bachelor's degree and began their postsecondary studies at a 4-year institution in 1995-96, just over half graduated from that institution within 6 years. [source 7]\n \n \n Students who take remedial coursework are much less likely to persist and eventually earn a degree than are other students, with those requiring the most remediation (more than two semesters of reading) being six times less likely to earn a baccalaureate degree than those requiring no remedial work. [source 6]\n \n \n In fall 2000, 28 percent of entering freshmen enrolled in one or more remedial reading, writing or mathematics courses. \n http://www.acrnetwork.org/educationchallenge.htm",

   "Well, you got some of it right, anyway. I posted a list of commonly held beliefs for why gay marriage shouldn't be allowed. Through a civil exchange between many posters, who proved that the cost in allowing gay marriage was either inconsequential or actually positive, the economic argument was dispensed. Similar discourse showed that \"recruitment\" and pedophelia were also bogus reasons. All of the major objections to gay marriage had been overcome but one, the sanctity of marriage held by many Christians. To overcome that obstacle, we discussed full rights without the name \"marriage\" because the term evokes negative responses from many Christians.\n I can live with gays receiving the same benefits as hetero couples, but my irrational, religious background forces me to stop short of calling it gay \"marriage\". To me and millions of others, who vote I may remind you, the term marriage is sacred and isn't up for redefinition. \n So, you see my North of the Border friend, my opinion has changed dramatically. Where before I was against all forms of gay union because of economic and religious reasons, I am now comfortable with gay unions that have all of the benefits of marriage, sans the name. That's quite a journey, IMO.\n\n \n I have to admit that I didn't see all of the evidence for that journey in the thread, but I will take your word for it, and given that, it is quite the journey.

   "The truth is that the legal institution of marriage and the title mean something, and opponents of same-sex marriage want that something all for themselves, whether they realize it or not. As long as the law gives marriage to opposite-sex couples but not to same-sex couples, the law will indeed be giving them something; it gives them a form of acceptance in society. Same-sex couples aren't trying to say that they want to force society to accept them, just that they want the same chance for acceptance that everyone else has.\n\n \n This is about inclusion. Gays and lesbians want the inclusion that straight people take for granted. That means equal access and recognition in the instution of marriage. It doesn't mean a separate instution, as a way of excluding only gays and lesbians from marriage, because it is thought that marriage holds too high a prestige for gays and lesbians. That certainly is not an inclusive society.",

I'm far from an expert on the US Constitution, but it would seem to me that a constitutional ban is unconstitutional. Ultimately, I see the whole issue playing out in much the same manner as the race issue. \n \n As much as I know the idea of it will make steam come out of your ears, I believe the issue will be solved in the courts. It came down to a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada to legalize gay marriage in Canada. Essentially, there was no legal leg to stand on to enforce the ban, and believe me, at least one of the judges looked far and wide to find a reason. The complete legalization of gay marriage in Canada is really just a formality now IMHO, it just needs rubber stamping by the gov't. Some are objecting, including the premier of the province I live in, but ultimately, again IMHO, it's a futile fight. \n \n Irrational fears don't trump the law.\n \n Anyhoo, it will be interesting to watch how things play out.

   "No question. The term marriage brings out an irrational defense mechanism. It's a button that needn't be pushed.\n \n You're way too optimistic. If gays keep pushing for \"marriage\", the US will move further towards a Constitutional ban of gay marriage. Mark my words.\n\n \n I don't doubt that the US will move closer to such an amendment if we keep pushing for marriage, at least they will for a short time. But when the older generation dies, the younger generation will support same-sex marriage. If we stop pushing for marriage, when the older generation dies off, we're going to be faced with a younger generation for whom the term \"marriage\" still sparks an irrational defense mechanism. We cannot build support for our cause if we abandon it.\n \n But the term \"marriage\" sparks an irrational defense mechanism not because people are irrational but because people are stubborn. People came into this debate with the knowledge that gay people are immoral, and no amount of reasoning can change that. When faced with reasoning, maybe some people can come to the realization that gay people deserve equal benefits, but although they can come to the conclusion that their original stance was wrong, they cannot come to the conclusion that gay people were right. That's where being stuck on the name originates; it isn't that the definition of a word is important. It's that people can't feel good blatantly treating themselves better than gay people, but they're too stubborn to admit their opponents were right. So they hold onto the idea that homosexuals shouldn't get exactly the same treatment using whatever justification they can; they think of themselves as compromisers, and they claim that we deserve punishment if we aren't willing to compromise.\n \n But compromise isn't always right, and compromising doesn't always result in a compromise. As I said, if we compromise, we'll be raising another generation of people to whom marriage sparks an irrational fear. People would take our change in stance as an admission that we were in the wrong place, but we weren't. We'd lose credibility and those who oppose us now would still oppose us; people are too stubborn to let their opponent be right. They'd recompromise, giving same-sex couples most of the benefits of marriage, but not a few benefits that they deem unimportant to same-sex couples. We'd have to start all over again.\n \n An amendment banning same-sex marriage is better than an amendment banning more, and that's where we'd be headed if we tried to support civil unions instead of marriage. I do not expect my words to resonate with an opponent of same-sex marriage; he does not have reason to believe that people would recompromise, to choose another arbitrary reason to oppose us, because he himself considers the definition of the word \"marriage\" to be a good reason to deny same-sex marriage. I expect what I'm saying here to be understood by same-sex marriage supporters, by people who realize just how little reason there is to deny same-sex couples the term \"marriage\". People will always find an irrational reason to oppose us.",

   "I disagree. I think part of the reason older people oppose gay marriage is that they ARE older, and a life of wisdom and experience speaks volumes. As younger people get older, their views often change over time and it could very well happen that the young people whom you think support your movement now will also in time see the problems with gay marriage as they get older. Younger people tend to be more interested in matters of social rebellion and going against the grain of society. I think it has a lot to do with youth in general--most of us were probably more rebellious when we were younger. I was certaily more liberal on social views when I was in my college years. Then reality hit, I got into the real world, got older, got married and had children, etc.\n\n \n Oh sure young people rebel against unjust traditions. You are wrong about how they will become unenlightened when they get older. Look at all the young rebels in the U.S. south, who are much at odds with the older generation over racism. The younger aged people going against those unjust old and comfortable(for some of the older generation), traditions of racism. By the way, gay people, as well as other minorities, exist in the \"real world\" too. Have you ever considered what it would be like if the situation were reversed, and heterosexuals were being excluded only because their sexuality was different from the sexuality of gay people?\n \n \nNo, it's neither one. It sparks a defense mechanism (and I wouldn't call it \"irrational\"--maybe in some cases) alright, but it's simply a defense mechanism that comes about because there are certain things in our culture and society that many people consder to be VERY important; so important in fact that they don't want you tampering with it. In this case, it's the institution of marriage. That's not stubborness--it's understanding the value and sacredness of something.\n\n \n One can understand the value and importance of something, without using irrational defence mechanisms. You have not shown us that this defence mecahnism is anything but irrational in all cases. Marriage can be important, sacred, valuable, etc., to gay and lesbian couples too. \n \n \nAgain, that's not stubborness, it's belief in absolute truth. The fact is, if you don't believe in absolute truth, you are the exception rather than the rule.\n\n \n How do you mean? If I don't believe in anything YOU say is an absolute truth, I am an exception? What if you say, it's the absolute truth that I must be your slave? I'm to just accept that injustice without question, without thinking too much about it? If it's a truth, a good set of morals, I will be convinced of it, intellectually, by good reasons. \n \n \nI am like JP as well in that you aren't going to be able to convince me that gay sex is moral. Not going to happen. That's not being stubborn; it's holding onto what's right.\n\n \n And how do you know absolutely what's right? Because of your interpretation of a religion, when that interpretation has been known to change for the majority, and will be different for different people? What are the reasons for beleiving this is right that gay sex is immoral?",

   "Where is your legal basis for calling it a legal contract? Marriage benefits are given in recognition of marriage: a commitment between two people. \n\n \n This is where you really have it backwards. A marriage can ONLY be sanctioned by the state. A WEDDING is the cerimony you hold in your church/backward/justice of the peace office. A marriage is in fact completely a governmental construct in order for committed couples to gain access to benefits which protect their rights as a single unit. \n \n \n \nThe more disturbing thing here is that you seem to want to reduce marriage to something akin to a contract.\n\n \n We didn't have to reduce it at all, it's already seen in all courts as a legal contract between two adults for the purpose of protecting the rights of the single unit.\n \n \n Marriage is a commitment. It's not a lease agreement. If the govt. suddenly stopped recognizing my marriage, I'd STILL have a marriage.\n\n \n And this you actually take from the Gay Rights movement. The fact is that is exactly what the Gay Rights Movement has been saying all along. Only now some hairbrained ultra-neo-cons hijacked the conversation and claimed the idea as their own.

   "I don't doubt that the US will move closer to such an amendment if we keep pushing for marriage, at least they will for a short time. But when the older generation dies, the younger generation will support same-sex marriage. If we stop pushing for marriage, when the older generation dies off, we're going to be faced with a younger generation for whom the term \"marriage\" still sparks an irrational defense mechanism. We cannot build support for our cause if we abandon it.\n \n But the term \"marriage\" sparks an irrational defense mechanism not because people are irrational but because people are stubborn. People came into this debate with the knowledge that gay people are immoral, and no amount of reasoning can change that. When faced with reasoning, maybe some people can come to the realization that gay people deserve equal benefits, but although they can come to the conclusion that their original stance was wrong, they cannot come to the conclusion that gay people were right. That's where being stuck on the name originates; it isn't that the definition of a word is important. It's that people can't feel good blatantly treating themselves better than gay people, but they're too stubborn to admit their opponents were right. So they hold onto the idea that homosexuals shouldn't get exactly the same treatment using whatever justification they can; they think of themselves as compromisers, and they claim that we deserve punishment if we aren't willing to compromise.\n \n But compromise isn't always right, and compromising doesn't always result in a compromise. As I said, if we compromise, we'll be raising another generation of people to whom marriage sparks an irrational fear. People would take our change in stance as an admission that we were in the wrong place, but we weren't. We'd lose credibility and those who oppose us now would still oppose us; people are too stubborn to let their opponent be right. They'd recompromise, giving same-sex couples most of the benefits of marriage, but not a few benefits that they deem unimportant to same-sex couples. We'd have to start all over again.\n \n An amendment banning same-sex marriage is better than an amendment banning more, and that's where we'd be headed if we tried to support civil unions instead of marriage. I do not expect my words to resonate with an opponent of same-sex marriage; he does not have reason to believe that people would recompromise, to choose another arbitrary reason to oppose us, because he himself considers the definition of the word \"marriage\" to be a good reason to deny same-sex marriage. I expect what I'm saying here to be understood by same-sex marriage supporters, by people who realize just how little reason there is to deny same-sex couples the term \"marriage\". People will always find an irrational reason to oppose us.\n\n \n And while you're waiting for America's epiphany on the virtues of gay marriage, an amendment will be passed that will be unarguably THE LAW of the land.

   "http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci861884,00.html\n \n \nabsolute truth\n \n In general, absolute truth is whatever is always valid, regardless of parameters or context. The absolute in the term connotes one or more of: a quality of truth that cannot be exceeded; complete truth; unvarying and permanent truth. It can be contrasted to relative truth or truth in a more ordinary sense in which a degree of relativity is implied. \n 1) In philosophy, absolute truth generally states what is essential rather than superficial - a description of the Ideal (to use Plato's concept) rather than the merely \"real\" (which Plato sees as a shadow of the Ideal). Among some religious groups this term is used to describe the source of or authority for a given faith or set of beliefs, such as the Bible. \n \n 2) In science, doubt has been cast on the notion of absolutes by theories such as relativity and quantum mechanics. Attempts to tie together all the known facts about the universe into a single unified theory (one example is string theory) could be seen as efforts to discover absolute truth about this set of facts. \n \n 3) In pure mathematics, however, there is said to be a proof for the existence of absolute truth. A common tactic in mathematical proofs is the use of reductio ad absurdum, in which the statement to be proved is denied as a premise, and then that premise is shown to lead to a contradiction. When it can be demonstrated that the negation of a statement leads to a contradiction, then the original statement is proved true. \n \n The logical proof of the statement, \"There exists an absolute truth,\" is almost trivial in its simplicity. Suppose we assert the negation of the statement, that is, that there is no such thing as absolute truth. By making that assertion, we claim that the sentence \"There exists no absolute truth\" is absolutely true. The statement is self-contradictory, so its negation, \"There exists an absolute truth,\" is true. \n \n This proof applies only to logic. It does not tell us whether any particular statement other than itself is true. It does not prove the existence (or non-existence) of God, the devil, heaven, hell, or little green people from another galaxy. Neither does it assert that we can always ascertain the truth or falsity of any arbitrary statement. The Incompleteness Theorem, proved by Kurt G\u00f6del and published in 1931, actually showed that there exist logical statements whose truth value is undecidable, that is, they cannot be proved either true or false. \n\n \n I would say that jyoshu's is more of the \"relative\" type than the \"absolute\".",

It's really easy to boast such a thing when you know it will never actually be threatened. \n \n Not to mention the fact that you never did respond to my questions earlier. \n \n If you were ill, would you expect your wife be allowed to visit you in the hospital as you legal spouce? \n\n \n Hospitals allow the patient to decide who visits anyway.\n \n \nIf you were to fall ill and needed her to care for you, I'm sure you'd expect her to be granted family leave, wouldn't you? \n\n \n Then work for an employer who grants same sex benefits.\n \n \nIf you were to die, would you expect her to exercize her legal right as your next of kin to claim Social Security Benefits? \n\n \n It's going to get cut quite a bit anyway, trust me. But civil unions laws can change that.\n \n \nIf you were to die, would you expect her to exercize her right as you legal next of kin as far as estate taxes? IRA benefits? \n\n \n That's why I would give her that right via power of attorney beforehand. You don't have to have marriage to do that.\n \n \nWhat if you were a widower, your wife had no living family yet did have a child from a previous marriage. Now, let's say something were to happen to your wife. Would you expect to retain custody of that child of which you had been raising as if it were your own, but in all actuallity it is not? \n\n \n Again, there's a very simple and basic legal document that grants that. Not much to it--I've looked into it before. You can do it with a will and judges will honor it. If not, get a copy of your state's legal guardianship form and it will do.\n \n \nHow about if your wife was a stay at home mother to your children but since you are not legally married, you cannot extend your medical coverage/insurence benefits to her because she is not your legal spouce? \n\n \n Again, work for a company that gives same sex benefits.\n \n \nWhat if when you both get to an age where one or both of you need nursing care and need to live in a nursing facility? Because the law does not recognize you as being legal spouces you would be forcably seperated from one another.\n\n \n Not if you get it in writing beforehand that you don't want to be separated.

As a gay person, in Ontario, Canada, I've known what it was like to not have equal recognition of my relationship, just because it wasn't heterosexual. My desires and my dreams, and who I was, was not being equally valued by my society. On June 11, 2003, that all changed. Ontario allowed equal marriage. I felt fully included and equally recognized and equally valued by my society. I was an equal citizen. I felt I had an equal stake in my society, and a very good reason to value that society, as it valued me.\n \n Um no, as for your sarcastic comments, it won't end world hunger or bring world peace.

There are MARRIED Catholic Bishops in Africa, POLYGAMOUSLY married. Catholicism has a history of adapting to the culture in local areas. It's one of the geniuses of the Church, and it shouldn't be one that people try to deny when it's convenient, nor one that they should try to reverse, just because it's doctrinally inconvenient. Not about matters of culture.\n \n As for those pictures you don't see as evidence, I'm sure you haven't read the books covering them or covering the liturgies that joined two men or two women. The evidence isn't so easily dismissed, not if you look at the iconography of the paintings or examine the actual words used in the ceremonies. Maybe everyone at the time was content to \"wink-wink, nudge-nudge\" that the two individuals were just \"good friends\" and let the deception go at that. Is that really so stunning?

   "WSM: thanks for those examples, unfortunately the first link doesn't seem to be working. Is it recent?\n\n \n Hmmm... Don't know what happened. It was working yesterday.\n \n Anyway, here's another:\n \n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/1979boswell.html\n \n \n Excerpts from the keynote address made by Prof. Boswell to the Fourth Biennial Dignity International Convention in 1979. \n \n \"Homosexuality,\" Plato wrote, \"is regarded as shameful by barbarians and by those who live under despotic governments just as philosophy is regarded as shameful by them, because it is apparently not in the interest of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects, or powerful friendships or passionate love-all of which homosexuality is particularly apt to produce.\" This attitude of Plato's was characteristic of the ancient world, and I want to begin my discussion of the attitudes of the Church and of Western Christianity toward homosexuality by commenting on comparable attitudes among the ancients. \n To a very large extent, Western attitudes toward law, religion, literature and government are dependent upon Roman attitudes. This makes it particularly striking that our attitudes toward homosexuality in particular and sexual tolerance in general are so remarkably different from those of the Romans. It is very difficult to convey to modern audiences the indifference of the Romans to questions of gender and gender orientation. The difficulty is due both to the fact that the evidence has been largely consciously obliterated by historians prior to very recent decades, and to the diffusion of the relevant material. \n Romans did not consider sexuality or sexual preference a matter of much interest, nor did they treat either in an analytical way. An historian has to gather together thousands of little bits and pieces to demonstrate the general acceptance of homosexuality among the Romans. \n One of the few imperial writers who does appear to make some sort of comment on the subject in a general way wrote, \"Zeus came as an eagle to god*like Ganymede and as a swan to the fair*haired mother of Helen. One person prefers one gender, another the other, I like both.\" Plutarch wrote at about the same time, \"No sensible person can imagine that the sexes differ in matters of love as they do in matters of clothing. The intelligent lover of beauty will be attracted to beauty in whichever gender he finds it.\" Roman law and social strictures made absolutely no restrictions on the basis of gender. It has sometimes been claimed that there were laws against homosexual relations in Rome, but it is easy to prove that this was not the case. On the other hand, it is a mistake to imagine that anarchic hedonism ruled at Rome. In fact, Romans did have a complex set of moral strictures designed to protect children from abuse or any citizen from force or duress in sexual relations. Romans were, like other people, sensitive to issues of love and caring, but individual sexual (i.e. gender) choice was completely unlimited. Male prostitution (directed toward other males), for instance, was so common that the taxes on it constituted a major source of revenue for the imperial treasury. It was so profitable that even in later periods when a certain intolerance crept in, the emperors could not bring themselves to end the practice and its attendant revenue. \n Gay marriages were also legal and frequent in Rome for both males and females. Even emperors often married other males. There was total acceptance on the part of the populace, as far as it can be determined, of this sort of homosexual attitude and behavior. This total acceptance was not limited to the ruling elite; there is also much popular Roman literature containing gay love stories. The real point I want to make is that there is absolutely no conscious effort on anyone's part in the Roman world, the world in which Christianity was born, to claim that homosexuality was abnormal or undesirable. There is in fact no word for \"homosexual\" in Latin. \"Homosexual\" sounds like Latin, but was coined by a German psychologist in the late 1 9th century. No one in the early Roman world seemed to feel that the fact that someone preferred his or her own gender was any more significant than the fact that someone preferred blue eyes or short people. Neither gay nor straight people seemed to associate certain characteristics with sexual preference. Gay men were not thought to be less masculine than straight men and lesbian women were not thought of as less feminine than straight women. Gay people were not thought to be any better or worse than straight people-an attitude which differed both from that of the society that preceded it, since many Greeks thought gay people were inherently better than straight people, and from that of the society which followed it, in which gay people were often thought to be inferior to others. \n If this is an accurate picture of the ancient world the social structure from which Western culture is derived-then where did the negative ideas now common regarding homosexuality come from? The most obvious answer to this question, and the one which has most generally been given in the past, is that Christianity is responsible for the change. There is an historical coincidence that seems to lend some credence to this idea- namely that when Christianity appears on the scene that this tolerance spoken of earlier disappears and that general acceptance of homosexuality becomes much less common. \n It should be obvious, however, that Christianity alone is not likely to be responsible for this change. (One notes, for instance, that the places in the world today where gay people suffer the most violent oppression happen to be the very places where Christianity is also least welcome.) First of all, I would like to dispose briefly of the notion that the Bible had something to do with Christian attitudes toward gay people. From an historical vantage point, it is easy to do so, but I realize that for people who live by the Bible more must be said about it than what an historian can observe. An historian can simply note that there is no place in the writings of the Early or High Middle Ages where the Bible seems to be the origin of these prejudices against gay people. Where any reason is given for the new hostility. sources other than the Bible are cited. As a matter of fact, from an historical perspective, the Bible would be the last source one would look at after examining growing hostility toward gay people, but so many people have a feeling that the Bible is somehow involved that its teachings on the subject matter must be addressed in detail. \n Most serious biblical scholars now recognize that the story of Sodom was probably not intended as any sort of comment on homosexuality. It certainly was not interpreted as a prohibition of homosexuality by most early Christian writers. In the modern world, the idea that the story refers to the sin of inhospitality rather than to sexual failing was first popularized in 1955 in Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition' by D.S. Bailey, and since then has increasingly gained the acceptance of scholars. Modern scholars are a little late: almost all medieval scholars felt the story of Sodom was a story about hospitality. This is indeed, not only the most obvious interpretation of it but also the one given to it in most other biblical passages. It is striking, for example, that although Sodom and Gomorrah are mentioned in about two dozen different places in the Bible (other than Genesis 19 where the story is first told), in none of these places is homosexuality associated with the Sodomites. \n The only other places that might be adduced from the Old Testament against homosexuality are Deuteronomy 23:17 and Kings 14:24, and*-doubtless the best know n places Leviticus 18:20 and 20: 13, where a man's sleeping the asleep of women\" with men is labelled ritual impurity for Jews. None of these was cited by early Christians against homosexual behavior. Early Christians had no desire to impose the levitical law on themselves or anyone else. Most non*Jewish Christians were in fact appalled by most of the strictures of the Jewish law and were not about to put themselves under what they considered the bondage of the old law. St. Paul says again and again that we must not fall back on the bondage of the old law, and in fact goes so far as to claim that if we are circumcised (the cornerstone of the old law), Christ will profit us nothing. The early Christians were not to bind themselves to the strictures of the old law. The Council of Jerusalem, held around 50 A.D. and recorded in Acts 15, in fact took up this issue specifically and decided that Christians would not be bound by any of the strictures of the old law except for which they list - none of which is related to homosexuality. \n In the New Testament we find no citations of Old Testament strictures. We do, however, find three places*-I Corinthians 6:9, I Timothy 1:10 and Romans 1:26*27**which might be relevant. Again, I'll be brief in dealing with these. The Greek word malakos in I Cor. 6:9 and I Tim. 1 :10, which Scholars in the 20th century have deemed to refer to some sort of homosexual behavior, was universally used by Christian writers to refer to masturbation until about the 15th or 16th century. Beginning in the 15th century many people were bothered by the idea that masturbators were excluded from the kingdom of heaven. They did not, however, seem to be too upset by the idea of excluding homosexuals from the kingdom of heaven, so malakos was retranslated to refer to homosexuality instead of masturbation. The texts and words remained the same, but translators just changed their ideas about who should be excluded from the kingdom of heaven. \n The remaining passage - Romans 1:26-7 - does not suffer by and large from mistranslation, although you can easily be misled by the phrase \"against nature.\" This phrase was also interpreted differently by the early church. St. John Chrysostom says that St. Paul deprives the people he is discussing of any excuse. observing of their women that \"they changed the natural use. No one can claim, Paul points out, that she came to this because she was precluded from lawful intercourse or that because she was unable to satisfy her desire....Only those possessing something can change it. Again he points the same thing out about men but in a different way? saying they 'left the natural use of women.' Likewise, he casts aside with these words every excuse, charging that they not only had legitimate enjoyment and abandoned it, going after another but that spurning the natural, they pursued the unnatural.\" What Chrysostom is getting at, and he expounds on it at great length, is the idea that St. Paul was not writing about gay people but about heterosexual people, probably married who abandoned the pleasure they were entitled to by virtue of their own natures for one to which they were not entitled. This is reflected in the canons imposing penances for homosexual activity, which through the 16th century were chiefly directed toward married persons. Little is said of single people. \n Perhaps the most significant element of the passage is that it introduced into Christian thought the notion that homosexual relations were \"against nature.\" What Paul, however, seems to have meant was unusual not against natural law, as it is so often interpreted The concept of natural law was not fully developed until almost 1,200 years later. All that Paul probably meant to say was that it was unusual that people should have this sort of sexual desire. This is made clear by the fact that in the same epistle in the 11th chapter, God Himself is in fact described as acting \"against nature\" in saving the Gentiles. It is therefore inconceivable that this phrase connotes moral turpitude. \n One may well ask whether the thundering silence on the subject in the New Testament does not indicate something about the attitude of early Christians toward homosexuality? As an historian, I would say no. Most of the literature of this period, especially legal and moral guidance, is silent on the purely affective aspects of human life. In the New Testament Jesus, St. Paul, and the other writers are generally responding to questions regarding social and moral problems posed to them by a predominantly heterosexual society. People asked them questions about divorce, widows, property, etch and they answered these questions. Most of Jesus' moral commentary, especially about sexuality is in response to specific questions put to him. Jesus does not appear to be giving detailed guidelines on all aspects of human life, especially not affective life, but rather to be offering general principles. There is almost no comment anywhere in the Bible about loving your children; there are few comments about friendship; and there is not a single comment about what we know as \"romantic love,\" although this is the basis of modern Christian marriage in our own church as well as the entire Christian community. \n There are some reasons for the hostility toward homosexuality which now seem characteristic of the Christian community, and I want to mention them. First of all, I want to dispose of what might seem the most likely primary reason for hostility toward homosexuality-namely, general opposition to non-procreative sexuality. There was indeed on the part of many early Christians a feeling of hostility toward any form of sexuality which was not potentially procreative. This cannot, however, be shown to stem from Christian principles. Among other things, there is not a word within the Old Testament or the New about non-procreative sexuality among married persons, and, indeed, most Jewish commentators have agreed that anything was licit between husband and wife. It is a well-established principle in several social science disciplines that there is, however, a class*related prejudice against non-procreative sexual acts, and one would expect to find this among lower class Christians as among any lower class group of the society. Among theologians, explicit rejection of all non-procreative sexuality, does not relate directly to attitudes toward gay people. The theologians of the early church were attempting to impress on all Christians that they had to see every act of heterosexual intercourse as the potential creation of a child. No effective means of birth control was known in this world (except for abstinence)-not even the rhythm method. The only way to avoid having children was to kill or abandon them. Theologians therefore wished to persuade Christian parents that they had to be responsible for the creation of a child every time they had sexual pleasure. The only other alternatives in their world-the world in which the early theology of the church was formulated-were morally unacceptable. Now the original aim of this approach, it appears, was only to protect children. It was not to attack homosexuality. Indeed, it was a very long time before this notion spilled over into homosexuality, but it eventually did. \n As late as the eleventh and twelfth centuries, there appears to be no conflict between a Christian life and homosexuality. Gay life is everywhere in the art, poetry, music, history, etc. of the 11th and 12th centuries. The most popular literature of the day even heterosexual literature, is about same*sex lovers of one sort or another. Clerics were at the forefront of this revival of the gay culture. St. Aelred, for instance, writes of his youth as a time when he thought of nothing but loving and being loved by men. He became a Cistercian abbot, and incorporated his love for men into his Christian life by encouraging monks to love each other, not just generally, but individually and passionately He cited the example of Jesus and St. John as guidance for this. 'Jesus himself,\" he said, \"in everything like us. patient and compassionate with others in every matter, Transfigured this sort of love through the expression of his own love. for he allowed only one - not al l- to recline on his breast as a sign of his special love; and the closer they were, the more copiously did the secrets of their heavenly marriage impart the sweet smell of their spiritual chrism to their love.\" \n After the twelfth century Christian tolerance and acceptance of gay love seems to disappear with remarkable rapidity. The writings of St. Aelred disappeared because they were kept locked up in Cistercian monasteries until about eight years ago, when for the first time Cistercians could again read them. Beginning about 1150, for reasons I cannot adequately explain, there was a great upsurge in popular intolerance of gay people. There were also at this time violent outbursts against Jews, Muslims, and witches. Women were suddenly excluded from power structures to which they had previously had access-no longer able, for example, to attend universities in which they had previously been enrolled. double monasteries for men and women were closed. There was suspicion of everyone. In 1 180 the Jews were expelled from France. \n The change was rapid. In England in the 12th century there were no laws against Jews and they occupied prominent positions, but by the end of the 13th century, sleeping with a Jew was equated with sleeping with an animal or with murder, and in France Jews, according to St. Louis, were to be killed on the spot if they questioned the Christian faith. During this time there are many popular diatribes against gay people as well, suggesting that they molest children, violate natural law, are bestial? and bring harm to nations which tolerate them. Within a single century. between the period of 1250 and 1350, almost every European state passed civil laws demanding death for a single homosexual act. This popular reaction affected Christian theology a great deal. Throughout the 12th century homosexual relations, had, at worst, been comparable to heterosexual fornication for married people, and, at best, not sinful at all. During the 13th century, because of this popular reaction, writers like Thomas Aquinas tried to portray homosexuality as one of the very worst sins, second only to murder. \n It is very difficult to describe how this came about. St. Thomas tried to show that homosexuality was opposed to nature in some way, the most familiar objection being that nature created sexuality for procreation and using it for any other purpose would violate nature. Aquinas was much too smart for this argument. In the Summa Contra Gentiles he asks, \"Is it sinful to walk on your hands when nature intended them for something else?\" No, indeed it is not sinful, so he shifted ground. This is obviously not the reason that homosexuality is sinful; he looks for another. First he tried arguing that homosexuality must be sinful because it impedes the reproduction of the human race. But this argument also failed, for, Aquinas noted in the Summa Theologica, \"a duty may be of two sorts: it may be enjoined on the individual as a duty which cannot be ignored without sin, or it may be enjoined upon a group. In the latter cases no one individual is obligated to fulfill the duty. The commandment regarding procreation applies to the human race as a whole! which is obligated to increase physically. It is therefore sufficient for the race if some people undertake to reproduce physically.\" Moreover, Aquinas admitted in the Summa Theologica that homosexuality was absolutely natural to certain individuals and therefore inculpable. In what sense, then, could he argue that it was unnatural? In a third place he concedes that the term \"natural\" in fact has no moral significance, but it is simply a term applied to things which are strongly disapproved of. \"Homosexuality,\" he says, \"is called 'the unnatural vice' by the common people, and hence it may be said to be unnatural.\" This was not an invention of Aquinas'. It was a response to popular prejudices of the time. It did not derive its authority from the Bible or from any previous tradition of Christian morality, but it eventually became part of Catholic theological thought. These attitudes have remained basically unchanged because there has been no popular support for change in the matter. The public has continued to feel hostility to gay people and the church has been under no pressure to re*examine the origins of its teachings on homosexuality. \n It is possible to change ecclesiastical attitudes toward gay people and their sexuality because the objections to homosexuality are not biblical, they are not consistent, they are not part of Jesus' teaching; and they are not even fundamentally Christian. It is possible because Christianity was indifferent, if not accepting, of gay people and their feelings for a longer period of time than it had been hostile to them. It is possible because the founders of the religion specifically considered love to transcend accidents of biology and to be the end, not the means. It may not be possible to eradicate intolerance from secular society, for intolerance is, to some extent ineradicable; but I believe the church's attitude can and must be changed. It has been different in the past and it can be again. Plato observed of secular society nearly 2,400 years ago that \"wherever it has been established that it is shameful to be involved in homosexual relationships, this is due to evil on the part of the legislatures, to despotism on the part of the rulers and to cowardism on the part of the governed.\" \n I don't think we can afford to be cowardly. We have an abundance of ecclesiastical precedent to encourage the church to adopt a more positive attitude. We must use it. As a gay archbishop wrote in the 12th century, \"it is not we who teach God how to love, but He who taught us. He made our natures full of love.\" A contemporary of his wrote, \"Love is not a crime. If it were wrong to love, God would not have bound even the divine to love.\" These statements came from the Christian community, from Christian faith. That community can and must be reminded of its former beliefs, its former acceptance. And we must do the reminding.\n",
