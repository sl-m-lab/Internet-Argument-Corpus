I'm a 20 something, own a house, drive fast car, good job, two B.S.s, not ugly, can turn beef, chicken, or fish into a work of art on a plate, and solid church goer.\n \n So what do women want? Chemistry is a wierd thing. I am familiar with all sorts of chemical reactions, but apparently not the right one.",

When I think of the first three in my buddies: I watch them to keep their word, watch my back, and not do dumb things.\n \n Women equate the first three with charm. Somehow charm can equal honesty, loyality, and intelligence. From my observations charming people are just \"closet a-h**es\".",
