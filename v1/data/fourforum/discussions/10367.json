   "...but failed to come up with a link at their website to show the photographs that appear on page 460, Volume 95 (September-October 2007) of American Scientist.\n \n www.americanscientist.org\n \n Get a copy and check out the pictures (six) of some mind boggling deep sea creatures. The cockatoo squid (galiteuthis phyllura) can reach a length of 2.7 meters. It's colored spots are bioluminescent photophores that help disguise its opaque eyes, the only parts of its body that are not transparent.\n http://discovermagazine.com/photos/deep-sea/Sherlock-623.jpg/view\n \n The fury little albino crab, discovered in 2005 prompted the immediate development of toy likenesses in Japan.\n http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/03/0309_060309_yeti_crab.html\n \n The Ping Pong Tree Sponge is rather interesting also.\n http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/05/22/science/20070522_DEEP_SLIDESHOW_3.html\n \n And try these jewels:\n http://www.coml.org/medres/high2005/highlightimages.htm\n \n It's simply amazing how many strange life forms exist on this one earth.",
