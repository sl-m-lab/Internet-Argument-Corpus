   "Does anyone else here watch this show? I have been watching Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD and can not get enough. It is sheer brilliance. Gritty and real. Tremendous performances. Amazing character development. No canned XXXX or one dimensional characters. No clear line good vs evil. It's all about the shades of gray that make up the true human face. And the writing! Although profanity abounds, in-between it is astonishing. No cutesy quips or melodramatic speaches written at a 7th grade level. You have to listen and pay attention here. And the use of monologues for inner thought! The only other place I have encountered dialogue so brilliant is Shakespeare. This show is the best thing I have ever seen on TV in my near 40 years. \n \n Overall cable is kicking the networks' asses for good programming. I also like Rome and Battlestar Galactica. \n \n Fox came close with Firefly - but put it to pasture. Pity. It was a marvelous, creative peek at a potential future. Just because there was spaceships didn't mean there wasn't horses or bicycles. Everyone speaking English AND Chinese. Prostitution is an honored profession, yet Christianity is still there. Although there were fancy weapons, swords and guns with bullets were still around. And although more advanced, machines were still noisy and dirty.\n \n Sigh - so little good TV to be found....",
