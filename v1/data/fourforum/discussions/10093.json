Adaptation to inevitable climate change might (or might not) be the wisest course of action - with progressive adjustments where they're judged to be feasible. The whole matter is a prudential question.\n \n James.\n\n \n I'm with James on this one. I think that it has been pretty well established that the earth is warming. WHY it is warming is largely irrelevant. If it is a natural phenomenon, there is nothing that we can do about it so we should jsut learn to live with it and try to adapt. If it is a man made problem there is nothing that we WILL do about it, so we should just learn to live with and try to adapt. \n \n Solutions are expensive and we would have to count on corporations to take the money for those solutions out of their profits, or pass them onto the consumer, and I am here to tell you it just isn't going to happen. \n \n If the warming IS man made, we are in for some pretty serious problems and it will be accelerating like crazy in the next decade. The IEA recently (yesterday) released a new petroleum market outlook that predicts a supply crunch in 2010-2012 when non opec oil hits a \"plateau\" and Opec looses pace with demand. The IAE has finally given the nod to peak oil, and in a near peak scenario. \n \n The environmentalists all seem to be excited about this. They see it as a chance to end global warming and many (if not most) seem to think that it will have a positive environmental effect. I have to wonder if these people are stupid or if they have just never met another human being. If the IEA is correct and oil peaks between 2010 and 2012 we are WOEFULLY ill prepared for it. Europe and the US both have biofuel targets that are a total joke and there are no real alternatives in sight. The US governments plan seems to be a crash program to build coal power plants and nuke power plants to try to pick up the slack as people try to switch from oil to electric wherever possible. One of the primary components of this plan is the lifting of EPA regualations regarding the construciton and emissions of new power plants. After all, this is a CRASH program we are talking about. We don't have time for that clean air ####. \n \n We will burn coal and nuclear plants until there is not a clean breath of air or a non radioactive glass of water left on the planet because we are humans and that is what we do. If global warming makes the UK an uninhabitable arctic wasteland and Africans are dying off by the millions, nobody really cares. If the rest of the world could figure out how to burn brits for heat and fuel our cars with liquified african babies, we would do it. \n \n That is just the way human beings are. We are greedy. We are selfish. We don't care about the others and we certainly don't care about future generations unless we can do so without inconveniencing ourselves. \n \n All this energy that goes into \"solving\" global warming needs to be going towards learning to live with it, because regardless of the cause, it is coming and we are not, or can not, going to do a damn thing to stop it.",

   "The value of this article is to show the huge impact that one of the smallest lifeforms on Earth has on the climate. An even larger impact than man allegedly. And this study is ONLY dealing with Phytoplankton. What about the affect the larger Sea Creatures combined, have on the climate ? And of course there is nothing Man could or should do regarding this affect phytoplancton has on the Ocean or the climate just as we can't change or control any of the other Natural processes that affect the Global Climate changes taking place.\n \n http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20060916010403data_trunc_sys.shtml\n Swimming Critters Add New Variable To Climate Confusion\n \n Phytoplankton - the microscopic plants that form the foundation of the marine food chain - generate an astonishing amount of power, report oceanographers from Florida State University (FSU). FSU's Professor William Dewar has calculated that the little critters generate about five times the annual total power consumption of the human world. He added that the yearly amount of chemical power stored by phytoplankton in the form of new organic matter was roughly 63 terawatts. By comparison, in 2001, humans collectively consumed around 13.5 terawatts. \n \n This microscopic powerhouse, already acknowledged as an important player in the climate debate, now looks to also play a key role in keeping the world's oceans circulating. Dewar estimates that the marine biosphere (the chain of sea life anchored by phytoplankton) invests around 1 terawatt in mechanical energy - swimming motions - that mix the world's oceans much as cream is stirred into coffee by swiping a spoon through it. \n \n And the end result, writes Dewar in the Journal of Marine Research, of all that phytoplankton-fueled stirring may be climate control.\n \n \"We have predicted, theoretically, that the amount of mixing caused by ocean swimmers is comparable to the deep ocean mixing caused by the wind blowing on the ocean surface and the effects of the tides,\" Dewar explained. In other words, this biosphere mixing appears to provide about one-third of the power required to bring deep, cold waters to the surface, which in turn completes the ocean's conveyor belt circulation critical to the global climate system. \n \n Phytoplankton acts as a reliable signal of environmental changes at, or near, the ocean surface through sudden declines or rapid growth - and scientists have suspected that phytoplankton affects as well as reflects climate change. In the future, phytoplankton levels are likely to be influenced by rising oceanic acidity and increasing temperatures.\n \n Along with the new calculations that point to the marine biosphere's bigger-than-expected role in ocean mixing and climate control, Dewar also suggests that the decimation of whale and big fish populations may have had a measurable impact on the total biomixing occurring in the world's oceans today.\n \n Source: Florida State University\n Graphic courtesy William Dewar, Florida State University\n \n ",

   "Given you haven't actually seen the documentary (nor would I expect any adherent of the Church of Man-Made Catastrophic Global Warming to consider evidence that questions their faith), I hardly think you're a good judge on this matter.\n\n \n It wasn't me that said it though was it? It was Mike Lockwood. Who we assume has seen the documentary.\n \n Strange that you can interchange 'Church of Man-Made Catastrophic Global Warming' and 'The Respectable, Publishing Scientific Community' is it not? \n \n \nThe point of the data presented was that solar activity has historically been a driver of climate change, not that \"if solar activity changes, the earth will instantaneously change to a temperature matching that dictated by it\".\n \n \n And yet the RS study claims that solar activity *has* been a driver of climate chance in the past but *can't* be today because the sums don't add up.\n \n \nIf the last 20 years were deleted to reinforce the point, that would be unconscionable. If the data presented was based on ice core samples used in a study which only had data available up until 20 years ago, that's a rather different story.\n\n \n Lockwood claims the latter: \"All the graphs they showed stopped in about 1980, and I knew why, because things diverged after that,\" he told the BBC News website. \"You can't just ignore bits of data that you don't like,\"\n \n And how do we know this? Because Lockwood used the same data! Except he *didn't* chop off the last 20 years! So now the Royal Society AND the British Antarctic Survey are *both* claiming that this documentary is not just misapplying data but actually deliberately misrepresenting it!\n \n \nThat's simply false, although it was generous of you to couch the claim in \"perhaps\", to indicate you don't actually know it is true.\n\n \n We're not going to know for definite for another 10 years. That's the way the graphs are going. But you're willing to wait and see? \n \n \nBut how do you reconcile that claim with this one:...\n \n Is there a sort of art form to holding mutually contradictory viewpoints within a single post?\n\n \n I don't think you've understood what I said. If you're going to include data on solar activity and the best data comes from the last 50 years, you don't leave out 20 of them.\n \n Historical evidence for climate change, on the other hand, comes from many sources and is abundant.\n \n I'm still baffled. Practically the whole scientific community accepts MMGW as \"fact\" but you seem to take the word of non-publishing scientists from other fields and documentary makers chasing ratings with junk science. Just what is it you think real scientists are doing?",

The warming began in Antarctica, probably initiated by changes in insolation. The increase in carbon dioxide content started about 800 years later but took place a few thousand years before the thaw of the ice caps that marked the main stage of the deglaciation. This sequence is consistent with the idea that the increase in carbon dioxide contributed, through various retroactions, to amplifying the very low effect of the changes in insolation, and thus participated actively in deglaciation.\"\n \n And you're accusing me of not reading the literature?!\n \n \nI don't know that that is true, and I don't think you do either.

Serious accustaions. Which is it to be? You don't assume he watched the documentary?!\n \n Also not that Friis Christensen said of the documentary's use of his data: \"We have concerns regarding the use of a graph featured in the documentary titled 'Temp & Solar Activity 400 Years'. Firstly, we have reason to believe that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that were presented as genuine. The inclusion of the artificial data is both misleading and pointless. Secondly, although the narrator commentary during the presentation of the graph is consistent with the conclusions of the paper from which the figure originates, it incorrectly rules out a contribution by anthropogenic greenhouse gases to 20th century global warming.\"\n \n \nIf solar activity declines to a historically low point (not simply a short term low, which by historical standards is still very high) we would predict global temperatures to decline... but this study does not address that, only this strawman version of the argument.\n\n \n Over what time frame? I'm confused. Are we going to see that change in decades, centuries or millenia? People who actually know about sunspot activity don't seem to think it's a big deal: http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/climate-change/dn6591\n \n ...see where Reimer says: \"the current upsurge in sunspots is not enough to account for the approximate 0.5\u00b0C rise from pre-industrial temperatures over the last 30 years\"?\n \n *it's quite interesting to go to the C4 webpage for the Swindle documentary.
