   "I'm surprised that this has yet to make this board.\n \n Maybe no one saw it splashed all over the news.\n \n http://www.spokesmanreview.com/jimwest/\n \nOver two decades, West rose to power in the Washington Legislature with a carefully cultivated image as a fiscally conservative Republican opposed to gay rights, abortion rights and teenage sex.\n ...\n While members of Spokane's gay community said it's widely rumored that West is a closeted gay man, they also said his sexual orientation is only an issue when his behavior intrudes on the legislative process and public policy.\n\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/05/AR2005050501868.html\n \nWest, 54, a conservative Republican leader of the state Senate before he was elected mayor in 2003, denied ever having had sex with children and vowed Thursday that he would serve out his four-year term.\n \n He confirmed in an interview with the newspaper that he offered gifts, favors and a City Hall internship over the Web site Gay.com to someone he believed was 18 but who was actually a forensic computer expert working for the newspaper.\n\n \n And the ultimate in hypocrisy.\n \n \nWest, who as an elected official has opposed gay rights, abortion rights and teenage sex, told the newspaper he had had online relationships in the past year through Gay.com and considered them private.\n \n \"My private life is my private life and always has been,\" he said. Concerning his sexual orientation, \"I wouldn't characterize me as 'gay,' \" West said. West was married for about five years in the 1990s.\n \n\n \n I just wonder how many other anti-gay crusaders are also closet gays.\n I'll bet it's more than a few.",

David Hager, a prominent obstetrician-gynecologist and Bush Administration appointee to the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), took to the pulpit as the featured speaker at a morning service. He stood in the campus chapel at Asbury College, a small evangelical Christian school nestled among picturesque horse farms in the small town of Wilmore in Kentucky's bluegrass region. \n\n \n \nUp on the dais, several men seated behind Hager nodded solemnly in agreement. But out in the audience, Linda Carruth Davis--co-author with Hager of Stress and the Woman's Body, and, more saliently, his former wife of thirty-two years--was enraged. \"It was the most disgusting thing I've ever heard,\" she recalled months later, through clenched teeth.\n \n \n \n \nAccording to Davis, Hager's public moralizing on sexual matters clashed with his deplorable treatment of her during their marriage. Davis alleges that between 1995 and their divorce in 2002, Hager repeatedly sodomized her without her consent. \n",
