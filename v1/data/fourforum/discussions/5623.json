If we heeded some pundits and politicians who are talking about our national trade deficit, we might think so. But do we have a trade deficit in the first place? Let's look at it.\n \n Insofar as the grocer example, there are two accounts that I hold. One is my \"goods\" account, which consists of groceries. The other is my \"capital\" account, which consists of money. Let's look at what happens when I purchase groceries. Say I purchase $100 worth of groceries. The value of my goods account rises by $100. That rise is matched by an equal $100 decline in my capital account. Adding a plus $100 to a minus $100 yields a perfect trade balance. That transaction, from my grocer's point of view, results in his goods account falling by $100, but when he accepts my cash, his capital account rises by $100, again a trade balance.\n \n The principle here differs not one iota if my grocer was located in another country as opposed to down the street. There'd still be a trade balance when both the goods account and the capital account are considered. Imbalances in goods accounts are all over the place. For example, my grocer buys more from his wholesaler than his wholesaler buys from him. The wholesaler buys more from the manufacturer than the manufacturer buys from him, but when we put capital accounts into the mix, in each case, trade is balanced.\n \n International trade operates under the identical principle. When we as consumers purchase goods from China, and the Chinese don't purchase a like amount of goods from us, it is said that there's a trade deficit. But instead of purchasing goods, the Chinese might purchase corporate stocks, bonds or U.S. Treasury debt instruments. Just as in my grocer example, there is a balance of trade. The deficit in our nation's goods and services account, sometimes called current account, is matched by a surplus of equal magnitude in our capital account. A large portion of surpluses in our capital account consists of U.S. Treasury debt instruments held by foreigners. As of June 2004, China held nearly $200 billion, Japan over $1 trillion, and Europe combined held over $2 trillion.\n \n Some politicians gripe about all the U.S. debt held by foreigners. Only a politician can have that kind of audacity. Guess who's creating the debt instruments that foreigners hold? If you said it's our profligate Congress, go to the head of the class. If foreigners didn't purchase so much of our debt, we'd be worse off in terms of higher inflation and interest rates. What about the possibility of foreigners dumping our debt?

National debt, instead of being incurred for productive purposes, is being used to sustain that service economy. Political expediency, keeping consumer confidence at levels to maintain consumption through personal debt, is a one-way street. It has no reserve factor for abrupt market adjustments nor does it encourage prudent fiscal management. Rather than pursuing the requirements to achieve balance in a maturing economy with a somewhat controlled decline in the lower class standard of living to meet present and future requirements, we've put all our eggs in one basket. \n \n A financial crisis will not present major problems to most established personal wealth or those industries who have prepared for it and will offer opportunity. It will disrupt a large number of individuals, businesses and require focus on getting our financial house in order. And that will require leadership looking to the future, not mired in perpetuating circumstances based on the past.

If it is used for investments, the inabllance is generally positive. If it is used for governmental and private consumption, the inballance is generally negative.\n \n If the inballance is fueled by a government decifit, it`s really bad...\n \n There are differnt types of investment. FDI`s (Foreign Direct Investments) are generally good things as it`s an indication of a competative economy. How much of the trade ballance do FDI`s and other types of investments in the US economy amount to? \n \n The US economy is certainly vibrant and do attract many foreign investors. But this does not negate the negative indications of a trade inballance fueled by private and governmental consumtion and borrowing...\n\n \n Let's just carry this argument to its most extreme. Suppose the Chinese have so much trade with us that they accumulate so much U.S. currency they can buy up everything in the U.S. Do they buy up me or my neighbor or what I own or use? The answer is no. The Chinese or whoever is free to stop trading with us at anytime and stop accepting our dollars. No one is holding a gun to their heads. It is often opined that these nations will stop accepting our money. Let them. I hope they do. The sooner the better. Then we'll know in the real world experience who is right and who is wrong about this argument. \n \n I can tell you this. I'm not losing any sleep over our trade deficit. It is, in my opinion, a function of the fact that we have a vibrant economy with people working and spending money. On the other hand a nation or area that is mired in recession (such as much of Europe), they have no spendable money to spend. Therefore they can't as a matter of practicality afford to spend money to import goods from such places as China. They have to import such necessities as oil to run their economies but consumer goods are not necessities. America can do both. We have the money and desire to improve our standards of living, and all the hand wringing by the chicken littles here and elsewhere counts for absolutely nothing with the American consumer. We do because we can.",

We no longer have a gold backing for our currency and haven't had for about 35 years now. \n \n As to the Chinese propping up our dollar. I think you have things a little reversed. We've asked very nicely and more recently forcefully, that they permit their currency to float. They don't want to do this. The reason they don't want to do this is because they want to employ as many people as possible as cheaply as possible. This keeps a lid on political turmoil. Eventually this will be the undoing of the communist government there. In their heart of hearts they know they have a tiger by the tail and they dare not let go. Their banking system is a mess. The Chinese economy will collapse long before ours does. \n \n To compare the relative strenghts of two economies I would rather compare apples with apples; namely the European Union. It currently has about 457 million people in the 25 countries. The total GDP is about $11.65 trillion. The GDP growth rate is 2.4%. The purchasing power parity is $26,900. The inflation rate is 2.1%. The unemployment rate is 9.5%. Exports are $1.109 trillion. Imports are $1.123 trillion. External debt is unknown.\n \n Compare that with the U.S. economy. We have 295 million people. Our total GDP is $11.75 trillion. The GDP growth rate is 4.4%. The purchasing power parity is $40,100. The inflation rate is 2.5%. The unemployment rate is 5.1%. Exports are $795 billion. Our imports are $1,476 trillion. Our external debt is $1.4 trillion.\n \n One can draw several conclusions from the above data. Our economy has a greater GDP than all of the EU. Our purchasing power is $13,200 higher per capita. Our growth rate is almost double. Our unemployment rate is almost half. However, our import/export ratio does not compare favorably but we have historically not been a large exporting nation until most recently. That is likely to change; especially if China can get its house in order. Additionally, as Japan's economy picks up this will help. Most importantly it is in our interest that Europe gets its economic house in order. Europeans cannot purchase from the U.S. if they are mired in recession. \n \n But having said all of this, no one is holding a gun to anyone's head to sell us goods are \"finance\" our debt.
