It seems that the idea has already been tried...with a republican president and a republican congress behind him...and it still came up short in the house by 54 votes.\n \n Did you ever stop to think that maybe people like you are the reason we have a constitution in the first place?

Marriage can only be between a man and a woman, as a symbol of love and possibly a means for the creation of a family. Unfortunately for homosexuals, there cannot be love between them. Homosexuality, in the majority of the cases, is a psychological disorder that arises at an early age for a lot of kids, and if not dealt with during adolescence, can lead to being gay. A lot of male kids are more \"effeminate\" when they're young, but when adolescence starts, thanks to the society which is against homosexuals, learn to be more manly, and lose any doubts about their sexuality. Unfortunately, today's society is becoming more and more open to it, causing homosexuality to spread. Therefore, you cannot call love a feeling that arises between two individuals because it exists only because of their psychological disorder. It's not love, it's an illusion of love. With women, it may be different. Because women are always a lot closer to each other than man. For instance they can easily kiss each other on the cheek without any kind of embarrassment or problem, thing condemned among men. So woman have a tendency to be bisexual, but they cannot naturally be completely lesbian.\n \n Now I believe that since we're all born different, there is a very scanty percentage of born homosexuals. We must however remember that by giving them the right to marry, we're spreading homosexuality. And homosexuality means bigger exposure to AIDS and other STDs, higher probability of pedophilia, the loss of distinction between a woman and a transsexual, and finally, the loss of distinction between a man and a woman.

   "There is just soooo much wrong with the last post. Don't worry Snaky.\n \n \nFirst of all let me say I'm 100% atheist.\n\n Nothing wrong with that.\n \nGay marriage should not be allowed because it is pointless. \n\n In what way is it pointless? Marriage is just a legal procedure which allows the authorities to keep track of relationships. It is not a religious thing (thought the church has tried to make it such). It also has little to do with procreation, as you don't need a licence to do the wild thing.\n \nMarriage can only be between a man and a woman, as a symbol of love and possibly a means for the creation of a family.\n\n See above.\n \n Unfortunately for homosexuals, there cannot be love between them. Homosexuality, in the majority of the cases, is a psychological disorder that arises at an early age for a lot of kids, and if not dealt with during adolescence, can lead to being gay. A lot of male kids are more \"effeminate\" when they're young, but when adolescence starts, thanks to the society which is against homosexuals, learn to be more manly, and lose any doubts about their sexuality.\n\n Do you have any evidence that homosexuality is just a disorder? Also, have you seen the number of hetrosexual men who appear effeminate (or butch lesbians), or homosexual men who appear 'normal'?\n \n You can't tell someone's sexual preference just by their mannerisms.\n \n Unfortunately, today's society is becoming more and more open to it, causing homosexuality to spread. Therefore, you cannot call love a feeling that arises between two individuals because it exists only because of their psychological disorder.\n\n So, now love is just a psychological disorder. Perhaps you are right.\n \n It's not love, it's an illusion of love.\n\n If you think you love someone, doesn't that mean you love someone? If I think I love chocolate, could I be wrong and actually hate the stuff?\n \n With women, it may be different. Because women are always a lot closer to each other than man. For instance they can easily kiss each other on the cheek without any kind of embarrassment or problem, thing condemned among men. \n\n Now we are getting into the 'ick factor'. Just because men don't have the touchy-feely thing going for them, doesn't mean much at all. Again, you can't tell just from mannerisms - or what makes you go eeeeeerrrrrr.\n \nSo woman have a tendency to be bisexual, but they cannot naturally be completely lesbian.\n\n It sounds like you just get off on seeing two women together (nothing wrong with that), but two men together makes you go eeeeeerrrrrr.\n \nNow I believe that since we're all born different, there is a very scanty percentage of born homosexuals. \n\n So there are real homosexuals out there. Nice to know.\n \nWe must however remember that by giving them the right to marry, we're spreading homosexuality. \n\n But you feel you can discriminate against the 'real' homosexuals, just to stop others from pretending to be homosexual. Isn't that a bit like locking up all those of Japanese descent because other Japs did something nasty. Hang on, already done that. Or bombing a muslim country because a few muslims crashed a plane. Er, still doing that.\n \n Perhaps we should lock up all Americans because of that business at Waco. Or all Brits because of he trouble they have a football matches. Or Canadians because of Ben Johnson.\n \n You see where I'm going? We can't make rules to discriminate against one bunch of people (innocent people) just because another bunch of people who maybe look a bit like them might be doing something wrong (and remember that the other bunch in question aren't actually doing anything wrong in this case).\n \nAnd homosexuality means bigger exposure to AIDS and other STDs, \n\n No it doesn't.\n \nhigher probability of pedophilia, \n\n No link there either. Male homosexuals like men, not boys and girls. Lesbians likewise.\n \nthe loss of distinction between a woman and a transsexual, \n\n So what?\n \nand finally, the loss of distinction between a man and a woman. \n\n So what?\n \n You'll be banning drag acts next.\n \nTherefore I do not think that for that ridiculously small percentage of uncurable individuals our society should risk so much.\n\n Lock up everyone who wears a turban. Or maybe a slightly off-white complexion might be enough.\n \nAnd let's not even get started about gay adoption. Poor kids.\n\n Yea, better off being unloved that being loved by someone who makes you go eeeeeerrrrrr.\n \nWe should try to support secular organizations which specialize in homosexual treatments, like the biggest one, the NARTH.\n\n You can't treat it. They are just a bunch of people who say eeeeeerrrrrr a lot.\n \nI rest my case.\n\n What case?",

   "What Easy? You got quiet about anti-gay scientists all the sudden? \n \n For those of you who are just catching up, George Alan Rekers is the notable professor, psychologist, and ordained baptist minister who also was a scientific advisor and board member of NARTH (organization that promotes \"conversion therapy\" for gays). He has testified in court and committee in support of oppression of gays. He hired an online male prostitute from Rent-Boy to accompany him to Europe and give him rub and tugs. \n \n What a classy guy. \n \n People like Rekers are a reality, and exist in a small but statistically significant percentage of \"anti-gay\" professionals (ministers, scientists, psychologists, and politicians) who turn out to be merely trying to cover up their own homosexuality. It is projection. They are merely punishing someone else for their own sins. It's really kinda sick. Ted Haggard comes to mind.",

   "As far as gay parenting (not all gay parents are adoptive - the reproduction organs of homosexuals aren't automatically broken.\n\n \n Almost always, the point being made is that two people in a homosexual relationship will never be able to conceive children because it's a sort of relationship outside of the procreative norm. That's just the reality of the situation. That there are are non-natural ways to get around that reality is beside the point. (Heck, I've even heard gays bring up--as wishful thinking, no doubt--the bizarro tabloid-like news accounts of womb transplants into men, and so forth.) \n I suppose one could still 'walk' around if he or she forwent normal walking for walking on their hands everywhere they went. The walking 'organs' (one's legs) would still not be \"automatically broken\".\n \n \nI know a gay man who is a biological grandfather - the actual facts, studies and stories of these children also say you are wrong. I co-parent with a gay man (I am the biological mother, he was my son's mentor and adopted him in a co-parent adoption years ago). Outside of the usual teen angst my son is just awesome and thinks people like you are bleedin' XXXXXX. He also hasn't \"caught gay\" yet.\n \n An lastly - pedophilia is a sexual attraction to children. Most child molesters are not true pedophiles but just another type of rapist. Rape is not about sexual attraction but power. Victims are not chosen because they turn the rapist on. Most child molesters are actually straight men.\n\n \n The usual 'rape-has-nothing-to-do-with-attraction' thing is a tragic over-simplification. If it were true, all rapists would target men and women with equal abuse, and everyone knows that's just not the case.",

The inability to procreate in that case is due to age, not due to biological incompatibility.\n\n \n many things can cause infertility in males and females at any age, but whats most relevant here is genetic infertility. males can have something called 'Y chromosome micro deletion', which in short means that he has some missing some base pairs in his Y chromosome - the chromosome responsible for sperm production. and if the information for sperm production is missing, that man is subsequently infertile from birth. he is still legally able to marry a woman, although he cannot biologically procreate.\n \n both males and females can have pituitary gland disorders which can cause an absense of hormones such as LH (lutenizing hormone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), testosterone or estrogen which are all responsible for fertility. - regarded hormonal disorders can sometimes be treated, but the fact still remains, those who dont treat their hormonal disorders which cause infertility can still get married to the opposite sex.\n \n EDIT:\n a couple may also be biologically incompatible. a friend of mine and his girlfriend are going through some rough times right now because their blood is not compatible with one another, and although they can procreate, the baby will have major blood problems. theyre currently figuring it out and getting medical treatment, but STILL - they are still legally able to get married despite their biological incompatibility.",

Of course biological reproduction involves a sperm and an egg, and most of the time, this involves a man and a woman engaging in sexual intercourse. But the creation of an ongoing couple relationship is a social arrangement, not a biological one. Not all cultures throughout time and around the world surround reproduction with monogamous heterosexual marital relationships. Polygamous relationships have been common in world history, whether we like them or not. To equate our current predominant form of social arrangement surrounding reproduction (monogamous heterosexual marriage) with nature or with biology is to confound biology with social arrangements. The biology of reproduction has stayed mostly the same over time and across cultures. The social arrangements surrounding reproduction have been diverse and have changed over time.\n \n You say that for you, \"gender does matter,\" and because it matters to you, you think same-sex marriages should be placed into a separate category from opposite-sex marriages, whether reproductive or not. I do not see this as a legitimate reason for creating a separate category of legal relationship just for same-sex couples. So what if gender matters to you?

No one is forcing anyone to marry someone of the same sex just because same-sex couples have the right to marry legally. \n \n There is no good reason for creating a separate legal institution specifically for same-sex couples, especially since the legal institution of marriage that we currently have would serve the needs of same-sex couples and their children just as effectively as it serves the needs of opposite-sex couples and their children. Creating a separate legal category that is identical to legal marriage in effect and differs from it in name only makes no rational sense, except perhaps as a step toward moving to include same-sex couples within marriage. Creating this separate legal category simply because you think \"gender does matter\" makes absolutely no sense.

   "I am sorry to hear about your uncle passing away.\n \n I would say your uncle's position is pretty much like most conservative Christians'. Most who are publicly vocal about it are just trying to defend their position, IMO. I don't think one can really go on the fact that some fundamentalists like EZ debate this issue on discussion boards--we have to remember that some people simply enjoy debate.\n You say you do not care what people think about sin, but there are obviously issues you DO care about. One is the issue of homosexuality, clearly. So I think it is safe to say you do care about about what people think about that. You say your religious beliefs are your business, but you make it your business to debate people when they take a different position than you on homosexuality-related issues. I don't see why it's not the same thing.\n \n \n \n Could you really ever be convinced that gay marriage should not be legalized? I think you are just as un-convinceable on this issue as EZ is on whatever issues he himself has dug his heels in over.\n\n \n I debate people on homosexuality-related issues for two reasons: because I want to support equal treatment under the law and because debate is interesting. \n \n I believe that gay people and bisexuals should have the same rights under the law as heterosexuals. I honestly do not care if EZRider thinks homosexuality is an \"abomination\" except to the extent that his view may prompt him to work against equal treatment under the law for gay people. If he does not organize to prevent equal marriage rights, then I don't care what his religious views are concerning gay people. I cannot possible convert everyone to agree with me, and I don't care to try. \n \n Sometimes I debate and discuss issues with people just because it's interesting, and I learn about different viewpoints from these debates. This has been especially true in the debates I have engaged in over constitutional issues like the meaning of the 14th amendment. I learn by debating others who understand the topic and who disagree with me. I don't actually think I will change anyone else's opinion, but I develop a better understanding of their views and a better understanding of my own views by debating them. I am not debating with you to try to change your views. I am debating with you to engage in an airing of different viewpoints, to hear the different arguments, because it's interesting and educational to do so.\n \n If I were to hear a good, reasoned argument for not including same-sex couples in legal marriage, I would think about it and I might agree with it. So far I have not heard a good, reasoned argument for not including same-sex couples in legal marriage. The arguments against legal same-sex marriage all seem to boil down to the fact that some people are uncomfortable with the idea, because it's not what they are used to or what they have grown up to believe in or because it's not what their church teaches or because it seems new. These are not legitimate reasons, in my view, for not including same-sex couples within the institution of legal marriage.",

   "Biological reproduction is not the same as the social arrangements we create to surround biological reproduction. Of course biological reproduction involves a sperm and an egg, and most of the time, this involves a man and a woman engaging in sexual intercourse. But the creation of an ongoing couple relationship is a social arrangement, not a biological one. Not all cultures throughout time and around the world surround reproduction with monogamous heterosexual marital relationships.

I do not like the idea that people can carry guns around, and I would never own a gun or shoot one. However, the 2nd amendment is in the constitution, and given that, I think the Supreme Court did rule correctly to incorporate the 2nd amendment and apply it to the states. (This is a 14th amendment interpretation question.) Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, I accept that gun ownership is an individual right. I may not like it, but I accept it, and I am not going to work to try to pass laws to restrict gun ownership. I don't own a gun, and I won't shoot a gun. I am taking the \"just don't do it\" position on this. I am not owning a gun. I am also not trying to prevent anyone else from owning a gun, even though I personally don't like the idea of people carrying guns around. \n \n It is possible to take the \"just don't do it\" position, and this is an example of it. I can live with people disagreeing with me about guns, and I can live with people having a right to bear arms. I know that many people see this right as very important, and I accept that, even though I don't value this right or wish to exercise it. But I accept that the right matters to other people, and I therefore accept and will live with their right to own guns.",

People argue their points because they believe they are right on a given issue. The gay pride movement has come out strongly opposing things like the ex-gay movement, for instance. If they were taking such a live-and-let-live approach, as you seem to be implying, they wouldn't care if people want to live an 'ex-gay' sort of way of living.\n \n I don't think the gay pride movement is just benignly asking for respect.

What liberty as an unalienable right means is a matter of interpretation and some disagreement. The meaning of the assertions in the Declaration has long been debated and contested. Further, not all Americans have always agreed with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Pro-slavery advocates did not see liberty as an unalienable right that extended to their slaves. Even Thomas Jefferson himself, while opposing slavery as contrary to his Declaration, never freed most of his own slaves. \n \n It is true that most people probably have convictions that they hold very deeply. I certainly do. However, that does not mean that what I believe is the absolute truth. As you suggest in your post, people nowadays mostly accept the view that blacks should be treated as the equals of whites. I believe this passionately. But is this the absolute truth? Or is it a conviction that we hold? I think it is the latter. It is an important conviction, but that does not make it the absolute truth. \n \n I do not think there are absolute moral truths. Our moral beliefs are always our beliefs. That doesn't mean that our beliefs don't matter or that we don't hold our convictions dear to us. Our moral beliefs are of great importance to us. But I think we must always reconsider what we believe and why we believe it in the various life contexts we encounter. \n \n I think your point that religious conservatives (at least some of them) view morality as more important than equality is interesting and probably true. I suspect that those of us who are religious liberals (I am one) view equality as an essential part of morality. Inequality is among the worst forms of immorality, at least in my view.

   "This post is a response to a previous post by Jyoshu, but I keep getting error messages when I try to respond directly to the points in his post. I don't know why this keeps happening. \n \n Jyoshu, I stand corrected on your argument about marriage as an institution. I misunderstood your argument to be that we should have a separate category of legal civil unions for gay people. \n \n I think it would be very difficult to eliminate all benefits associated with legal marriage at this point. Perhaps it would be possible; we could, for example, say that a person can leave Social Security survivors' benefits to one survivor, whether this is their legal spouse or not. Disassociating all benefits from marriage would mean revising many laws and policies, and I doubt most people would go along with this plan. It would be far easier simply to include same-sex couples within the institution of legal marriage.\n \n On the question of \"just don't do it,\" I have addressed this earlier by pointing out that I do not agree with gun ownership and think the second amendment is a bad thing, but I accept that people have the right to own guns and will own guns, and I simply choose not to own or shoot guns myself. This is an example of \"just don't do it.\" \n \n Laws against stealing are different from marriage laws in that stealing directly harms other people and thus harms the society. Stealing therefore should be against the law, in my view. Marrying someone does not harm other people, even though some may disagree with a particular kind of marriage. There is no rational basis for making same-sex marriage against the law; the only reason people oppose legal same-sex marriage is because they don't like it or because their religion doesn't accept it. These are not rational bases, not justifications for making a particular kind of marriage against the law, especially since such laws discriminate against a class of people and deny them a fundamental right.\n \n Your argument that \"no\" same-sex couple can ever contribute to society by procreating ignores the fact that gay individuals can and do procreate, and same-sex couples do contribute to society by raising children together. If a purpose of marriage is to foster the rearing of children in stable families, and same-sex couples do create families with children, then it clearly harms children and the society to deny children with same-sex parents the protections and stability of having legally married parents. \n \n We do not prohibit opposite-sex couples who are raising adopted children or children from previous unions the right to marry. We encourage them to marry in part to provide stability to the children they are raising, no matter whether these children are their biological offspring. We should grant same-sex couples the legal right to marry in part for the same reasons: to provide stability to the children they are raising. Why should we deny this security to children who happen to have same-sex parents?\n \n To argue that we should give special encouragement to marriage relationships that \"expand society in numbers\" does not make sense today, as we have plenty of numbers already, and there is no need to promote an expansion of our human numbers. People don't need to marry to reproduce anyway. The purpose of legal marriage should not be to promote more biological reproduction, in my view. I think that we should encourage marriage in part to promote long-term stability in families for the benefit of children. Since same-sex couples have and raise children together, the children of same-sex couples should have the same right to the protections of legally married parents that the children of opposite-sex couples have. Long-term stable families help children to grow up with love and security, and this helps to produce better-adjusted adults. Promoting marriage for all families with children thus serves society not by encouraging the expansion of numbers, but by helping to produce healthier and better-adjusted children and eventually adults.",

   "This post is a response to a previous post by Jyoshu, but I keep getting error messages when I try to respond directly to the points in his post.

It's a lot less prone to losing a lot of typing if the site isn't working right.\n \n \nI think it would be very difficult to eliminate all benefits associated with legal marriage at this point\n\n \n Yes it would but it's the only long-term way to make sure everything is covered or at least that marriage isn't broadened into anything and everything that comes along.\n \n \nOn the question of \"just don't do it,\" I have addressed this earlier by pointing out that I do not agree with gun ownership and think the second amendment is a bad thing, but I accept that people have the right to own guns and will own guns, and I simply choose not to own or shoot guns myself. This is an example of \"just don't do it.\n\n \n But that's simply a choice on your part. It's not something I'd necessarily ever tell someone they should do solely, instead of lobbying or arguing for gun laws. The answer isn't to just say \"just don't do it\". That typically goes without saying, I think, for anyone who opposes something. There's no reason you or anyone who doesn't like the 2nd Amendment can't continue to fight to have it overturned via another amendment for instance. And besides, this is an example for which the Supreme Court has ruled. Gay marriage is not so--the Supreme Court has never taken up gay marriage specifically so it's an issue that is much more undetermined.\n \n \nLaws against stealing are different from marriage laws in that stealing directly harms other people and thus harms the society. Stealing therefore should be against the law, in my view. Marrying someone does not harm other people, even though some may disagree with a particular kind of marriage.\n\n \n I only used that example to show why the 'just-don't-do-it' approach as an argument isn't a very good argument, IMO. I'm not asserting that stealing matches up with gay marriage analagously in other ways. However, for the most part it is not people who oppose gay marriage who are trying to change the status quo of law, usually. (There are exceptions of course.) It's rather typically those who want to change marriage by broadening it. It is the gay pride movement trying to affect something here, not the other way around. In terms of gender, marriage is as it has been since this country began: a union between a man and a woman. It's not like that was set up in order to oppress gay people. It was and is an opposite-sex institution, and that's WHY it's been that way. Gay pride proponents want to change that and broaden the institution of marriage.\n \n \nYour argument that \"no\" same-sex couple can ever contribute to society by procreating ignores the fact that gay individuals can and do procreate\n\n \n As I said earlier, only by using some work-around such as relying on an opposite-gender person outside the relationship. Again, you're splitting hairs here and playing word games--quite simply, a gay couple can never reproduce with each other. It's as simple as that.\n \n \nand same-sex couples do contribute to society by raising children together. If a purpose of marriage is to foster the rearing of children in stable families, and same-sex couples do create families with children, then it clearly harms children and the society to deny children with same-sex parents the protections and stability of having legally married parents. \n We do not prohibit opposite-sex couples who are raising adopted children or children from previous unions the right to marry. We encourage them to marry in part to provide stability to the children they are raising, no matter whether these children are their biological offspring. We should grant same-sex couples the legal right to marry in part for the same reasons: to provide stability to the children they are raising.\n\n \n With that approach, then any sort of marriage could be justified simply on the basis of raising children. With that logic, a single mother (who also raises children) should be indistinguishible in law from a married couple. So your point here is fraught with problems. Raising children is not a good enough reason to open marriage up to any given group that comes along wanting those benefits because anyone of any relationship arrangement imaginable could conceivably be raising a child. \n \n \nTo argue that we should give special encouragement to marriage relationships that \"expand society in numbers\" does not make sense today\n\n \n I think it's a case of the best we can do with the situation. The line has to be drawn somewhere, after all. There's always going to be some category of people out there who want in on the marriage-benefit gravy-train, so to speak. they too may be raising children. Society might as well draw that line at where the line is in terms of gender.",

It's a lot less prone to losing a lot of typing if the site isn't working right.\n \n \n \n Yes it would but it's the only long-term way to make sure everything is covered or at least that marriage isn't broadened into anything and everything that comes along.\n \n \n \n But that's simply a choice on your part. It's not something I'd necessarily ever tell someone they should do solely, instead of lobbying or arguing for gun laws. The answer isn't to just say \"just don't do it\". That typically goes without saying, I think, for anyone who opposes something. There's no reason you or anyone who doesn't like the 2nd Amendment can't continue to fight to have it overturned via another amendment for instance. And besides, this is an example for which the Supreme Court has ruled. Gay marriage is not so--the Supreme Court has never taken up gay marriage specifically so it's an issue that is much more undetermined.\n \n \n \n I only used that example to show why the 'just-don't-do-it' approach as an argument isn't a very good argument, IMO.

There's always going to be some category of people out there who want in on the marriage-benefit gravy-train, so to speak. they too may be raising children. Society might as well draw that line at where the line is in terms of gender.\n\n \n I strongly disagree with you that \"society might as well draw that line at where the line is in terms of gender.\" What does this do to all the children who have same-sex parents? It leaves them out because you think we might as well draw the line to exclude them. \n \n You sound so ho hum about this, like it's no big deal that children of same-sex couples are being disadvantaged in this way. To me it is a big deal, because these are real children who are losing out. The \"marriage-benefit gravy train\" as you phrase it exists for good reasons, not just to provide extra benefits to some people and not others. The benefits of legal marriage are aimed at supporting family stability and protecting children and spouses who may be home raising children. (Now I am sounding like more of a supporter of marriage than you are, though I am sure that is not actually true. I know you support marriage.)\n \n Of course, the ideal solution that you have envisioned and proposed would not leave out children of same-sex couples, because it would disconnect marriage from benefits entirely. And it's true that if we had universal health insurance not provided through employers, children and spouses would not depend on one spouse's family health insurance benefits. If people could leave Social Security survivors' benefits to one adult of their choice as well as to their children, rather than only married people being able to leave benefits to spouses, this would get around the problem of same-sex spouses not being eligible for survivors' benefits. However, the goal of disconnecting benefits from marriage entirely does not seem politically feasible to me, despite how attractive it sounds in theory. \n \n You write this: \"Raising children is not a good enough reason to open marriage up to any given group that comes along wanting those benefits because anyone of any relationship arrangement imaginable could conceivably be raising a child.\"\n \n What \"relationship arrangement imaginable\" are you imagining here? Two people who are raising a child together already CAN get married to each other, unless they are already close biological family or unless they are of the same sex in most states or unless they are legally married to someone else. Otherwise, two people raising children together can marry each other. I don't know what \"given group\" you think will suddenly demand the right to marry that doesn't already have the right to marry, except for gay people. (I do see some first cousins seeking the right to marry, from which they are barred in some states but not others. I personally see no good reason why states should bar first cousins from marrying each other, but that is a debate for another thread.) \n \n You seem to be worried about a slippery slope that doesn't exist, about all kinds of weird groups of people wanting to marry each other because they are raising children together. But people raising children together already have the right to marry each other legally if they are not closely related biologically, if they are not already married to someone else, and if they are not of the same sex in most states. There is no slippery slope where all kinds of weird people will marry each other, because weird people already have the right to marry each other. Even criminals on death row can marry. The group of couples that is mostly excluded is same-sex couples, for no legitimate reason. \n \n I think that protecting and providing for children IS a major reason why people get married legally, and it is a good reason for doing so. Many senior citizens, who are not going to have more children, choose not to marry each other legally and simply live as unmarried couples. They have no good reason to marry legally once they do not plan to raise children together, and some of them already receive Social Security survivors' benefits from previous spouses. \n \n You write this: \"Again, you're splitting hairs here and playing word games--quite simply, a gay couple can never reproduce with each other. It's as simple as that.\"\n \n My answer to this is, \"So what?\" An infertile couple can never reproduce with each other either, and you do not want to exclude them from the right to marry. You are the one splitting hairs, by trying to find a rationale for excluding from marriage only same-sex couples. You would exclude same-sex couples from marrying because of their infertility, but you would not exclude other infertile couples from legal marriage. Our current marriage laws do not require that people be able to reproduce biologically with each other in order to marry. This is as it should be. Marriage should not be denied to people simply because they cannot reproduce biologically with each other. \n \n Same-sex couples are no different from any other couple in their love, in their commitment, and in their ability and choice to raise children together. Same-sex couples should have the equal right to marry legally because it benefits society to support stable families, and it especially benefits children to live in stable families with two married parents. Since same-sex couples are raising children, the children in these families deserve the right to have two parents who are legally married to each other. Beyond this, marriage is a fundamental right, and states need to have a compelling state interest in denying couples the right to marry each other. States have demonstrated no compelling interest in preventing same-sex couples from marrying legally.",

I therefore must work to support my child, and there is no other spouse to stay home to take care of our child. I have to hire people or ask others to help me do child care for the next 4 years, until my daughter is 12. My child automatically qualifies to be on my health insurance plan because she is legally my daughter. I do not get the benefits of marriage, because I do not have a spouse, not because the laws are discriminatory against single parents. I could marry if I chose to, except that I cannot marry someone of the same sex, for no legitimate reason. I would be forced to marry someone of the opposite sex in order to provide my daughter with the protections and benefits of having two married parents. \n \n Since marriage is a fundamental right, states should have to demonstrate that they have a compelling state interest in denying a particular type of couple the right to marry. It's not enough to draw arbitrary distinctions between people and say that these people do not have the right to marry simply because it is convenient for the state to say so or because the majority dislikes the marriage in question. The burden should be on the state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in prohibiting a particular type of marriage. I think this is true of laws barring first-cousin marriage, for example. \n \n I think it's clear that states do have a compelling interest in prohibiting marriages by people who are still children. Age requirements for marriage protect children. Age requirements for marriage do not represent a permanent prohibition against a particular kind of couple marrying, however. Since people get older, a child is not barred from marrying forever. The child must simply wait to come of age to marry. Prohibitions against same-sex marriage are a permanent bar to particular couples marrying, as prohibitions against child marriage are not. \n \n Someone who is 17 and wants to marry in a state with the legal age at 18 can either wait 1 year (a short time), or ask the permission of parents. In contrast, a gay person who wants to marry his or her partner legally can do so in only a few states, and the marriage will not be recognized at all ever in most other states. \n \n The case for including same-sex couples within marriage has nothing to do with \"redefining marriage.\" Marriage was \"redefined\" by the federal and state DOMA laws passed in the 1990s that suddenly explicitly banned same-sex couples from marrying legally. The goal of those of us who advocate for including same-sex couples within marriage is to enable people who are already forming committed marital relationships to receive the same legal status and have the same legal rights and legal obligations as couples who are opposite-sex. \n \n Again, there is no compelling state interest in barring same-sex marriage. Barring same-sex couples from marrying harms children; it does not benefit them. Barring same-sex couples from marrying does nothing to promote stable families. It simply excludes some people from a fundamental right, with no purpose or rationale other than tradition, religious beliefs, and people's discomfort with the idea. These are not adequate reasons to exclude a class of people from a fundamental right.",

   "To joshyu and gansao: The term \"compelling state interest\" is a standard applied by the Supreme Court to state laws that deny a class of people a fundamental right. The Court has said previously that marriage is a fundamental right. In defending laws that bar same-sex marriage, a state, specifically California right now, must show that they have at the very least a rational basis for denying same-sex couples the right to marry, but they should probably be required to demonstrate a compelling interest in denying same-sex couples the right to marry.\n \n Marriage is a right. Therefore, the state must explain to the Court its reasons for denying a particular class the right to marry. It's incumbent on the state, not gay people, to demonstrate a compelling interest in denying the right to marry.

   "Jyoshu: The Supreme Court has said in the past that marriage is a fundamental right, and we will see if they assert this now. It's not just my opinion; the Court has in the past declared this. The Court has never viewed fundamental rights as absolute, however. The Court has created balancing tests to weigh the interest of the states or the federal government in abridging a right against the right itself. For example, the Court after World War I declared that the first amendment right of free speech is not absolute, and it can be limited by the government if the speech presents a \"clear and present danger.\" That came to be known as the \"clear and present danger test.\" The Court thus upheld the Espionage Act as constitutional, allowing the government to arrest and imprison people for calling on men to resist the draft and for denouncing the government and the war. Over time, however, the Court backed away from the test, ruling in subsequent cases that the danger from speech had to be imminent for the government to restrict the speech. This is an example of how the Court has tried to balance the interests of the government or the states in protecting the people and the individual rights of the people. Steeeve will probably argue that this is the Court just making up balancing tests, which is true. But it's what they do. \n \n You are right that widespread acceptance of same-sex marriage will be a cultural change. I will argue that the culture has already been changing to accept gay people as free and equal citizens with the right to be themselves openly. The society has also been changing in acceptance of gay-headed families, even though most people still say they do not favor same-sex marriage. But the changes in attitudes over the past 30 years have been dramatic. I also think you are right that significant cultural and legal changes require time and thoughtful dialogue and consideration and debate. We are having that when it comes to same-sex marriage and equal rights under the law for gay people generally. That's partly why we have this debate topic in this forum. \n \n I think that each significant cultural or social change needs to be debated on its own merits. I do think this debate is important to our society, so that we continue to live together in a civil way, without resort to violence. \n \n While I like in theory your proposal to remove all concrete legal and financial benefits from marriage and granting all benefits to every individual, I think it is politically unrealistic to expect this to happen. I think most Americans can and will come to accept same-sex couples being included under the umbrella of existing marriage laws. We have seen this happen in states where same-sex marriage has been legal for a period of time. People have come to accept this because legalizing same-sex marriage does not take away anything from opposite-sex couples in their marriages. It has no direct impact on them at all. I do not think most Americans would accept stripping all marriages of the benefits that married couples receive. That would be a huge change that would directly affect not just same-sex couples but all married couples.",

   "\n \n Since marriage is a fundamental right, states should have to demonstrate that they have a compelling state interest in denying a particular type of couple the right to marry. It's not enough to draw arbitrary distinctions between people and say that these people do not have the right to marry simply because it is convenient for the state to say so or because the majority dislikes the marriage in question. The burden should be on the state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in prohibiting a particular type of marriage.\n\n \n IMO the only demonstration needed by the states is the Word of God which clearly states that gay sex is a sin.

However, because we separate church and state, our laws must not advantage one religious viewpoint over others. Not all Christians or people of other faiths believe that \"gay sex is a sin,\" and nowhere does the Bible say anything at all about same-sex marriage.

We are all free to believe and practice our own faiths by keeping religion separate from our government. \n \n Whether your or some others believe that same-sex marriage is \"institutionalized sin\" should be irrelevant in whether it is legal. The question should be whether same-sex marriage does harm to the society or its members, and whether a state has at least a rational basis but probably a compelling interest in banning same-sex marriage. People have the right to believe that Jews and Christians should not marry each other. People do not have the right to pass laws prohibiting Jews and Christians from marrying each other.\n \n On the K-12 level, in the public schools, it is not the job of teachers to impose religious doctrine on students.

I think what remains to be seen is whether or not that means that any kind of marriage whatsoever could fit into that idea.

As one writer noted, \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions.\n \n Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, \"...Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue....\"\n \n There is a God, and if you continue to violate his commandments then you will be in bondage just like the Israelites were time and again in the Book of Judges when they ignored God.\n \n Thomas Jefferson understood this principle when he wrote:\n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n Of course, you probably won't hear any of that from our current crop of educators.",

   "The problem, Steeeve, with saying the compelling state interest is in enacting a law that the people want is that this is exactly what the Bill of Rights was intended to prevent: the majority denying rights to the minority through the use of government. \nNo, the bill of rights was intended to prevent the federal government from overstepping it's bounds...which you can look at as related to majority denying rights but really it is government denying rights (as government could always \"deny rights\" when the majority didn't want them to because the congress has the power). But this brings up an interesting question. How is it not a state interest that the citizens get laws enacted that they wish to have? The fact that it denys a right seems irrelevant and almost circular. \"You have to have a compelling state interest to deny a right\" and then \"something isn't a state interest if it denies a right\". \n \n This is why I find \"compelling state interest\" to be so absurd. If we injected everyone with truth serum we'd probably find out that it really means \"compelling reason to the judge\". Of course with moral questions that really varies. \n \n \nIf minority rights are to mean anything and to be protected, they must be protected from the animus of majorities. In the case of Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court struck down a state constitutional amendment voted in by the people, because the Court ruled that the amendment was based purely in animus against gay people. The Court ruled that the constitutional amendment did not even meet the rational basis standard. The fact that the people of Colorado voted for the amendment and thus wanted it was not sufficient to allow them to deny a right to a group of people, a minority. \nThe problem was it was a ruling based upon pure emotion. Nothing I have read (in the history of the amendment) seems to suggest that equal protection can only be \"broken\" (it wasn't) if the court agrees with the reasoning. It is irrational at best and makes the court a bunch of moral arbiters.\n \n \nI think the Court ruled correctly in Romer v. Evans.

   "That's another revisionist myth that the founding fathers did not adhere to - that being that religious principles could not be taught in the public schools. That's no where in the Constitution. The Constitution says that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\" It says nothing about what teachers can teach. And in my own lifetime I attended a K-12 public school where the teacher (an assistant football coach) occasionaly gave us a lesson from the Book of Revelation. But that was before some spiritually bankrupt judges took Jefferson's Danbury Letter out of context on the \"wall of separation.\"\n \n Just another example of how this country is going down the tubes because of people's ignorance of the Bible and the beliefs & practices of our Founding Fathers.\n\n \n The modern Supreme Court has said that the constitution does not allow teacher-led prayer in the public schools and that public schools are not allowed to teach religious doctrine as truth in the classroom. If a K-12 public school teacher were ever to teach my daughter a \"lesson from the Book of Revelation\" I would immediately file a lawsuit. I would also try to get the teacher disciplined and probably fired, unless the teacher issued an apology to parents and to the students and pledged never to teach religious doctrine in the public school classroom again. I feel very strongly about this. I do not want ANYONE ramming their religious beliefs down my child's throat, and certainly not in a public school. My daughter has the right not to be subjected to this in the public schools. I respect your right to believe what you will, but it's not your right or anyone else's right to force your religious beliefs on my child through the public schools. That's how it is, whatever you think of our Supreme Court. \n \n Teaching religious doctrine as truth in the public schools is without doubt creating an establishment of religion, and it violates the principle of religious freedom that has helped to make our nation free for all of us. The Supreme Court will back me up on that. If you want to teach your children religious doctrine in school, you are certainly free to send them to private school. That is also religious liberty.",

   "You want to know what real freedom / liberty is? Take a lesson from our Founding Fathers:\n \n Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the \"Father of Public Schools,\" once had this to offer: \"The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.\"\n \n Don't miss the significance of that last statement: \"..without virtue there can be no liberty....\" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage. As one writer noted, \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions.\n \n Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, \"...Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue....\"\n \n There is a God, and if you continue to violate his commandments then you will be in bondage just like the Israelites were time and again in the Book of Judges when they ignored God.\n \n Thomas Jefferson understood this principle when he wrote:\n \n \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the\n people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are\n not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my\n country when I reflect that God is just; and that His justice\n cannot sleep forever.\" (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781)\n \n Of course, you probably won't hear any of that from our current crop of educators.\n\n \n The founders mostly all advocated religious faith, but their faiths were diverse and not necessarily traditionally Christian. Benjamin Rush became a Universalist, meaning he came to believe in universal salvation. This was considered heresy by most Christians at the time. My own faith is Unitarian Universalism, and my church was founded in the 1860s as a Universalist congregation. Thomas Jefferson was a Deist who did not believe that God intervenes in daily life and who did not believe in the miracles described in the Bible. He rewrote the Bible and stripped it of all miracles, including the resurrection of Jesus, which he excluded entirely from his Bible. James Madison was nominally Episcopalian, but some scholars regard him as a Deist. George Washington rarely spoke of his religious beliefs. He was Episcopalian in his church membership, and some scholars think he was also a Deist. John Adams was a Unitarian. Benjamin Franklin was a Deist who rejected the divinity of Jesus and a belief in salvation, but who retained a belief in religious practice and prayer. Many of the founders embraced the Enlightenment philosophy of their age and were not evangelical Christians in the traditional sense. \n \n The founders in the late 18th century were much concerned with fostering civic virtue, by which they generally meant a commitment to serve the common good. They drew their ideas about virtue from ancient Greek philosophers, notably Plato and Aristotle, and they modeled the new American republic partly on the republics of ancient Greece and Rome.",

   "No, the bill of rights was intended to prevent the federal government from overstepping it's bounds...which you can look at as related to majority denying rights but really it is government denying rights (as government could always \"deny rights\" when the majority didn't want them to because the congress has the power). But this brings up an interesting question. How is it not a state interest that the citizens get laws enacted that they wish to have? The fact that it denys a right seems irrelevant and almost circular. \"You have to have a compelling state interest to deny a right\" and then \"something isn't a state interest if it denies a right\". \n \n This is why I find \"compelling state interest\" to be so absurd. If we injected everyone with truth serum we'd probably find out that it really means \"compelling reason to the judge\". Of course with moral questions that really varies. \n \n The problem was it was a ruling based upon pure emotion. Nothing I have read (in the history of the amendment) seems to suggest that equal protection can only be \"broken\" (it wasn't) if the court agrees with the reasoning. It is irrational at best and makes the court a bunch of moral arbiters.\n \n I think without question it was a wrong decision even if the Colorado amendment was total BS.\n\n \n The assumption by anti-federalists who called for a Bill of Rights in the constitution was that the government would act in the interests of the majority, and so laws enacted by the federal government could and would reflect the will of the majority. Anti-federalist writers like Agrippa and \"a Maryland farmer\" worried openly that majority rule would deny liberty to the minority, unless a Bill of Rights was included in the constitution to prohibit the majority from denying rights to the minority. James Madison also expressed great concern about the majority trampling on the rights of the minority. But Madison, as we have previously discussed, initially argued that a Bill of Rights was not necessary, because he thought the structure of the government itself, the separation of powers, would prevent the majority from trampling on minority rights. Madison had other reasons as well for initially opposing a Bill of Rights in the constitution. He later changed his mind, some say because of political pressure, and he was instrumental in writing the Bill of Rights that we now have. \n \n So while the Bill of Rights was inserted to prevent the government from trampling on the liberty of the people, if you read the antifederalist papers and also the writings of Madison on this topic, you see that their concern was that the majority would trample the rights of the minority through exertion of federal power. In the thinking of 18th century political theorists, in the struggle between power and liberty, the new constitution gave power to the majority of the people, but this left the problem of the majority of the people potentially using government power to deny liberty to the minority. The anti-federalist answer to this was a Bill of Rights, and Madison eventually agreed and participated in writing the Bill of Rights. \n \n Fast forward to the 20th century and Supreme Court interpretations of the 14th amendment. According to the Supreme Court, a state can have a compelling interest in a law that denies a right, but the bar is high for a state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. The Court, as we both know, has further developed this doctrine so that laws that deny rights on the basis of race or national origin or religion get strict scrutiny, meaning the state must show that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. Laws that violate a fundamental right also apparently get strict scrutiny, although this doctrine is less clear, and it's hard to know whether the Court will apply strict scrutiny to a case challenging a restrictive marriage law. It is up to the Supreme Court to determine whether the state has a compelling interest in enacting a law in a case where the Court applies strict scrutiny. \n \n For cases in which a law denies rights on the basis of sex, the Court has applied a middle level of scrutiny, so that the bar is lower for the state to demonstrate its reasons for enacting the law. (I know you know all this, but I include it for background for other readers.) And for other kinds of discrimination, the Court typically applies the lowest level of scrutiny and demands only that states demonstrate a rational basis for enacting the law. Even with this low level of scrutiny, the Court ruled that the state of Colorado failed to show a rational basis for its state constitutional amendment that denied political rights on the basis of sexual orientation. The fact that the voters themselves voted in the constitutional amendment did not, in the view of the Court, give the state even a rational basis for enacting the law. I know you don't like any of this, but these balancing tests are what the Court does.\n \n I do not think the ruling in Romer v. Evans was based on \"pure emotion.\" The Court majority considered what interest the state had in enacting the constitutional amendment, which denied people in the state the right to pass legislation barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court considered what the state's interest was in enacting this amendment, and the majority concluded that the only reason for the amendment was animus against gay people. This was not, in the view of the Court majority, even a rational basis for enacting the amendment, and they therefore ruled that the state could not abrogate an individual right with such an amendment.",

But the words of Madison himself demonstrate his intent. \n \n As for the Abingdon case, you need to place your quotation into context and show us the whole of what Justice Clark wrote. His point was that, although the state may not show hostility to religion, religious exercises in the schools are in fact unconstitutional, and their prohibition does not represent hostility toward religion. See his statement in context: \n \n \"It is insisted that unless these religious exercises are permitted a \n 'religion of secularism' is established in the schools. We agree of course that the State may not establish a 'religion of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus 'preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.' Zorach v. Clauson, supra, at 314. We do not agree, however, that this decision in any sense has that effect. In addition, it might well be said that one's education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment. But the exercises here do not fall into those categories. They are religious exercises, required by the States in violation of the command of the First Amendment that the Government maintain strict neutrality, neither aiding nor opposing religion. \n \n \"Finally, we cannot accept that the concept of neutrality, which does not permit a State to require a religious exercise even with the consent of the majority of those [374 U.S. 203, 226] affected, collides with the majority's right to free exercise of religion. While the Free Exercise Clause clearly prohibits the use of state action to deny the rights of free exercise to anyone, it has never meant that a majority could use the machinery of the State to practice its beliefs.\"",

   "According to the Supreme Court, a state can have a compelling interest in a law that denies a right, but the bar is high for a state to demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law. The Court, as we both know, has further developed this doctrine so that laws that deny rights on the basis of race or national origin or religion get strict scrutiny, meaning the state must show that it has a compelling interest in enacting the law.\nI'm familiar with what the court has said but they fail to realize the substantive meaning of this. So I'm going to break down the illogical nature of the \"compelling state interest\" test and why if one did exist it would have to include citizen votes as an interest.\n \n First off, I subject the role of government (federal and state combined) is basically to provide \"establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity\". You might notice this is from our Constitution. The relevant part here is \"blessings of liberty\". Now, who decides what a liberty is? Should it be the citizens of United States or should it be a select group of people or something else. I would say generally in the United States we have both rights agreed upon by the citizens and those we find inherent from God (see DOI for what I mean on the later). For the sake of argument let's just look at rights agreed upon by the citizens. Who's job is it to determine what the rights agreed upon by the citizens should be? There is really the main question. Well if I felt the speed limit should be 70mph instead of 65mph who do I go to? I go to the General Assembly in my state and lobby them to change the speed limit laws. Traditionally in our government we have set it up so we have one person running executive aspects or rather carrying out the laws; one GROUP making the laws that are to be carried out; and one group to ensure the government and others are acting in accordance with the laws. As such you have the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. So what branch would you go to in order to make an 'agreed upon right' for citizens? Well naturally the legislative branch. The judicial branch's ONLY job with that should be to look at that law and say does it conflict with a superior law (aka the constitution).\n \n Now, in form, the judges are claiming the 14th amendment equal protection clause implies a \"compelling state interest test\". The substance of this ruling makes this not true in the way they apply it. Why? Well what is a compelling state interest? As I established above one state interest, for the legislature, is to bring about laws that the public agrees upon. The courts have said this is not good enough. So what is the threshold? It isn't implied in the amendment so you can't turn there. If you looked at public opinion than you'd just break what you said you can't do. These leaves you with either looking at your own views or looking at a different set of opinions. So it isn't a \"compelling state\" interest anymore but would be a \"compelling interest to a judge or given subset of opinion\" test.

   "I'm familiar with what the court has said but they fail to realize the substantive meaning of this. So I'm going to break down the illogical nature of the \"compelling state interest\" test and why if one did exist it would have to include citizen votes as an interest.\n \n First off, I subject the role of government (federal and state combined) is basically to provide \"establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity\". You might notice this is from our Constitution. The relevant part here is \"blessings of liberty\". Now, who decides what a liberty is? Should it be the citizens of United States or should it be a select group of people or something else. I would say generally in the United States we have both rights agreed upon by the citizens and those we find inherent from God (see DOI for what I mean on the later). For the sake of argument let's just look at rights agreed upon by the citizens. Who's job is it to determine what the rights agreed upon by the citizens should be? There is really the main question. Well if I felt the speed limit should be 70mph instead of 65mph who do I go to? I go to the General Assembly in my state and lobby them to change the speed limit laws. Traditionally in our government we have set it up so we have one person running executive aspects or rather carrying out the laws; one GROUP making the laws that are to be carried out; and one group to ensure the government and others are acting in accordance with the laws. As such you have the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. So what branch would you go to in order to make an 'agreed upon right' for citizens? Well naturally the legislative branch. The judicial branch's ONLY job with that should be to look at that law and say does it conflict with a superior law (aka the constitution).\n \n Now, in form, the judges are claiming the 14th amendment equal protection clause implies a \"compelling state interest test\". The substance of this ruling makes this not true in the way they apply it. Why? Well what is a compelling state interest? As I established above one state interest, for the legislature, is to bring about laws that the public agrees upon. The courts have said this is not good enough. So what is the threshold? It isn't implied in the amendment so you can't turn there. If you looked at public opinion than you'd just break what you said you can't do. These leaves you with either looking at your own views or looking at a different set of opinions. So it isn't a \"compelling state\" interest anymore but would be a \"compelling interest to a judge or given subset of opinion\" test. By what standard you apply that is probably beyond anyone and certainly not taught in law school. \n \n So as you can see the FORM of the compelling state interest test makes no sense. The substance shows it to be a \"convince me\" test which basically results in 9 lawyers deciding the liberties of a nation of 300 million. This was feared in the anti-federalists papers if you remember and clearly not intended by the powers of the judiciary section of the constitution. The only compelling state interest that exists is to secure the Blessings of Liberty that the CITIZENS want secured. \n \n For those wondering about majority rule...basically the constitution is not there to prevent the majority from winning every time. The constitution merely slows down the majority. In the long run the majority should and does win out. \n \n and basically this was the reason. People thought it was gross and didn't want it. That is a good enough reason to enact a law and has been for many other laws. The court thought \"well it isn't gross and you can't make a law because you don't like something\" which is an emotional way of thinking, it isn't based in law.\n\n \n This is a thoughtful analysis of the compelling interest doctrine. I think that on some issues, the constitution does prevent the majority from winning, specifically in cases in which the majority passes laws that deny rights to minorities. The segregation laws are an example. The majority of voters in the South clearly supported segregation laws, and the Court eventually interpreted the constitution as preventing the majority from enacting or retaining these laws. \n \n Ultimately, of course, the constitution exists because of the will of the majority, and it is the majority who sustain the constitution and provide for its enforcement, but it is more than a simple majority. Changing the constitution requires a decision by a super-majority, in effect. Only a super majority of 2/3 of both houses of Congress and 3/4 of the state legislatures can amend the constitution, as you know. So you are right that it is the will of the people, expressed in a super-majority, that has created and sustains the constitution, which through the Bill of Rights prevents majorities from denying rights to the minority. Madison himself wrote about his concerns that the majority would deny rights to minorities, as did several of the antifederalist writers. \n \n On the Romer v. Evans matter, I think the Court majority's ruling was based on more than their dislike for the public animus against gay people or their belief that you \"can't make a law because you don't like something.\" I think their ruling was based on the fact that the Colorado constitutional amendment denied a right to a class of people, and in the judgment of the Court majority the voters had no rational basis for doing this beyond animus against gay people. Colorado, in defending the amendment, failed to demonstrate what the Court deemed to be a rational basis, in effect a good reason, for enacting the law. And they applied this judgment because the Colorado constitutional amendment in question denied a right to people. \n \n Voters can pass laws because they don't like something, and voters do this all the time. What the Court said voters cannot do is pass a law denying a right to people simply because they don't like those people; they have to demonstrate that the state has at least a rational basis for enacting a law that denies people rights.",

It started out that those rights are rights \"deeply rooted\" in our nations traditions.

Let's assume abortion is a right granted in the constitution...a compelling state interest test still makes no sense to apply to that just like it doesn't make sense to apply to the 2nd amendment, for example. What matters is the meaning of that right...which you can adapt to new technologies or changes in a society (such as the internet for the first amendment freedom of speech).

He was a strong supporter of religious liberty. That is why he sought to keep government from interfering with religion and to prevent any church from claiming a hold on the government. He believed, like his friend Jefferson, that the people are free to practice their faith only when the government is kept out of religion. He did not seek to create a Christian nation. He sought to create a nation where the people would be free to practice their Christian faith and other faiths. He believed that protecting religious liberty would enable Christianity to thrive and to water the tree of republican liberty generally. \n \n You are also right that most of the founders of our nation were men of faith. They were also men of diverse faiths and diverse views about faith. As I have said, many of the men who had significant influences on the creation of the republic and on the constitution were not traditional evangelical Christians, but Deists and people whose faith was shaped by the Enlightenment ideas of the age. The framers were to a large degree believers in reason and science as well as men of faith, and many of them looked to the laws of nature to explain phenomena, not to a God who intervenes directly in people's lives. But they were certainly not hostile to religion. They opposed an established religion, meaning government-sponsored religion and government-sponsored worship. (Note that it was not until the 20th century, well after the ratification of the 14th amendment, that the first amendment ban on established churches was applied to the states. The first amendment originally applied only to the national government, not the state governments, and the old Puritan Church, which became the Congregational Church, remained the established church of Massachusetts well into the 19th century.) \n \n I do not know the extent to which most K-12 public school teachers address the religious influences on the shaping of our republic in their classes, but I suspect that most social studies and history teachers on the K-12 level shy away from teaching about this. I think that's a shame. There is nothing unconstitutional in teaching about religion and its influence on the history of our nation. What is unconstitutional is teaching religion as doctrine in the public schools. \n \n On the college level, I teach a great deal about the influences of religion on American society and culture. I think it is important for our students to learn this.",

   "You are right that Madison was a man of faith, and he believed that the republic would thrive if people were free to worship and practice their faith. He was a strong supporter of religious liberty. That is why he sought to keep government from interfering with religion and to prevent any church from claiming a hold on the government. He believed, like his friend Jefferson, that the people are free to practice their faith only when the government is kept out of religion. He did not seek to create a Christian nation. He sought to create a nation where the people would be free to practice their Christian faith and other faiths. He believed that protecting religious liberty would enable Christianity to thrive and to water the tree of republican liberty generally. \n \n You are also right that most of the founders of our nation were men of faith. They were also men of diverse faiths and diverse views about faith. As I have said, many of the men who had significant influences on the creation of the republic and on the constitution were not traditional evangelical Christians, but Deists and people whose faith was shaped by the Enlightenment ideas of the age. The framers were to a large degree believers in reason and science as well as men of faith, and many of them looked to the laws of nature to explain phenomena, not to a God who intervenes directly in people's lives. But they were certainly not hostile to religion. They opposed an established religion, meaning government-sponsored religion and government-sponsored worship. (Note that it was not until the 20th century, well after the ratification of the 14th amendment, that the first amendment ban on established churches was applied to the states. The first amendment originally applied only to the national government, not the state governments, and the old Puritan Church, which became the Congregational Church, remained the established church of Massachusetts well into the 19th century.) \n \n I do not know the extent to which most K-12 public school teachers address the religious influences on the shaping of our republic in their classes, but I suspect that most social studies and history teachers on the K-12 level shy away from teaching about this. I think that's a shame. There is nothing unconstitutional in teaching about religion and its influence on the history of our nation. What is unconstitutional is teaching religion as doctrine in the public schools. \n \n On the college level, I teach a great deal about the influences of religion on American society and culture. I think it is important for our students to learn this.\n\n \n Bravo Sir!\n \n E pluribus unum, Latin for \"Out of many, one\" makes much more sense (to me) as de facto motto of these, atm, precariously United States.\n \n You sortof have to wonder why we adopted In God We Trust as the official motto in 1956?",

   "& Winston? This one's for you:\n \n \nBut if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation even among people who should and do know better.\n \n \n \nNow, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence of this or that individual writer. But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible. Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step towards political regeneration: so that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional writers. I will come back to this presently, and I hope that by that time the meaning of what I have said here will have become clearer. . . .\n \n Each of these passages has faults of its own, but quite apart from avoidable ugliness, two qualities are common to all of them. The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not. This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of WORDS chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of PHRASES tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house. I list below, with notes and examples, various of the tricks by means of which the work of prose-construction is habitually dodged: . . .\n [*]DYING METAPHORS. A newly-invented metaphor assists thought by evoking a visual image.\n \n [*]OPERATORS, or VERBAL FALSE LIMBS. These save the trouble of picking out appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the same time pad each sentence with extra syllables which give it an appearance of symmetry. \n \n [*]PRETENTIOUS DICTION.\n \n [*]MEANINGLESS WORDS. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different. Statements like MARSHAL P\u00c9TAIN WAS A TRUE PATRIOT, THE SOVIET PRESS IS THE FREEST IN THE WORLD, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS OPPOSED TO PERSECUTION, are almost always made with intent to deceive. Other words used in variable meanings, in most cases more or less dishonestly, are: CLASS, TOTALITARIAN, SCIENCE, PROGRESSIVE, REACTIONARY BOURGEOIS, EQUALITY.. . . As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. . . . \n \n I think the following rules will cover most cases: \n \n (i) Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are \n used to seeing in print. \n \n (ii) Never use a long word where a short one will do. \n \n (iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out. \n \n (iv) Never use the passive where you can use the active. \n \n (v) Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you \n can think of an everyday English equivalent. \n \n (vi) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.These rules sound elementary, and so they are, but they demand a deep change of attitude in anyone who has grown used to writing in the style now fashionable. One could keep all of them and still write bad English, but one could not write the kind of stuff that I quoted in these five specimens at the beginning of this article. \n \n I have not here been considering the literary use of language, but merely language as an instrument for expressing and not for concealing or preventing thought. Stuart Chase and others have come near to claiming that all abstract words are meaningless, and have used this as a pretext for advocating a kind of political quietism. Since you don't know what Fascism is, how can you struggle against Fascism? One need not swallow such absurdities as this, but one ought to recognize that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end. If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. Political language-and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists--is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one's own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase--some JACKBOOT, ACHILLES' HEEL, HOTBED, MELTING POT, ACID TEST, VERITABLE INFERNO or other lump of verbal refuse--into the dustbin where it belongs.\n \n from Politics and the English Language by George Orwell.\n\n \n This one's sortof a more modern day take on some of these things:\n \n << The Onion | February 29, 2008\n http://mobile.theonion.com/content/node/74896\n \n \n If someone were to ask me to summarize 1984 in one sentence it would be this (quoted from above):\n \n (He was) not considering the literary use of language, but merely language as an instrument for expressing and not for concealing or preventing thought.",
