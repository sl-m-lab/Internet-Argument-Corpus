   "It's as if Vietnam's still dogging us. But Pentagon profi know their trade well. Get me right. That's not face to face fighting of things of the sort. I mean information coverage and all that. Pentagon explanations I picked up in the net are that Iraqi fighters have been employing American military know-how from the special American literature. Fancy book wisdom makes Iraqis mighty. I wish I had those books too. LOL. Frankly, I tend to see it differently. I'd rather explain their successes by presence of other Muslim 'brothers' (Albanians from Kosovo, Muslims from Bosnia, Chechens from Russia etc.) helping them. Perhaps our own instructors happened to train some of them earlier. Take those roadside bombs IED. I know that those devices often cause death to many of our servicemen in Iraq. Half of deaths are due to them according to some estimates. I also know that with Chechen fighters IED is the favorite. Get it?",

Get it?\n\n \n Iraqis and the entire Middle East are full of people who are worthless at fighting and winning wars. The United States is a good opponent for these types of people because every 4 years they could pull out of a war, due to the election of a new president. Back to my point, these camel jockeys don't know how to fight and win a war, all they've done is create casualties and fatalities, thats not how wars are won. They haven't changed or adapted their tactics, they have no goals, they have no solid plan of driving the Americans out of the country. Their cause is something that will be meaningless to future generations, they aren't trying to garner the support of the people, their own people are ratting them out.",
