   "The RIAA is coming down pretty hard on dowloaders these days, the end user license agreements for a lot of video games, especially MMORPGs, are designed to make anything ever springing from the game their property. Furthermore, pharmaceuticals patent chemical reactions and copyright chemical materials.\n \n In our information age, I don't think legislation is going to completely stop what is likely the inevitable. However, the abolishment of intellectual property brings up the same fallacy as communism, what is the incentive to do anything?\n \n I was wondering if anyone else was concerned with this and whether or not an alternative could be proposed. It's obvious some advantage must exist to those who write, research, etc. otherwise they wouldn't bother. However, if some other means of subsistence could be made, would it be superior to the current capitalist system?\n \n For the moment, I cannot think of any alternate system that would be as stable as what we have now, but if such a system exists, it should be strived",

   "What would be sensible is to return IP rights to their original purpose - to give the creator a head start. Patents would last for a few years before the tech becomes available to anyone. Books I think should last longer, perhaps copyright expiring with the author, or after 20 years, whichever is longer. Property like films and video games, should have 5 or 10 year copyrights on them, especially video games. There should be some right not to have your work used in offensive ways, perhaps say that it cannot be used in anything that would get a higher film rating than the initial work, for example.",

   "Somewhere between what we have now, and Dzerons idea, there HAS to be a happy medium.\n \n Currently, the IP situation is rediculous. We have a patent attorney on staff because it was cheaper than continually outsourcing the services. In todays America, you apetent EVERYTHING. Every idea you have, you patent it.\n \n The problem with this is that it stifles innovation. Even if you come up with a c oncept and get it to martket, there is a good chance that somehwere out there, there is somebody who has patented the concept, or something similar enough to the actual device to come back and sue you, and they will.\n \n Software patents have gotten completely out of hand, with HP, Microsoft, and IBM turning them out at an incredible rate, thes suing the socks off of anyboyd who may possibly have infringedon their patent. \n \n New ideas do not come to market, becuase people cannot afford the $100,000 + that a patent suit will cost them to defend against.\n \n Personally, I think that patent and IP laws need to be revised so that you cannot patent on overly broad concept (if you should even even be allowed to patent a mere concept). There may be mroe than one way to skin a cat, but you should not be able to patent to concept of feline skinning.\n \n I also think that protection needs to be given for independant original work. People working along smae or similar research lines are often going to come to the same or similar solutions to similar problems. In our current system, the first to come to that solution can be grnted a patent, and others who later arrive at the same solution are SOL since someboyd already owns the patent rights to it, they end up paying royalties. I believe that if you can show that the end result is a product of your own work or research, the original patent should be nullified.\n \n \n We recently went through a patent war with a guy over the design for a digitizing probe for a milling machine. A digitizing probe is basically a button with a stick attached to it (overly simplified, but not as much as you migh think.....I have used a radioshack button with a toothpick superglued to it before). Our probe was designed in house, it was the result of less than an hours work by one of our engineers. I will admit that it was VERY similar to his, but we are not talkign rocket science here. Our engineer just took what he knew about electrical contacts, milling machines, and regular probes, and knocked out a design using well known principals. Realistically, he very well may have won, if he had been able to afford to push the lawsuit (we bankrupted him). This is what the guy had essentially been doing for a living. He patents simplistic ideas, then sues people who come out with new designs that incorporate the simplistic concept he has patented. IP has become such a hot issue anymore that courts and the patent office are reluctant to rule that a given patent contains material that should be obvious to those acquanted with the subject matter.\n \n Another example....we sell a special troch tip to select customers that allows them to use gasoline instead of acetelye for cutting metal. This is not a new concept, it has been around for 100 years. There is a compnay (ironically enough, a chinese company), that has patented the concept now. They have essentially patented the high temperature combustion of gasoline. They sell a whole torch setup for the same purpose, while our product is just a special tip to convert a regular acetelyne torch. It is going to be another patent battle, and likely an expensive one, since they actually have money tyo spend to fight.\n \n These are rediculous IP issues.\n \n As far as the RIAA, I thinkthe DMCA is a crock, and needs revision. Private entities should NOT have the right to obtain search warrants, and if the RIAA is essentially hacking peoples computers, their people shoudl be in jail just like regualr hackers,.\n \n Beyond that, the whole issue of copyright needs to be re-examined and a new solution needs to be found. Witht he prevelance of the internet and P2P programs, the RIAA will not win the battle. Back in the old days when technology was expensive, there was a chance. No more. P2P programs are getting more advanced, and it is no longer a simple matter to track down the physical location of a given user. They need to adapt their tactics. Besides being fruitless, going after 15 yr old kids just makes you look mean/",
