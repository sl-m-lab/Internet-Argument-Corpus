   "What I'm reading in the media is disagreement between Blair and his own party, which will lead to his inability to lead and eventual demands for his resignation.\nWell, he's resigning fairly soon anyway, and Brown probably doesn't want to make the departure a struggle, so may make sure he stays in for a while yet. The demands have already come (from Micheal Howard, leader of the Conservatives) but are unlikely to have any effect. \nWhile this particular instance is especially humiliating to Blair after so many years of commanding almost rubber stamp power, some attribute it to waning popularity due to his stance on Iraq and opposition his policies have generated by gaining the distinction of the UK becoming Bush's lapdog.\nFirstly, it is the impression that the UK is Bush's lapdog that is the problem. I think the facts are more complex, but that idea has certainly influenced both his popular support and his own MPs.\n \n More importantly, I would say this defeat was becuase the MPs know he won't fight the next election and that therefore his authority is dwindling.",

   "I'm a little baffled by Blair's stance in the whole issue. Charles Clarke was gearing up for compromise following consultation with the Torys and Lib Dems (which seemed quite savvy and likely to save face for the Government) but the same day Tony threw his full clout in public behind getting the full 90 day detention clause into law. Now, there are several reasons he might have done this:\n \n 1) He misunderstood the size of the rebellion he was facing and thought the bill would carry through. If this had happened his authority would have been enhanced having given such strong public backing to the position prior to the vote.\n \n 2) He knew how big the rebellion was (quite possible given there was a three line party whip on the vote) but thought lending his personal authority to the matter in a public matter would bring enough rebellious backbenchers to heel to carry the legislation.\n \n 3) Having being through a generally bad patch in terms of his leadership since the invasion of Iraq he thought this was a vote to support because of the public opinion on the matter and backing it received from the Police, hence boosting his popularity.\n \n The likelyhood of defeat seems to have become clear shortly before the vote as evidenced by the recall of several high profile ministers to try sway the rebels. Unfortunately for Blair he has done himself significant damage though his unwillingness to accept Clarke's compromise vote for 28 days detention (which would have passed, as opposed to handing victory to the back bench amendment vote for 28 days) as he has lost his first commons vote (the rebels will be buoyed as they now know they can win if put to fight) he politcised the Police with his arguements (who also loose much face as it was made very clear how much they wanted 90 day detention by the PM) and off course has undermined his authority as leader of the Labour party.\n \n Blairs rejection of sound advice from one of his Ministers reminds me of the situation prior to the invasion of Iraq. The forigen Secretary Jack Straw strongly advised against any UK involvement in Iraq- Blair won that vote using the 45 minute claim but subsequent events have shown what a bad choice going into Iraq was.\n \n At the end of the day for me its the end of the line for Blairs brand of \"I believe this is the right thing to do\" style of politics. Such a style can only take someone so far and eventually facts and reason have to support a position.",

   "From your description, to me it sounds like Blair had as much political capital riding on Iraq being a cakewalk as did Bush.\n\n \n Absolutely- Blair knew public opinion would be less generous and shorter lived in the UK than Bush enjoyed in the US so yes, he must have hoped for a \"quick and clean\" war. His judgement on this issue has recently been criticised in a most public manner by Sir Christopher Meyer (Britain's former Washington ambassador) in his memoirs. He said Blair basically got caught up by the \"lets go to war\" agenda of the Bush Administration and neglected the counsel of his own advisors about the effect of going into Iraq on British interests.\n \n \nHaving followed the extended IRA campaign, I was surprised when UK citizens initially supported the Iraq action. I'd think the recent London bombings would have brought any reasonable politician not completely bought, if any remain, to abandoning Blair's ship.\n\n \n Well Big Bear Scot has already covered most of what I would have responded with here. I recall support was low for the war in the run up but became higher once the UK was clearly committed due to \"support our troops\" sentiments. This has since evaporated as evidenced by the performance of the Labour party in subsequent elections (at local and national levels) where they have lost considerable support.\n \n \nThe cost of 90-day detention would become very expensive on financial and then political levels. It would broadcast UK intent to direct expansion of committed resources to combat Islamic extremists. Police have to be mortified as they planned commands similar to those in our (US) new Homeland Security bureaucracy, $50-billion right out the gate.\n\n \n I think we might hear quite alot about the Police's involvement in 90 day detention laws over the next few days/weeks ;)\n \n \nHow long before you would expect a change in leadership? Any policy decisions coming up in the near future that have ramification similar to the dentention issue?\n\n \n Blair and his supporters keep giving ambiguous signals on this issue- he has been clear in stating he will stand down as leader before the next election, but the timing of this is uncertain. Sometimes we hear him saying he will serve a full third term, but I also struggle to see him doing so as Brown will need time to assert his authority over the party and establish himself as the new leader in the public eye prior to a very challenging General Election.\n \n Could further defeats hasten Blair departure? difficult to say- here the fragile unity between Brown and Blair will be key as Brown could challenge Blair at anytime before the next election if he so chose. Blair winning such a contest would be a loose-loose result for the Labour Party. If Blair does suffer further defeats on legislation Brown's position will strengthen and his supporters will extert ever more pressure on Blair to step aside. Would Blair be prepared do so 2-3 years before the next election? if not then an open contest could be on the cards intsead of a dignified exit (a thing that Blair wants- he does not want to end his leadership as Margaret Thatcher did hers).\n \n There are a number of pieces of legislation that are coming up that will test Blair considerably- the various terror bills have to stand the test of the House of Lords and some measures are still to be debated and voted on and there is key manifesto material on education and health are likely to be controversial with elements of his party.\n \n All in all Blair is in for the most testing time of hs Premiership- his own position is on the line in a way it has not been previously.",
