Basically I would think that the funeral should be in a cemetary and the cemetary should have rules about protesting, and the government should have no part in outlawing protesting. I thought that she was an idiot in the video, but so were the 2 people \"interviewing\" her, if you can call it that. They brought her on the show to publically embarrass her and if that's what passes for news at fox it's a good thing I don't watch Fox News. They came in asking \"how dare you...\" as the first question, this is not an interview.\n \n But she came in with an agenda too. She was going to say that no matter what they asked her. So both sides said what they were going to, regardless of what the other said, so I guess both sides won. She got her messege out (I hope no one actually entertained it) and they got a face with which to criticize and embarrass.\n \n But on the issue, her ideas are disgusting, the cemetary really should have taken some action. But the state has no right to legislate away the Constitution.",
