   "Two and a half million dollars later, a study on the efficacy of prayer--the largest ever conducted--showed that it had no positive effects whatsoever on cardiac patients. In fact, one group being prayed for showed adverse, negative effects. \n \n http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-prayer31mar31,1,3169049.story?coll=la-headlines-nation\n \n The study was conducted to determine the validity of claims by many Christians over the years that intercessory prayer was scientifically proven to be beneficial. Skeptics now can point to this study, which for $2.5 million, is at least worth something. \n \n But for most, it was a huge waste of money. Common sense tells us that when people are in need, whether it be large or small, the worst thing to do in response is to close one's eyes and fold one's hands.",
