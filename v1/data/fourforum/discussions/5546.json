Still, if I was the admin, I would contact his ISP and have his serviced revoked for harrasment. I'd love to see his face when he has to explain to his mum and dad why their internet service was cut off.\n \n lol. Still, if he had any real brains, he'd merely run it through a series of proxies. Starting alot of new posts with his forum name doesn't help either.",

He goes there and jams up their workings by somehow bypassing a \"email address required\" function. He's used screen names such as: God, The Lord, Ged, bill, The Only one...and my favorite: Just Curious. (notice the loving way he sees me!!?) \n \n His posts there are EXACTLY the same, word for word as they are here, with a personal touch. He even personally attacks the site moderator as well.",
