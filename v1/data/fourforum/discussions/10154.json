   "If you watched the Democratic Debate on CNN using YouTube to ask the questions then please respond here.\n \n Did you 1) like the format and 2) Like the questions.\n \n I personally thought it was an embarrassment to see the questions posed.\n\n \n I didn't necessarily mind the format, although I think one could hardly call it a debate. When one looks over our history, the suggestion that a format of \"one minute responses and 30 second rebuttals\" and \"raise your hand if you did...\" constitutes a grueling and informative debate is quite laughable.\n \n I think in the upcoming election we should find an individual who really, really, really does NOT want to be President, and then force him (or her) to be President. I would also support this method of selection for all the Senators and Representatives in Congress as well.\n \n As for the questions: the ones I saw were mostly stupid. For example, there was a question asking the candidates to tell us who their favorite teacher was. Who cares, and how is that relevant anyway? And another example: \"What are you going to do to standardize voting?\" Well, considering that the Constitution places this squarely in the hands of the States, a President really cannot do anything about it. Yet another irrelevant (and actually, quite stupid) question.\n \n After hearing such ridiculous nonsense, its no wonder to me that we are in the mess we are in as a political system.",

   "Truly pathetic, moronic questions, moronic answers. No-fly zones over darfur? I can't believe after the Iraq fiasco a single one of them thinks this is a good idea. Trying to get China to act by threatening to boycott their olympics? They aren't serious about it. And its the worst excuse for an olympics boycott I ever heard, \"Yeh, we'd really like to go bomb those muslims in Darfur, but we've kind of got our hands full killing iraqis, so china, you better do something about it for us!\"\n \n Kucinich and Gravel I found least offensive, Obama somewhat moderate and Hilary is disgusting. Bill Richardson is also pretty good generally, but he didn't get much of a chance to show his differences in this debate, largely because of the stupidity of the questions and tendency to give the preordained frontrunners maximum airtime.\n \n This is the kind of policy you see emerging;\n 1) Talk about getting out of Iraq and how its the fault of republicans, but don't actually do anything about it\n \n 2) Institute no-fly zones over Darfur, block imports of goods and services to the people there (or maybe don't bother, depends how much the public cares by the time they reach office, probably not very much, so it's just a talking point to illustrate how much they \"care\" about people).\n \n 3) Pursue a largely unspoken domestic policy of socialisation and expansion of government - it will be difficult to match Bush's efforts here, but you can be sure they will try. Direct blame to china for declining living standards and institute protectionist tariffs to the benefit of their domestic corporate benefactors.\n \n Well there you go America, enjoy another 4 crappy years of lying XXXXXX leading your country. If you're lucky you'll get someone who'll shut down guantanamo, but that's about the best you can hope for. God forbid there be another terrorist attack, or you can forget about that too.\n \n The Republicans are no better, in fact they're largely a lot worse, but they have no chance of winning with a pro-war candidate (and every so-called \"leading\" republican candidate is aiming to be as pro-iraq-war as possible).",

   "I really didn't want this to be about the quality of the candidates but more about the format of the debate using YouTube.\n \n You can see the questions here: http://www.youtube.com/debates\n \n I mean just look at the first \"question\" (really an introduction)...if that guy is representing America then we might as well pack it up now. Perhaps a few more \"air quotes\" and another reference to \"bush\" would make \"cool\" enough to be the next \"president\". Pff, what an idiot.\n \n What about this question: Are you a \"liberal?\"\n \n This one is a laugh....yes they are liberal, way to pay attention.\n \n And of course the most pressing issue of our day: \"Will Americans give reparations for slavery?\"\n \n This one is just embarrassing. How many people in this country were once slaves? I'd say about 0 unless they are 160yrs old. The guy that asked this question should get off his lazy a$$ and work for a living and stop waiting for government handouts.\n \n Other questions were in a musical format or some other attempt at being creative.

While I said it was not a requirement you clearly can see the result of such a debate as seen last night.\n\n Just because there is a debate, that doesn't make it a rational debate. :( \n \n Political debates of this sort are rarely based fully on rational reasons but on political tactics and sound bites. Politicians have the unenviable task of trying to please everyone, or at least most of their constituency, so they cannot be as honest as they may like to be. Also, unfortunately, recently, people seem to be more swayed by sound bites than by fully expounded reasoning.\n \n Nevertheless, I continue to hope that the decisions of politicians behind the scenes once in office are based on more real discussion and reasoning than one sees in these \"debates\".",
