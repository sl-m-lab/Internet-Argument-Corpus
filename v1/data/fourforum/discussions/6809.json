   "Do you have a rare or unique way to cook steaks?\n \n Try this:\n \n Steal a 10 to 12 oz filet. (Mine come from a meat supplier that provides to most of the finer restuarants in the southeast.)\n \n Prepare a relatively hot (7 on a 10 scale) mesquit chacoal fire, about 3 brickettes high all over the grill. Let all brickettes become \"ashed\".\n \n Top grill with a cast iron slotted grill similar to what you might find on the top of a Franklin wood burning stove. Let the cast iron get hot. (The piece I use is about 1.5 inches high, raising the meat a bit from the hot fire.)\n \n Cook steak about 2 minutes per side on the top, bottom and four sides...letting the slotted cast iron put burn marks on the meat. Continue to cycle rotations, turning the steak 90deg from the original burn so the burn lines form squares on the meat, being careful not to let the meat roll off the grill. Continue to cook in this manner until you think the steak is rare in the center only.\n \n Remove from grill. Butterfly into two steaks. (I use a razor-sharp rocker cutter for this.) You should have two pieces of meat that are rare on one side and in the center only. If too rare, simply cook a bit more with the rare side down.\n \n Feed one side to the dog. Eat the other after doucing with fresh ground pepper, fresh ground sea salt, a smidgeon of Goya Adobo (green cap) seasoning and a tblsp of Worcestershire Sauce or Dale's seasoning. (Unless you're a purist and don't want much seasoning...in this case, stop after the salt and pepper.)",

   "You just ruined a perfectly nice piece of meat. \n All you need to do is sprinkle with salt and cracked pepper. Sear it good on both sides and cook until just warmed through (I like my meat rare). Meanwhile while it's cooking, reduce some balsalmic vinegar, sugar and a few herbs to a syrupy thickness.\n Now when the steaks are done..Plate them and drizzle the reduction over them(not a lot, but just enough to get the flavour of the syrup. Put more on the side, if you want) and sprinkle just a bit of blue cheese on top. Serve with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and a nice spring salad. Top the meal off with a really smooth and silky Chocolate Mousse.\n \n Very simple..yet elegant and delicious.\n \n If you have a really nice piece of meat like a filet you shouldn't have to do much to it.",
