   "Recent events in Egypt, Jordan, and Yemen are poking some pretty major holes in our middle eastern policy. Granted, the events there could be seen as a victory for the Bush doctrine since he did believe that if we installed a vibrant democracy in the middle east that other nations there would turn to democracy as well. I don't think ANYBODY would describe Iraq as a \"vibrant\" democracy, though, and I don't think he was actually thinking that we would see all our allies brought down like this. \n \n I am not sure that I like the way Obama is handling the situation in Egypt. Granted it is a delicate situation. We have been paying egypt billions of dollars a year to be friendly to Israel, and for the last 30 years the only reason that has worked is that we had a dictator sitting in Egypt that we bought and paid for. The danger in supporting him now, when popular opinion is obviously overwhelmingly against him, is that if he ends up overthrown and we support him now, it will be Iran all over again where they find the most anti american zealots they can to replace the guy. Already it seems almost certain that the government that replaces his will NOT be nearly as friendly to the US as his has been, and CERTAINLY not as friendly to Israel.\n \n Frankly I think that we need to re-asses our meddling in other nations. We pushed for Palestinian elections that nobody wanted. The Israelis did not want them, the Palestinians did not want them, we forced them, and Hamas was elected. Then we end up in the ridiculous situation of having to try to broker peace while refusing to deal with one side because we claim they are illegitimate, despite the fact that they were elected in elections that we forced them to have. \n \n I do not disagree that democracy is the best form of government. I just dont believe that we should be trying to hand freedom out like a door prize, and I think we need to have UNIVERSAL standards when it comes to our foreign policy. Supporting a dictator in Egypt and Jordan (regardless of what they call themselves) because we are buying friends for Israel, while at the same time actively working to overthrow dictators and spread democracy in other parts of the world is a foolish policy. In fact, a lot of Israels problems would be solved if we would either force them to become more democratic by letting people in the occupied territories VOTE, or if we just left them alone and let them be destroyed. Either way, problem solved. \n \n What I DO think is asinine is the backpedaling that the US is doing now. It is pathetic that the US president is getting up there now and saying \"we have been giving this guy billions of dollars a year for 30 years, but we have been telling him all that time that he would have to make democratic reforms...\" That is sickeningly pathetic. We supported a tyrant for 30 years with exactly ZERO reform on his part. Trying to pretend now that it was all a plan to someday see a free and democratic Egypt is just sad.",

This whole supporting one party over another, etc is not how we operate with Europe or other countries.\n\n \n Yes and no. For the most part the US has done an excellent job of supporting the \"right\" tyrants to keep the ME stable for the last decade or so. Really, if you look at the ME and what has been done there, it is amazing that the place has not vanished under a bunch of mushroom clouds. \n \n IMO, what is going on there is going to have serious long term implications for the ME, and especially US policy and power in the ME. Thus far US interests have not done well when Arabs vote. There was recently a leak from the white house that Obama was backing an immediate resignation by Mubarak followed by a transitional government led by the current vice president. IMMEDIATELY egyptian opposition leaders started stating that they will no support ANY plan the US puts forth or supports. \n \n I have been saying this for years. You can go back and look at my posts here going back several years and see. If you support the death and oppression of millions of people, they WILL NOT LIKE YOU. We have supported a tyrant in Egypt for 30 years...helped keep him in power. Now US politicians are acting confused and are \"concerned\" that the replacement government MIGHT be anti-US. It makes me want to grab them, shake them, and yell \"OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE ANTI US YOU RETARD\". \n \n Who are these XXXXXX???? All I am saying is that if you want people to like you, supporting tyrants who spend their time screwing said people is NOT a good first step. \n \n We all saw the blowback in Iran. It will be interesting to see what happens as other ME nations depose their own US backed tyrants.",
