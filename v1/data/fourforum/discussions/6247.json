   "hey guys. this question interested me and i wondered what youre take on it was. \n Does evolution prove there is no God?\n \n No. Many people, from evolutionary biologists to important religious figures like Pope John Paul II, contend that the time-tested theory of evolution does not refute the presence of God. They acknowledge that evolution is the description of a process that governs the development of life on Earth. Like other scientific theories, including Copernican theory, atomic theory, and the germ theory of disease, evolution deals only with objects, events, and processes in the material world. Science has nothing to say one way or the other about the existence of God or about people's spiritual beliefs.\n \n (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat01.html#Q11)",

Natural selection for example is in part a law as, in its simplest form, it can be mathematically proven. Theories are too complex to ever be proven mathematically though, so they remain theories.

   "Clive is right. In science, theory is as good as it gets. Sometimes the creationists like to pretend that if evolutionary theory had any merit, then it would somehow graduate to a \"fact\" or a \"law.\" And that is the mindset that SkepticGrunt is buying into. It is also an inversion of reality.\n \n For a creationist, any scientific idea that contradicts a selective interpretation of the Bible (it isn't really a literal reading - mention 4 legged grasshoppers or bats as birds and you'll see) is lumped into the creationist idea of \"evolution.\" Thus, the big bang theory becomes \"evolution,\" planetary physics becomes \"evolution,\" geology becomes \"evolution,\" paleontology becomes \"evolution,\" and even objectionable parts of archaeology become \"evolution.\" Attempts to try to educate creationists draw responses about some imagined \"general theory of evolution.\" Requests for a simple statement of the theory or the tenets of the theory are usually met with responses of how the creationist has spent years studying \"evolution\" and how you must somehow be stupid not to know what it is. Trying to explain to them that in science the theory of evolution is about hereditary changes in populations of organisms over time get responses about how that is just \"variation in kind\" or some other unexplained term.\n \n And, of course, for a creationist a theory is a wild guess; speculation based on wishful thinking. Thus, they can talk with a straight face about theories of creation or theories of ID. Attempts to explain the meaning of \"theory\" in a scientific context only mean that you are trying to force them to accept your opinion, followed by quotes from various and sundry dictionaries with the definition of theory. Thus creationists claim, also with a straight face, that evolution is \"just a theory\" because if it had been \"proven\" it would be a fact or a law. Upside down again.\n \n But science and scientists define a theory as a set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena. Untested, such sets of statements are called hypotheses. But hypotheses and theories are predictive, and once tested, as most theories have been repeatedly by experimentation, theories are accepted. Many theories have been so well tested that most scientists consider it foolish not to accept them until some data is found to show that they are wrong. The problem is that any new theory, in order to be accepted, must better explain the whole of the theory that it replaces (relativity v. Newtonian physics). In the case of the theory of evolution, that isn't likely to happen since there is no research on the horizon that is making a beginning in such work. And the task is prodigious, since evolutionary theory now involves not only simple biology and cladistics, but paleontology, archaeology, molecular biology, microbiology, agriculture science, medicine, virology, bacteriology, genetics, animal husbandry, population genetics, wildlife management, ecology, and on and on. On that level, scientists consider the theory of evolution to be factual. It is the best, indeed, there are no other, explanations for the observations of the changes in populations of animals over time.\n \n So the theory of evolution explains the empirical observations of evolution (facts) that conform to the definition of evolution. That definition was actually formulated during the 1930s and 1940s when Mendelian genetics was joined with Darwinian evolution. It is known as the modern synthetic theory or the modern synthesis, or neo-Darwinism.\n \n So, yep. Evolution is a fact that is explained by the theory. It is both fact and theory.\n \n For anyone interested, Stephen Jay Gould wrote an essay on the question that appeared in Discover magazine in May, 1981. It has since been republished in a the collection of Gould's essays, Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes and since in other places, including on the net.\n \n Evolution as Fact and Theory",

Stated simply, scientific theories do not grow up to be laws. In fact, scientific laws make up part of the structure of ideas upon which theories are built. Scientific laws are statements of blind, unbroken, natural regularities. I already gave the definition of a scientific law in another post: a statement that describes invariable relationships among phenomena under a specified set of conditions.\n \nfor alot of poeple its still balogna!\nAnd a lot of people are ignorant and scientifically illiterate.

Your claim is meaningless unless you can come up with specific examples.

And if finding evidence that contradicts an idea were actually important to you, then you would have abandoned creationism long ago.\n \nso how is this possible to be a law but your same belief conradicts it??\nExplained that.
