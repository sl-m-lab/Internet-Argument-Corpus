   "My dictionary defines the Sabbath as, 1. the seventh-day of the week, Saturday, devoted to worship and rest from work in Judaism and in certain Christian Churches. 2. Sunday, observed by Christians as the day of worship and rest from work in commemoration of Christ's Resurrection.\n \n Is it possible to use the Bible as our only source and get a 'Sunday Sabbath' from it? If not, then WHY do mainstream Christians comply with the second dictionary definition of 'Sabbath' and ignore 7th-day observance but adhere to 1st-day observance? Please, the Bible only.\n\n It is scriptural to worship on Sunday. The earliest Christians, who were also holding on to their Judaism to a certain degree, kept the Sabbath by going to temple to study and hear about scripture on Saturday. Then on Sunday, they met for the Lord's Supper to remember him. The Lord's Day is the fulfillment of the Sabbath for it is the day of the Resurrection, the guarantee of eternal rest.\n \n Acts 20:7 \"On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread...\" What was this breaking of the bread? It was the celebration of the Eucharist, as commanded by Jesus in memory of him. It was the early form of worship.\n \n 1 Corinthians 16:2 Sunday offerings-- \"On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that contributions need not be made when I come.\" \n \n It may also be of note that John \"was in the Spirit on the Lord's day\" when he received the Revelation which he penned. Revelation 1:10\n \n Furthermore, Jesus kept the Sabbath but Jesus also broke the Sabbath. In Mark 2: 23-27  the disciples broke the Sabbath by plucking grain. Jesus replied to accusations by the Pharisees thus, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath; so the Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.\" Just after this Jesus breaks the Sabbath by healing a man (Mark 3:2-5). Also John 5:10-18, \"This was why the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God.\" See also, John 9:16  and John 7:23. Now, did Jesus truly break the Sabbath? If it is a sin to break the Sabbath and Jesus was without sin then did he break it? No, he more truthfully followed it. He said that he did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. So Jesus was teaching that the Pharisees were being hypocrites with all of their outward worship while at the same time having impure hearts and impure actions toward their brothers. (At any rate Jesus was God so he could change the Sabbath if he wanted to). \n \n But just because God in the form of Jesus has this power, do others, does the Church? Do we have the authority to change the day to our convenience? Let's go to Paul's writings and see. Colossians 2:16-17: \"Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.\" In terms of which day of the week to observe on, \"One man esteems one day as better than another, while another man esteems all days alike. Let every one be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord.\" (Romans 14:5-6) See also the verses I referenced above concerning the breaking of the bread and the Lord's day.\n \n So we see that Jesus changed the Sabbath. The apostolic Church changed laws of God including circumcision (Acts 15). Paul wrote that one must set aside a time to honor God but the day that one does this is not important. Finally, by looking at the writings of the early Church Fathers-men who walked with the apostles-one can see that Sunday was the day of worship. Sunday was mentioned by name and it was also mentioned clearly that the Sabbath was no longer binding (see the website provided below). Although early Christians probably kept the Sabbath and during the same time worshipped on Sunday with the breaking of the bread, the Church changed from the Sabbath for three probable reasons: 1.to honor the Resurrection 2. rejection of Christians by Judaism 3.To distinguish Christianity from Judaism.\n \n Only one church, the Catholic Church, had the power to change the Sabbath. Not because it is the \"Catholic\" Church but because this authority was given to the Church by Christ himself. \"And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" (Matthew 16:18-20) You can see the authority of the Church illustrated in scripture at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15  (as I mentioned above). Here Gentiles were released from having to follow the law of circumcision. This was an everlasting command of God. How then does the Church change the law of God?\n \n How then can the Church deny the original Sabbath? It does so by the authority given it by Christ. \n \n A rigid observance of the Sabbath is for Judaism. The New Sabbath must be viewed in the New Law of Jesus, not the Old Law. The Sabbath/Sunday is for God. We owe him reverence on that day. It is also for man. It is for our leisure, enjoyment, and rest--a gift from God.",

I don't know when they quit doing so in Ireland.\n \n When a non-Jew becomes a Christian they are grafted onto the Tree of Life--in place of the unbelieveing Jews who were pruned off.",

   "in the OT they did worship on Saturday, they had a LOT of laws, many of which men made up. There is some controversy as to whether Jesus violated those laws, I think when he performed miracles and also once when the disciples picked grain on Sunday (Mark2:23-28) In Mark Jesus' disciples were violating the Pharisees' detailed rules regarding Sabbath rest. God's law did forbid working on the Sabbath, but Jewish traditions defined work with stifling legalism. The Pharisees considered it wrong even to pluck a it of grain and rub it in one's hand before eating ti. In their opinion, theses actions constituted reaping and threshing. Yet God intended Sabbath-keeping to be a blessing not a burden (\"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.)\n I think the main reasons for worshiping on Sat. were 1) when God created the world (Genesis 1) he rested on the seventh day (the seventh day is Sat.), 2) b/c that's how it was commanded in the Ten Commandments\n \n \nSabbath - The day of rest, considered holy to God by His rest on the seventh day after creation and viewed as a sign of the covenant relation between God and His people and of the eternal rest He has promised them.\n \n Old Testament - The word sabbath comes from the Hebrew shabbat, meaning \"to cease\" or \"desist.\" The primary meaning is that of cessation from all work. Some people have traced the origin of the concept to the Babylonian calendar which contained certain days, corresponding to phases of the moon, in which kings and priests could not perform their official functions. Such days bore an evil connotation, and work performed on them would have harmful effects. The fifteenth of the month, the time of the full moon in their lunar calendar, was shapattu, the \"day of pacifying the heart\" (of the god) by certain ceremonies.\n \n Although one can show similarities to the Babylonian concept, the Hebrew sabbath did not follow a lunar cycle. It was celebrated every seven days and became basic to the recognition and worship of the God of creation and redemption. Regulations concerning the sabbath are a main feature of the Mosaic laws. Both reports of the Ten Commandments stated that the sabbath belonged to the Lord. On six days the Israelite's should work, but on the seventh, they as well as all slaves, foreigners, and beasts must rest. Two reasons are given. The first is that God rested on the seventh day after creation, thereby making the day holy (Es. 8-11). The second was a reminder of their redemption from slavery in Egypt (Deut. 5:12-15).\n The day became a time for sacred assembly and worship (Lev. 23:1-3), a token of their covenant with God (Ex. 31:12-17; Ezek. 20:12-20). Death was the penalty for desecration (Ex. 35:1-3). The true observance of not following one's own pursuits on that day would lift a person to God's holy mountain and bring spiritual nourishment (Isa 56:1-7; 58:13), but failure to keep the sabbath would bring destruction to their earthly kingdom (Neh. 13:15-22; Jer. 17:21-27).\n \n Interbilical - The sabbath became the heart of the law, and the prohibitions were expanded. Thirty-nine tasks were banned, such as tying or untying a knot. These in turn were extended until ingenious evasions were devised that lost the spirit but satisfied the legal requirement.\n \n New Testament - The habit of Jesus was to observe the sabbath as a day of worship in the synagogues (Luke 4:16), but His failure to comply with the minute restrictions brought conflict (Mark 2:23-28; 3:1-6; Luke 13:10-17; John 5:1-18). At first, Christians also met on the sabbath with the Jews in the synagogues to proclaim Christ (Acts 13:14). Their holy day, the day that belonged especially to the Lord, was the first day of the week, the day of resurrection (Matt. 28:1; Acts 20:7; Rev. 1:10). They viewed the sabbath and other matters of the law as a shadow of the reality which had now been revealed (Col. 2:16-23), and the sabbath became a symbol of the heavenly rest to come (Heb. 4:1-11).\n \n Barbara J.

   "Doesn't make a bit of differnce.\n \n As far as the Jewish religion is concerned, the Sabbath that the Jews celebrate is just for the Jews. That is not one of the requirements for non-jews. If non-Jews want to observe a holy day , or not, that is just their path to god, and their business. The Sabbath, as written in the Torah, is just a rule that the Jews require for themselves.\n\n \n Well, wonder of wonders; something we agree on.",

   "[QUOTE=maximus;166865]It is scriptural to worship on Sunday. The earliest Christians, who were also holding on to their Judaism to a certain degree, kept the Sabbath by going to temple to study and hear about scripture on Saturday. Then on Sunday, they met for the Lord's Supper to remember him. The Lord's Day is the fulfillment of the Sabbath for it is the day of the Resurrection, the guarantee of eternal rest.\n \n The Sabbath isn't something that is to be fulfilled.\n \n Isn't eternal rest death?\n \n \n \nActs 20:7 \"On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread...\" What was this breaking of the bread? It was the celebration of the Eucharist, as commanded by Jesus in memory of him. It was the early form of worship.\n\n \n Agape. The love feast.\n \n \n1 Corinthians 16:2 Sunday offerings-- \"On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that contributions need not be made when I come.\"\n \n \n Contributions to whom?\n \n \n \nIt may also be of note that John \"was in the Spirit on the Lord's day\" when he received the Revelation which he penned. Revelation 1:10\n\n \n It is better if it is not of note.\n \n \nFurthermore, Jesus kept the Sabbath but Jesus also broke the Sabbath. In Mark 2: 23-27  the disciples broke the Sabbath by plucking grain. Jesus replied to accusations by the Pharisees thus, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath; so the Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.\" Just after this Jesus breaks the Sabbath by healing a man (Mark 3:2-5). Also John 5:10-18, \"This was why the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God.\" See also, John 9:16  and John 7:23. Now, did Jesus truly break the Sabbath? If it is a sin to break the Sabbath and Jesus was without sin then did he break it? No, he more truthfully followed it. He said that he did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. So Jesus was teaching that the Pharisees were being hypocrites with all of their outward worship while at the same time having impure hearts and impure actions toward their brothers. (At any rate Jesus was God so he could change the Sabbath if he wanted to). \n\n \n Father and Son do not imply equality, but one being superior to the other or subordinate. \n \n Jesus didn't break the Sabbath. I am confused why you say he did to make a point and then say he really didn't to make a point. Otherwise the last half is right, except the Jesus could change if he wanted to part.\n \n \nBut just because God in the form of Jesus has this power, do others, does the Church? Do we have the authority to change the day to our convenience? \n\n \n He didn't and wouldn't and couldn't.\n \n No.\n \n \nLet's go to Paul's writings and see. Colossians 2:16-17: \"Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.\"\n \n \n Yes, Paul had a lot of new ideas about what should and shouldn't be. \n \n \nIn terms of which day of the week to observe on, \"One man esteems one day as better than another, while another man esteems all days alike. Let every one be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord.\" (Romans 14:5-6) See also the verses I referenced above concerning the breaking of the bread and the Lord's day.\n\n \n Is this really speaking about dropping the Sabbath?\n \n \nSo we see that Jesus changed the Sabbath. \n\n \n We don't see that.\n \n \nThe apostolic Church changed laws of God including circumcision (Acts 15). \n\n \n They gave the Gentiles a watered down version of Judaism in order for Paul to get converts.\n \n \nPaul wrote that one must set aside a time to honor God but the day that one does this is not important. \n\n \n It was to God and the Jews.\n \n \nFinally, by looking at the writings of the early Church Fathers-men who walked with the apostles-one can see that Sunday was the day of worship.\n \n \n Such as?\n \n \nSunday was mentioned by name and it was also mentioned clearly that the Sabbath was no longer binding (see the website provided below).\n\n \n \n I don't see a website below.\n \n \nAlthough early Christians probably kept the Sabbath and during the same time worshipped on Sunday with the breaking of the bread, the Church changed from the Sabbath for three probable reasons: 1.to honor the Resurrection 2. rejection of Christians by Judaism 3.To distinguish Christianity from Judaism.\n\n \n 3 would be the correct answer.\n \n \nOnly one church, the Catholic Church, had the power to change the Sabbath. Not because it is the \"Catholic\" Church but because this authority was given to the Church by Christ himself.\n \n \n God would not put man in a position to overrule his decision. Maybe going forward man can choose, but not to undo what God has already done.\n \n \n\"And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" (Matthew 16:18-20)\n\n \n What Church did Peter build? We are familiar with what Paul built but I am not familiar with anything created by Peter.\n \n \nYou can see the authority of the Church illustrated in scripture at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15  (as I mentioned above). Here Gentiles were released from having to follow the law of circumcision. This was an everlasting command of God. How then does the Church change the law of God?\n \n\n \n The Jerusalem Church was very different from Paul's.\n \n Gentiles weren't obligated to be circumcised how can then can they be released? \n \n This was a command of James and if from God why was it only Gentiles? \n \n The covenant was not with Gentiles to begin with. Where does God say it is everlasting? The Sabbath he says is to be forever, but nothing everlasting with regards to Gentiles and circumcision.\n \n \nHow then can the Church deny the original Sabbath? It does so by the authority given it by Christ. \n\n \n It did so because it wanted to differentiate itself from Judaism. If it ever had the authority it had been long lost.\n \n \nA rigid observance of the Sabbath is for Judaism.\n\n \n Isn't that what Jesus was saying isn't right?\n \n \nThe New Sabbath must be viewed in the New Law of Jesus, not the Old Law. The Sabbath/Sunday is for God. We owe him reverence on that day. It is also for man. It is for our leisure, enjoyment, and rest--a gift from God.\n\n \n Why must it be viewed in the new Law of Jesus? As far as I can tell Jesus was saying the problem was with man not the Sabbath.",
