   "Texas Rep. Leo Berman Revives Fear Of Sharia With Bill That Would Ban 'Religious Or Cultural Law'\n \n Texas state Rep. Leo Berman (R), a lawmaker best known for his anti-Obama rhetoric and legislative proposal, has turned his eyes on a new risk -- the creeping threat of \"religious or cultural law,\" and perhaps most importantly, Sharia.\n \n Berman's legislation would mandate that \"A court of this state may not enforce, consider, or apply any religious or cultural law.\" Though it includes no direct mention of \"Sharia,\" a subsequent interview would suggest that Berman, like other Republicans such as Nevada GOP Senate candidate Sharron Angle, maintains some unwarranted fear that Islamic law is cropping up in America.\" \n Can't wait to see the frantic backpeddling this sumbitch does when he realizes the full import of his \"non-specific\" wording.. \n \n Yahoo!",
