I just can't stand it when people try to turn this \"tragedy\" into something more than it really is. This was simply a case of drunk driving and it's all too often deadly consequences. The driver was drunk, the passengers got in with him, 3 stupid people dead...case closed. \n \n It seems that people want to blame everyone except the actual people who are to blame. ~No...it couldn't have been the princess, or Dodi, or the driver's fault...they couldn't have been responsible for this tragic turn of events, it was the father...yeah that's it, the father...after all, he let them take the family car out...yeah, blame him~ Give me a break. \n \n This, especially in the US, is an alarming look at the growing denial of self-responsibility seen today. We always want to blame someone aside from the victims. Sometimes there is a legitimate claim, more often than not it is simply not wanting to place blame on the victim simply because they are \"victims\". Look at Katrina. Few people want to recognize or admit that the majority of the \"victims\" were victims simply because they failed to get out of the way of the massive Cat. 5 storm bearing down on the city. Now I'm no weather man, but if you tell me a Cat. 5 storm is coming towards my house, I'm leaving. I don't care if I have to walk, I'm leaving. Now granted, there were true victims in NO who could not get out on their own, and my heart goes out to them. But probably more than 90% of the people that had to be rescued of the roof of their homes, or marched through the water to trash the superdome were more than capable of getting out on their own. They however found it more prudent to attempt to ride the storm out in their homes (below sea level in a city surrounded by water). Then they have the audacity to whine and complain when they are not rescued fast enough. Had these people actually taken responsibility for themselves, the majority of these people would not have needed to be rescued in the first place.

They were then killed, their heads cut from their bodies. \n How could that killer with his hands in British blood come here just as a peaceful tourist escaping all those sophisticated gadgets designed to bar such monsters from Britain? That's a baffling mystery indeed but for... I'm sure Ahmadov is a MI-6 agent. That's it. MI-6 just let him in just the way they allowed in here that criminal Berezovsky. They say the man's brain was behind those \"smart\" schemes to kidnap hostages in Chechnya. But even in my worst nightmare I wouldn't see that killers of Ahmadov like ever welcomed in London by our intelligence services! That's beyond any limits and needs an in-depth probe by Gordon Brown imo. I wonder for how long he is going cover the crimes of MI-6.\n\n \n \n Oh goody away we go again.\n \n The whole tenor of the thread quoted above looks suspiciously like other strange threads which appear every so often",
