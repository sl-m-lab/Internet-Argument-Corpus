   "What has had the most influence around the world in promoting American values , American media and arts( especially Hollywood) or American military power?\n I say Media and arts.\n\n \n I agree with you that the exportation of our pop culture has most influenced the world. More so than our Military might for sure. But unfortunately, that isn't necessarily a good or positive thing at all. Being of middle eastern descent myself, and having relatives who have lived through out the middle east, I have heard first hand reports going back decades of why foreign relatives and friends would never allow their wives or daughters to read American fashion Mags, watch our TV or Movies, or even have American female friends because of the low morals we display for all the world to see. \n \n Many foreign Countries consider us to be a shameless, reprobate Country which satisfies our every narcissistic desire without conscience or consideration of the consequences. And you know what? They are absolutely right in most all of their criticisms of what this Country represents, morally speaking today. It is absolutely true that when we aren't flaunting irresponsible sex and debauchery in our movies and TV shows, then we are promoting violence and every possible way to kill each other that can be imagined in the mind of man. \n \n I believe that with great blessings comes great responsibility. And America has lost our way as we have become hedonists and self serving brats who seek only to satisfy our own lusts without real concern for the other 9/10ths of the Planet that is starving to death. :(",
