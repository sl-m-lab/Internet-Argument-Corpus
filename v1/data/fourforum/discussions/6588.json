   "Resolved: Global warming&#8217;s primary cause is human activity\n \n First up, the customary thank you's. I'd like to thank my opponent, JPSartre12, for agreeing to the debate; Kronus, daewoo, and jim&#8217;s trucking for agreeing to judge the debate; and of course billsco for his enthusiasm and his ability to encourage people to do, rather than talk about it. Pleasantries over, I shall get on with the debate.\n \n So what do I mean by global warming? It is, I feel, important that I clarify this early on. After all, if my opponent has different ideas, we could waste much time debating at cross purposes. Global warming, or climate change - the two terms are synonymous in my opinion - is a term used to describe the observed change in mean Earth temperature over the last century or so. That trend is upwards, ie the mean Earth temperature is rising; the globe is warming. There are skeptics who claim that there is evidence that the Earth is in fact cooling, but these skeptics were effectively silenced by Carl Mears and Frank Wentz of Remote Sensing Systems in Santa Rosa, California, who found flaws in the way the temperature of the lower troposphere had been measured in reports that the lower troposphere was cooling -or at least not wrming. (see eg http://www.llnl.gov/pao/news/news_releases/2003/NR-03-05-01.html). I shall assume at this point that JPSartre12 is in agreement over what is meant by global warming and move on to the meat of my first post.\n \n In the last few decades it has become apparent that there is an upward trend in mean average global temperature (henceforth referred to simply as global warming). So what is causing this global warming? Broadly speaking, the answer can be divided into two possible answers: it is the result of natural cycles that the Earth periodically goes through, or it is caused by some out-of-the-ordinary event. Of course I accept that it could be a combination of the two - some might even say this third option is the most likely - but for the purposes of this opening post, I'd like to approach the two options independently.\n \n What natural cycle could cause a change in temperature? It is known the the Earth goes through a complex series of cycles in axial tilt and mean distance from the sun (known as the Milankovitch Cycles) and that the sun varies in heat output. Might these combine to provide a cycling variation in the amount of heat reaching the Earth and thus directly causing global warming? The answer is no. Some studies have suggested there is a link between sun affect cycles and temperature cycles, but they suffer from using two separate sources to find the link. Dr Chris Turney and his team from the University of Wollongong&#8217;s GeoQuEST Research Group at the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences recently carried out a study using Irish peat bogs. This study had a huge advantage: the same source could be used to measure both temperature and sun activity over the last 9,000 years. The study found that variations in sun activity did not match up with variations in temperature (see eg http://media.uow.edu.au/releases/2005/0920a.html).\n \n So we can dismiss any solar cycle as causing global warming. I'm not aware that the Earth's core has been getting hotter, or that there has been an increase in volcanism. The tectonic plates aren't moving fast enough to be causing such a rapid change. Might there be another natural cycle that is causing it? Perhaps, I freely admit that I do not know. Perhaps this is because I am unaware of it; perhaps it is because it does not exist. For now I'm assuming the latter. Should my opponent provide evidence of such a cycle, then I may have to change my position, but for now the evidence points to natural cycles not fitting the bill.\n \n So if global warming isn't caused by a natural cycle, might it be caused by an unusual natural event? Global warming has been occurring for just over a century, so we can dismiss single large volcanic eruptions like St. Helens. I'm not aware we have been hit by a large asteroid recently. Again there might be an major climate-changing natural event that occurred a century or so ago, the affect of which we are still feeling in a growing fashion, that isn't known about (at least by me). Seem pretty unlikely though and so I feel I can dismiss the idea of an unusual natural event as teh cause of global warming.\n \n So that leaves an unusual man-made event. Might something have happened in the last century that is man-made and could affect climate? It sure has: CO2. CO2 is a known \"greenhouse gas\", so named because it both absorbs infrared energy and contributes to the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere (by reflecting escaping heat back toward the Earth). We humans have been producing ever increasing quantities of the stuff for a century or more now (see http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?method=4&dsname=Wikipedia+Images&dekey=Global+Carbon+Emission+by+Type.png&gwp=8&linktext=%3CIMG%20src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.answers.com%2Fmain%2Fcontent%2Fwp%2Fstyle%2Fimages%2Fmagnify-clip.png%22%20width%3D%2215%22%20height%3D%2211%22%20alt%3D%22Enlarge%22%2F%3E). Hmm, so we have a gas that is known to increase the greenhouse effect increasing in levels and the Earth's mean temperature is rising? Coincidence? Well the \"climate skeptics\" would claim so, but really, they are only kidding themselves when they claim so. Right?\n \n So to conclude this first post: we cannot be 100% sure that human activity is causing global warming. But there is a dearth of possible reasons other than CO2 production via human activity. The evidence overwhelmingly points to human activity and thus the case ought to be closed. I shall now hand you over to my opponent who, I'm sure, will explain why the case ought to be kept open.\n \n Thank you.",

I shall now hand you over to my opponent who, I'm sure, will explain why the case ought to be kept open.\n \n Thank you. \n __________________\n C14. \n \n\n My opponent points to one attempt to prove that global warming is occurring because one research group was able to correctly account for both man-made and natural variations in satellite data.The problem with this line of reasoning is that it neglects other evidence not in dispute. Here's what my opponents own source says in its conclusions:\n \n\n The Lab scientists and their colleagues use results from a state-of-the-art computer climate model that was run with estimates of historical changes in greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, ozone, volcanic dust and the sun's energy output. These experiments were performed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and the Department of Energy's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center in Berkeley, Calif. The model runs yield detailed patterns (or 'fingerprints') of tropospheric temperature change. These fingerprints are identifiable in the Santa Rosa satellite data showing a warming troposphere, but not in the University of Alabama MSU records. Model output from these and other simulations are freely distributed to the research community (http://www.nersc.gov/projects/gcm_data).\n \n \"In the last 24 years, satellites have helped us to observe the climate of our planet more intensively and systematically than at any other time in Earth's history,\" said Santer, lead author of the paper. \"Yet even over the satellite era, there are still large uncertainties in our estimates of how tropospheric temperatures have changed. It's important to take these uncertainties into account in evaluating the reliability of climate models. We find that model/data agreement, like beauty, depends on one's observational perspective. Our detection results point toward a real need to reduce current levels of uncertainty in satellite temperature measurements.\"  \n\n \n This is hardly a definitive \"smoking gun\" in favor of man-made global warming. Global Warming proponents always couch their findings with such cavaets as that enboldened above. But, there is much more evidence showing that global warming is either a naturally occurring phenomenon or a pipe dream using a variety of scientific protocols and measurement systems. I'll start with evidence that contradicts global warming being man-made and end with a discussion of CO2 and its effects, in particular.\n 1. Solar Magnetic Cycle Length:\n\n http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p36.htm figure #3\n Moving 11-year average of terrestrial Northern Hemisphere peratures as deviations in \u00baC from the 1951-1970 mean left axis and darker line (8,9). Solar magnetic cycle lengths right axis and lighter line (10). The shorter the magnetic cycle length, the more active, and hence brighter, the sun. \n \n\n As can be seen above, the current temperature in NA, below the mean temperature in the late 1940's, generally trends with solar magnetic cycle lengths.\n \n\n 2. Annual mean surface temperatures in the contiguous United States between 1895 and 1997, as compiled by the National Climate Data Center (12). Horizontal line is the 103-year mean. The trend line for this 103-year period has a slope of 0.022 \u00baC per decade or 0.22 \u00baC per century. The trend line for 1940 to 1997 has a slope of 0.008 \u00baC per decade or 0.08 \u00baC per century \n http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p36.htm figure #4\n\n Further support for a lack of warming. \n \n\n 3. Surface temperatures in the Sargasso Sea (with time resolution of about 50 years) ending in 1975 as determined by isotope ratios of marine organism remains in sediment at the bottom of the sea (7). The horizontal line is the average temperature for this 3,000 year period. The Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Optimum were naturally occurring, extended intervals of climate departures from the mean. \n http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p36.htm figure #2\n \n\n \n Professor Fred Singer, the man responsible for creating the US Weather Satellite Service, former Chief Scientist for the DOT and climate expert testified before the Senate Commerce Committee on Climate Change that there was no appreciable climate warming. \n \n\n 1. There is no Appreciable Climate Warming\n Contrary to the conventional wisdom and the predictions of computer models, the Earth's climate has not warmed appreciably in the past two decades, and probably not since about 1940. The evidence is overwhelming:\n a) Satellite data show no appreciable warming of the global atmosphere since 1979. In fact, if one ignores the unusual El Nino year of 1998, one sees a cooling trend.\n b) Radiosonde data from balloons released regularly around the world confirm the satellite data in every respect. This fact has been confirmed in a recent report of the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences [1].\n c) The well-controlled and reliable thermometer record of surface temperatures for the continental United States shows no appreciable warming since about 1940. [See figure] The same is true for Western Europe. These results are in sharp contrast to the GLOBAL instrumental surface record, which shows substantial warming, mainly in NW Siberia and subpolar Alaska and Canada.\n d) But tree-ring records for Siberia and Alaska and published ice-core records that I have examined show NO warming since 1940. In fact, many show a cooling trend.\n Conclusion: The post-1980 global warming trend from surface thermometers is not credible. The absence of such warming would do away with the widely touted \"hockey stick\" graph (with its \"unusual\" temperature rise in the past 100 years) [see figure]; it was shown here on May 17 as purported proof that the 20th century is the warmest in 1000 years.\n http://www.nationalcenter.org/KyotoSingerTestimony2000.html\n \n\n If man's generation of CO2 was the major cause of a global warming, shouldn't we be experiencing the highest average temperatures for the globe now? We're not, the highest average temperatures were experienced in 1940, according to NASA GISS (Goddard Institute of Space Studies) and we have seen an 82% increase in atmospheric CO2 levels since that point. Clearly, we should be at record high temperature levels id CO2 was a major factor. If we go back in time further, we find that ~400 years ago, the average temperatures were high enough for Greenland to be colonized, certainly higher than today's temperatures and preceding the Industrial Revolution.\n Now, let's look at the magnitude of CO2 generated by man vs CO2 found naturally in the environment.\n Total human CO2 emissions primarily from use of coal, oil, and natural gas and the production of cement are currently about 5.5 Gigatons carbon per year. It is estimated that the atmosphere contains ~ 750 Gigatons C; the surface ocean ~1,000 Gt C; vegetation, soils, and detritus contain ~2,200 Gt C; and the intermediate and deep oceans contain 38,000 Gt C (3). Each year, the surface ocean and atmosphere exchange an estimated 90 Gt C; vegetation and the atmosphere, 60 Gt C; marine biota and the surface ocean, 50 Gt C; and the surface ocean and the intermediate and deep oceans, 100 Gt C (3). http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p36.htm \n As can be seen from above, the total amount of carbon exchanged by the atmosphere with plants, surface oceans, etc., (mostly in the form of CO2) is ~150Gtons/year, dwarfing man's contributions. \n Also, it has been demonstrated that increasd CO2 levels stimulate and increase plant growth, so increases in atmospheric CO2 will result in increased plant growth, thereby \"scrubbing\" even higher levels of CO2 out of the atmosphere. An added benefit is that many crops subjected to higher CO2 levels also demonstarted increased WUE (water usage efficiency). In one study of sugarcane, WUE increased between 38-75% when the cane was exposed to CO2 levels 2x normal. So, in addition to greater usage of atmospheric carbon, high CO2 levels may even reduce the amount of irrigation needed to grow certain crops. That's an added benefit, not a problem.\n http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publications.htm?seq_no_115=171069\n \n I'll end this here and give my opponent a chance to rebut.",

Increasing CO2 levels can theoretically increase plant growth, but only for C3 plants. C4 plants do not benefit from increased CO2 concentrations. However increasing temperature causes a drop in plant growth for C3 plants. C4 and CAM plants are not (so) limited by temperature. In addition, a rise in CO2, leading to a rise in temperature, will often lead to a reduction in water. Without water, all plants stop growing or die. Increased CO2 ultimately may be disastrous for plant growth. Even if this doesn't occur, 97% of the worlds plants - including most trees and most crop plants - are C3 plants. Increased CO2 will be good for these plants. Increasing temperatures will be bad for these plants. So will global warming lead to mass plant (and thus human) death or to increased plant growth?

It isn't that simple. These two events have been discovered to be regional events that affected western Europe and eastern North America. In fact temperatures have been found to have got colder in the Antarctic during the Medieval Climate Optimum for example. These two events show us that the climate is a complex beast and that it is difficult for us to reliably model what the affects of global warming will be on a local scale for each region of the world. They in no way though suggest that large scale global rises and falls in temperature (such as the current global warming we are experiencing) can be attributed to natural causes.\n \n Refs:\n http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/070.htm\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_climate_optimum",

Although the CO2 levels in the atmosphere have increased by 82% since that time, the rate of temperature increase has decreased, contrary to what the global warming models have predicted. Too much cutting, pasting and editing. My apologies. \n \n\n Next I shall touch upon the following point:\n Quote: \n \n Also, it has been demonstrated that increased CO2 levels stimulate and increase plant growth, so increases in atmospheric CO2 will result in increased plant growth, thereby \"scrubbing\" even higher levels of CO2 out of the atmosphere. \n The problem with this claim is that it ignores (a) temperature and thus (b) water availability.

Increasing CO2 levels can theoretically increase plant growth, but only for C3 plants. C4 plants do not benefit from increased CO2 concentrations.\n False: Increasing CO2 levels has a beneficial effect on ALL types of plants. For C4 plants, this increase in plant growth has been attributed to CO2's ability to improve the C4 plant's water management and not increased photosynthesis. http://www.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/century5/reference/html/Century/enriched-co2.htm\n 2. However increasing temperature causes a drop in plant growth for C3 plants.\n Misleading statement: While I would agree that placing a plant in boiling water is harmful to C3 plants, the temperature changes that we're talking about are on the order of 1degree/century, so your statement is either misleading or just plain inaccurate given the magnitude of change we're discussing. (The current average temperature is ~15degrees C.)\n 3. In addition, a rise in CO2, leading to a rise in temperature, will often lead to a reduction in water.\n Misleading statement: You're assuming, a priori, that an increase in CO2 will lead to a rise in temperature. CO2 content in the atmosphere only accounts for ~2% of the greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere. The largest greenhouse gas is water vapor, clouds. If you assume that the average temperature of the earth has risen, then the ultimate cause must be due to increased presence of water vapor in the atmosphere. If that were the case, then, on a global scale, then there would be an increase in available water, not a decrease, making the latter part of your assertion false. \n 4. Without water, all plants stop growing or die\n True. No need to beat a dead plant. \n 5.Increased CO2 ultimately may be disastrous for plant growth. \n False: For C3 plants, CO2 increases photosynthesis and for C4 plants, it increases water efficiency, a Win-Win for both types of plants.\n 6. Even if this doesn't occur, 97% of the worlds plants - including most trees and most crop plants - are C3 plants. Increased CO2 will be good for these plants. Increasing temperatures will be bad for these plants. \n True and False: Increased CO2 will be beneficial AND the magnitude of the temperature changes that we're discussing will be overwhelmingly beneficial. \n 7. So will global warming lead to mass plant (and thus human) death or to increased plant growth? We don't know.\n This is a rhetorical question...and the purpose of the debate. While you're perfectly willing to say man is causing global warming, you're not willing to definitively defend that this is a bad thing. What you're proposing, following Kyota and the likes, would cost the US alone ~$2.7Trillion over the next decade and in your own opinion is of unknown value. Personally, If I was going to spend $2.7Trillion, I'd want to know. \n \n \n\n Finally I'd like to discuss the \"Little Ice Age\" and \"Medieval Climate Optimum\" that my opponent refers to and that are often used to suggest that the Earth has experienced huge natural global swings in temperature in the last few hundred years. It isn't that simple. These two events have been discovered to be regional events that affected western Europe and eastern North America. In fact temperatures have been found to have got colder in the Antarctic during the Medieval Climate Optimum for example. These two events show us that the climate is a complex beast and that it is difficult for us to reliably model what the affects of global warming will be on a local scale for each region of the world. They in no way though suggest that large scale global rises and falls in temperature (such as the current global warming we are experiencing) can be attributed to natural causes.\n\n Interesting how you use the imprecision of accurately measuring short-range temperature flucuations as an argument against evidence of the cyclical nature of the earth's climate, but depend purely on data gathered in the last 30 years to \"prove\" global warming. I'll be the first to agree with you that there's a high degree of uncertainty and error in looking at relative snapshots of the earth's climate and drawing profound conclusions that man is causing global warming from them. The 17,000+ scientists who signed the Environmental Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Petition would agree.\n http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p36.htm\n \n\n \n Refs:\n http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/070.htm\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_climate_optimum \n\n Here's what your source, Wikipedia, says about the IPCC that pro-global warming advocates love to quote.\n \n\n \"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988 by two United Nations organizations, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess the \"risk of human-induced climate change\". The Panel is open to all members of the WMO and UNEP.\n IPCC reports are widely cited [1] [2] in almost any debate related to climate change [3] [4]. The reports have been influential in forming national and international responses to climate change. A few of the scientists whose work is summarized in these reports have accused the IPCC of bias.\" \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC \n\n I would look at any source, whose decision-making is based on analyzing others' scientific work, with a jaundiced eye, if the scientists who actually perform the studies charge it of bias. Remember, the IPCC has a political agenda intimately tied to its UN members. After all, Kyota is a wealth redistribution scheme and not a plan to reduce greenhouse gases. (We can debate that at another time, if you'd like) For example, did you know that its summary reports are reviewed twice? Once by \"technical\" and once by governments. http://www.ipcc.ch/about/faq/IPCC%20Who%20is%20who.pdf page 3. One must ask, 'why should the government be reviewing scientific reports?'\n And since you've used www.grida.no/climate (part of the United Nations Environment Programme) as one of your supporting sources, I'm sure that you won't mind me using it as well. \n http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm\n This graph clearly demonstrates temperature and CO2 level cycling over the past 400k years, based on ice core samples taken from the Vostok Ice Core in Antarctica. The interesting thing is the caption which states: \n \n\n Over the last 400,000 years the Earth's climate has been unstable, with very significant temperature changes, going from a warm climate to an ice age in as rapidly as a few decades. These rapid changes suggest that climate may be quite sensitive to internal or external climate forcings and feedbacks. As can be seen from the blue curve, temperatures have been less variable during the last 10 000 years. Based on the incomplete evidence available, it is unlikely that global mean temperatures have varied by more than 1\u00b0C in a century during this period. The information presented on this graph indicates a strong correlation between carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere and temperature. A possible scenario: anthropogenic emissions of GHGs could bring the climate to a state where it reverts to the highly unstable climate of the pre-ice age period. Rather than a linear evolution, the climate follows a non-linear path with sudden and dramatic surprises when GHG levels reach an as-yet unknown trigger point. \n \n\n While any high school student can see 4 distinctive cycles present and that we are in the midst of a maximum, all they can do is speculate on what might happen in the future, completely glossing over causes for the temperature and CO2 swings of the last 400k years. If anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are causing global warming, what caused the previous 4 global warming cycles over the last 400k years alone? And why was the average temperature 2 - 3 degrees higher than today during 4 periods in the last 400k years? Surely cavemen didn't burn that much wood. :) \n Beware the fruit from a poisoned tree.",

   "Hum, so Fred Singer isn't credible despite his impressive credentials listed below\nThat is what I'm saying, yes. One must sensibly question his credibility when there seems such a strong link between what he says and who is paying him at the time.\n \n \nWell, no matter, I have over the names of over 17,000 other scientists who hold similar opinions. I'm sure there's at least one that even Sourcewatch would have to call credible.\nI'd be interested to see the list, and more importantly when it was created. I'm sure that 10 years ago it was possible to find 17,000 scientists who questioned global warming and its human-activity cause. Now days, I'd be impressed it you could provide a list one tenth that size. For a view of what the scientific community really thinks these days, check out the \"Joint Science Academies&#8217; Statement: Global Response to Climate Change\" statement issued in June this year, signed by the heads of the world's top science institutions. The names include Bruce Alberts, the president of the National Academy of Sciences in the USA and Robert May, the president of the Royal Society in Britain. The statement quite clearly states that global warming is occuring and it is human activity that is causing it. You can see the statement at http://www.mindfully.org/Air/2005/Joint-Science-Academies7jun2005.htm\n \n \nI'd be happy to. I left out the words \"increases in\" . The highest increases in average temperature occurred prior to 1940. Although the CO2 levels in the atmosphere have increased by 82% since that time, the rate of temperature increase has decreased, contrary to what the global warming models have predicted. Too much cutting, pasting and editing. My apologies.\nThis is simply not true. Please see the graphic that I have created at www.little-home.com/gwarming.png . I have taken the plot of mean annual temperatures from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Instrumental_Temperature_Record.png and drawn a best fit line through the years 1975(ish) to 2000. I've then copied that line and pasted it over the slope prior to 1950. The slope is less in the latter case. The fastest rate of warming has been post 1975.\n \n \nI'll take your statements one by one.\n 1. Increasing CO2 levels can theoretically increase plant growth, but only for C3 plants. C4 plants do not benefit from increased CO2 concentrations.\n False: Increasing CO2 levels has a beneficial effect on ALL types of plants. For C4 plants, this increase in plant growth has been attributed to CO2's ability to improve the C4 plant's water management and not increased photosynthesis.\nI stand corrected: increased CO2 does appear to result in tiny increases in C4 plant performance in some of the experiments you listed.\n \n \n2. However increasing temperature causes a drop in plant growth for C3 plants.\n Misleading statement: While I would agree that placing a plant in boiling water is harmful to C3 plants, the temperature changes that we're talking about are on the order of 1degree/century, so your statement is either misleading or just plain inaccurate given the magnitude of change we're discussing. (The current average temperature is ~15degrees C.)\nMy statement is both correct and straightforward, unlike the rather silly \"boiling water\" strawman you use.\n Firstly, 1\u00b0C/century is at the low end of the scale. The IPCC model's put it at between 1.4\u00b0C and 5.8\u00b0C rise between 1990 and 2100.\n Secondly, we are not talking boiling point here, we are talking temperate-climate temperature range for the optimum temperatures for C3 plants. The optimum varies from species to species, but is normally around 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C. Wheat for example will grow 25% less when the summer air temperature is 30\u00b0C rather than 24 (http://digital.library.okstate.edu/OAS/oas_htm_files/v62/p57_62nf.html)\n \n \n3. In addition, a rise in CO2, leading to a rise in temperature, will often lead to a reduction in water.\n Misleading statement: You're assuming, a priori, that an increase in CO2 will lead to a rise in temperature. CO2 content in the atmosphere only accounts for ~2% of the greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere. The largest greenhouse gas is water vapor, clouds.

If that were the case, then, on a global scale, then there would be an increase in available water, not a decrease, making the latter part of your assertion false. \nThe latter part of my assertion is only false if the weather were uniform on a global scale. The recent intensifying droughts in Africa and Europe coupled with increased rainful around the Gulf of Mexico might be a more realistic example of rainfall patterns as the Earth warms as the weather isn't uniform across the globe.\n \n \n5.Increased CO2 ultimately may be disastrous for plant growth. \n False: For C3 plants, CO2 increases photosynthesis and for C4 plants, it increases water efficiency, a Win-Win for both types of plants.\nRather selective use of data there. As previously stated, higher temperatures will be bad for C3 plants, thus increased CO2 will not be a win situation for C3 plants.\n \n \n6. Even if this doesn't occur, 97% of the worlds plants - including most trees and most crop plants - are C3 plants. Increased CO2 will be good for these plants. Increasing temperatures will be bad for these plants. \n True and False: Increased CO2 will be beneficial AND the magnitude of the temperature changes that we're discussing will be overwhelmingly beneficial.\nThe magnitude that we are discussing vary wildly. If we are really really lucky and the tiny rise that you predict occurs, then it will likely be beneficial. The rise is far more likely to be higher though as the rise in temperature estimate over the next 100 years just keeps getting bigger as the models get more accurate (http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0127-01.htm ,http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=56&ItemID=8482)\n \n \nInteresting how you use the imprecision of accurately measuring short-range temperature flucuations as an argument against evidence of the cyclical nature of the earth's climate, but depend purely on data gathered in the last 30 years to \"prove\" global warming.\nI use the results of scientific experiments and computer modelling to argue both that \"natural cycles\" in Earth's temperature are not what they seem and that the Earth is getting hotter and the speed of that heating is increasing.\n \n \nI'll be the first to agree with you that there's a high degree of uncertainty and error in looking at relative snapshots of the earth's climate and drawing profound conclusions that man is causing global warming from them.

I look forward to you showing me that they still agree in 2005.\n \n I shall stop at this point, mindfull that I haven't addressed my opponent's criticisms of my sources (\"Here's what your source, Wikipedia, says about the IPCC that pro-global warming advocates love to quote....\" onwards).

   "\n That is what I'm saying, yes. One must sensibly question his credibility when there seems such a strong link between what he says and who is paying him at the time.\n \n\n While I'd rather not turn this into a debate over the credibility of sources, especially with one having the credentials of Dr. Singer, I will remind the reader that the IPCC, UNEP and most other highly quoted pro-global warming advocacy groups have political agendas that transcend science. In my final post, I'll discuss the real reasons for the UN's promotion of the Kyota Accord. \n \n\n I'd be interested to see the list, and more importantly when it was created.

The statement quite clearly states that global warming is occuring and it is human activity that is causing it. You can see the statement at http://www.mindfully.org/Air/2005/J...ies7jun2005.htm\n \n\n I would suggest that a closer read of your reference is in order. Its authors don't exude nearly as much conviction in the assertion that you do:\n \n\n \"It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001)2.\"\n \"As the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recognises, a lack of full scientific certainty about some aspects of climate change is not a reason for delaying an immediate response that will, at a reasonable cost, prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\"\n \n\n Again, I'd like to remind the reader that the source for this assumption is the IPCC, composed of UN members and the UNFCCC, another obvious UN sponsored endeavor. And as was stated in my prior post, all IPCC reports receive a final review by governments, an unheard of step for supposedly scientific findings. \n \n\n This is simply not true. Please see the graphic that I have created at www.little-home.com/gwarming.png . I have taken the plot of mean annual temperatures from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:...ture_Record.png and drawn a best fit line through the years 1975(ish) to 2000. I've then copied that line and pasted it over the slope prior to 1950. The slope is less in the latter case. The fastest rate of warming has been post 1975.\n\n One of the biggest problems associated with global warming studies is the technique used to measure temperature. Your graph came from the following data:\n http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/2004/\n This was data based on ground-based meteorological stations and ocean surface temperatures measured by satellite, according to the website referenced above. One needs to ask, how did NASA get satellite data on ocean surface temperatures prior to the first satellite, Sputnik, being launched in 1959?! The answer is easy, they didn't. All pre-1970 or so data is ground-based data using much cruder instrumentation, subject to large regional variations, etc., but the GISS fails to note this in their findings. \n Below is a table of global temperature trends based on a variety of measurement systems. One can see that land-based measurement systems tend to show an increase in temperature while atmospheric measurement systems tend to show a cooling effect. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is included after the following chart.\n \n \n Projected vs. Actual Deep Layer Temperature Measurements\n IPCC Projection 0.23 degree C (0.41 degree F) per decade\n Satellite Trend -0.01 degree C (-0.018 degree F) per decade*\n Weather Balloon Trend (National Oceanic & Space Administration) -0.07 degree C (-0.126 degree F) per decade\n Weather Balloon Trend (U.K. Met Office) -0.02 degree C (-0.036 degree F) per decade\n Source: Dr. Roy Spencer, \"Measuring the Temperature of Earth From Space,\" NASA Space Science News, August 14, 1998\n *Satellite figure includes correction for orbital decay\n \n Projected vs. Actual Surface Measurements\n IPCC Projection 0.18 degree C (0.32 degree F) per decade \n Sea Surface and Land Surface Temperatures (U.K. Met Office) 0.15 degree C (0.27 degree F) per decade\n \n Source: Dr. Roy Spencer, \"Measuring the Temperature of Earth From Space,\" NASA Space Science News, August 14, 1998\n *Satellite figure includes correction for orbital decay\n \n Satellite temperature data are generally considered more reliable than ground-based temperature reading because they not only cover a greater portion of the planet but provide nearly continuous monitoring, taking some 40,000 readings every day.  Ground-based temperature gages are also unevenly distributed, with most located in wealthier countries in the Northern Hemisphere. Ground-based readings also tend to be vulnerable to such distortions as the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE). The UHIE is an artificially high temperature reading linked to urban development. As the number of roads, cars, airports, airplanes and buildings grow in an urban areas, so too does the local temperature. Since most ground-based temperature gages are located in urban areas, most are vulnerable to UHIE.http://www.nationalcenter.org/GWFactSheet.html\n \n\n As can be seen from the table above, sattelite and weather balloon data paints a differing picture of climate change. They show a slight decrease in temperature while ground-based data suggests a slight increase in temperature. Do you believe that such uncertainty is worth the US spending $2.7Trillion to address?\n \n\n I stand corrected: increased CO2 does appear to result in tiny increases in C4 plant performance in some of the experiments you listed.\n\n Tiny increase?! In the study involving corn grown in 2X CO2 levels, the growth increase was 40%! That's not a tiny change. http://www.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/century5/reference/html/Century/enriched-co2.htm\n \n\n My statement is both correct and straightforward, unlike the rather silly \"boiling water\" strawman you use.\n Firstly, 1\u00b0C/century is at the low end of the scale. The IPCC model's put it at between 1.4\u00b0C and 5.8\u00b0C rise between 1990 and 2100.\n Secondly, we are not talking boiling point here, we are talking temperate-climate temperature range for the optimum temperatures for C3 plants. The optimum varies from species to species, but is normally around 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C. Wheat for example will grow 25% less when the summer air temperature is 30\u00b0C rather than 24 (http://digital.library.okstate.edu/...2/p57_62nf.html) \n\n Again, I'll take the statements one at a time.\n 1. \"Firstly, 1\u00b0C/century is at the low end of the scale. The IPCC model's put it at between 1.4\u00b0C and 5.8\u00b0C rise between 1990 and 2100.\"\n The IPCC models have already been shown to be inaccurate. Here are three references which contradict IPCC's assumption, including a statement by the IPCC itself.\n \n\n Measuring the Temperature of Earth From Space\n Even with Needed Corrections, Data Still Don't Show the Expected Signature of Global Warming\n By \n Dr. Roy Spencer \n Senior Scientist for Climate Studies \n NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center\n Originally Published: 8/13/98\n http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/MSU/hl_measuretemp.htm \n\n \n\n \"The Mann graph [i.e., the hockey stick of IPCC TAR] indicates that it was never warmer during the last ten thousand years than it is today. ... In recent years it [the hockey stick] has been elevated to the status of truth by the UN appointed science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This handicapped all that research which strives to make a realistic distinction between human influences and climate and natural variability.\"\n http://techcentralstation.com/102704F.html \n\n \n\n P24 IPPC/TEAP special report on safeguarding the ozone layer and the global climate system\n \"Increases in CO2 concentration are expected to cool the stratosphere\"\n http://www.ipcc.ch/activity/specialrprt05/IPCC_low_en.pdf \n\n Even the IPCC doesn't believe their own rhetoric. \n \n\n The latter part of my assertion is only false if the weather were uniform on a global scale. The recent intensifying droughts in Africa and Europe coupled with increased rainful around the Gulf of Mexico might be a more realistic example of rainfall patterns as the Earth warms as the weather isn't uniform across the globe.\n\n False: Again, from your IPCC, \"Existing studies show that on the whole, global agricultural production could be maintained relative to baseline production in the face of climate change projected under doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions.\n http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/sarsyn.htm\n \n\n Rather selective use of data there. As previously stated, higher temperatures will be bad for C3 plants, thus increased CO2 will not be a win situation for C3 plants.\n\n I addressed the temperature effects in the range that we're talking about in my last post. At the IPCC's stated ~1degree/century temperature increase, the effect will be nil or positive given the average temperature is currently ~15degrees C. \n \n\n The magnitude that we are discussing vary wildly. If we are really really lucky and the tiny rise that you predict occurs, then it will likely be beneficial. The rise is far more likely to be higher though as the rise in temperature estimate over the next 100 years just keeps getting bigger as the models get more accurate (http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0127-01.htm ,\n \n\n I love sources like this one. When you snake back to the original source, you get to this.\n http://www.americanprogress.org/atf/cf/{E9245FE4-9A2B-43C7-A521-5D6FF2E06E03}/CLIMATECHALLENGE.PDF\n It is a political action group sponsored document. It epitomizes the proliferation and attempts to add credibility to claims of global warming by policy wonks, not scientists. For amusement, read the names and brief bios of the taskforce's membership starting on page 19, appendix B. They are a collection of politicians and environmentalists with ONE scientific advisor who just happens to also be the chair of the UN's IPCC. There is not one iota of new scientific data presented in its 28 pages. They even reference Greenpeace as a source of financial support. (p.25) Good grief.\n \n Your other reference includes the following\" \n \nResearchers who have recently returned from the region found that an area of permafrost spanning a million square kilometres - the size of France and Germany combined - has started to melt for the first time since it formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. \n http://www.zmag.org/content/showart...=56&ItemID=8482) \n\n To this I can only comment \"duh!\" It's thawing for the first time since it formed 11k years ago. So prior to 11k years ago, it didn't even exist. What caused it to form in the first place and why wasn't it already in existence prior to 11k years ago? Could it have been that we were in a global warming cycle prior to its formation? From Antarctic ice core sampling (referenced in my last post) that we are in a natural cyclical warming period and have gone through 4 in the last 400k years according to Vostok samples, so we shouldn't be surprised with the fact that some of the permafrost in Siberia is melting today. \n Might I suggest that, if the permafrost will be releasing 700bn tons of methane over the next decade, we'd be smart to try to capture and use some of it as fuel. :)\n [\n\n I use the results of scientific experiments and computer modelling to argue both that \"natural cycles\" in Earth's temperature are not what they seem and that the Earth is getting hotter and the speed of that heating is increasing. \n\n I've refuted both your scientific experiments AND IPCC computer models in this and my previous posts. As can be seen above, when one uses weather balloon and satellite data that is unaffected by distortions such as the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE), the global temperature trend is actually decreasing, not increasing.\n \n \n\n They might have agreed in 1998 when they signed. I look forward to you showing me that they still agree in 2005.\n \n I shall stop at this point, mindfull that I haven't addressed my opponent's criticisms of my sources (\"Here's what your source, Wikipedia, says about the IPCC that pro-global warming advocates love to quote....\" onwards). I've run out of time on this occasion and so will address my opponent's points on this matter in my next post.\n \n\n Per your request, I have e-mailed the sponsor of the petition and will post his reply when received. But don't hold out much hope for defections. The more \"real science\" that is performed, the more IPCC's inaccuracies come to life. \n The IPCC's report came out in 2001, since then a number of scientific organizations have picked it apart.\n http://www.spacedaily.com/news/climate-03q.html is an article about Univ. of Alabama at Huntsville's finding that the previous satellite and weather balloon data is corroborated by the NOAA Satellite data showing that the global warming is 0.07degrees per decade, far less than IPCC's estimate\n http://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/climate-change/mg18825225.100 is a very recent, Oct22, 2005, article from New Scientist magazine on findings that suggest that changing CO2 levels may account for the dramatic changes in glacial cycles that occurred 950,000 years ago. Clearly there were no anthropogenic sources of CO2 a million years ago to account for this.\n \n Addendum:\n I received a reply from the author of the petition and have included it in its entirity.\n \n\n Out of over 17,000 scientists signers, about 15 have asked that their names be removed - over the past 6 years. There is no new data that materially alters that which was published with the petition and forms the basis of its validity.\n \n Art Robinson\n \n",

The word \"banned\" under his name tells the story.\n I was looking forward to writing my last response because I wanted to tie the farce into world economics, since I believe that the technical issues have been dealt with effectively. \n I don't know how the judges want to handle this, but we both had 3 posts on the topic, so you could judge it based on them or we could just leave it unresolved. Either way, I appreciate the time that you took to follow the debate and would like to thank Billsco for organizing the debate.\n\n \n Clive14 was not Banned, he put it in his profile, which I have removed. The problem was I removed a quote from his signature that although true was antagonizing another poster. Which tends to cause problems for me. He felt I was taking sides.",

The uncompleted debate is judged on its merits as is with a winner and a loser.\n \n 3. The whole thing is scrubbed.\n \n I think I'd be overstepping my bounds as moderator to declare which path to follow, so I'm going to defer to the judges to make the decision. That's why they get paid the big money. \n \n So work through it, see if a consensus can be reached. Good luck.",

   "I agree that it can be difficult to judge a debate without closing quotes.\n \n Personally, I was judging the debate based soley on technical merit, and JP was arguably up by a few points (there is an issue I had not decided how to score, waiting to see if JP recognized and addressed it later). \n \n If I had to score it right now, I would go ahead and give JP the points, since he did touch on the issue a couple of times, and it sems reasonable that he did recognize the problem and plan to address it.\n \n As far as I am concerned, we can do this either way. My recomendation would be to call it a victory by default for JP. As was pointed out, without closing, it is still anybodies game. If there was a clear cut winner, it would be easier to judge, but soley on technical merit, the debate could have still gone either way by my score sheet.\n \n I will defer to the decision of the other judges, unless they cannot agree, then I owudl ask the moderator to cast the deciding vote.",
