Guys like Tim really do try to keep things reasonable and accountable, but occasionally somebody gets a bug up their butt in the British government and they perform a witch hunt. Without well defined regulations, the PMC is entirely at the mercy of the witch hunters. This is essentially what happened to Sandline intl (spiocers old company) with the Sierra Leone arms deal. \n \n Bar none the WORST companies come from Russia, where I am fairly certain they are staffed entirely with criminals, and from the US, where it is illegal to run such an operation so they hide behind the guise of \"military advisors\" and \"security specialists\".
