   "As it has been reported by Herald Tribune, \"gas war between Ukraine and Russia is not over yet, which is to say that Ukraine may try to compensate own loss of gas at the cost of transit gas for Europe\". It's clear this will has negative consequences for vital winter fuel supplies to many European countries. And in this context I should remember you that Ukraine has signed Energy Charter. According to it gas transportation to Europe must be independent from Russian gas deliveries for Ukrainian internal usage. But Ukraine violates contracts many times. It's enough to remember how Ukraine's authorities have forgotten about agreement on German (Ruhrgas AG Essen Concern), French and Italian firms equal participation in creation of the international Consortium on Management and Development of Gas Shipping System of Ukraine. Then Ukrainian businessmen proposed associative participation instead of a full-scale merger under the pretext that all of these companies either wanted to participate in the redistribution of the European gas market with the help of this concern or they sought to gain own profits through reduction of the tariff for transportation of gas from Russia. That's so-called Ukrainian suspiciousness. But such behaviour is out of business! \n Moreover, if we want to imagine our potential partner in EU, taking into account Ukrainian avidity to join us, we shouldn't forget that during 15 years Ukraine was making Russian gas extractions, decorating them as debts with delay in paying and simultaneously reselling Russian gas to some European countries twice as expensive under condition of prompt cash. In the end Ukrainian gas debt to Russia has totaled nearly $65 million and the country has been publicly accused of obtaining the gas illegally. \n Thus, it is time for us to realize that not only Ukrainian economy falls short of accepted European standards but also Ukraine's magistracy has lost any norms of commercial relations. About what EU integration of Ukraine can we speak after such facts of elementary gas picking and stealing? Ukraine continues to be fully dependent state, still observed Soviet laws of business conduct. It'll be not only unprofitable but also very dangerous for Europe to have such unreliable partner even in future. And there is no surprise for me EU leadership has hurried to hint to Kiev that Ukraine shouldn't to apply for membership of EU club in order not to be refused.",
