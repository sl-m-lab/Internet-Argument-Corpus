If it quacks like a BNP duck..............\n\n \n The minimum wage has been around barely 10 years. I don't think falling wages have anything to do with immigration. The creep down of wages for unskilled work started long before Poland joined the EU, with the tory (and Blairite) privatisation of public services. Polly Toynbee did an excellent analysis of this in 2003 (Hard Work, published by Bloomsbury). It nothing to do with immigration, because it happens in areas where there is very little immigration too. It's about allowing market forces where they're not effective - unskilled labour doesn't have perfect information or free movement, it doesn't matter how many people are chasing the same jobs because when you need a job and there is only a small number of places you can access, you are not in a position to negotiate a better wage. The lack of unionisation in the private sector makes this worse.",
