   "Since the Schiavo case has stimulated discussion in this direction, I would like to open the reverse case debate.\n \n The subject of the case is 50 year old \"Nick\" (*As in \"Necromancer\", any real cases are not known to the author), male homo sapiens of the middle class. One day Nick decides he would not like to die. So, Nick makes a will in which he states: \"I believe in the absolute sanctity of every life, including my own. I therefore demand that every effort available to contemporary medicine be made to extend the life of my body, including every single cell, to the maximum possible, regardless of my brain functions.\"\n \n 5 minutes later, Nick is the victim of a lightning strike (*ignore possibility of divine intervention). He is taken to a hospital, where the surgeons read the note in his pocket regarding the above demand. Here, the discussion begins.\n \n The discussion is to be aimed at values, not policies, but in case of problems, here's a quasi medical presentation of the medical side of things. Assume all failures are irreversible. Assume the three adjustable time periods always allow the time for un-rushed legal and medical procedures. Assume no malpractice.:\n \n The lightning strike has initially inflicted severe damage to Nick's nervous system and knocked Renny into a coma. \n \n After the passage of an adjustable amount of time, Nick's vegetative nervous system begins to fail, resulting in organ failure. \n \n After the passage of another adjustable amount of time, Nick's higher cognition brain areas fail first due to higher levels of damage. \n \n After the passage of a third adjustable amount of time, the rest Nick's organs begin to fail one by one and can be replaced by the \"machines\", one by one. Each can be replaced, assume eventually all organs fail and are replaced, keeping the cells alive.\n \n Assume a sizeable family with enough members to accomodate all possible motivations, from greed to love to fanatical persuasion both ways.",

I therefore demand that every effort available to contemporary medicine be made to extend the life of my body, including every single cell, to the maximum possible, regardless of my brain functions.\"\n\n Contemporary medicine. So right off the bat we admit that medicine as we know it today is limited in nature. There are endpoints of technology, and their applications in medical science. \n \n \n \nThe lightning strike has initially inflicted severe damage to Nick's nervous system and knocked Renny into a coma.\n\n Very vague. Is he still breathing? What part of his nervous system sustained the severe damage? \n \n \nAfter the passage of an adjustable amount of time, Nick's vegetative nervous system begins to fail, resulting in organ failure. \n\n What is a \"vegatative nervous system\"? I have heard of autonomic nervous system, central nervous system, but never a vegatative nervous system. Vegatative is not a word that is used to describe a nervous system, nor any other system or organ. Vegatative is a diagnostic word that is used to describe a condition that people can exist in after failure of certain organs and systems. Again, what organs failed?\n \n \nAfter the passage of another adjustable amount of time, Nick's higher cognition brain areas fail first due to higher levels of damage. \n\n OK, assuming you meant his cerebral cortex becomes non-functional much like Terri's was.\n \n \nAfter the passage of a third adjustable amount of time, the rest Nick's organs begin to fail one by one and can be replaced by the \"machines\", one by one. Each can be replaced, assume eventually all organs fail and are replaced, keeping the cells alive.\n\n In the case of a failure of the respiratory center, we have ventilators. For kidney failure, we have dialysis. But there are organs that a person cannot exist without, nor are there any \"machines\" capable of taking their place. Hypothetical or not, we have said contemporay medicine, and there are limits. \n \n \nAssume a sizeable family with enough members to accomodate all possible motivations, from greed to love to fanatical persuasion both ways.\nThe piece of paper in his pocket makes their wishes null and void. If he did not have it, there would be a court appointed or legally appointed legal guardian.",

   "I proposed a debate on values, not policies, so please try to avoid picking on the details. Assume three stages: failure of consciousness, failure of brain, failure of body. All details are merely an attempt to avoud the discussion of technical matters on which we are no experts. Also, as this is a hypothtical debate on values, the standard procedures can be ignored.\n \n Re vegetative: it's autonomous, sorry, but terminology in another language may be hard to get right... emoticon_emb\n \n \n As for the debate field:\n \n While wills are an accepted legal institute, they were kept in existence for a purpouse - because they provide motivation for people not to spend everything they have before death. In the end, no matter how sacred they are, when everyone is forced to chop wood for the winter before all the electricity from power plants is consumed by a billion braind dead who just don't want any of their cells to die, respect for the dead gets a bit shaken.\n \n Insofar as I am aware, by the law as it is, Nick's life support would be turned off after brain death, regardless of his wishes. By my criteria, this is reasonable, although I would also allow his body to die by the point any chance of recovery would become negligeable, which illustrated what I consider to be human: the human mind. If the mind is \"down\", the body is to be kept only so long as there is a chance for the restoration of the mind, or at least a mind. Life, both on a cellular level and on the systematic level, is a secondary consideration.\n \n \n P.S. I proposed this debate since the Schiavo case reminded me of a \"readers' letter\" from years ago in which someone attacked the concept of brain death being considered as moment of death. The guy presented some apparently religious theories about a large number of spirits and such which do not leave the body at that time, citing some oriental monks whose bodies remained warm for long periods.

Had the Schiavo case gone the other way, it would have been just one more step down the slippery slope towards a dangerous precedent that we as a society need to keep provide for and support all vegatative and braindead people, which would be a logistical and financial impossibility. People just do not realize how many people are removed from life support by choice every day, nor what it would cost to keep them alive indefinately. \n \n \nInsofar as I am aware, by the law as it is, Nick's life support would be turned off after brain death, regardless of his wishes.

Life, both on a cellular level and on the systematic level, is a secondary consideration.\n\n Laws differ from place to place, so it all comes down to the local customs. I agree that as soon as we can confirm clinical brain death, or irreversible vegatative conditions, people should be removed from life support automatically. \n \n \n \nP.S.
