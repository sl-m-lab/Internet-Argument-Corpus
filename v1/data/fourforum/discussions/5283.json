The fault is equally distributed then between the person who didn't write clearly enough and the person too lazy to give the writer the benefit of careful reading. \n \nIf Bill thought that Jill believed that selling beer was good and said that she thought it was good after citing that Jill wrote beer shouldn't be sold, would Bill be lying if he thought that it was true?\n Bill wouldn't be lying if he thought that it was true.

Simply take a dictionary and substitute synonyms for 'lying' and 'false' and 'fraudulent' and 'fabricating'. If the synonyms change, but the meaning doesn't, then there is no semantic difference.",
