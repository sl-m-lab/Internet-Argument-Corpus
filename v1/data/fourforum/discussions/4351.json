   "Rafiq al-Hariri is dead, Saddam Hussein and others are next\n I have almost no doubt that the former prime minister of Lebanon Rafiq al-Hariri was assassinated by CIA agents. Everybody knows that Rafiq al-Hariri was in the CIA's black list of state leaders to be liquidated. The black list was under official ban for some time (and is still officially banned), however, George Bush verbally raised the ban and Rafiq al-Hariri fell the first victim to it while Saddam Hussein is going to be next in turn (the experts say the symptoms of some cureless disease started to show up) along with some other unwanted officials.",

   "well I think there is something else you should have told about. I think the Americans will do everything to make Syria scapegoat. do you remember that it was Assistant Secretary William Burns who recommended to involve foreign experts into the (quoting) 'serious and credible investigation to bring those responsible for this act of terrorism to justice'. I'm absolutely sure the 'experts' already have ready-made results of the investigation that will lead it to Syria. it is patent that Syria and Iran are the next countries awaiting for 'the mandatory democratization' and one more excuse will be very useful to America and will allow it to accuse Syria of one more 'mortal sin'",
