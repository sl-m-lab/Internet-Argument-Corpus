   "I'm not really familiar with Kadyrov, so I'll respond from what I read in the link you posted.\n It seems that the Kadyrov government was elected in a questionable manner, so perhaps he wasn't real popular. There were several previous attempts on his life, so it was inevitable i guess that he was killed.\n This situation has a similar setting as the one in Iraq.\n The father ran the country, while the son headed the security forces, with reports of citizens coming up amongst the missing.\n I get the impression this was a puppet government of Russia, so that sort of explaines why the rebels killed him. He also seemed to have changed sides in the conflict.\n Russia seems to be dealing with the son,so I don't look for things to change much, other than perhaps Russia retaliating against the rebels in some way.",

Mutually beneficial and it would bring our two countries closer together.\n\n You nearly hit the nail on the head; actually it was Putin who told the US that Russia wouldn't stand in its way during the time after 9/11 as long as the US would stop complaining about human rights violations committed by Russian troops in Chechneya.\n This nation gets wasted for years and the world doesn't care. Putin and his classical style of Russian leadership installed a puppet regime in Grozny so it is no wonder that an assassination attempt would sooner or later succeed.\n \n What is important to remember:\n Although both, the fighters in Iraq and the ones in Chechnya, are called 'terrorists' by their enemies this does not link these conflicts in any way. Making all wars part of the so-called 'war on terrorism' is a pretty common behaviour by governments in recent days.",
