Are we to say that those are lost souls? \n \n\n \n The kangaroo continues to huff and to puff\n And to try to pull the wool over others eyes with yucky fluffy stuff\n She does not want to believe that she heard\n The small yop from below: \"we are here, we are here\" was the word\n Screamed by those living in whoville who did not\n Want to be thrown in the burning beezlenut pot \n \n After the following quick survey we shall see\n That smallest human lives are still human indeed\n Just read what is said by the scientific community: \n \n \n As surprising as this may be to some people, there is no debate within the medical community as to when life begins. Life begins at conception. Therefore, every \"succesful\" abortion ends the life of a living human being. \n Consider the testimony below from an assortment of leading embryology textbooks:\n \n \n \n The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, 6th ed.\n Keith L. Moore, Ph.D. & T.V.N. Persaud, Md., (Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 1998), 2-18.\n \n \"[The Zygote] results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm. A zygote is the beginning of a new human being. Human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ... unites with a female gamete or oocyte ... to form a single cell called a zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.\"\n \n \n \n Essentials of Human Embryology\n William J. Larsen, (New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1998), 1-17.\n \n \"In this text, we begin our description of the developing human with the formation and differentiation of the male and female sex cells or gametes, which will unite at fertilization to initiate the embryonic development of a new individual. ... Fertilization takes place in the oviduct ... resulting in the formation of a zygote containing a single diploid nucleus. Embryonic development is considered to begin at this point... This moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.\"\n \n \n \n Human Embryology & Teratology\n Ronan R. O'Rahilly, Fabiola Muller, (New York: Wiley-Liss, 1996), 5-55.\n \n \"Fertilization is an important landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed... Fertilization is the procession of events that begins when a spermatozoon makes contact with a secondary oocyte or its investments... The zygote ... is a unicellular embryo... \"The ill-defined and inaccurate term pre-embryo, which includes the embryonic disc, is said either to end with the appearance of the primitive streak or ... to include neurulation. The term is not used in this book.\"\n \n Adding to the consensus of contemporary textbooks, is the testimony of older medical texts as well:\n \n  * Human Embryology, 3rd ed.\n Bradley M. Patten, (New York: McGraw Hill, 1968), 43.\n \n \"It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoan and resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitues the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual.\"\n \n * Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics\n J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, (Philadelphia: W.B. Sanders, 1974), 17.\n \n \"The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life.\"\n \n * Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed.\n E.L. Potter and J.M. Craig, (Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers, 1975), vii.\n \n \"Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition.\" \n \n In addition to the consistent testimony found in medical textbooks, there is some equally conclusive evidence that exists on the public record. In 1981, a United States Senate judiciary subcommittee received the following testimony from a collection of medical experts (Subcommittee on Separation of Powers to Senate Judiciary Committee S-158, Report, 97th Congress, 1st Session, 1981):\n \n  * Professor Micheline Matthews-Roth\n Harvard University Medical School\n \n \"It is incorrect to say that biological data cannot be decisive...It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception.\"\n \n * Dr. Alfred M. Bongioanni\n Professor of Pediatrics and Obstetrics, University of Pennsylvania\n \n \"I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception.\"\n \n * Dr. Jerome LeJeune\n Professor of Genetics, University of Descartes\n \n \"After fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. [It] is no longer a matter of taste or opinion...it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning, at conception.\"\n \n * Professor Hymie Gordon\n Mayo Clinic\n \n \"By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.\"\n \n * Dr. Watson A. Bowes\n University of Colorado Medical School\n \n \"The beginning of a single human life is from a biological point of view a simple and straightforward matter &#8211; the beginning is conception.\"\n \n The official Senate report reached this conclusion:\n \n Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being - a being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings.\n \n This, of course, should come as no surprise since the American Medical Association (AMA) declared as far back as 1857 (referenced in the Roe. v. Wade opinion) that \"the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being&#8221; is a matter of objective science. They deplored the &#8220;popular ignorance...that the foetus is not alive till after the period of quickening.&#8221; Doctors knew it during the 1800's and doctors know it today. Human life begins at conception.",

I must ask you though; you make this statement above so matter of factly as if you have hard evidence to support it. Do you? Because I am convinced that life begins at conception. And do you know what my evidence is? It is that only at the point that the egg and the sperm join that a fertilized egg STARTS TO GROW into an individual human being. And anyone with any scientific understanding at all knows and clearly understands that dead things don't GROW; much less grow into an individual that resembles the very people who's copulation produced the fertilized egg that grew into the child in question.\n \n This is pretty convincing evidence that life begins at conception.

   "Those may be textbook statements, but they're not based on objective scientific standards. In order to specify when life begins, you need a definition for life. Our current criteria for determining life are pretty bad; the same reasoning that causes most biologists to consider viruses not living dubs me not living.\n \n chloe, how do you define life? Are you prepared to justify this definition or list of criteria?\nI think that science really can't answer the question of what is a life as it is more of a moral question (not that you are saying science could answer it). One could also use an argument (and I don't use this one) that one should default to accepting all reasonable definitions of human life to be \"on the safe side\". A reasonable definition could be one that is held by a large amount of the population. \n \n Now i think science can tell us what is or isn't a human based on only science criteria. From what I have read it seems you could define any fertilized human egg as a human (noun). This doesn't mean much in terms of moral debate but there has been debate in the past on whether or not someone can use the term \"human\" in that manner. \n \n So to define human life I think one should consider it as a moral question as opposed to a science question. It is also a little more difficult now because you already have an answer you want to achieve. If you believe abortion is ok then you will want to formulate your \"human life\" definition around that. As a personal story I was actually \"pro choice\" before I actually considered the issues. The way I formulated a new position was taking what I already believe (don't kill innocent human life...[simplified]) and then decided what a human life is and followed that principal. In other words, I felt I didn't use result based reasoning to get a position. This is much harder to do, in my opinion, after the fact.",

I've checked many a biology textbook for a definition or list of criteria to distinguish life from non-life. Every definition proper I've ever found is extremely lacking. (Example: a book might define [living] organism as \"any individual living creature, either unicellular or multicellular\" but then it defines cell as \"the smallest unit of life,\" so we get nowhere.) Most books use a list of criteria that include metabolism, ability to reproduce, self-preservation, genetics, and usually a couple others. These generally do a decent job of distinguishing \"life\" from \"non-life\" if we use our preconceived notions of what is living and what is not as a standard for comparison. (But this begs the question: if we're using preconceived notions as the standard, why do we need the definition?)\n My conclusion is this: A zygote fails to meet most of these criteria. It should not be considered alive by people looking to use a scientific interpretation of the facts. It has no ability to reproduce, no metabolism, no method for even expressing the desire for self-preservation. It reaches these stages later, when it is capable of surviving in a natural environment outside of the womb.\n Note that this line of argumentation that turns a blind eye to other issues is not meant to be presented as the only valid (or even the most valid) approach.",

Nowhere did brutus even hint that he was even thinking about implying this.\n \n So why would you imply that he was saying something so ridiculous? \n\n \n Because he is taking the debate to a completely absurd place TQ. How can you possibly compare a cancerous tumor to an unborn human being and expect me to respect your analogy. I dare you to take any normal average seventh grader and ask him or her to answer the following question true or false and see what they say to the question; \"An unborn baby is the same thing as a cancerous tumor that grows and kills its carrier\" TRUE or FALSE! How many 13 year old children would equate the two as the least bit similar or comparable at all?\n \n None would in my opinion, especially since they are so much closer to experiencing the newness of life. So why shouldn't I scoff at allegedly intelligent adults making such stupid and absurd analogies regarding the unborn? \n \n \nSo not only are you talented at building strawmen to slay, you can also read minds? A double threat...\n\n \n The only strawman builder here is brutus for comparing an unborn human being to a cancerous tumor. And how incredibly sad that you are blind to that fact.\n \n \nHere we see the typical tactic of using emotive language to demonize one side while sanctifying another.\n \n When something grows it's alive? That's your reasonable evidence? Then brutus' assertion that a tumour is alive is proven by your evidence.\n\n \n That argument might work if you weren't now redefining the debate. Remember tq, it was brutus who first stated that, and I quote: My argument was bait. We can't define a per se beginning of life So he denied that the beginning of life can be defined, and therefore determined. He also went on to say this: Tumors start to grow when you are exposed to radiation. And they grow and live independently of you, in as much as your body has no control over those cells, much like a zygote.  Are they too human?   \n \n Are they too human? Huh? And you wonder why I reacted at such an incredibly inaccurate statement that attempts to compare cancer to a human being? You say above that brutus was right to say that a cancerous tumor is alive, but i have clearly shown where he compares a tumor to being like a human in order to marginalize a developing human baby to that of a cancerous tumor. And you're trying to insist his point is accurate?\n \n \nNot in all cases,no. But are you going to claim that no woman has ever died in child birth, or that there are not significant health risks associated with pregnancy?\n\n \n Of course not. I have two daughters so I have run the complete gambit of emotions and concerns that my daughters either wouldn't be born healthy, or that my wife would experience life threatening problems in child birth. But just because complications in child birth DO happen, that in no way delegates child bearing as equivalent with a DISEASE; which is precisely what the argument that you're defending implies that you believe.\n \n And can a more SEXIST argument for defending and justifying abortion even be conceived of? I think not.\n \n \nWhy do you insist on painting anyone who disagrees with you as a greedy, fraudulent demon? \n\n \n I said this tq: \n \n \nYour side has never wanted to actually deal with when life begins; only protecting this billion dollar industry.\n\n \n Now how is this calling anyone a DEMON?

No where, in no way, did anyone say a tumour was to be considered \"human\". It was an analogy used to show the errors in your argument.\n \n \nOf course not. I have two daughters so I have run the complete gambit of emotions and concerns that my daughters either wouldn't be born healthy, or that my wife would experience life threatening problems in child birth. But just because complications in child birth DO happen, that in no way delegates child bearing as equivalent with a DISEASE; which is precisely what the argument that you're defending implies that you believe.\n\n See above.\n \n \nAnd can a more SEXIST argument for defending and justifying abortion even be conceived of? I think not.\n\n How is that sexist? \n \n \nAre you denying that abortion is a multi billion dollar business now?\n\n Are you implying that the sole reason for abortions being made available is to make people these billions of dollars?\n *I see you edited while I posted-You are implying that the doctors/health care workers providing this service are solely interested in making money, and that they will fight tooth and nail to continue to do so, with no regard for the welfare of their patients. It's very similar to your reasoning behind rejecting scientific research-ie the scientists can't be trusted because it's a multi-billion dollar industry, so they say what will get them the grant money and get their name in the journals. You are effectively labeling an entire profession as corrupt, fraudulent, money-grubbing liars.\n \n Do you plan to address any of the questions I asked you, now that I stated the \"tumour\" argument was merely to show the complexities in defining \"life\"?",

Unless you cannot read beyond foxes and grapes, you would rather benefit for a consideration of Seuss as political theory.\n \n Hope I didn't seriously de-rail your Roe V Wade Party.\n\n \n I agree completely with your opinion on Seuss's metaphorical style of writing and his Socially conscious influence in his writing. And you have also validated the opinion that it is very possible that \"Horton Hears a Who\" was a metaphor for the value of the unborn according to Seuss just as chloe implied in her statement that it has a very pro life message.\n \n \n\"A person's a person no matter how small\"\n \n Horton Hears a Who is a great movie and has a great pro-life message. Everyone should go see it and take their kids.\n",

   "That's only if you assume that the man remains celibate. Each spermatozoon has the same \"potential\" whether the man is celibate or not.\n \n\n \n What does the man remaining celibate have to do with my hypothetical about his sperm never growing into a sentient being unless it is deposited into a fertile uterus? And I'm not playing the what if game at all. I'm pointing out that if a sperm remains inside the man it will never grow into a human being; but if it fertilizes with a woman's egg, it can grow into a human being. No matter how you slice it, that happens every day. \n \n \nGestation parameters are not absolute. Nature sometimes determines that it won't remain in the womb until it matures. You're saying that these things are certainties, but you're lacing your arguments with conditionals. If there is no spontaneous abortion. If there is no deleterious genetic defect. There is no such thing as a conditional absolute, Archie.\n\n \n I know there are no absolutes lyte! Do you think that I don't know about premature births, deformed children or spontaneous miscarriages? Why do you speak down to me as if I'm some XXXXX? How many child births have you been through lyte? The bottom line is that nothing you have written here has anything to do with what you're supposedly responding to. This was the point I was making, and as you can see you've ignored it completely.\n \n \n \n Now let's take that sperm and inseminate a woman with it. That sperm fertilizes an egg from her and IMMEDIATELY THE TWO BECOME ONE AND THEY START TO GROW. Now that fertilized egg is still in its natural environment, It's in the womb where nature determined it would remain until it matures, and if allowed to complete its gestation period that carries with it absolute parameters, then in that 9 month period a fully developed human being will be born with all of the potential that you yourself possesses.\n\n \n So try again and this time read my argument and actually respond to it if you can.\n \n \nI know perfectly well what grows in the womb. The crux, as I tried to point out earlier, is what characteristics you choose to assign that entity. As I exposed above, you're having to jump through hoops and use conditional necessities to support your argument.\n\n \n You exposed nothing above. You focused on irrelevant minutia rather than responding to any points I was actually making. Even though millions of babies a year are born every year in PRECISELY the same exact way, (and I know about artificial insemination so don't even try to correct me.) So I haven't used any conditional necessities but have pointed out reality in what and who unborn babies are. What you don't like is that I humanize them and speak of them with respectful terms such as unborn children instead of your preferred term of zygote which is meant to totally dehumanize them. That some how relieves your guilt about justifying the wholesale slaughter of them.",

I think it's shocking that people can doubt a dr. who has had such an intimate knowledge of reproduction as an ObGyn. He has treated pregnant women at every stage of inutero development and knows better than any of us the complete process of growth and development that an unborn child goes through, only to ultimately become a human being just like we are if only allowed to grow.\n \n Every argument the pro abortionist offers is nothing more than rationalizing, justifying, making excuses and obfuscating their very real responsibility for supporting the murder of unborn, but perfectly viable babies who need no special care at all beyond what any other pregnant woman needs that wants her baby; but only needs the opportunity to grow to term. That is murder by any definition of the word, and Ron Paul learned that through first hand experience.

Essentially all physicians who perform abortions are ObGyn's.\n\n \n No problem moose. I just thought it was worth correcting. And although you're right about ObGyn's, here are some stats you might find interesting. \n \n http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E6DA1339F93BA25752C0A96E958260\n Today, 59 percent of all abortion doctors are at least 65 years old. That's not a typo: nearly two-thirds are beyond legal retirement age. Most doctors who perform abortions specialize in obstetrics and gynecology; according to a study done three years ago, the percentage of OB-GYN's willing to perform abortions dropped from 42 percent in 1983 to 33 percent in 1995. (Doctors going into what's called family-practice medicine were thought by some to be part of the next generation of abortion providers, but a study published in October revealed that only 15 percent of chief residents doing family practice had any experience with the simplest abortion procedure.)\n \n OB-GYN's learn the surgeries and procedures associated with abortion during their hospital residency programs. A 1991 study showed that only 12 percent of these programs now routinely teach abortion, and, according to Philip Darney, a professor at the University of California at San Francisco's medical school, all indications are that the percentage is ''still trending down.''\n \n One factor in this is the growth in hospital mergers.-- Many bring together institutions with no religious affiliation and Catholic hospital chains like the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother. The Catholic Church is, of course, firmly against abortion, and typically, one immediate result of this sort of merger is the elimination of abortion training and birth-control counseling.\n \n Few medical schools dare to even mention, much less teach, the mere facts of abortion. My wife finished medical school last year. She never heard the word ''abortion'' mentioned in a classroom. Which medical school was it that neglects to expose students to what is one of the most common surgeries among American women? Yale.",

That it's ok to be socially irresponsible and screw the consequences because abortion is an easy enough way out of any problem. Rather than that option that just leaves the woman feeling spiritually empty and worthless as a human being; we take them in, love them through the pain of going through such a life altering experience alone. We give support, training and counseling while even offering adoption if a woman decides she just can't handle the responsibility. But my greatest sense of satisfaction has always come from keeping mother and child together as a family.\n \n But of course you and matt expect all anti abortion advocates to lock women up and force them to have babies as they are further dehumanized as a prisoner.

And you wonder why this Country is so screwed up? \n \n \nIt teaches her that she has rights to her personal integrity.\n\n \n PERSONAL INTEGRITY????? Are you kidding me? Are you so lacking in any understanding of reality that you think women who MURDER their own unborn children actually walk away with their personal integrity intact rather than being haunted by a deep and very personal guilt? Don't you understand that for all of the pro-abortionists excuses and justifications for this infanticide, in the end, in that woman's reality, she knows deep within her HUMAN SOUL that she has killed her own baby? And here's some evidence of the after effects of this National disgrace called abortion. http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/ASMF/asmf14.html\n \n Is Abortion Safe?\n Psychological Consequences:\n \n Clinical research provides a growing body of scientific evidence that having an abortion can cause psychological harm to some women. \"Women who report negative after-effects from abortion know exactly what their problem is,\" observed psychologist Wanda Franz, Ph.D., in a March 1989 congressional hearing on the impact of abortion. \"They report horrible nightmares of children calling them from trash cans, of body parts, and blood,\" Franz told the Congressional panel. \"When they are reminded of the abortion,\" Franz testified, \"the women re-experienced it with terrible psychological pain ... They feel worthless and victimized because they failed at the most natural of human activities -- the role of being a mother.\"[106]\n \n The emergence of chemical abortion methods poses a new possibly more devastating psychological threat. Unlike surgical abortions, in which women rarely see the cut up body parts, women having chemical abortions often do see the complete tiny bodies of their unborn children and are even able to distinguish the child&#8217;s developing hands, eyes, etc. [107] So traumatic is this for some women that both patients and researchers involved in these studies have recommended that women unprepared for the experience of seeing their aborted children not take the drugs. [108] Long-term psychological implications of this experience have not been studied.\n \n Researchers on the after-effects of abortion have identified a pattern of psychological problems known as Post-Abortion Syndrome (PAS). Women suffering PAS may experience drug and alcohol abuse, personal relationship disorders, sexual dysfunction, repeated abortions, communications difficulties, damaged self-esteem, and even attempt suicide. Post-Abortion Syndrome appears to be a type of pattern of denial which may last for five to ten years before emotional difficulties surface. [109]\n \n Now that some clinicians have established that there is an identifiable patterns to PAS, they face a new challenge. What is still unknown is how widespread psychological problems are among women who have had abortions. A Los Angeles Times survey in 1989 found that 56% of women who had abortions felt guilty about it, and 26% \"mostly regretted the abortion.\"[110] Clinicians&#8217; current goal should be to conduct extensive national research studies to obtain data on the psychological after-effects of abortion.[111]\n \n With the growing awareness of Post Abortion Syndrome in scholarly and clinical circles, women with PAS can expect to receive a more sensitive appreciation of the suffering that they endure. Fortunately, a growing network of peer support groups of women who have had abortions offers assistance to women who are experiencing emotional difficulties.\n \n Many post-abortive women have also been speaking out publicly about their own abortion experiences and the healing process they went through.. Women or family members seeking information about this particular outreach can contact American Victims of Abortion, 419 7th Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C., 20004.\n \nIt teaches her that the government has limits to its power.\n\n \n The Government is charged with one main responsibility. And that is to insure \"LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS\" for all of its CITIZENS, no matter how small they are. And if the Government refuses to protect the most innocent and weakest among us CAPO, then how safe are any of us in the long run?\n \n \nIt teaches her the importance of choice in a free society.\n\n \n Why am I not surprised. You think that enabling her to commit infanticide is actually giving her a choice. How pathetically, and typically liberal of you. Forget the consequences to her from the guilt and sense of failure as a woman for resorting to such a senseless act as a solution for her problems; Forget that she just learned to run from her responsibilities in life and to justify and excuse her mistakes, by killing if need be. \n \n \nIt teaches her to tell the likes of you where to go.\n\n \n Actually, it's people like me that these girls and women come to for real help once they get a full serving of your lip service that accomplishes nothing more than to aggravate an already serious problem by telling them that the only solution is to kill their baby; that with enough cash they can solve their problem through infanticide. We help her to stop and calmly look at their situation and look down the road of life at the long term affects of todays decisions. Not just at the next 9 months and the allegedly immediate, yet shallow solution that abortion offers.\n \n \nBTW, in case you haven't noticed, I'm bhbcu64. You must be having an Alzheimer's moment to twice call me someone else. \n \n Does this occur frequently to you?\n\n \n Look Capo, you and I both know that you have already been banned twice here already.

You'll not see the gruesome mass graves of Mao or Stalin where 40,000,000 people have been killed by their govt. Have we made mistakes? Sure, what countries haven't. But the difference is, our goals. Our goal, the main goal of for US as it pertains to the people of other countries, is to help them achieve the freedom, both economic and political, that we enjoy. We don't wish the world to be run by dictators (even 'friendly' dictators). In Iraq, we don't quash free speech.

Embryos and fetuses are fully and individually human from the moment of fertilization on. If this were not true, if unborn children were not demonstrably human, there would be no need to even talk about rights of personhood. \"Removing a fetus\" would be the moral equivalent of pulling a tooth. This, however, is not the case, and so the debate must now enter the political arena.\n \n There is a very real sense in which the need to answer this second question is, in itself, an absurdity.

This fact should be enough. The intrinsic humanity of unborn children, by definition, makes them persons and should, therefore, guarantee their protection under the law. For more than thirty years, however, this has not been the case. The situation we are left with is this. In America today, there is a huge and singular group of living human beings who have no protection under the law and are being killed en masse every day. Is that not astounding?! It is astounding, but not wholly unprecedented.\n \n There have been at least two other instances in American history in which specific groups of human beings were stripped of their rights of personhood as a means of justifying their horrible mistreatment. African-Americans and Native-Americans both felt the brunt of a system which denied their humanity, stripped their personhood and subjected them to horrors beyond measure. While the legal framework that made such injustice possible has now been removed, it remains firmly in place for unborn Americans.\n \n There remains one, and only one, group of human beings in the U.S. today for which being human is not enough. The inconvenience of their existence has resulted in a legal loophole of shameful proportions. What is a person? A person is a human being (unless, of course, you haven't been born yet, in which case we'll define personhood in any way possible so as to exclude you, kill you and forget you).\n \n Welcome to America.",

   "Just remember that there are others who are just a moral as you who do not accept that assumption.\n\n And they are wrong.\n \n \nNow, to the crux of your misguided post.\n \n Please tell the forum just exactly how this \"large collection of individual people who are entitled to impose their will\" CAN impose its will unless it is given the law's sanction to do so?\n\n The large collection of individual people are the lawgivers. They are the sovereign. They do not need the law's sanction to do so because the people collectively make the law. \n \n \nHow else can this \"large collection of individual people who are entitled to impose their will\" do so unless there is some means for coercing those who do not accept its demands without punishment for those who do not do so?\n\n Abortion once was universally criminalized in the United States, and there were no sanctions against the woman.\n \n \nThus, it must needs follow that, in order for this \"large collection of individual people who are entitled to impose their will\", it must be allowed imprison or execute those who would extinguish the lives of what you call \"little people\".\n\n Of course the people have the authority to imprison or execute those who violate the law. But they also have the authority to attach lesser sanctions if they so choose. They even have the authority to only hold those responsible who actually performed the abortion, which has been the mode in the United States. \n \n \nSo I ask again, are you and your ilk ready to see women and their doctors going to prison or to the execution chambers in order that you may work your will on them?\n\n I, for one, believe women should be held responsible for freely consenting to an abortion under the law if we are going to criminalize it. I do recognize, however, that that might not be possible given the cultural climate. But I by no means believe that just because our cultural climate is deficient, I therefore must consent to or accept a policy of abortion on demand for any reason or no reason at all.",

One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's attitudes toward life and family and their values, and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to influence and to color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion. \n \n Does anyone have an issue with the truth of his statement?",

   "There are essentially two issues which must be resolved concerning unborn embryos and fetuses. The first is, \"Are they human beings?\" The second is, \"Should they be recognized as persons under the law?\" \n \n We've already established that there is no debate on the first question. Embryos and fetuses are fully and individually human from the moment of fertilization on. If this were not true, if unborn children were not demonstrably human, there would be no need to even talk about rights of personhood. \"Removing a fetus\" would be the moral equivalent of pulling a tooth. This, however, is not the case, and so the debate must now enter the political arena.\n \n There is a very real sense in which the need to answer this second question is, in itself, an absurdity. If you look up the word \"person\" in your average dictionary (we'll use Webster's), you'll find something like this:\n \n Person n. A human being.\n \n A person, simply put, is a human being. This fact should be enough. The intrinsic humanity of unborn children, by definition, makes them persons and should, therefore, guarantee their protection under the law. For more than thirty years, however, this has not been the case. The situation we are left with is this. In America today, there is a huge and singular group of living human beings who have no protection under the law and are being killed en masse every day. Is that not astounding?! It is astounding, but not wholly unprecedented.\n \n There have been at least two other instances in American history in which specific groups of human beings were stripped of their rights of personhood as a means of justifying their horrible mistreatment. African-Americans and Native-Americans both felt the brunt of a system which denied their humanity, stripped their personhood and subjected them to horrors beyond measure. While the legal framework that made such injustice possible has now been removed, it remains firmly in place for unborn Americans.\n \n There remains one, and only one, group of human beings in the U.S. today for which being human is not enough. The inconvenience of their existence has resulted in a legal loophole of shameful proportions. What is a person? A person is a human being (unless, of course, you haven't been born yet, in which case we'll define personhood in any way possible so as to exclude you, kill you and forget you).\n \n Welcome to America.\n\n \n For you a person or a human being is simply code strings of DNA, or because there are possible \"what ifs\", potentials. It could become a person, if this happens and that doesn't happen. Because there are a wide range of possibilities, one which would lead to a baby; this one potentiality of a baby, makes it an actual baby.\n \n The sperm and egg also have DNA. If these go through one further process, sperm fertilizes egg and nothing natural interferes afterward, there will also be a potential baby. The fertilized egg has one more potential, only one further possibility of becoming a baby, compared to the sperm or egg seperately.\n \n Are more potentials what makes it a human person, or more DNA? This one stage, the fertilized egg stage, is held up as sacred. It seems to be in a contrived way. Nature is the biggest destroyer of these things. It's made an issue of, only if the woman takes control, or if she loses something she really wanted. In the latter case, those are her own hopes and dreams of the future, which give it a special significance to her. \n \n Many Americans, and Canadians would say that without a sentient person's right and freedom to choose, sentient life has no meaning.",

What the abortion issue boils down to is control over a person's body.

You couldn't force me to donate a kidney that would save the life of another. You can't force a woman to carry a baby to term. Her right to liberty/freedom supersedes the 'potential' rights of the 'potential' person. We cannot allow our govt. to start managing what we can or can't do in the doctors office. \n \n I understand the pro-life position. And I agree that the fetus is alive. But that doesn't supersede the physical integrity, the borders if you will, of the woman's body. Our govt. doesn't have the power to make her carry a baby to term that she doesn't want to carry to term. The govt. has no business sitting in the doctor's office with us.\n \n Imagine-- If they one day come up with a way to take stem cells and make new hearts out of them, but only 1% of adults have these particular stem cells. Imagine if one person's cells could grow hearts for 1000 sick people that would absolutely die without them. Imagine now that the operation is nearly painless and I'd only be in the hospital for 4 hours. Could the govt. FORCE me to have the opp oration, even to save 1000 people? No. It wasn't given that power in the constitution so it doesn't have the right, even though by not harvesting the cells those people are sentenced to die.\n \n Now using that logic how could the govt. have the power to tell a woman what she can or can't do with her body in her doctor's office. The integrity of our bodies can't be violated without due process. The govt. just wasn't ever given that authority.",

But you seem to be saying (I suppose I could be wrong) that a law may not be passed to prohibit abortion, and that is what I disagree with.\n \n \n \nI understand that pro-life's main goal is to have an unborn baby be declared a citizen. But the problem is you cannot subjugate a woman to her womb (her womb) and the constitution doesn't give the govt. the power to do this. The framers never intended to have the govt. intrude into the physicians' examine room. They (from Locke on) knew that true human freedom started with the sanctity of the individual's body [ie. no unlawful search, no 'cruel and unusual' punishment, right to bear arms (to protect one's person)].\n\n In order to be precise, this might be a little more detailed than necessary. The Federal constitution certainly has nothing to say about abortion one way or the other. Given that fact, the principle of federalism espoused in the Amendments 9 and 10 would grant the individual states the authority to decide their abortion policy. I don't know which state you live in, but abortion happens not to be covered in my state's constitution either, and as a result, the state is entitled and has the authority to prohibit doctors from performing abortions, and punishing those who choose do. This is why the states, historically and prior to Roe v. Wade, enacted laws that prohibited abortion.\n \n \nWrong, you could try to make ANY law you'd like, but the courts would knock it down as 'unconstitutional'. That's why we have checks and balances--to protect us from tyranny, even tyranny of the majority!\n\n It would be an interesting day indeed when a court would attempt to strike down a constitutional amendment.

The fight over assisted suicide will one of the last victories necessary for a truly secular society. It is purely from a religious standpoint that the right of an individual to choose when and how they die has been disallowed. If you remove the religious connotations of suicide if becomes nothing more than another right of control over the individual's body. Many localities are beginning to see it that way and the right to die is being granted in more and more places. Soon enough the power of the individual will assert itself over the antiquated religious notions of the past.\n\n First of all, it is perfectly plausible to deny on secular grounds that a right to suicide exists for the simple reason that the premises of secularism are just as unprovable as the premises of any other religion.\n \n Second of all, a truly secular society is not desirable since it removes the only possible grounds for the actual existence of rights; that is, it removes the rational possibility that rights are real. Secularists can argue that rights are necessary, or that they are nice little things. But they cannot say that rights are real for the simple fact that rights are metaphysical; they are moral claims.\n \n Society might be fine for a little while understanding that rights really don't actually exist, but that it should act as though they do. Sometime, however, some majority will trample the rights of some minority for some pragmatic, practical, or expedient reason on the basis that rights aren't real.",

The Federal Govt. can nullify a state law if it violates the constitutional rights of the citizens of that state, that's what I mean by the fed. gov. protects civil rights.\nFree speech? What does hair color have to do with free speech? You can't walk around nude yet this isn't a violation of the constitution under free speech. Privacy isn't a right anywhere in the constitution and due process was done by the fact that it was voted on by 99% of the people. What more process could was required? \n \n And of course a state law is nullified by a violation in the constitution but it first has to be in the constitution (and the constitution doesn't talk about everything) and second any court can nullify it...doesn't have to be done on a federal court level.\n \n \nSee above (Defininately 1st, also 4th and 8th amendments)\n8th? How is requiring a hair color a punishment? That makes no sense. The first amendment violation I think has no merit either. Requiring people to act a certain way has nothing to do with speech. And how can it violate the 4th when nothing is being searched and seized? I don't think those are valid arguments. Please explain if you think they are.\n \n \n \n\n Yes, I agree with you that the states have some powers and the fed govt. has other powers too. The constitution itself states that anything not enumerated in it is reserved for the people/states. But the fed. judiciary can find that a state law is unconstitutional, as they would for the green hair law.\nI see absolutely no provision that could strike down a law requiring green hair. States have always restricted dress codes and actions...for better or worse. Whether or not the idea is crazy or stupid is irrelevant to whether or not it is constitutional. I think this is something people don't understand. A crazy law is not always unconstitutional. For example, sodomy laws are not unconstitutional (despite what the recent court has said) yet those are dumb laws because they are not really enforceable and really don't serve a good purpose. Laws against marijuana seem to be rather stupid when you allow tobacco yet those too are constitutional. And finally, laws requiring companies to not have Trans-Fats are, in my opinion, stupid and probably unfair laws but those are constitutional. The constitution is a very limited document for a very good reason. It is meant to give the greatest power to the people to decide for themselves how they want to be run. When you start claiming everything is in the constitution you get a rigid system of government that doesn't flow with the people and grants the greatest power to those put in charge of determining what the constitution says.\n \n \nA state can't refuse a federal law (for instance, the FBI can arrest someone in CA for pot even though they have a pot prescription).\n Indeed they can. \n \n \nIf the states don't follow federal guidelines the fed can withhold money but the fed can force other issues, such as they did with integration.\nThe federal government, no doubt, has tools it can use to help states conform. This doesn't mean they are above the states in terms of power and authority as the states have the power to dissolve the federal government.",

   "The only thing I can add to this discussion is that, up to now, in law, rights have been given to born people only, with the assumption that all born people are persons. This has been so consistent during our lifetimes that we take for granted the concept of born people being persons without needing to go into details of what defines a person. \n \n Since the concept of personhood has thus been vaguelly but not specifically defined, there is a lot of disagreement on whether the concept of person with rights applies to the unborn. \n \n I continue to think that we are not having a specific enough discussion on the details of what constitues a person. I, and many others, think that at least two attributes are needed for personhood and, thus, rights:\n 1) The being in question is human - i.e. has human DNA.\n 2) The being in question has at least a rudimentary mental existence.\n \n Instead of such a list of characteristics of \"person\" to aid in defining it, pro-life people consistently say that \"life starts from conception\" without analyzing what that means. So many times, I have asked the question - \"What specific changes occur to the unfertilized egg at conception that changes a non-person to a person?\" and have been met with silence. The only way I can interpret that silence is to say that pro-life people do not have an answer that can stand up to scrutiny, so they remain silent.\n \n If those on the pro-life side want to convince others of their view of all the unborn as people, they need to be far more specific on the DETAILS of their view.\nI can only guess that not wanting to broach the subject of soul, they are forced to try to dance on the head of a pin.",

   "The wealth and health of nations and their peoples are inextricably connected to birth control and the woman's right to control her own body. Denial or inaccessibility of family planning leads to the deaths of untold numbers of young children throughout the developing world because parents cannot invest enough in each individual child to ensure his or her survival. We, as with any other species, naturally tend to produce far more offspring than can reasonably hope to survive. Something is going to kill our babies, one way or another. Through family planning - and yes, as a last resort, abortion - we take ownership of that responsibility rather than entrusting it to an indifferent mother nature.\n \n Legal termination thresholds are determined by our best understanding of minimising potential suffering. Whether your personal squeamishness would preclude you from aborting a foetus at that stage is a matter for you and any foetuses you may happen to be carrying at the time. Abortions are not performed for sport and are rarely undergone lightly. Enforcing an unwanted birth often achieves nothing more than denying a young woman the chance to prepare better circumstances for herself and a later, planned child.",

I would disagree with those views since, as you know, I do view the fetus as gaining rights of personhood once it gains mental existence. Luckily for women with an unwanted pregnancy, this happens quite late in the pregnancy so she would have had roughly six months to decide. The onset of fetal rights would represent a sort of deadline for her to make that decision.

Though I also have some fears of the slippery slope, my view is that, in these forums, we are not making laws but are arguing for the most logical positions, so we must make as honest arguements as we can.

   "[QUOTE]\nReally? Then why can't I choose to kill you? Are you suggesting we can treat people differently...or rather grant them different natural rights? \n\n \n You could, if our ship sank and the only way for me to live was for you to swim, dragging me to shore while performing mouth to mouth the whole time, you'd be within your right to let me drown. The fetus is completely Dependant on a fully formed, thinking person who must have the choice as to whether they will carry and care for the unborn. Again, without the right to control her reproductive system, a woman would be an unequal member of society as compared to males. Society could never even pretend to have equal rights if that existed so there goes your theory out the window anyway. It just so happens that a fetus, inside someone has to have their permission to be brought to term.\n \n \nHow does it not make them on equal terms with men? Seems that allowing the abortion would grant the power to kill to a woman and not a man thus making it unequal. \n\n \n A woman can accidentally get pregnant anytime she has sex. Men can do whatever they want and never have to worry about it (and believe me, if men could carry babies, there would never have been laws against abortion). If abortion was illegal, then a woman would either have to abstain from sex or risk being FORCED to carry a baby she doesn't want, possibly ruining her career and/or many other life goals, going through the pain of birth, then either having to raise the baby or give it up, possibly causing both mental anguish now and later. That's why. Women would never be in complete control of their life.\n \n \nYou mean if you make woman responsible for her actions she won't be in control of her life. Two thins with this, no one is in complete control of their life and if you allow abortion you say that person has no control of their life. You rank persons in terms of importance. Tell me how that is equal? Tell me where in history has telling some people they have rights and other people they don't ever worked? It didn't work in the holocaust or slavery or in Africa or in Asia and it doesn't work for abortion.\n \n \n We tell people they don't have the same rights as someone else all the time. A pregnancy can happen even if all precautions are used. The sentient, formed, woman can't be forced to grow something in her body that she doesn't want in there. In any dispute there is a winner and a loser. In this case the 'soon to be person' can't force someone to pay that kind of price to give them birth. The 'baby' doesn't have control of their life. They can't survive without the full support of the mother's body. This forms a relationship that must be voluntarily entered into by the person who is being completely 'used' as the life giver.\n \n \nThen why were you so upset that the woman was to be unequal? Now inequality is ok? \n\n \n For a completely dependent unformed insentient being that can't survive without complete aid from the mother.  Its the same reason we can unplug the machines keeping people alive! When someone's a veg. its fine to unplug the machine. Think of the mother of that machine.\n \n Got to go to bed. G-night.",

It's applied in a context-sensitive manner, just as many other laws are applied.

When you say \"right to ones own body is above the right to a unborn\" as an argument for abortion then you can't add arguments or you render the original argument useless. You get to the point where you ask \"why does is this true in this case but not this case\" and the answer comes to a different argument. For example you could say \"well the unborn is not a person\". So the real argument is not that you have a right to your own body above that of the unborn but rather an unborn is not a person and therefore has no rights as a person. But when you give reasons like \"too much burden\" then you can apply that equally and identically to a one year old and yet we come out with a different answer. The standard then becomes too complicated and it makes it seem that the conclusion is reached and a means to get there is trying to be found.",

I don't believe, as declared in the DoI, that rights are endowed by our government.\n\n To claim that they are endowed by anyone else you would need to prove the existence of said authority. To prove they are guaranteed by anyone else you would need to further prove that said authority can be prevailed upon to arbitrate.\n \n I could, for instance, claim that the Flying Spaghetti Monster endows me with the right to turn invisible by clicking my fingers. I click my fingers and nothing happens - to whom do I appeal?\n \n Yes, that's a spurious and silly example. But let's say I claim instead that the Flying Spaghetti Monster endows me with the right to life. If that right is threatened, can the FSM intervene and rule in my favour? I think you would agree it cannot. Thus it is with any and all rights, regardless of their perceived moral value: they must be guaranteed by a potent authority in order to be valid. \n \nWhat does this have to do with what you claimed I claimed? Nothing there suggest this.\n\n The question you posed clearly indicated skepticism that a consistent application of law was possible if a foetus's status as a person was not in doubt. I am not responsible for your choice of words, and I am confident any observer would agree with my interpretation of them.\n \n If you did not intend to express such skepticism, then I have to ask: what was the purpose of the question? If you believe it possible to revoke or overrule an unborn's rights without first declaring it a non-person, what did you hope to gain by posing a hypothetical where the foetus's personhood was not in doubt?\n \n \nWhether there is any doubt is not reason for a trial. There is no \"right to trial if and only if doubt exists\"\n\n Fine, have it your way: force every woman seeking an abortion to prove in a court of law that she is the mother and the foetus she is carring is a foetus, thus demonstrating that the appropriate law applies and she is eligable for an abortion. Will that make you feel better?\n \nIn any event, I think the point is crazy because being a fetus is not illegal.\n\n Nor is being a father illegal, yet a court can rule (favourably or otherwise) based on paternity.\n \nWhy can't the mother kill them as done in abortion? Because there is another option? If so, what if that option is not immediately available?\n\n Then suffering will ensue, just as it may if abortion is not immediately available. Are you trying to argue that because the system isn't perfect it should be discarded?\n \nHere I thought we were having a reasonable discussion and you throw in a petty insult. If this is the way you choose to debate then don't waste my time.\n\n I apologise without reservation; you are correct that it was petty and unnecessary.\n \nI mean you change the targeted argument or modify it slightly or add other details. I don't think this can be done when arguing against a single argument. Also, what contradiction?\n\n As I mentioned, your earlier question presupposed that the personhood of a foetus was not in doubt. You would not have done that unless you believed it pivotal to your argument. Yet you have subsequently insisted that you have no problem with the selective revocation of rights without declaring someone a non-person. Where does this leave your argument?\n \nIn terms of that argument they were identical circumstances. I don't believe one can add details that aren't effected by the argument at hand.\n\n But what is your justification for ignoring the ways in which the circumstances differ? If you are free to do so on a whim, I can do the same and ignore the context which allows us to discriminate between an innocent and a criminal, and thus declare that laws of incarceration are unsafe and unjust. Please, explain why you are allowed to ignore context while I am not.\n \nHere you take the argument and expand it beyond its meaning. You claim only legal rights why I am speaking of moral ones.\n\n There are only legal rights. They may reflect certain moral values but there is no obligation for them to do so. Does your argument then boil down to a complaint that the law does not reflect your personal moral beliefs?\n \nIf you don not believe in such then that is fine but I don't have to follow your rules when debating. The argument was regarding a \"right to body\" over a \"right to life\" and whether or not this is applied equally to persons.\n\n And you have so far provided no justification for making this arbitrary generalisation. I maintain that there is no ambiguity, no riskiness, no slippery-slope inherent in a law which singles out the circumstances of a mother and her foetus. There is no chance of such a law being used by CUNxTime to defend a physical assault on your person, so why are you trying to say there is?\n \n \nIn the event of a criminal no right is overriding a right\n\n Oh, but there is. A criminals rights are infringed by incarceration, on the grounds that the rights of others will be thus better preserved.\n \nWhen you add circumstances to the argument I make they need to be in context of the argument itself.\n\n Why, if the argument is spurious and arbitrary? Why should I not point that out?\n \n Abortion law is clear, and applies only to a mother and her foetus. You've tried to call the validity of that law into question by tossing out context and pretending the law applies to persons in general. Why should I play along? The law doesn't apply to persons in general; your game of 'what if' is not one I need play.",

   "Our posts are getting too long so I have chosen not to respond to some things. If I missed something please just ask me to answer it.\n \n \nTo claim that they are endowed by anyone else you would need to prove the existence of said authority. To prove they are guaranteed by anyone else you would need to further prove that said authority can be prevailed upon to arbitrate.\nI stated it was a belief and if I didn't then I am now :). But my belief derives morality. I don't use the law as a basis for morality. \n \n \nThe question you posed clearly indicated skepticism that a consistent application of law was possible if a foetus's status as a person was not in doubt. I am not responsible for your choice of words, and I am confident any observer would agree with my interpretation of them.\nWell if my words were taken that way let me just clear it up by saying I do not refer to the law because something could be consistent with the law yet the law can be inconsistent itself. \n \n \nIf you did not intend to express such skepticism, then I have to ask: what was the purpose of the question? If you believe it possible to revoke or overrule an unborn's rights without first declaring it a non-person, what did you hope to gain by posing a hypothetical where the foetus's personhood was not in doubt?\nTo avoid the personhood argument altogether actually. In other words, I didn't want to get an answer to the \"rights of mother over rights of ____\" to be \"because _____ is not a person\". So the hypothetical was merely to see if the situation changes given an equal platform of \"personhood\" and whether or not that is consistent. \n \n Hopefully that makes more sense.\n \n \nFine, have it your way: force every woman seeking an abortion to prove in a court of law that she is the mother and the foetus she is carring is a foetus, thus demonstrating that the appropriate law applies and she is eligable for an abortion. Will that make you feel better?\nActually, it would but obviously in a more reasonable manner. If states could actually vote on the issue I'd probably at least feel some sense of justice on one level. \n \n \nThen suffering will ensue, just as it may if abortion is not immediately available. Are you trying to argue that because the system isn't perfect it should be discarded?\nI'm arguing it should strive to be consistent with itself and moral. So should one be able to kill the child if adoption is not immediately available? \n \n \nAnd you have so far provided no justification for making this arbitrary generalisation. I maintain that there is no ambiguity, no riskiness, no slippery-slope inherent in a law which singles out the circumstances of a mother and her foetus. There is no chance of such a law being used by CUNxTime to defend a physical assault on your person, so why are you trying to say there is?\nI don't claim a slippery-slope that will cause me to be allowed to assault someone, I merely claim that the argument given is not consistent.\n \n \nOh, but there is. A criminals rights are infringed by incarceration, on the grounds that the rights of others will be thus better preserved.\nI disagree that this is a right of one overriding another right.

Even if abortion was available in Kansas (ha) and not Texas I would still feel Kansas was wrong. Don't get me wrong, this is why I said \"feel some sense\" as opposed to feeling all better. I believe it is a state question because of the 10th amendment. \n \n This is really off the topic though.\n \n \nWhat a bizarre non-sequitur.\nThen let me explain again.

   "\n Identical circumstances is what the issue is. When you say \"right to ones own body is above the right to a unborn\" as an argument for abortion then you can't add arguments or you render the original argument useless. You get to the point where you ask \"why does is this true in this case but not this case\" and the answer comes to a different argument. For example you could say \"well the unborn is not a person\". So the real argument is not that you have a right to your own body above that of the unborn but rather an unborn is not a person and therefore has no rights as a person. But when you give reasons like \"too much burden\" then you can apply that equally and identically to a one year old and yet we come out with a different answer.

The real question is humanity, and nothing short of anarchy can guarantee the perfect freedom of choice.\n\n Perhaps, for some pro-choice advocates, choice is the only thing that matters. However, for most, there are certainly other reasons involved for our support of abortion rights.\n \n Speaking for myself and for many others who hold similar views, abortion rights are not considered as an all or nothing right. Specifically, we don't support abortion being allowed under all circumstances - so, therefore, we do not view abortion rights as being absolute. For most of us, it is important to look at what it is that is being aborted when considering the balance of rights of mother and fetus. While the embryo/fetus is just a body without any level of mind - i.e. when there is \"nobody home\" in the body - then all that is left is its potential to become more. It is not a person worthy of rights AT THAT MOMENT, just as a body that has no upper brain function left after a major accident would also no longer be considered a person - i.e. brain dead bodies are not people. It is equivalent to the religious view of a body without a soul. As for its potential to become more, though many of us do value that potential, we do not value it so much that we would take away the very valuable right that a woman (or indeed any person) has over the use of their own body. \n \n Once that body gains a mental existence (or, in religious equivalent, a soul), then many of us do view the fetus as gaining rights. At that point, we start balancing the rights of the fetus with the rights of the mother. If it is a risk to the mothers life or major health risk, then the mother's rights would still win out. Abortion for non-critical reasons would remain limited. Indeed, I believe that those statistics are very small anyway (i.e. the number of ~third trimester abortions that are performed for non-critical reason). \n \n Since polls (see the abortion section of pollingreport.com) show that over 80% of Americans would restrict third trimester abortions, this means that, indeed, most pro-choice supporters do not view choice as absolute but do take other factors into consideration - contrary to the points you made in your post.\n \n If I can ask you a question: Most pro-life supporters seem to think that personhood magically starts at conception.

   "No, it is consistent across the board. You seem to be thinking I am saying something I am not.\n\n So according to you it's consistent to insist that personhood be the determining factor when the rights of women and foetuses come into conflict, while insisting that personhood shouldn't be the determining factor in other situations where rights are on the line. Hang on, I'll get my dictionary... :)\n \nI mean what \"physiological changes to the fetus?\" do you think matter? Why do they matter? And isn't this getting at the question of \"personhood\" and not \"choice\"?\n\n The physiological changes judged by medical professionals to represent the point at which consciousness and therefore suffering can occur.\n \nMorality.\n\n Then we are doing nothing more than exchanging opinions, and your attempts to paint my morals as inconsistent are spurious and irrelevant. Many moral codes of conduct are inconsistent. Therefore I can be inconsistent if I want to be - not that I am, mind you :)\n \nNo, I don't admit this.\n\n Then your argument is entirely meaningless; you won't allow it to apply to anything. \n \n You point blank asserted that rights may be denied without denying personhood. Yet you simultaneously insist that in the special case of abortion, we must deny personhood. When I point out this inconsistency, you deny that.\n \nFor the last time you are confusing what I said and I am not arguing a slippery slope.\n\n If there's no slippery slope, then there's no ambiguity, and no problem. Your whole premise is that abortion law is dangerously inconsistent, yet whenever I try to pin down this alleged 'inconsistency' and ask what risk you think it presents, you say 'No, it isn't that, or that, and I never said it would lead to that either', despite clearly worded questions raising the issues as concerns of yours.\n \nYou still seem to miss the idea of what I am arguing. You are taking what I said and applying it to a different argument thus making it look wrong. This is a strawman.\n\n It's starting to look like you don't have an argument, because every interpretation I make of your words, you say it's wrong. What am I supposed to do, figure out for you what you should mean in order to make me wrong?\n \nYou are inconsistent when you use certain arguments. The only consistent approach is to say the unborn does not deserve basic human rights. I find this to be dangerously similar to arguments made before.\n\n What 'certain arguments'? What's inconsistent about abortion law? What's inconsistent about the medical judgement of suffering?\n \n Once again, you say the only consistent approach is to declare the unborn a non-person. Yet you have no problem denying or allocating people rights in other circumstances without declaring them a non-person. You're the only one being inconsistent here.\n \nYou again assume I am arguing on a whole when the entire time I am arguing against a particular argument.\n\n Which is ironic, really. You want to present an argument that abortion laws - or perhaps the justifications given for them - are inconsistent with the wider picture, yes? Yet because your argument falls to bits when applied to the wider picture, you want it to be given special treatment.\n \n I mean, maybe I'm doing you a disservice; you keep telling me I'm not 'getting' your argument, so maybe it really is my fault. Just to clear things up, could you make a firm commitment to agree or disagree with the following statements:\n \n 1. Rights may be denied a person, or the rights of others upheld to their personal detriment, without declaring them a non-person.\n \n 2. Declaring a foetus to be a non-person is the only way to apply abortion law so as to be consistent with the application of other rights-affecting laws.\n \nRight, there is a line. \n\n Then we merely disagree upon where it should be drawn. Medical professionals judge a first semester foetus no more capable of suffering than a fertilized egg. Unless you have some evidence to contradict that judgement, then you are simply asking that your squeamishness overrule medical consistency.",

And since a newborn is the Nationality of its Mother automatically, then yes, 1.4 million POTENTIAL AMERICANS are killed each year for the sake of the perpetrator of the problems convenience.\n \n \nSo if we dialed back the abortion rate to match the number of children blown up by American bombs each year, you'd find it acceptable?\n\n \n NO\n \n \nI'm just trying to get a handle on your reasoning, that's all. Excising a mindless lump because, after much soul-searching, the parents decide they can't look after a baby = bad, blowing up a healthy, alert, conscious child because someone in the same city block might be thinking bad thoughts about America = OK. I don't see how adding numbers to these events helps make the thinking consistent.\n\n \n Why aren't you using the examples of the genocide's in the Sudan or Rwanda which are true mass murders designed and implemented for the sole purpose of destroying innocent human life? Why must you reveal your anti american prejudice by referring to a legitimate attempt by a Country to free 24 million innocents from totalitarian rule? \n \n \nMy point is that the eggs and sperm have exactly that potential, so why draw the line at fertilization?\n \n \n WOW Peeling, I actually gave you too much credit. You're no better or deeper than capO in your perspective. The answer, very simply is that by themselves they have no potential to become human beings. Until the egg is fertilized, it is not a potential human being as it will inevitably be washed away in the monthly menstrual cycle. That is the proof that it had no potential for life. But you're just once again attempting to minimize and marginalize the fertilized egg that is growing into a sentient being, if only allowed to continue to grow and develop to term.\n \n \nWhat I'm pointing out is the arbitrary and meaningless line you have drawn at the point of conception. As soon as you start talking about potential you abandon any hope of justifying your placement of the line, because all stages prior to that moment also have the same 'potential'. Better, in my opinion, to deal with what something is.\n\n \n Nothing about accepting that life begins at the point of conception is arbitrary or meaningless Peeling. And tell me what more we have other than the hope that lies in the potential for every single newborn child that we welcome into this World at their birth? How dishonest and disingenuous are you to state here the obfuscations you have defended when you know intellectually that you yourself was once nothing more than a fertilized egg that grew from that early stage of development into what you stand as today, a fully sentient and complete human being with all of the past memories and future hopes and dreams that make you who you are.\n \n How dare you sanctimoniously deny others their right to the same opportunities you have had by actually arguing that they are nothing more than mindless lumps of tissue when you know you started life in exactly the same manner. Your argument reflects the epitome of hypocrisy and self delusion in that you can know one thing is a fact and simultaneously argue the opposite. Actually, I must add to that statement. It is also completely dishonest to lie when you know what your saying is nothing more than shallow justifications for murdering those who are what you yourself once was. \n \n \nYes: you're a moral relativist, ready to kill innocent children whenever you think it's justified. Or do I have you pegged wrong: are you a staunch opponent of military intervention?\n\n \n No, you're the moral relativist, I'm a moral realist. And only a fool would compare abortion to a War between two Countries and equate the deaths in each as having any moral equivalency at all.",

   "aborting the innocent unborn is MURDER. Executing murderers is not. There's a distinct difference that you seem incapable of discerning.\n\n \n What is the difference? You want the murderer killed because he or she has done something wrong, but it's still a life. You don't want the conception/embryo/fetus aborted, because it is the woman's choice? Most conception are going to be spontaneously aborted anyway, so the concern is when the woman purposely chooses and takes control of her own body. \n \n \nTo be denied a life that is inevitable if only aloud to continue to develop is to be directly punished for nothing the fetus caused in and of itself. Your shallow excuses and justifications for marginalizing them and their potential not withstanding.\n\n \n To be denied a million dollars is unfair punishment to me personally. I have the potential to have that, if others share their wealth. The fetus has the potential to be a person, if the woman shares her body. Potential, potential, not actual reality. \n \n \nWrong again Peeling. I'm not a moral relativist at all, but a moral REALIST. You are the relativist in that you can marginalize the value of the unborn for the sake of the convenience of the allegedly responsible adults who created the whole problem by acting irresponsibly. Your comparison of abortion to the loss of life in Wars is an inane and infantile comparison that has no bearing with each other in reality.\n\n \n So what value does the \"unborn\" have over the sentient born who are killed, the latter having lives and families and the ability to experience physical and emotional pain as well as happiness?\n \n \nWar is War. It is one Nation protecting its citizenry from another Nations intent to do them harm. Wars aren't started for the sole purpose of killing other people but to prevent the unnecessary deaths of innocent people. Abortion exists for the sole purpose of destroying new and innocent lives who are guilty of no wrong doing at all. PERIOD!!!\n\n \n But war is all about killing people. It couldn't be a war otherwise. Sex was not started for the sole purpose of having an abortion. Ha, who is right or wrong in a war is decided by the victors. You are using moral relativism to decide what an acceptable or \"necessary\" loss of life is and is not. The \"unborn\" are held up as sacred, above all else, when it comes to restricting a woman's choice. Now I know why Dr. Henry Morgantaller calls them \"fetal fetishists\". \n \n \nAnd yet you condone disposing of them as readily as a cancer which is a disease. And since a newborn is the Nationality of its Mother automatically, then yes, 1.4 million POTENTIAL AMERICANS are killed each year for the sake of the perpetrator of the problems convenience.\n\n \n And many more potential are killed by men every single day with a kleenex, just because of horniness.\n \n \n \nWhy must you reveal your anti american prejudice by referring to a legitimate attempt by a Country to free 24 million innocents from totalitarian rule?\n\n \n Who rules over a woman's body, but that woman? \n \n \nWOW Peeling, I actually gave you too much credit. You're no better or deeper than capO in your perspective. The answer, very simply is that by themselves they have no potential to become human beings. Until the egg is fertilized, it is not a potential human being as it will inevitably be washed away in the monthly menstrual cycle. That is the proof that it had no potential for life. But you're just once again attempting to minimize and marginalize the fertilized egg that is growing into a sentient being, if only allowed to continue to grow and develop to term.\n\n \n The \"what if\" game. It only seems to be important when the seed is entering the woman's body, then it's deemed worthy of protection. The man has marked his territory, which is the woman's body. Well, not in our enlightened times, I am glad to say.\n \n \nNothing about accepting that life begins at the point of conception is arbitrary or meaningless Peeling.\n\n \n It's both. I mean, the sperm and the egg separately are alive too. Since it's not sentient, what are you talking about? I think as someone said previously, what's being avoided is a religious belief that a soul is transmitted at conception. Looking at the evidence, that's as probable as the existence of the tooth fairy, or any other superstition with no supporting evidence. \n \n \nAnd tell me what more we have other than the hope that lies in the potential for every single newborn child that we welcome into this World at their birth? How dishonest and disingenuous are you to state here the obfuscations\n\n \n Ok, now you have gone from talking about the unborn to the newborn. Who is obfuscating?\n \n \nyou have defended when you know intellectually that you yourself was once nothing more than a fertilized egg that grew from that early stage of development into what you stand as today, a fully sentient and complete human being with all of the past memories and future hopes and dreams that make you who you are.\n\n \n However, there was no developing memories, it was not a \"you\" or \"I\", anymore than a sperm or an egg separately. Everything we are, in terms of the value we place on who we are, our traits and our lives, we owe to sentience. DNA by itself, left on its own, without sentience, does not represent value.

   "aborting the innocent unborn is MURDER. Executing murderers is not. There's a distinct difference that you seem incapable of discerning.\n\n In all seriousness, you might find you face less hostility in discussions if you slowed down and were a little more careful before leaping to conclusions :)\n \n Look again at what I said:\n \nLike I said - so far, so what. I wasn't saying there was anything wrong with being pro-life and pro-death penalty, merely pointing out that you cannot then appeal to 'killing = wrong' as an absolute.\n\n Now, do those words really expose an inability to distinguish between different circumstances? My only point, one that doesn't actually bear upon our discussion at all, is that one cannot support the death penalty and oppose abortion on the absolute grounds that 'killing is wrong'. That's all.\n \nTo be denied a life that is inevitable if only aloud to continue to develop is to be directly punished for nothing the fetus caused in and of itself. Your shallow excuses and justifications for marginalizing them and their potential not withstanding.\n\n If a fertilized egg is judged to have that 'potential', then so must the sperm and egg at the instant before they met, and the instant before that, and so on. Denying conception - by any method including deciding not to have sex - is a destruction of that very same potential.\n \n If you are tempted to scoff at this suggestion, because nothing 'real' is being destroyed, good. We're on the same page; I've just read a bit further.\n \nWrong again Peeling. I'm not a moral relativist at all, but a moral REALIST.\n\n You make that distinction because you are convinced that your particular moral relativism is justified. You see yourself as pragmatic and hard-headed, prepared to face up to tough choices. Me too. We're still both moral relativists.\n \nYou are the relativist in that you can marginalize the value of the unborn for the sake of the convenience of the allegedly responsible adults who created the whole problem by acting irresponsibly. Your comparison of abortion to the loss of life in Wars is an inane and infantile comparison that has no bearing with each other in reality.\n\n I don't see it in any way irrelevant to point out that for all your 'look in the mirror' and 'look at a newborn baby', you're still prepared to sanction the death and maiming of innocent children - children whose mental existence and capacity for suffering are unquestioned.\n \n I don't want to go too far down the 'war' parallel. I certainly don't want to get bogged down in an argument over whether any given war is justified or whether any particular strategy ought to be preferred - suffice it to say that I agree with you that war, and consequent loss of innocent life, is sometimes unavoidable given our present level of technology and cultural sophistication. I'm realistic about that.\n \nAbortion exists for the sole purpose of destroying new and innocent lives who are guilty of no wrong doing at all. PERIOD!!!\n\n You talk as if it were a bloodsport. Do you really believe it's performed for no other reason than a malicious desire to end a life?\n \nSure it does, unless one is a moral relativist as you are.\n\n So if I can find a way of describing something you've done in a way that makes it sound bad - however inaccurate or hyperbolic my phrasing - suddenly you've actually done something evil? Your morality is defined absolutely by my facility with words?\n \nAnd yet you condone disposing of them as readily as a cancer which is a disease.\n\n AA, please please don't resort to distorting the things I say. It just bogs down the discussion. I mean, seriously, look at my words:\n \nChoosing to portray it in a way that sounds wrong does not make the act itself wrong. 'Discarding 1.4 million unwanted mindless growths' makes it sound positively like a public service - does that mean it is?\n \n I don't for a moment pretend abortion is as straightforward as excising a cancer. It's an emotionally charged issue for all involved and may have lasting psychological consequences, and I see it as tolerable, no more than that.\n\n Would it have killed you to read one or two more lines before writing your reply? Or to have said 'oops' and deleted that reply when you read further?\n \n \nAnd since a newborn is the Nationality of its Mother automatically, then yes, 1.4 million POTENTIAL AMERICANS are killed each year for the sake of the perpetrator of the problems convenience.\n\n Ah, now we're getting somewhere - now we're talking about potential americans. In which case, your figures are on the low side. Let's see... 50 million women of childbearing age, averaging 2.09 children each, which is 18 months without ovulation, leaving around 30 years of unused fertility. So in any given year about 609,000,000 eggs go to waste. Now, sperm. Wow. 10,000,000 active ones per emission, let's say once a day on average for all 100,000,000 eligable men, gives us a whopping 365,000,000,000,000,000 frustrated tiddlers. It's hardly worth deducting the lucky ones. Now, potential Americans could be formed by any combination of those sperm and those eggs, so we multiply up to get 222,285,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Add in abortions and we get 222,285,000,000,000,000,001,400,000.\n \nWhy aren't you using the examples of the genocide's in the Sudan or Rwanda which are true mass murders designed and implemented for the sole purpose of destroying innocent human life? Why must you reveal your anti american prejudice by referring to a legitimate attempt by a Country to free 24 million innocents from totalitarian rule?\n\n I've never beaten my wife :) If we're going to start employing loaded questions I want to get my answers in ahead of time. \n \n Ignoring the irrelevant 'anti american prejudice' dig, I referred to the Iraq war precisely because you are able to feel it is legitimate. You're a moral relativist. Killing innocents isn't absolutely wrong, in your book: there are justifications for it. I'm not criticising you for it, I'm just pointing it out.\n \nWOW Peeling, I actually gave you too much credit. You're no better or deeper than capO in your perspective. The answer, very simply is that by themselves they have no potential to become human beings. Until the egg is fertilized, it is not a potential human being as it will inevitably be washed away in the monthly menstrual cycle.\n\n Aw, don't dismiss me so lightly; you'll hurt my feelings :)\n \n Think about this really carefully now. How can they have no potential to become human beings? If that were true, there is no way that becoming a human being could lie in their future. Are you saying that a currently unfertilised egg has no potential to be fertilised?\n \n \nThat is the proof that it had no potential for life.\n\n We are both walking, talking proof that currently-unfertilised eggs do have the potential to end up as human beings.\n \nBut you're just once again attempting to minimize and marginalize the fertilized egg that is growing into a sentient being, if only allowed to continue to grow and develop to term.\n\n 'Allowed' is a misnomer. It implies we could just put the egg somewhere and let the process occur unmediated. In reality, the mother contributes almost 100% of the raw materials and a considerable amount of regulatory control. She builds the foetus, and until it develops a mental existence there is no suffering caused should she decide to stop.\n \nNothing about accepting that life begins at the point of conception is arbitrary or meaningless Peeling.\n\n Life starts a little later, actually, biologically speaking. But you're not talking about life. At the risk of inviting another distortion of my viewpoint, a cancer is also 'alive'. You're talking about something more specific than life: potential Americans, and as I've pointed out, if the fertilized egg is a potential American then logically so must the egg and sperm have been, collectively, in the instant before fertilisation. If that were not true, fertilization could not occur and an American could not pop out at the other end. That's what potential means.\n \nAnd tell me what more we have other than the hope that lies in the potential for every single newborn child that we welcome into this World at their birth? How dishonest and disingenuous are you to state here the obfuscations you have defended when you know intellectually that you yourself was once nothing more than a fertilized egg that grew from that early stage of development into what you stand as today, a fully sentient and complete human being with all of the past memories and future hopes and dreams that make you who you are.\n\n Very pretty, but I don't really understand the significance. Yes, I was once a fertilised egg. Before that, I was an unfertilised egg and a sperm, one of millions of potential combinations only one of which was realised. Should I feel guilty for 'murdering' all the rest of that potential by swimming too fast? Because make no mistake, that was 'me' at work.\n \n If you're going to insist on talking about potential, you have to be consistent. What's the difference, in terms of 'murdered potential' between preventing a sperm and egg meeting that would otherwise have resulted in a fertilised egg, and destroying said fertilised egg?\n \nHow dare you sanctimoniously deny others their right to the same opportunities you have had \n\n Already done long ago - I swam faster than the rest. You've done the same. We all have.\n \nby actually arguing that they are nothing more than mindless lumps of tissue when you know you started life in exactly the same manner.\n\n What I now call my body was once a mindless lump of tissue. My mind hadn't developed yet. What I think of as 'me' didn't exist, so aborting that foetus wouldn't be killing 'me'. Nor would it be denying 'me' anything, because I didn't exist. It would be denying that lump of tissue the chance to be animated by a mind, perhaps, but that's hardly the same thing.\n \nYour argument reflects the epitome of hypocrisy and self delusion in that you can know one thing is a fact and simultaneously argue the opposite. Actually, I must add to that statement. It is also completely dishonest to lie when you know what your saying is nothing more than shallow justifications for murdering those who are what you yourself once was.\n\n Steady on, old boy; let us not stumble needlessly into that pit we call Liars Corner :)\n \n I appreciate that you feel strongly about this, so strongly that you simply cannot believe anyone could have an alternative viewpoint without being dishonest to themselves or others. But that's a failure of your imagination, and you should hesitate before blaming others for it. It's rude.\n \nNo, you're the moral relativist, I'm a moral realist. And only a fool would compare abortion to a War between two Countries and equate the deaths in each as having any moral equivalency at all.\n\n In other words, only a fool would be a moral absolutist.\n \n Thanks for making my point for me :)",

   "No one likes a smart a$$. You distort what I was saying.\n\n Sorry for being flippant - but I'm not distorting what you're saying.\n \nWith regards to a personhood, I am of the belief that only persons get rights and that all persons get rights. This isn't inconsistent.\n\n Correct, but that's not all you're saying or have said. You clearly and unambiguously stated that a person may be denied rights without declaring them a non-person. That contradicts your claim that we must define a foetus as a non-person to deny it rights. \n \n I can't help that there's a contradiction there. I can't make it go away. And when the main thrust of your argument concerns consistency, I think it's somewhat hyopcritical of you to be selective about to whom it should apply.\n \nWhy does this matter? Consciousness doesn't always equate to the ability to suffer by the way. Furthermore, entities other than human can suffer and/or be conscious.\n\n If there is no mind, what exactly is doing the suffering?\n \nI recall saying the only logical way to deny rights for an unborn is to declare them to not be a person.\n\n Yet you also stated that persons may be denied rights without declaring them a non-person. So if I find it hard to follow the 'logic' of your argument, I feel I'm not entirely to blame :)\n \nYou should start by figuring out what the argument was about which was a so-called right to a woman's body trumping a unborn's right to life given they were a person. You changed the frame of debate to abortion in general and assume my arguments were referring to abortion in general when really they were towards pointing out how the given argument is not a good one.\n\n If that was the impression I gave, I apologise. My position applies absolutely to the question of rights superceding other rights - such determinations are made all the time in all manner of circumstances without ever declaring anyone a non-person.\n \nThis is absurd and to answer your question, NO...I'm not arguing that and I haven't been (even if I agree with it). If I make the argument that a certain argument is poor then I am not arguing the merits of the issue that argument is about. To apply those arguments to the issue is nothing but illogical. I really think you have just misunderstood what was being argued here.\n\n No, but I think we have crossed purposes somewhat.\n \n As I demonstrated an understanding of earlier, you're arguing against a particular justification for abortion, yes? Rights of the mother superceding those of the child. Ok. You've raised concerns that such a justification is inconsistent. If I recall correctly, you presented them thus:\n \n 1. You suggested, by posing a particular question, that the same justification could be used to defend CUNxTime striking you. Even if that question were not rhetorical, you clearly saw it as a potential problem, yes? Otherwise you would not have asked that question.\n \n 2. You've implied that elevating one right over another is not how things are done elsewhere. Certainly whenever I've produced an example you've said you don't 'see it' as being a question of one person's rights overruling another's.\n \n The first claim of inconsistency is false because the logic used to justify abortion would not justify assault on your person. You do not fit the criteria which makes it tolerable to destroy a foetus, and CUNxTime's circumstances do not match those which qualify a pregnant woman to exercise control over that foetus. This directly parallels the specificity of abortion law itself.\n \n Secondly, we clearly and demonstrably do elevate one person's rights over another's in all manner of circumstances, without declaring either one a non-person. So the notion that this justification is inconsistent with the resolution of other moral issues is also false.\n \nPerhaps you didn't read the discussion prior to. In your example there, I don't believe there is a \"right to incarcerate\". But like we talked about before, we disagree on what rights are.\n\n I don't think I said there was a right to incarcerate. I simply said that some of a criminal's normal rights are superceded by the rights of others. That applies whether you treat rights as a moral imperative or a legal guarantee.\n \n If you can spare a moment to check, you'll see that what we disagreed upon were the requirements for you to have a particular right, not how they are arrived at. Rights are an expression of what we feel is morally correct or can show to be practically beneficial, but you do not have any particular right unless it is guaranteed by a potent authority. Until such time as that is true, you only have an opinion as to what people should be due. Practicality vs idealism.\n \n That's why I take exception to arguments of the form 'X has a god-given right to Y, so we shouldn't infringe it': there's no such thing as a god-given right. Your personal beliefs about god may lead you to believe he intends certain things for us, but that's all. In some cultures, men have a 'god-given' right to do all sorts of things to women - there, as anywhere, 'god-given' is merely a reflection of their own opinions and traditions.\n \n If you want to convince me that a foetus has rights which supercede those of the mother rather than the other way around, before that foetus has a mind or is capable of suffering, I feel I'm entitled to more than just an appeal to 'god-given', because that's really just 'I'm right, and god thinks so too'. I also think appeals to 'that justification is inconsistent' are weak when your position is still one of rights superceding others.\n \n Has that cleared up our burgeoning misunderstanding? :)",

   "What you have shown in this response Peeling is that you have no problem applying the most shallow rationalizations regarding the development of new human beings. As long as you can keep the debate limited to unfertilized eggs and sperm, or zygotes, or fetuses; then you can keep it so impersonal as to not be about human beings with minds. Well let's look at a site that caters not to abortionists, but to new mothers, and about to be, mothers. \n \n Notice how different the language is than that which you have subjected me to in your bloviating about how insignificant a fetus is because in your opinion it's just a mindless mass of tissue. \n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu8K4Xf9Hg3cA0D9XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTE0bzNmczYyBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA1lTMzAyXzEyMg--/SIG=1236n4nrr/EXP=1208004408/**http%3a//www.blog4mom.com/index_files/Page604.htm\n \n Here is the description of the development that takes place in just the first and second month to remind you that we are actually dealing with human beings here. And notice the rapid growth that takes place in the second month.\n First Month\n \n The process of implantation begins after about 5 to 7 days when the sperm fertilizes the egg, and the egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. The fertilized egg then begins to grow in the uterus, doubling in size every day. At this stage of development the baby is called an embryo.\n Shortly after implantation the placenta and umbilical cord begin to form. The placenta and umbilical cord take care of the nourishment and oxygen being provided to your baby and carry away the baby's wastes. Your baby is enclosed in a sac of fluid to protect the baby from bumps and pressure.\n In another week the baby has a spinal cord. Within a few days , she develops 5 to 8 bones of the spinal column (vertebrae). By the end of your first 6 weeks of pregnancy, your baby has a head and trunk. The eyes, brain, mouth, inner ears, and digestive system begin to form, as do tiny buds that will be the arms and legs. The heart also forms, and it begins to beat on the 25th day after conception (5 to 6 weeks after the last menstrual period).\n By the end of 6 weeks your baby is about a half inch long (1 centimeter) and weighs a fraction of an ounce (or a few grams).\n \n By the end of this month, most mothers start feeling nausea termed as \"morning sickness\". It gets worse for some mothers as months progress while others may not experience this symptom at all.\n \n Second Month\n \n This month is part of the most critical aspect of your baby development. It is imperative to take precaution against external factors like drugs, viruses, or environmental factors such as pesticides which may cause birth defects.\n Your baby's development is very rapid during the second month. By the end of the second month, all of your baby's major body organs and body systems, including the lungs, liver, and stomach, have begun their development cycle. Eyelids form and grow but are sealed shut, and ears are formed. Ankles, toes, wrists, fingers, and sexual organs start developing. If your baby is a boy, his penis will appear as part of the organ growth.\n By this month end your baby starts looking like a miniature human infant rather than the small cell it was conceived as. The baby is a little over 1 inch long (3 centimeters) and still weighs less than 1 ounce (less than 28 grams). The baby is now in a sac called the amniotic sac.\n \n The expectant mother may start having enlarged breasts nad prominent nipples. There may be some tenderness and pain in the area due to an increase in the body hormones. There may be increased vaginal secretion and the mucous plug begins to form. The expectant mother may feel an increased urge to urinate because of increased pressure from the uterus due to the growing fetus.\n Now, in addition to the above, let's get past this mindless lump of tissue assertion of yours. Does a mindless lump of tissue FEEL PAIN? Of course not. Because there's no mind to transfer to, or the pain or receptors to receive it, right? Then explain this Dr's opinion to me and continue to justify your attempted minimizing of who and what the unborn are in reality. They do feel pain which confirms that they do have minds. I believe that even hear and have thoughts. And since they have brains, that is actually not a leap at all to believe.\n \n http://www.gargaro.com/fetalpain.html\n \n DOES THE FETUS FEEL PAIN?\n Summary of a presentation given by Dr. Paul Ranalli on \"Pain, Fetal Development, and Partial-birth abortion\" on June 27, 1997. (I personally attended this presentation). Related links are included below.\n The fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks. This is probably a conservatively late estimate, but it is scientifically solid. Elements of the pain-conveying system (spino-thalamic system) begin to be assembled at 7 weeks; enough development has occurred by 12-14 weeks that some pain perception is likely, and continues to build through the second trimester. By 20 weeks, the spino- thalamic system is fully established and connected.\n \n There are three different indicators providing evidence that the fetus feels pain.\n \n Anatomical\n - pain receptors spread over the body in stages: 8-16 weeks\n - pain impulse connections in the spinal cord link up and reach the thalamus (the brain's reception center): 7-20 weeks (summarized by Anand, K.J.S., Atlanta)\n Physiological/Hormonal\n - fetuses withdraw from painful stimulation\n - two types of stress hormones, normally released by adults subjected to pain, are released by adults subjected to pain, are releases in massive amounts by the fetus subjected to a needle puncture to draw a blood sample:\n (a) from 19 weeks onward (N. Fisk; London, England)\n (b) from 16 weeks onward (J. Partch; Kiel, Germany)\n Behavioral\n - withdraw from pain\n - change in vital signs\n A 20-30 week old fetus actually will feel more pain than an adult. The period between 20-30 weeks is a uniquely vulnerable time, since the pain system is fully established, yet the higher level pain-modifying system has barely begun to develop.\n \n Below is a graphical represenation depicting this mis-match in pain detection and pain modification ",

Its worth to them is almost purely in what it will become - again, \"potential\".\n \n The main point to argue is that a potential something is not that something. I can potentially be a billionaire. That does not make me a billionaire. So, a potential baby is not a baby and it is erroneous to call it that except if, as in these web sites, you want to cater to the emotions of the mother by calling it something it is not.\n \n If you disagree, then could you tell me what SPECIFIC characteristics are shared between a zygote and a baby (as that term is conventionally used - i.e. born babies)?",

The web sites catering to new mothers oblige them in this affection by calling even a zygote a baby.\n\n \n That was my reason to post a link to that site Ao, because I wanted to show how people through out the real World refer to the unborn. What you call zygotes are developing children; future human beings; babies to be. By whatever impersonal label you place on them, they are still developing human beings with all of the value that you yourself possess.\n \n \nHowever, a zygote and a baby are very different in reality. Apart from human DNA and the start of the growth process it really has no similarities to a baby itself, though it will eventually develop into a baby - i.e. potential.\n\n \n What I marvel at is that you can't see how incredibly ridiculous this paragraph is. \"Apart from human DNA and the growth process it really has no similarity to a baby itself\"? Talk about taking the meat out of the argument! A fertilized egg does have HUMAN DNA, and it DOES GROW! Which proves it's alive because we all know that dead things don't grow. But still you'll deny the unborn their humanity. Go figure huh?\n \n \nIf the zygote had no potential to turn into a baby then I have no doubt that the great majority of mothers would feel very little affection for it. Its worth to them is almost purely in what it will become - again, \"potential\".\n\n \n Thanks for making my point...\n \n \nThe main point to argue is that a potential something is not that something.

So, a potential baby is not a baby and it is erroneous to call it that except if, as in these web sites, you want to cater to the emotions of the mother by calling it something it is not.\n\n \n And neither is your comparison a valid one. Becoming a billionaire is something someone accomplishes through personal effort, it isn't a state of being as is the result of the birth process. Just as a pregnant dog will always deliver a litter of puppies, so will a woman always deliver a human baby. It has nothing to do with the will. No matter how much a woman wills it, she will never deliver anything other than a human baby.\n \n \nIf you disagree, then could you tell me what SPECIFIC characteristics are shared between a zygote and a baby (as that term is conventionally used - i.e. born babies)?\n\n \n This photo is of a Fertilized human egg (zygote) having reached the blastocyst stage Zygote contains a fluid filled blastocele which is preparing for implantation into endometrium of uterus.\n \n http://www.fotosearch.com/comp/LIF/LIF126/fertilized-human-egg-zygote-having-reached-the-blastocyst-stage-~-3D605008.jpg\n \n So at this point of its development it has very little in common with a baby. But that's only because of its stage of development and not because of any inherent flaw with its existence. This zygote hasn't even attached to the uterine wall yet so although it is a fertilized egg, it's future development into a human being isn't yet assured. And this is the stage when abortions take place, so to imply that zygotes are aborted is completely fallacious, because it's fetuses that women choose to get aborted, not zygotes. Here are pictures of aborted babies. Maybe they will help drive home the reality of what is actually being discussed here regarding this disgusting and inhuman practice of what allegedly civilized human beings are doing to 1.4 million unborn babies per year in America alone.\n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0WTefXguv9H4fEATsOjzbkF/SIG=12d3c9val/EXP=1208028256/**http%3A//home.thezone.net/~nfrtla/photos-aborted-babies.htm",

That the abortion clinics dispose of the garbage cans full of aborted babies in hefty trash bags that are placed in the orange dumpsters, and then picked up by the waste disposal companies 2 or 3 times a week is precisely in line with my response to CxT.

So no, nothing I showed here disproves what I said earlier at all.\n\n \n Beyond being obviously wrong due to standard medical waste procedures, what likely happens is that waste is stored in sealed bags, inside the facilities in locked containers awaiting incinerator.

   "Correct, but that's not all you're saying or have said. You clearly and unambiguously stated that a person may be denied rights without declaring them a non-person. That contradicts your claim that we must define a foetus as a non-person to deny it rights. \n \n I can't help that there's a contradiction there. I can't make it go away. And when the main thrust of your argument concerns consistency, I think it's somewhat hyopcritical of you to be selective about to whom it should apply.\nWell even if I were saying that it still isn't a contradiction. If you say you don't need sugar to make a cake but to make a spice cake you have to have sugar (this isn't true by the way :p) then you aren't contradicting yourself. You just are applying a restriction on a broad statement. \n \n \nIf there is no mind, what exactly is doing the suffering?\nThinking about it I believe you are using a different definition of \"consciousness\" which is appropriate. So ignore what I wrote.\n \n \nIf that was the impression I gave, I apologise. My position applies absolutely to the question of rights superceding other rights - such determinations are made all the time in all manner of circumstances without ever declaring anyone a non-person.\nI think rights can supercede another right but I think it applies absolutely and is inconsistent if you say \"it can here but not here and only here if this occurs\". It is completely random and really has no basis for logic. Of course the normal abortion argument I get will then come down to something like a person is something that is human and conscious (at some varied level) and once that point occurs the right to life exists. So it really comes down to a person argument in those cases. But I believe you would be arguing that being a person (by whatever definition) is irrelevant. Is this correct?\n \n \nNo, but I think we have crossed purposes somewhat.\nWhich, you'd have to admit, probably has caused some confusion. Even more so since you are having multiply discussions at the same time.\n \n \n As I demonstrated an understanding of earlier, you're arguing against a particular justification for abortion, yes? Rights of the mother superceding those of the child. Ok. You've raised concerns that such a justification is inconsistent. If I recall correctly, you presented them thus:\nWell not only justification for abortion but anywhere that kind of argument would apply....but yeah.\n \n \n1. You suggested, by posing a particular question, that the same justification could be used to defend CUNxTime striking you. Even if that question were not rhetorical, you clearly saw it as a potential problem, yes? Otherwise you would not have asked that question.\nYes, a potential problem indeed. The key word is potential.\n \n \n2. You've implied that elevating one right over another is not how things are done elsewhere. Certainly whenever I've produced an example you've said you don't 'see it' as being a question of one person's rights overruling another's.\nTwo things here, one: we have a different idea of rights and two: I don't think your example showed two different rights where one trumped another. Instead it was a government function of power overruling a government issued right via due process. Certainly an ok thing to do in my opinion but if you were to apply that to abortion then you'd have to give the same due process like we discussed before and once you do this then we really get back to the question at hand because at some point you need some logic for a law...or at least an argument I suppose.\n \n \nThe first claim of inconsistency is false because the logic used to justify abortion would not justify assault on your person.\nBut it potential could. \n \n \nYou do not fit the criteria which makes it tolerable to destroy a foetus, and CUNxTime's circumstances do not match those which qualify a pregnant woman to exercise control over that foetus. This directly parallels the specificity of abortion law itself.\nBut right off the bat you make the argument useless to even make (the argument CUNxTime used). That criteria of who gets \"rights\" is what is at issue not that a right to life is overruled by a right to ones own body. I believe it was understood by CUNxTime as well as others here that \"person\" implies certain rights. \n \n \nSecondly, we clearly and demonstrably do elevate one person's rights over another's in all manner of circumstances, without declaring either one a non-person. So the notion that this justification is inconsistent with the resolution of other moral issues is also false.\nSee above as I disagree that rights overrule other rights in some but not all circumstances. \n \n \nI don't think I said there was a right to incarcerate. I simply said that some of a criminal's normal rights are superceded by the rights of others. That applies whether you treat rights as a moral imperative or a legal guarantee.\nAre you sure? I copied the phrase \"right to incarcerate\" somewhere. What rights are superseding other rights anyway?\n \n \nIf you can spare a moment to check, you'll see that what we disagreed upon were the requirements for you to have a particular right, not how they are arrived at. Rights are an expression of what we feel is morally correct or can show to be practically beneficial, but you do not have any particular right unless it is guaranteed by a potent authority. Until such time as that is true, you only have an opinion as to what people should be due. Practicality vs idealism.\nAgain I disagree with this statement. A government granting rights often times has nothing to do with morality. Again, I just agree with the DoI and you are free to not. \n \n \nThat's why I take exception to arguments of the form 'X has a god-given right to Y, so we shouldn't infringe it': there's no such thing as a god-given right. Your personal beliefs about god may lead you to believe he intends certain things for us, but that's all. In some cultures, men have a 'god-given' right to do all sorts of things to women - there, as anywhere, 'god-given' is merely a reflection of their own opinions and traditions.\nAnd this is just your opinion as well. It is rather clear that our country was founded on the idea that we have rights outside of government. \n \n \nIf you want to convince me that a foetus has rights which supercede those of the mother rather than the other way around, before that foetus has a mind or is capable of suffering, I feel I'm entitled to more than just an appeal to 'god-given', because that's really just 'I'm right, and god thinks so too'. I also think appeals to 'that justification is inconsistent' are weak when your position is still one of rights superceding others.\nIf you are of the opinion that a right only exists when the government says it does then of course the fetus has no rights and furthermore the woman has no constitutional right to abortion either (assuming we apply the law correctly). I'm not even sure how you could ever claim a right if you don't have it and get away with it under your idea of how rights exist. Do you argue that one \"should\" have a right? I think that gets into a different debate so I'm gonna stop on that one.",

You just are applying a restriction on a broad statement.\n\n I could argue that point, but OK, I understand the spirit in which you're making it. \n \n However, this 'application of a restriction' is exactly what I said it was several posts ago: special pleading in the case of abortion. You want to make it a unique kind of 'cake' that requires sugar. And unlike 'spice cake' which by definition refers to a particular recipe presumably including sugar, here the 'recipe' for abortion is what is up for grabs - you need to show it needs sugar.\n \n Incidentally, let's not use this cake metaphor any more; it's driving me nuts.\n \nI think rights can supercede another right but I think it applies absolutely and is inconsistent if you say \"it can here but not here and only here if this occurs\".\n\n It's trivial to find many such examples you would agree with. As a parent, I can choose to home-school my child - but my neighbour cannot intercept my child on the way to school and take her to his house for schooling. Similarly I can ground my child for being rude, and restrict her movements - were anyone else to do that they would be charged with kidnapping. And so on and so forth.\n \nBut I believe you would be arguing that being a person (by whatever definition) is irrelevant. Is this correct?\n\n What I'm arguing is that there are clear medical and contextual arguments concerning the various rights, responsibilities, obligations and consequences involved, and arbitration can be made without dragging 'personhood' into it. Indeed, I think arguing on the basis of personhood alone is less safe, because it removes from the foetus various protections against unsanctioned abortion.\n \nWhich, you'd have to admit, probably has caused some confusion. Even more so since you are having multiply discussions at the same time.\n\n Quite, and I apologise.\n \n \nYes, a potential problem indeed. The key word is potential.\n\n I think you need to explain why, though. I can't see any logic that would permit the distortion you describe. Can you? If I present a justification for abortion that doesn't mention personhood but instead factors in the relationship between mother and foetus, the undeveloped mind of the foetus etc etc, can you really distort that justification to legitimise assault?\n \nCertainly an ok thing to do in my opinion but if you were to apply that to abortion then you'd have to give the same due process like we discussed before\n\n If you're referring to trials, my answer is as before: trials establish guilt - or more generally, they establish whether a particular statute applies to a particular person or situation: whether they qualify. With a mother and foetus, there is no point having a trial to establish whether the statute applies.\n \nAre you sure? I copied the phrase \"right to incarcerate\" somewhere. What rights are superseding other rights anyway?\n\n If I used that phrase, it was sloppy. I did not intend to represent a specific 'right' as such, merely that a person can be lawfully locked up, some of their normal everyday rights rescinded, in order to protect other rights.\n \nAgain I disagree with this statement. A government granting rights often times has nothing to do with morality. Again, I just agree with the DoI and you are free to not.\n\n Steeeeve, I don't disagree with the DoI. I'm stating a clear, simple fact: you only HAVE a right if it is guaranteed by a potent authority. I'm not saying anything about whether that right exists in the abstract, is moral, was derived from morals, or anything else.\n \n Say you enter a funfair, and at the gate I hand you a voucher entitling you to a free hot-dog. Do you now have a right to a free hot-dog? It depends entirely upon whether *I* had any authority to hand out those vouchers and whether I can make good on that promise. If I was just some guy yanking your chain, you have no hot-dog related rights whatsoever. Even if I was serious, your 'right to a hotdog' ultimately depends upon my goodwill or alternatively the power of a higher authority to force me to make good on my promise.\n \n The DoI may include rights percieved as 'god given', but like I said, that's just a reflection of the signatories' philosophical beliefs. You now have those rights because they are part of the government/citizen contract.\n \nAnd this is just your opinion as well. It is rather clear that our country was founded on the idea that we have rights outside of government.\n\n Ought to have certain rights, transient governance notwithstanding, hence those rights are part of the contract to which all US governments are obliged to be signatory. It's very straightforward.\n \nIf you are of the opinion that a right only exists when the government says it does\n\n That's a slight distortion. It exists if it is in the contract between government and citizen; it is not something the government (or at least a democratic government) can revoke or extend willy-nilly. Hence the flagrant opportunism exhibited post 911, where all manner of rights-violating laws were bum-rushed through Congress under the banner of patriotism - but that's certainly a different discussion.",

   "That was my reason to post a link to that site Ao, because I wanted to show how people through out the real World refer to the unborn. What you call zygotes are developing children; future human beings; babies to be. By whatever impersonal label you place on them, they are still developing human beings with all of the value that you yourself possess.\n\n I, and most on the pro-choice side, make a clear distinction between what IS and what WILL BE. Again, a potential something is not that something. I am a potential billionaire but that does not make me a billionaire. I would love to be treated as a billionaire since I have that potential but that would be ridiculous. Another analogy (that gets around your objection to that particular example) is that every kid is a potential adult. That doesn't mean that they should be treated as adults when they are four years old because they have a very high probability of automatically becoming adults given time. \n \nWhat I marvel at is that you can't see how incredibly ridiculous this paragraph is. \"Apart from human DNA and the growth process it really has no similarity to a baby itself\"? Talk about taking the meat out of the argument! A fertilized egg does have HUMAN DNA, and it DOES GROW! Which proves it's alive because we all know that dead things don't grow. But still you'll deny the unborn their humanity. Go figure huh?\n\n They are human. So are all the cells in our bodies. I really don't care whether a cell has full human DNA or not. I will not value that cell or cells for that point alone. When I scratch my arm, I am killing millions of such cells. \n \n As for it growing, the growth alone only has worth in that it is a process that will lead to something that we DO value - i.e. full human persons. \n \n The main difference in our thinking process is that you seem to treat a potential something as that something. We all value babies. However, you seem to say that something that can become a baby needs to be valued as much as a baby. You certainly have the right to think that but it is very unconvincing. Most of us can tell the difference between a potential something and that something. A child is not an adult, even though it will become one. So, a child should not be treated as an adult because it is a potential adult. An unfertilized egg has the potential to become a person. Should it be treated as a person?\n \n \nThis photo is of a Fertilized human egg (zygote) having reached the blastocyst stage Zygote contains a fluid filled blastocele which is preparing for implantation into endometrium of uterus.\n \n http://www.fotosearch.com/comp/LIF/LIF126/fertilized-human-egg-zygote-having-reached-the-blastocyst-stage-~-3D605008.jpg\n \n So at this point of its development it has very little in common with a baby. But that's only because of its stage of development and not because of any inherent flaw with its existence. This zygote hasn't even attached to the uterine wall yet so although it is a fertilized egg, it's future development into a human being isn't yet assured. And this is the stage when abortions take place, so to imply that zygotes are aborted is completely fallacious, because it's fetuses that women choose to get aborted, not zygotes. Here are pictures of aborted babies. Maybe they will help drive home the reality of what is actually being discussed here regarding this disgusting and inhuman practice of what allegedly civilized human beings are doing to 1.4 million unborn babies per year in America alone.\n\n Pictures can stir emotions but as rational beings we need to not jump to conclusions but to try to understand the situation as it actually is. When I see a picture of a mangled body, I get an emotional reaction because I quickly emotionally jump to the conclusion that the person who inhabited that body must have suffered when that damage was done. That is the main thought that drives my emotions at seeing pictures of mangled bodies. However, as a rational person, I need to step back and ask whether that actually happened - i.e. whether someone actually DID suffer that mutilation. There, I trust science since it supplies evidence and that evidence says that, for the great majority of abortions which happen in early term, there is no pain, or indeed no mind whatsoever.

   "What you have shown in this response Peeling is that you have no problem applying the most shallow rationalizations regarding the development of new human beings.\n\n Sorry, but I don't see why my rationalisation deserves to be called 'shallow'.\n \n Your rationalisation equates a fertilised egg with a newborn baby. It appeals to 'potential', without being in the slightest consistent regarding the existence of potential in a fertilized egg vs the sperm and egg a nanosecond prior to fertilization. If there is any evidence of superficial thinking to be found in this discussion, I think we will find it there.\n \n \nAs long as you can keep the debate limited to unfertilized eggs and sperm, or zygotes, or fetuses; then you can keep it so impersonal as to not be about human beings with minds.\n\n It isn't the words I'm choosing that prevents an egg or a zygote or an early-term foetus being a human being with a mind. It's the fact they don't have minds.\n \n Again, you're projecting your own argument on to me: you keep using one word, baby, in order to equivocate, to falsely endow a foetus with properties it simply does not have.\n \n \nNow, in addition to the above, let's get past this mindless lump of tissue assertion of yours. Does a mindless lump of tissue FEEL PAIN? Of course not. Because there's no mind to transfer to, or the pain or receptors to receive it, right? Then explain this Dr's opinion to me and continue to justify your attempted minimizing of who and what the unborn are in reality.\n\n \n As others have pointed out, hardly any abortions are carried out after the stage mentioned here, and even that small number tend to involve extraordinary medical justifications.\n \n But ok, let's look at what's being claimed here. Pain receptors form early on but aren't wired up to anything. They connect to their destination by 20 weeks, enabling the physical reflex responses mentioned. However, there is no mind to appreciate or comprehend those signals for another seven weeks or so:\n \nFunctional maturity of the cerebral cortex is suggested by fetal and neonatal electroencephalographic patterns...First, intermittent electroencephalograpic bursts in both cerebral hemispheres are first seen at 20 weeks gestation; they become sustained at 22 weeks and bilaterally synchronous at 26 to 27 weeks.\n\n From here, which is a very in-depth study of neonatal pain.\n \n For there to be suffering, there must be an awareness and understanding of pain, otherwise it's just signals travelling along nerves, indistinguishable from any other signals. Add to that the very, very small proportion of abortions carried out at such a late term, and the fact they usually have exceptional extenuating circumstances, and it's clear that the overwhelming majority of abortions do not court any danger of inducing suffering in the foetus.\n \n I'll reiterate, in the hope that it will inform your interpretation of my arguments: I perceive abortion as tolerable. I can quite understand why some people would emotionally balk at the prospect, and it's entirely possible that I might be one of them if faced with the reality of the decision - I think it would very much depend upon how far gone the foetus was. However, I don't believe my squeamishness - untested at that - should be forced upon others who may be sufficiently motivated or clear-thinking to make a different choice. Hence I am pro choice, and I present here my justifications for holding that position.",

   "I, and most on the pro-choice side, make a clear distinction between what IS and what WILL BE. Again, a potential something is not that something. I am a potential billionaire but that does not make me a billionaire. I would love to be treated as a billionaire since I have that potential but that would be ridiculous. Another analogy (that gets around your objection to that particular example) is that every kid is a potential adult. That doesn't mean that they should be treated as adults when they are four years old because they have a very high probability of automatically becoming adults given time. \n \n They are human. So are all the cells in our bodies. I really don't care whether a cell has full human DNA or not. I will not value that cell or cells for that point alone. When I scratch my arm, I am killing millions of such cells. \n \n As for it growing, the growth alone only has worth in that it is a process that will lead to something that we DO value - i.e. full human persons. \n \n The main difference in our thinking process is that you seem to treat a potential something as that something. We all value babies. However, you seem to say that something that can become a baby needs to be valued as much as a baby. You certainly have the right to think that but it is very unconvincing. Most of us can tell the difference between a potential something and that something. A child is not an adult, even though it will become one. So, a child should not be treated as an adult because it is a potential adult. An unfertilized egg has the potential to become a person. Should it be treated as a person?\n \n \n Pictures can stir emotions but as rational beings we need to not jump to conclusions but to try to understand the situation as it actually is. When I see a picture of a mangled body, I get an emotional reaction because I quickly emotionally jump to the conclusion that the person who inhabited that body must have suffered when that damage was done. That is the main thought that drives my emotions at seeing pictures of mangled bodies. However, as a rational person, I need to step back and ask whether that actually happened - i.e. whether someone actually DID suffer that mutilation. There, I trust science since it supplies evidence and that evidence says that, for the great majority of abortions which happen in early term, there is no pain, or indeed no mind whatsoever. There can't be because the brain is insufficiently developed. Therefore, our gut reactions when seeing those photos are just wrong because they are based on imagination, not reality. Similarly, we can get a gut reaction when seeing operations or when seeing dead bodies cremated or worked on by an undertaker.

However, those that claim that fetuses can experience pain early fail to differentiate between reflex action and an actual sense of pain. Most scientific studies that have allowed for discussion and debate among scientists on this topic reveal that it is late in the pregnancy that pain can first be felt. Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_pain) has some nice summaries of the varying views on fetal pain.",

I'm referring to the unborn with the same dignity as I would any other human being. After all, an unborn child at the abortion stage has all of the inherent qualities of a born infant except the experience of breathing, itself. Unless you can actually prove that they don't feel pain and can't think or process information while in the womb? Can you actually prove that claim? I think not. But there is strong evidence to support what I'm saying. http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=51723 \n But studies have shown that your unborn child can hear sounds as early as 20 weeks and will be startled by loud noises at about 25 weeks. Very loud sounds can cause changes in your baby's heart rate and movements, and sometimes even cause them to empty their bladders.\n \n Instead of the womb being the quiet place scientists once assumed, it is actually awash in sounds, particularly the whooshing of your blood and digestive system, the thumping of your heart and your voice, which sounds louder than it would transmitted through the air since it reverberates through the bones and fluids in your body.\n \n Noises from outside your body are more muffled but they also make it through surprisingly clearly, says Robert Abrams, a fetal physiologist in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Florida. Low frequency sounds, such as those above middle C, tend to be more audible than higher frequency ones. Men's voices, for instance, come through clearer than women's, and music also is easily recognizable.\n \n It appears the fetus can even hear specific speech patterns and intonations, although probably not recognize words themselves, Fifer says. Some studies have shown that babies after birth will recognize -- and be comforted by -- a story read repeatedly to them while in the womb or even by particular songs, like the theme from a television show watched regularly during pregnancy.\n So not only can they feel pain at least as early as 20 weeks, if not earlier, but they can hear and process information at that early stage of development. Remember that it say's above that they feel pain between 7 and 20 weeks, so it's somewhere in between that stage of development.

It does not show 'pain felt' and 'degree of pain modification'. It shows the development of the pain system and the development of the pain modification system.

Does that mean you can sit in front of your unplugged TV and see a 99.9% perfect picture?\n \n Furthermore, 20 weeks only gets you as far as nerve impulses travelling between the receptor and the thalamus. There is still no mind to interpret or appreciate that as pain.\n \n \nAfter all, an unborn child at the abortion stage has all of the inherent qualities of a born infant except the experience of breathing, itself.\n\n At the 'abortion stage'?

Could I experiment with foetal tissue? No - but then again I couldn't bring myself to do a lot of things. Should my squeamishness prevent valuable research being done? I don't think so. And before you question the value of that research, bear in mind that a negative result can be just as useful and informative as a positive one.\n \n If you find it disturbing, then ask yourself why you don't find the deaths of children in wartime equally disturbing. You're impatient about me bringing them up again, aren't you? Why won't I just let it go; why do I keep bringing this irrelevant point up? Ask yourself why you're thinking like that when the subject is dying children, something you're determined to paint abortion as in order to establish its wrongness. Are you perhaps squeamish about the thought of all that death, caused by missiles fired by high-fiving soldiers sitting tens or hundreds of miles away? You won't permit yourself to think about such events in certain ways; you'll only think about it in terms of 'liberating a people' or 'spreading democracy', not an innocent, happy child abruptly having all or part of her body turned into a bloody gruel of masonry and shrapnel by an explosive device.\n \n What I'm trying to make you see here is that you are every bit as capable of rationalising as I. You present the issue to yourself in a way that makes it possible for you to make the right decision. You believe the right decision with abortion is to forbid it, so you portray the issue to yourself accordingly: abortion is murdering a child, which is clearly wrong, so you're right to advocate forbidding it. On the other hand, firing a missile into a crowded city is spreading democracy, which allows you to believe you're right about that too. Heck, if I said we should never fight wars because children suffer and die, you'd call me some kind of bleeding-heart liberal wimp. Yet at the same time I'm a cold-hearted murdering bastard because I'm prepared to permit abortion and the use of the remains for medical research - something that's had a better track record of solving problems than war, I might add.",

Am I right in that appraisal?\n \n So, it seems that our main difference is that I trust that scientific consensus can tell us the truth about reality (in this case, when a fetus can feel pain or have a rudimentary mind) and you trust that your religion tells the truth about reality where, presumably, your religion implies that early fetuses have some level of mind, sense of pain, etc. Otherwise, apart from the importance we place on potential and on the importance of a woman's right to her own body, we do have some overlap in the reasons for our views - namely, that some sense of empathy drives the decision of when to restrict abortions. That difference in world views is an insurmountable one - i.e. science vs religion.\n \n Given the range of scientific views, I have no doubt that, as you already showed, you will be able to find some scientific opinion that is more closely related to yours. However, scientists aren't right just because they are scientists. The scientific views that have withstood the test of time and, more specifically, the test of analysis and criticism from the scientific community - these are the scientific views that have proven most reliable. Where fetal pain is concerned, the scientific consensus is that the fetus cannot feel pain until late in the pregnancy - mainly since it is viewed that the cerebral cortex needs to play a role to actually register that pain and the connections and development of that cerebral cortex is insufficient at early stages. Many scientists actually push that point farther since they expect that consciousness is required, but those views still seem controversial. Either way, the scientists who view early fetuses as being able to experience pain fail to be able to explain how any early nerve impulses and reactions are anything other than simple reflex action - not experienced pain. The bottom line for me is that, since I myself am not an expert in biology, I trust the experiments and scientific method and scientific community scrutiny that has come to a consensus of determining that only late term fetuses can experience pain. I know you have much less trust in that scientific community. That difference in world views is likely insurmountable and we will just have to agree to disagree.",

It's not a subjective notion of a supernatural being which has no evidence of existence which should be in control. Her humanity involves being in control and making decisions about her body and reproduction. She's not a container, not a reproduction machine. Her life is not such a misery, hopefully. She can think.\n\n \n You see Jake, I actually agree with the bolded in principle. But in \"factual reality\" I still oppose the application of a woman's right over her own body where the death of another human being is concerned. All human beings deserve ultimate control over their own bodies, but as adults we are all also responsible for our own actions and conduct, and under no other circumstances can you show where because of the actions of a responsible adult, a totally innocent bystander can be needlessly murdered/denied life for the personal convenience of the perpetrator who caused the problem to exist completely apart from the person being killed in order to correct the presumed problem.\n \n Under your scenario, if a man beats his pregnant girlfriend and her unborn baby dies, the man could never be charged with murder, right? He hasn't actually killed a person, right? I mean, 3rd degree assault makes perfect sense for beating his girlfriend, but explain the second degree murder charge if you can. Here's an excerpt.\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,249107,00.html\n Man Charged With Murder After Beating Pregnant Girlfriend on Tape, Causing Miscarriage\n \n Wednesday, January 31, 2007 \n \n The boyfriend of a pregnant 18-year-old woman smirked and posed for an apartment building security camera before brutally beating her, causing her to miscarry, according to a complaint filed against the man.\n The Minnesota man was charged with second-degree murder on Tuesday in the death of his girlfriend's unborn child, marking rare use of a state law that allows a murder charge even though the mother survived. The couple also has a 6-month-old child together.\n \n Dino M. Scott, 20, smirked and made an obscene gesture on camera before he beat Namrata Ceisel on Sunday, the criminal complaint alleged.

With 1.4 million abortions a year in America, here are some stats that speak volumes to the fact that the health of the mother, nor the condition of the fetus is even considered when compiling numbers for why abortions take place. And neither do your alleged facts correlate with statistics from a reputable source.\n Facts on Induced Abortion in the United States\n \n January 2008\n INCIDENCE OF ABORTION\n \n &#8226; Nearly half of pregnancies among American women are unintended, and four in 10 of these are terminated by abortion.[1] Twenty-two percent of all pregnancies (excluding miscarriages) end in abortion.[2]\n &#8226; In 2005, 1.21 million abortions were performed, down from 1.31 million in 2000. From 1973 through 2005, more than 45 million legal abortions occurred.[2]\n &#8226; Each year, about two out of every 100 women aged 15&#8211;44 have an abortion; 47% of them have had at least one previous abortion.[3]\n Number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44, by year\n \n &#8226; At least half of American women will experience an unintended pregnancy by age 45[4], and, at current rates, about one-third will have had an abortion.[5,6]\n WHO HAS ABORTIONS?\n \n &#8226; Fifty percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are younger than 25: Women aged 20&#8211;24 obtain 33% of all abortions, and teenagers obtain 17%.[7]\n &#8226; Black women are 4.8 times as likely as non-Hispanic white women to have an abortion, and Hispanic women are 2.7 times as likely.[7]\n &#8226; Forty-three percent of women obtaining abortions identify themselves as Protestant, and 27% as Catholic.[3]\n &#8226; Women who have never married obtain two-thirds of all abortions.[7]\n &#8226; About 60% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.[7]\n &#8226; The abortion rate among women living below the federal poverty level ($9,570 for a single woman with no children) is more than four times that of women above 300% of the poverty level (44 vs. 10 abortions per 1,000 women).*[3]\n &#8226; The reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Three-fourths of women cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals; three-fourths say they cannot afford a child; three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents; and half say they do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner.[8]\n CONTRACEPTIVE USE\n \n &#8226; Fifty-four percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method (usually the condom or the pill) during the month they became pregnant. Among those women, 76% of pill users and 49% of condom users report having used their method inconsistently, while 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users report correct use.[9]\n &#8226; Forty-six percent of women who have abortions had not used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant. Of these women, 33% had perceived themselves to be at low risk for pregnancy, 32% had had concerns about contraceptive methods, 26% had had unexpected sex and 1% had been forced to have sex.[9]\n &#8226; Eight percent of women who have abortions have never used a method of birth control; nonuse is greatest among those who are young, poor, black, Hispanic or less educated.[9]\n &#8226; About half of unintended pregnancies occur among the 11% of women who are at risk for unintended pregnancy but are not using contraceptives. Most of these women have practiced contraception in the past.[1,10]http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.html\n \n \nSecondly, there is no similarity between aborting a foetus and yanking a full grown adult randomly out of a crowd and operating on him. The former has the potential to eventually become conscious, aware, and capable of suffering, provided the mother consents to continue her vital role in its development, while the other is already conscious, aware, and capable of suffering.\n\n \n That difference is Irrelevant to the debate Peeling. Both the child and the stranger are innocent of being the cause of the problem in any way, for which they are being required to be the fix for, both against their wills and due to nothing they did to cause the problem. That is the relevant issue in the hypothetical.\n \n \nFalse. If you were right, the mother would be legally entitled to abort her foetus at any stage, which isn't the case. First and foremost the developmental status of the foetus takes precedence, with the mother's wishes only considered should circumstances permit.\n\n \n Have you never heard of late term abortions Peeling?

When you find that out, you'll notice that it refers to the age of the foetus. So, exactly as I said in my last post: \"First and foremost the developmental status of the foetus takes precedence\". Only after that are the wishes of the mother considered.\n \n \nAnd neither do your alleged facts correlate with statistics from a reputable source.\n\n \n Really? Hmm.

Failure rate of contraception is about 1-2% per year? Sounds familiar :)\n \n\u0095 At least half of American women will experience an unintended pregnancy by age 45[4], and, at current rates, about one-third will have had an abortion.[5,6]\n\n That's just an extrapolation of the figures above.\n \n\u0095 About 60% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.[7]\n\n So it's not like they aren't giving parenthood a chance.\n \n\u0095 The reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life.

So the very source you affirm as 'respectable' disagrees with your disdainful assessment of motives for abortion.\n \n\u0095 Fifty-four percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method (usually the condom or the pill) during the month they became pregnant. Among those women, 76% of pill users and 49% of condom users report having used their method inconsistently, while 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users report correct use.[9]\n\n That's more like it. It's disappointing to see the figures are that high, but even so, they're trying. \n \n\u0095 Forty-six percent of women who have abortions had not used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant. Of these women, 33% had perceived themselves to be at low risk for pregnancy, 32% had had concerns about contraceptive methods, 26% had had unexpected sex and 1% had been forced to have sex.[9]\n\n Ok, so in reality only 11% of abortions result from 'heat of the moment' irresponsibility, with the rest attributable to poor sex education, inconsistent use of contraceptives, and contraceptive failure. So you're 11% right :)\n \nThat difference is Irrelevant to the debate Peeling. Both the child and the stranger are innocent of being the cause of the problem in any way, for which they are being required to be the fix for, both against their wills and due to nothing they did to cause the problem. That is the relevant issue in the hypothetical.\n\n Why? Because you say so? I'm sorry, but it doesn't work like that. The specific role a mother must consent to play in constructing a foetus, the real risks undertaken by the mother in performing that role, the absence of mental function in the foetus - all these factors are considered when ruling elective abortion before a certain stage in pregnancy to be legal. You might want your analogy to be relevant, but it simply isn't - it bears no resemblence to the issue at hand.\n \n Is the stranger in your analogy 'potentially' or 'actually' a conscious human being capable of suffering? If the latter, *poof* goes any relevance to the discussion. Is this stranger's continued welfare contingent upon the woman continuing to endure discomfort and risk to her health? No? *Poof*, there it goes again. Is this 'randomly picked innocent stranger' personally the only solution to the woman's problems? No? *Poof*.\n \n \nHave you never heard of late term abortions Peeling? But of course data is lacking on this most vile aspect of the Industry as it protects itself from we terrible pro-lifers. Here are some facts to get you up to speed.\n http://www.nrlc.org/NRLCintheNews/WashPost041907.html\n\n What relevance does this have to our discussion? Have I expressed support for late term abortion? Ummm.... let's see.... no.\n \nAre you actually saying that a parent has the legal right to kill his own children Peeling? Because that's what we're discussing here you know. The right of a parent to abort/kill their unborn baby.\n\n Allow me to remind you of what the point being made actually was:\n \nName me another scenario in life where one gender or class of person can determine the value of another class of person and where that definition changes according to the whims of the controlling class of person?\n\n \nEasy: any rights you have to exercise control over your own children that do not apply to some random stranger in the street.\n\n My reply can be correctly interpreted in two ways: you have rights over your children that you do not have over a stranger, and that a stranger does not have over your children. Since you have not actually disagreed with that response, am I to take it you accept it as a valid example of the kind you demanded?\n \n As to whether I support the right of a parent to kill their child or whether that is what we're discussing in abortion, the former is a strawman I won't bother tackling and the latter is simply your opinion, one you refuse to justify in any rational or consistent manner. You equate a fertilised egg with a newborn baby (all your arguments and analogies boil down to that equivocation), but when challenged retreat behind claims of 'potential'. When I challenge the consistency of those claims, and 'potential' is suddenly not your friend, you get upset and start calling me 'shallow', amongst other things.\n \n What we're talking about is the right of a mother - who based upon the statistics you sourced probably did not behave irresponsibly and, again based on your material, is most likely motivated by selfless concerns - to cease constructing an incomplete and mindless foetus. That's the unvarnished reality once you strip out the emotional appeals to cute little newborn babies and the nasty, selfish, sluttish harlots who murder them.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "Ao, here is a photo of a 21 week old baby outside the womb, and these babies live all the time now. 24 weeks is a 6 month old fetus/child. http://cellar.org/iotd.php?threadid=13397 At this age this child is a thinking, feeling human being with all of the parts we have, only much smaller and less developed.\n\n At 21 weeks, the premature baby is out of the womb and moving but that doesn't mean that it is thinking or feeling yet. I suspect that your suspicion of it being a \"thinking, feeling human being\" is that it simply looks like a miniature version of a baby. Science tells us that it will not start to think or feel for at least a few weeks yet. Meanwhile, every effort is made to keep it alive until and after it reaches that stage since there is no reason not to and its value in the now very near-term potential is important.\n \nIf the child was destined to never develop or grow as your hypothetical claims, then at birth it would die and I would accept that as Gods will. My argument is that it deserves a fighting chance just as this 21 week old preemie deserved, that as you can see has survived and flourished against all odds. It is humanities nature to always reach for life which is why abortion is such an unnatural solution to the problem it is used to rectify. It is overkill if you will. \n\n That is why I put the hypothetical that it will NEVER grow into anything more than it was at 12 weeks. By placing the condition on that hypothetical, I tried to exclude the very arguement of potential that you are once again introducting in this paragraph. Specifically, the premature 21 week old has potential, the 12 week old that will never grow into more does NOT have potential by the very definition of the hypothetical.\n \n Having re-stated the original hypothetical, what is it in that 12 week old fetus that will never develop farther that you value? It will NEVER feel, it will NEVER have emotions or thoughts. It has NO potential since, by the definition of the hypothetical, it will NEVER change. Future technology could keep it alive despite that lack of further development, so it would not NEED to die. What is it that you would value in that forever underdeveloped fetus? What you keep that non-developing fetus with no potential alive nevertheless if one could?\n \n I know that this is not a real situation but the only reason I brought up the hypothetical is to see if you have any arguements besides the one based on potential. Perhaps your arguement about potential is your only one. That is certainly a possibility. If that is the case, then I think we have no choice but to agree to disagree and leave it at that since, for those of us on the pro-choice side, though potential may be important, we view a woman's right to her own body as more important.\n \nThen how do you explain this? http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/08/28/nprem28.xml\n \n Very premature babies may need pain relieving drugs\n \n By Roger Highfield, Science Editor\n Last Updated: 11:57pm BST 27/08/2001\n \n THE unborn child may be able to feel pain as early as 20 weeks into pregnancy, a finding that suggests pain relief should be considered for the 2,500 extremely premature babies born each year who may be subjected to painful procedures.\n \n The head of a government-appointed expert group said a foetus was definitely aware of pain by 24 weeks, perhaps as early as 20 weeks, according to a review of the latest research.\n \n The Medical Research Council's expert group, chaired by Prof Eve Johnstone of Edinburgh University, makes a strong case for additional research on ways to prevent the unnecessary suffering of extremely premature children.\n \n Prof Johnstone said these babies had to undergo painful procedures, such as heel pricks, blood monitoring, injections and insertion of breathing tubes. \"We ought to study this carefully.\"\n So what have I shown here? Above I have shown that a 21 week old preemie can survive outside of the womb and that it obviously has a mind, feelings and a soul as it is a living person at that point. And here I have shown that it has been proven that fetuses at that age DO FEEL PAIN. And yet we still allow them to be aborted and the abortion industry is fighting any legislation requiring the use of pain relievers during abortions. \n \n Does that make sense to you? Does that cause you to respect this multi-billion dollar industry that survives on the corpses of 1.3 million murdered children a year? And yes Ao, I continue to refer to them as children because if the practice of abortion was never conceived of in this Country, then each year, 1.3 million more new babies would be born on average than are currently allowed to exist.\n\n I explain it by the fact that there are some scientists that claim that a cortical connection is not required to experience pain. Though the majority of scientists disagree, the organization which was referred to in your quote would apparently prefer to give the benefit of the doubt.\n \n I put more trust in scientific concensus since individual scientists are fallable and are subject to bias that can be filtered out through scientific debates in the scientific community.",

   "How typical lyte. Rather than answer a very valid question that's based on very real symptoms and medical evidence in an abortion debate, you choose to once again lash out at me personally while never even responding to the issue of the psychological effects of abortion on women at all.\n\n I addressed the (loaded) question precisely as it deserved. You focused on ONE point; I brought in the ones that you were purposely ignoring because they don't help your case. Your ignorance of these other points only serves to show that you are hypocritically trying to make other people's decisions based on YOUR interpretations of what their possible effects might be in just a single realm when equally important realms also need to be considered by the people who will actually be effected. It's not my fault if you're plugging your ears and screaming \"lalalalalalala!,\" so you're in no position to accuse me of ignoring your point. I didn't deny the information on the page, I didn't ignore that this line of argumentation exists; instead, I showed why you are being illogical and hypocritical. It goes back to my earlier question that you refused to answer: if some abortions are okay, why aren't others, and who decides?\n \n \nReal intelligent and mature response lyte. Exactly what I expected of you.\n\n Damn right it was. I notice you didn't really make much argument against it, either.\n \n \nSo I realize you'll just reject and ignore my words lyte, but what does this picture reveal to you? \n http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/ASMF/asmf14.html Isn't this a picture of a dead child?\n\n Nope. There's nothing but text (and image text) on that page.\n \n \nSo, I'll ask one more time. Any comment on the posted evidence or do you just want to reduce this thread to another flamefest because you're unable to deal with my arguments again? Will this be your usual M.O. with every response you ever make to me that you can't refute?\n\n Again, don't blame me for the fact that you can't read. I didn't deny that some mothers experience negative psychological effects; in fact, I said quite the opposite:Does Archie give a rat's XXX that women/couples who aren't really ready for parenthood but who have the child anyway also face hardships? [bold and color added]\nI clearly said that there is more going on here than just the psychological effect on the mother. I said that all of these things need to be addressed, not that the effects you mention are irrelevant. Your posting the same thing again won't convince me that you're right. Your failure to address any of my points sure as hell won't convince me that you're right.\n You accuse me of being a legend in my own mind, of being an elitist intellectual, of being illogical, but here I am with a laundry list of extremely topical objections to your one-dimensional approach to a complex situation, and you evade all of my points in order to accuse me of not addressing the issue and proceeding to repeat yourself.\n \n Classic Archieism.",

   "You've got to realize that a compromise has been made on the abortion issue. Society has decided that the 'baby' is a fetus until certain developmental stages are reached. After that point a woman no longer has the 'choice' of whether or not to carry it to birth. This compromise allows women to have control over their bodies and forces them to make a choice before the 'baby' is fully developed. I believe that this compromise is necessary if women are to ever enjoy the same rights as a man. Sex IS a fact of life and women are entitled to enjoy it, just as men are. Perhaps, one day there will be another way for women to better control their bodies but until then abortions will be a fact of life (whether legal or not).",

That baby is alive. A fetus, no matter which way you slice it, is not a person. The argument that life begins at conception or at the quickening or when daddy blows a wad, is at its face flawed. To make this point, some eggs that are \"conceived\" don't attach to the lining of the uterus and are rejected from the body during menstruation. Are we to say that those are lost souls? \n \n Here is an idea, if you don't like abortion, don't have one. But don't stand in front of a clinic and throw mean words and lettuce, I assume, or maybe cabbage, at some girl who has to make a hard decision. Don't go on tv and pound fist on table railing of the evil's of abortion. Make the decision yourself and believe me, your mind will be changed. \n \n It is sad that abortion is necessary. But I really have to hand it to the pro-lifers. Not teaching teens about condoms, I guess helps make more abortions. Abstinence doesn't reduce sexual promiscuity and activity, it only increase risky sexual behavior. So you made your bed, sleep in it!\n\n \n Thier is a big difference between an unfortunant event such as a miscariage and an abortion.

You know if someone kills a women who is preagnant that person is charged with not only the murder of the mother but also the unborn child, and a women who has an abortion should be charged with murder and senenced to the max for the simple fact that abortions are a brutal act of violence against a child.

One way or another women will control their own bodies regardless of slavery nazis like yourself who try to control women, and only see women as being invisible.\n \n \n Wow, what in your head makes you think that's OK? emoticon_rolleyes First of all it isn't murder, so please learn the very basic definition of the words you 'try' to use. Secondly, according to your so-called reasoning, if a woman dies while giving birth then the baby should also be sentenced to the max for committing her murder. Deal with it.\n\n \n OK, well freedom of choice is ####, We do not have freedom if we kill someone and I beg to differ but abortion is murder, and a very brutall murder at that.

   "Christina_Castl:\n When you call abortion murder, do you consider abortion murder at all stages of a pregnancy or only in late term? Assuming that you consider all abortion murder - since the great majority of abortions are performed in the first trimester of pregnancy, what exactly is it that you would think is being murdered? You might call it a \"baby\" at that stage but what do you think that embryo is at that moment? Do you think it thinks, feels, senses perceptions, feels pain? What specifically is it about what that embryo actually IS that draws your sympathy? Is it only the knowledge of what it will BECOME - i.e. one of us - or is there some aspect of what the embryo is at that early stage that draws your sympathy? \n \n Here, I am trying to distinguish between any value you might place on the embryo due to its potential vs value you place on the embryo for what it actually is at that point in its development (its present, as opposed to its future). Most pro-life arguements seem to revolve around the embryo's potential. Many if not most on the pro-choice side also value potential but not as much as we value the mother's rights over her own body, so arguements purely about potential largely fall on deaf ears. \n \n The pro-life arguement would be more effective in convincing people if genuine reasons were presented for valuing embryos for what they are at that particular state of development. As an example, many on the pro-choice side, including myself, value late term fetuses since they can have the beginnings of a mental existence of some sort so that there is \"somebody home\" in that body that can potentially suffer, feel, have emotions, etc. For us, that value then supercedes the mother's right to her own body (with the usual exceptions of rape, and risk to mother's life or health) so we would largely agree with restrictions to late term abortions.",

   "Christina_Castl:\n The pro-life arguement would be more effective in convincing people if genuine reasons were presented for valuing embryos for what they are at that particular state of development. As an example, many on the pro-choice side, including myself, value late term fetuses since they can have the beginnings of a mental existence of some sort so that there is \"somebody home\" in that body that can potentially suffer, feel, have emotions, etc. For us, that value then supercedes the mother's right to her own body (with the usual exceptions of rape, and risk to mother's life or health) so we would largely agree with restrictions to late term abortions.\n\n \n I, for one, am Pro-Choice, right up until the woman gives birth. The instances you describe as acceptable circumstances for late term abortions, I believe, account for almost all of the abortions performed at that time.\n \n \nChristina_Castl:\n When you call abortion murder, do you consider abortion murder at all stages of a pregnancy or only in late term? Assuming that you consider all abortion murder - since the great majority of abortions are performed in the first trimester of pregnancy, what exactly is it that you would think is being murdered? You might call it a \"baby\" at that stage but what do you think that embryo is at that moment? Do you think it thinks, feels, senses perceptions, feels pain? What specifically is it about what that embryo actually IS that draws your sympathy? Is it only the knowledge of what it will BECOME - i.e. one of us - or is there some aspect of what the embryo is at that early stage that draws your sympathy?\n\n \n I might have missed this part amongst all the posts that have been put in this thread, but I would like to point out that abortion is not murder. Murder is illegal killing with malice aforethought and is, also, a legal term. Abortion has not been ruled illegal. I am just really antsy when someone uses that term because it is often used as another emotional term with the hopes that it will garner support for a particular viewpoint when it is, actually, anything but an emotional term.",

There are several types of procedures; one is called dilation and extraction which is used very late in pregnancy and involves dilating the cervix so the fetus comes into the vagina feet first. This is the stuff of the anti-choice movement's famous cartoons pretending that a ''baby'' right out of a Good Housekeeping ad is killed on the verge of live birth. In reality, the fetus involved is often already brain-dead or otherwise hopelessly flawed, and the procedure protects the woman's health, including her ability to have children in the future. The procedure may also be used to remove a fetus that is already deceased, but they don't tell you that part in the anti-choice brochures, and you certainly won't hear these facts from anti-choicers that were raised on propaganda like archangel. You should also know that the procedure is very, very rarely used. In-fact it's way less than 1%... not even 1/4th of 1%... even less than 1/8th of 1%, around only 0.14% - but they make it sound like it's a common procedure emoticon_rolleyes \n \n There are also some very good legitimate reasons for this form of abortion, one is called Hydrocephalus, but the anti-choice movement doesn't want you to learn about it either. You won't hear people like archangel talk about Hydrocephalus, because they don't have any medical background, and don't have a clue as to what it is. Hydrocephalus is when a fetus has abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities of the brain. The fetuses head may expand to a abnormally large radius of up to 250% of a normal skull at birth, making it impossible for it to pass through the cervix. Eventually the pregnant woman would die without this procedure!\n \n Not only that but because of the abnormally large amount of fluid accumulating in the fetuses skull, compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually causes irreversible brain damage, and other life threatening complications. The anti-choice movement doesn't want you to learn about any of those facts either. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor (a non-physiological state) sets in. Around 90% of fetuses with spina bifida usually end up with Hydrocephalus. So as you can see when this procedure is used it is NOT used on a normal fetus as the anti-choice propaganda wants people to believe. The fetus usually already has irreversible brain damage or is already dead, so they feel absolutely nothing, another fact that the anti-choice propaganda doesn't want you to know about. That's a LOT different than the cartoons used by the anti-choice movement where they try to trick you into thinking that the fetus was right out of a Good Housekeeping ad, or the faked photoshopped pictures that archangel commonly posts. The fact is that the so-called term of 'partial birth abortion' is not even recognized as a medical term by the American Medical Association, nor the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The term is pure propaganda used to scare non-medical people into whipping up visions of torture on perfect fetuses, and nothing could be further from the truth!",

The term is pure propaganda used to scare non-medical people into whipping up visions of torture on perfect fetuses, and nothing could be further from the truth!\n\n \n I don't know if you're purposely lying or just ignorant Ingus, either way though, everything you have said here is a delusional fairy tale. Here are some actual facts to consider.\n Facts:\n 1.4 million abortions are performed in the US per year, 44% on women who have had previous abortions, 82% on women who are unmarried or separated. This is enough for 43% of American women to have an abortion during their lives at present rates.\n 89% of abortions in US are performed before 12 weeks, 1% after 20 weeks (90% of these for non-medical reasons).\n D&X (Dilation and Extraction) A late-term (post 20 week) procedure in which the fetus is brought feet first into the birth canal, a large needle is inserted into its skull, its brain suctioned out, and the fetus removed. Popularly known as \"partial birth\" abortion.\n D&E (Dilation and Evacuation) A late-term procedure in which a serrated forceps is inserted into the womb, and the fetus dismembered and removed. More common than D&X, above.\n In D&X or D&E the fetus is usually, but not always, killed first, by cutting umbilical cord or via injection of digoxin or other lethal agent. The rationale for not killing the fetus before suctioning its brain or cutting it to pieces is a better medical outcome for mother, and that the nervous system of fetus not sufficiently developed to \"appreciate pain.\"\n Women who have had late-term abortions for non-medical reasons tend to be young, living with their parents, and to have involved their parents in the decision. The inference is that it just took a long time for the families to reach a decision to abort.\n - US News & World Report, January 1998, pp 20-32\n To survive, a very premature baby usually must have developed at least 23 weeks. - US News & World Report, March 30, 1998, p60.\n Conclusions:\n Women who seek abortion do so often because there is no one they can turn to for the love and help they need to raise a child. As long as so many of our men are not man enough to help raise their children, beating those women with the blunt instrument of the Law will generally be the wrong solution. We need to build consensus on abortion, rather than to continue a polarized debate that so far has led to a widening gulf between the political left and right that threatens the integrity of our society.\n Late term abortions, however, are particularly grisly, whether the unborn fetus has its brains sucked out through a needle, or whether it is cut to pieces in its mother's womb. Although there is national disagreement as to whether a fetus at a given stage of development is a baby, there is no disagreement that it is rapidly becoming a baby, and that late-term abortions tread perilously close to infanticide, especially considering that only about 10% of them are done for medical reasons. Fortunately, they are performed rarely enough that doing without them will not cause a major dislocation in our society. While we tone down the pro-life and pro-choice shouting, let us also back away from non-medical D&E's and D&X's, and do so in our morals, in our medical ethics, and in our Law.http://www.dogchurch.org/dogpac/abortfact.html\n \n I notice that you wrote 3 paragraphs of your personal opinion rather than simply post just 1 link that factually expresses the drivel you spewed. So how about giving us any actual facts that support what you are claiming above? You can't and wont do that though because nothing you have said is the least bit true, but is said only so you can live with the fact that you endorse, condone and defend the cold blooded murder of infants who would surely grow into perfectly healthy children if they weren't so violently murdered by their own mothers who willingly agree to these procedures.",

First, they show that not all pro-life proponents advocate making abortion illegal in the first trimester since nearly 50% of Americans call themselves pro-life while only 29% would keep abortion illegal in the first trimester.

   "I, for one, am Pro-Choice, right up until the woman gives birth. The instances you describe as acceptable circumstances for late term abortions, I believe, account for almost all of the abortions performed at that time.\n\n From what I have read, I agree that the mentioned exceptions do account for nearly all the abortions performed in the third trimester. However, I think that there are political advantages for having some sort of law solidifying that third term generally illegality with exceptions in law (which Roe vs Wade seems to do but is not advertised enough). The main draw of the pro-life camp is the sympathy that is drawn to abortion of late term fetuses. If you take away that arguement by officially making most reasons for late term abortions illegal (apart from the risks to health and life, and rape and incest), then you take much of the bite out of the pro-life arguement. Aparently, the UK did something similar where late term abortions where mainly banned. This took the bite out of the pro-life movement and they haven't had any real strength since to push that level earlier. \n \nI might have missed this part amongst all the posts that have been put in this thread, but I would like to point out that abortion is not murder. Murder is illegal killing with malice aforethought and is, also, a legal term. Abortion has not been ruled illegal. I am just really antsy when someone uses that term because it is often used as another emotional term with the hopes that it will garner support for a particular viewpoint when it is, actually, anything but an emotional term.\n\n I personally don't view the great majority of abortions as murder since, even the majority of those performed in late term, are performed as a sort of \"self-defense\" against risk to the mother's life or health and the ones performed in earlier terms are performed on fetuses and embryos that are just bodies with \"nobody home\". If no mind exists yet, then I cannot view abortion as murder. However, that line starts getting much fuzzier once one gets into the possibility of abortion for arbitrary reasons at near term. If a fetus were a few days from birth and the mother had an abortion done on it, it might border on being called murder - depending on the reasons.",

   "THE BIBLE SAYS WE SHOULD HAVE RESPECT FOR LIFE\n\n Sounds to me like someone is \"filtering\" your bible. Don't you want to hear both sides of the story Christina? Many forms of killing were considered perfectly legal in ancient Israel, and levitical law listed many of the exceptions. Generally, levitical law permitted killing in times of war, the commission of justice and in self-defense. Now here is an interesting bit of information that you will never hear a anti-choicer admit. Sometimes, God even gave Israel permission to kill infant children. In Samuel 15:3, God ordered Saul to massacre the Amalekites: \"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; put to death men and women, children and infants, ox and sheep...\" Most Christians do not know about this because it has been hidden, mislabeled or censored from them so they are uneducated about it, and who do you supposed censored it? The bottom line is that you will NEVER find anyplace in the bible that says that abortion is bad. The bible also does not say that the fetus is a human being. Because of this some religious radicles have to twist the truth around to make it \"look\" like the bible is against abortion, when in fact it is not. Fortunately, the Jews are legendary for their fanatical preservation of the law, and they have never considered abortion to be a sin. That alone should make many anti-choice advocates stop and reconsider the legal basis, holy or otherwise, for their opposition to abortion. \n \n Now, if you are going to live your life by the word of a man made book like the bible, then lets examine it and how you live to see if you're a hypocrite or not. The Bible plainly and clearly forbids wool/linen clothing. Leviticus 19:19 \"You shall not let your livestock breed with another kind. You shall not sow your field with mixed seed. Nor shall a garment of mixed linen and wool come upon you.\" Do you or your family members wear wool or linen clothing Christina? The Bible plainly and clearly condemns tattoos. Leviticus 19: 28 \"You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor tattoo any marks on you: I am the LORD.\" Do you or any of your family members have any tattoos Christina? The Bible forbids various grooming styles for men. Leviticus 19:27 \"You shall not shave around the sides of your head, nor shall you disfigure the edges of your beard.\" Does any of your family members shave Christina? The Bible says don't eat pork, ham or bacon. Deuteronomy 14:8 \"The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn't chew the cud, is unclean to you: of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses.\" Do you or any family members eat pork, ham or bacon Christina? We could go on like this all night. The point is that when you say that the bible says that abortion is wrong - YOU are wrong, as it NEVER says that anywhere in the bible, and yet there are plenty of other things that the bible clearly does say not to do - that you probably do - do, so that would make you a hypocrite IF you are living your life according to this man made book called the bible.",

   " Exodus 23 7 states we should not put the innocent to death, well a fetus is an innocent.\n\n No Christina, you are reading into that, and that is being disingenuous. The bible ALSO contains verses that indicate the fetus is not a human being, and that suggest abortion does not involve killing a human being. Whomever is \"translating\" the bible for you is putting their own bias on it. It's time that you learn to think for yourself. There is a good pdf on the net called the wisdom of abortion which you should read. It will show you both sides of the story and some examples I will list for you below. \n \n In the Bible, breath, soul and human life are synonymous. A body without breath may be alive but it lacks a human soul and therefore is not a human being. For example, in Genesis Adam becomes a \"living soul\" in a two step process. First, Adam's body is created, much as the fetus is created in the womb. Genesis 2:7: \"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground.\" . . Adam's body is created but he is not yet a \"living soul.\" The verse continues: . . . \"and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul\". So only in step two, after God gives him \"the breath of life,\" does Adam become a living soul. The same idea, that it's the breath that makes us human, appears in Ezekiel 37:8-10, too. The verses describe human bodies that lack breath: \"And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them\". As in Genesis, there is flesh and skin but no breath, therefore no human life. The verses continues: \"Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. So they'll live as human beings only when they possess the breath of life. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army\". These verses show that a body doesn't become a human being until it's animated with the breath of life.\n \n These verses in the bible directly contradict the idea that the zygote is human at conception.\n \n Let's discuss one more verse. Luke 1:31 describes a prophecy of the conception and birth of Jesus. The verse is: \"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus\". Now suppose God wanted the Bible to teach that a zygote is a human being. Then the verse would have instead said: \"And, behold, thou shalt conceive a human being in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.\" But it does NOT say that because until the babies first breath God does not consider the newly-conceived zygote to be a human being (yet). Miscarriages are another good example of this, one that religious radicals try to discount.",

   "According to the Bible, humans first sinned because they chose knowledge over obedience. Is this what you believe, that we should submit to God, or at least to his self-styled representatives on Earth?\n\n \n It's a false dichotomy that some critics of religion have cast religion in by saying that submitting to spiritual authority and thinking/reasoning are going to be juxtaposed. One only need look at giants like Galileo, Newton, and Kelvin to see that such isn't necessarily the case at all. That's not to say that the poster you responded to is on that level, but please don't make assumptions about whether or not someone has thought through an issue or not. Many of us are pro-life because we believe it is the reasonable thing to do, and it so happens that our religion and reason almost always work together hand-in-hand for doing good in the world such as valuing life and saving lives. You've no doubt heard the arguments given and just because you reject them doesn't mean their wrong. Heck, even many pro-choice people are often against abortion as a procedure. (Remember the old Clinton statement \"safe and rare\"?) Please don't automatically jump to prejudiced conclusions just because you hear the terms 'religion' and 'bible'. \n \n \nThis person may have thought it through, but simply invoking religion is not evidence. It's evidence of obedience, not of knowledge being sought and found. \n\n \n Then what would ever BE \"evidence\" for something like that? One's view on whether abortion is ok or not is a moralistic one--we're not talking about someone trying to prove, say, that something happened historically, or that someone is guilty of a crime. \"Evidence\" isn't really the right term for this. Since \"evidence\" is a term we would use for a much different kind of discussion, I assume what you really mean is \"argument\". So what argument suffices, in your view, to say that abortion is or isn't ok? After all, there's no central Committee above everyone deciding what should be considered rational or not. It seems to me that it's quite rational to say that taking a life of an every stage of what will soon be a human being thereby preventing it from living and growing into a toddler, adolescent and adult is a wrong thing to do in most cases, simply on the basis that it is a form of harm.",

I've posted more than any other member save 1, so I have alot of info here to support my perspective. Start posting some actual evidence rather than just your opinion if you want to impress someone, because your opinion doesn't carry much weight around here. Facts like these, which you completely ignored when I posted them above. Face it, you don't want to debate facts; you just want to spew your pro death gospel of murder.\n Facts:\n 1.4 million abortions are performed in the US per year, 44% on women who have had previous abortions, 82% on women who are unmarried or separated. This is enough for 43% of American women to have an abortion during their lives at present rates.\n 89% of abortions in US are performed before 12 weeks, 1% after 20 weeks (90% of these for non-medical reasons).\n D&X (Dilation and Extraction) A late-term (post 20 week) procedure in which the fetus is brought feet first into the birth canal, a large needle is inserted into its skull, its brain suctioned out, and the fetus removed. Popularly known as \"partial birth\" abortion.\n D&E (Dilation and Evacuation) A late-term procedure in which a serrated forceps is inserted into the womb, and the fetus dismembered and removed. More common than D&X, above.\n In D&X or D&E the fetus is usually, but not always, killed first, by cutting umbilical cord or via injection of digoxin or other lethal agent. The rationale for not killing the fetus before suctioning its brain or cutting it to pieces is a better medical outcome for mother, and that the nervous system of fetus not sufficiently developed to \"appreciate pain.\"\n Women who have had late-term abortions for non-medical reasons tend to be young, living with their parents, and to have involved their parents in the decision. The inference is that it just took a long time for the families to reach a decision to abort.\n &#8211; US News & World Report, January 1998, pp 20-32\n To survive, a very premature baby usually must have developed at least 23 weeks. &#8211; US News & World Report, March 30, 1998, p60.",

   "From what I have read, I agree that the mentioned exceptions do account for nearly all the abortions performed in the third trimester. However, I think that there are political advantages for having some sort of law solidifying that third term generally illegality with exceptions in law (which Roe vs Wade seems to do but is not advertised enough). The main draw of the pro-life camp is the sympathy that is drawn to abortion of late term fetuses. If you take away that arguement by officially making most reasons for late term abortions illegal (apart from the risks to health and life, and rape and incest), then you take much of the bite out of the pro-life arguement. Aparently, the UK did something similar where late term abortions where mainly banned. This took the bite out of the pro-life movement and they haven't had any real strength since to push that level earlier. \n\n \n Ao, I believe that a woman can have an abortion for any legal reason (pertaining to abortion and pregnancy - under which criteria the reasoning that the child was unwanted still applies since an unwanted child was very likely an unwanted pregnancy, as well) under the sun right up until the child completely leaves the womb. Otherwise, a woman's bodily integrity is still being usurped by someone who has wished to impose their views on a woman's body from the outside. Since all forms of discrimination are abhorrent (and most, if not all, are officially illegal), to me, and women are one group that can be highly discriminated against, I do not believe that abortions should be performed simply because they are the wrong gender, they have genetic abnormalities or they do not fit the eugenic criteria that the parents wanted them to fulfill. But I do not believe that severe deformities that could cause extreme pain to the fetus, eventually, or mother or the inability to carry through with a high-risk pregnancy due to a severe lack of means to fulfill the pregnancy's medical needs, fits any definition of discrimination.\n \n \n I personally don't view the great majority of abortions as murder since, even the majority of those performed in late term, are performed as a sort of \"self-defense\" against risk to the mother's life or health and the ones performed in earlier terms are performed on fetuses and embryos that are just bodies with \"nobody home\". If no mind exists yet, then I cannot view abortion as murder. However, that line starts getting much fuzzier once one gets into the possibility of abortion for arbitrary reasons at near term. If a fetus were a few days from birth and the mother had an abortion done on it, it might border on being called murder - depending on the reasons.\n\n \n I believe that abortion either IS murder or it isn't.

   "Ao, I believe that a woman can have an abortion for any legal reason (pertaining to abortion and pregnancy - under which criteria the reasoning that the child was unwanted still applies since an unwanted child was very likely an unwanted pregnancy, as well) under the sun right up until the child completely leaves the womb. Otherwise, a woman's bodily integrity is still being usurped by someone who has wished to impose their views on a woman's body from the outside.

But I do not believe that severe deformities that could cause extreme pain to the fetus, eventually, or mother or the inability to carry through with a high-risk pregnancy due to a severe lack of means to fulfill the pregnancy's medical needs, fits any definition of discrimination.\n\n It seems that you yourself have some reservations about what type of abortions can be done in late term (bolded text). As an extreme case, would you allow a woman to have an abortion a few days from term because she decided that she didn't want to have the baby after all? Judging from the reservations you mentioned, I would guess not. This would mean that you also would place reservations on when abortions can be performed and not leave it completely up to the woman. After all, not all people make wise decisions. \n \n My personal view is that, up to roughly the beginning of the third trimester, there is only one person's rights that need to be taken into account since, prior to a fetus gaining any mental existence, it doesn't make sense to me for a fetus to have rights since they are mere bodies without minds. Sometime in the late second or third trimester, the fetus starts acquiring a rudimentary mind so that it might suffer pain, have emotions, simple thoughts, etc. In my view, this justifies giving it rights to life. Then, it is a balance of rights of the mother vs rights of the fetus. When there is a risk to the mothers life or major risk to her health, or if she was a victim of rape or incest, then I would still allow the woman the abortion in the third term. Indeed, there might be other exceptions to discuss. I agree that, if it is determined that the fetus is severely deformed and will suffer if brought to term, then, for the sake of the fetus, it might be best to abort it - \"mercy killing\" of a sort. That would have to be discussed in detail since some might consider it justified to abort if the fetus has any life-limiting abnormalities, thus distorting that exception. \n \n I think that any law should take into account general exceptions that are reasoned out and make sense (which of course can be a relative judgement). I simply think that letting abortion happen at any stage for any arbitrary reason is itself unjust since, in late term, there are two people involved, not just one.\n \nI believe that abortion either IS murder or it isn't. There is no inbetween. If it is deemed an illegal killing with malice aforethought under the law, it is murder. If it is not, it isn't murder.\n\n I differentiate between abortions in early term vs abortions in late term since, in early term, the embryo/fetus is only a body. In late term, it can have a mind and, in my view, should get some rights as a new person. \n \n Defining murder purely on legal grounds (i.e. what is illegal killing as the laws are currently defined) is relative to the laws that currently exist. Prior to Roe vs. Wade, nearly all abortions would most likely have been legally considered murder. Did that make all abortions really murder? I say no. I find it more relevant to analyze what the term murder means based on reasoned analysis, independent of any legal status, and whether it applies to abortion. From that analysis, I personally came to the conclusion mentioned in my last post.",

   "It's a false dichotomy that some critics of religion have cast religion in by saying that submitting to spiritual authority and thinking/reasoning are going to be juxtaposed.\n\n \n Yes. It's not logical to simply cite, \"the Bible tells me so, the Bible was written by God,\" and consider that an argument. The Bible has been wrong. It's also not logical to cite authority to God. It necessarily begs further questions about your God's unproven existence to those who don't believe in that God, or in any God. If we don't simply believe in your God, on the basis of your presupposition, he can have no authority over the rest of us. One must come up with another argument.\n \n Should each religion have it's own definition or completely different idea of logic, which favours that religion and its God? \n \n \nOne only need look at giants like Galileo, Newton, and Kelvin to see that such isn't necessarily the case at all.\n\n \n Were they making those kinds of arguments? \n \n \nThat's not to say that the poster you responded to is on that level, but please don't make assumptions about whether or not someone has thought through an issue or not.\n\n \n The poster needs to show this.\n \n \nMany of us are pro-life because we believe it is the reasonable thing to do, and it so happens that our religion and reason almost always work together hand-in-hand for doing good in the world such as valuing life and saving lives. You've no doubt heard the arguments given and just because you reject them doesn't mean their wrong. Heck, even many pro-choice people are often against abortion as a procedure. (Remember the old Clinton statement \"safe and rare\"?) Please don't automatically jump to prejudiced conclusions just because you hear the terms 'religion' and 'bible'. \n \n \n \n Then what would ever BE \"evidence\" for something like that? One's view on whether abortion is ok or not is a moralistic one--we're not talking about someone trying to prove, say, that something happened historically, or that someone is guilty of a crime. \"Evidence\" isn't really the right term for this. Since \"evidence\" is a term we would use for a much different kind of discussion, I assume what you really mean is \"argument\". So what argument suffices, in your view, to say that abortion is or isn't ok? After all, there's no central Committee above everyone deciding what should be considered rational or not. It seems to me that it's quite rational to say that taking a life of an every stage of what will soon be a human being thereby preventing it from living and growing into a toddler, adolescent and adult is a wrong thing to do in most cases, simply on the basis that it is a form of harm.\n\n \n Here you make other arguments besides, \"the Bible told me so, which was written by God, so it must be right\". That was my point. These things may be espoused by your religion, but they deal with more universal ideas as well. One doesn't need to necessarily be Christian or a member of a particular church, to make these arguments.\n \n We can have a debate at least, even if we don't agree. I don't agree there's a human presence in early development. It would depend on how one defines a human. DNA itself doesn't suffice, that exists in other places besides the fertilized egg in the uterus. I would argue that it's not rational to say a potential toddler necessarily has anything to do with an actual toddler, other than in terms of DNA. When the fetus is at a certain point in development, it will have more in common with a baby.",

   "Lol. Ao, that is exactly what I was telling someone on Facebook just recently. I know Pro-Choicers can disagree amongst themselves. It is the same with Pro-Lifers, lol.\n \n I prefer it that way, actually.\n\n These forums tend to most often split into two opposing camps, which obscures the reality that each camp has its own variations. I think some people view it as disloyalty if one disagrees with other members of ones own camp, or they think that the \"enemy\" is engaging in \"divide and conquer\". I think it is far more important to try to address all sides in as honest a discussions as one can to try to understand the reasoning of all sides. Sometimes, this leads to a change of attitude on either side. Most often, it is just a useful learning experience. Either way, as long as both parties remain cordial (typically, more difficult when dealing with the opposite camp), then it is an enjoyable experience.\n \nI believe that a fetus has rights but that a woman's rights will always trump the fetus' rights when the zef remains a part of her womb. I just see the issue as two sets of rights diametrically opposed to each other. I just see the woman's rights as, inherently, more important. \n\n Given that you give the woman the choice automatically, under all circumstances, then you are effectively rendering any fetal rights as moot and non-existent. You would then, as an extreme case, allow a woman to abort a fetus one day from birth if she decided at the last moment not to have the baby - even it both she and the fetus was healthy, and there was no other compelling reason. Such an abortion would certainly bother me from a fundamental view of human rights. Doesn't it bother you?\n \n I would have a strong sense of sympathy for the fetus. Out of sight is not out of mind. I would recognize that, at that very late stage, it can feel, have emotions, feel pain, etc - just like a newborn. The woman, on the other hand, had nearly nine months to decide to get rid of the pregnancy. Waiting until that last moment would be pure irresponsibility. I think there should be a deadline for deciding for arbitrary reasons - roughly until the beginning of the third trimester. After that, when there are two minds involved, not just one, then I would advocate balancing rights where, most often (cases of woman's health, risk of death, etc.), the woman's rights would win out. However, in rare cases such as the one I mentioned, then I do think that the fetus's rights would win out. Balance doesn't mean that one automatically wins every time. That seems grossely unjust. \n \n Perhaps your fear is that, once one starts limiting late term abortion rights to certain exceptions, then some new circumstance might come up which is not addressed by law but which would be a compelling reason for the woman to have an abortion. I agree that that would be a risk, and would hope that some provision by law could be set up for new exceptions. Meanwhile, the exceptions would have to be spelled out as extensively as possible to exclude those possibilities. Yes, it would be an imperfect system but, in my view, less imperfect than a system that would allow a woman an abortion for any arbitrary reason at any arbitrary time - such as the example I gave.",

I just don't understand why not. Do you have sympathy toward the newly born? If so, then what is the difference, in your view, about what that newly born is compared to the about-to-be-born that makes you have sympathy toward one and not the other? Is its location (inside vs outside the mother) so important about what it inherently is? \n \n Otherwise, if you do have sympathy toward the about-to-be-born fetus, then why do its rights have a negligible weighting factor while the mother who wants to abort at that late stage (in the extreme case, for no other reason that she changed her mind at the last moment) has an 100% weighting factor no matter how that balance of impact on mother vs fetus pans out?\n \n I suspect that you mainly are concerned about the unexpected situation where a woman would be justified in having an abortion, while the law would not have predicted that exception - or other such concerns. I suppose that, in that case, it comes down to a judgement factor of what concerns weigh on us the most. For me, I would be more concerned with the rare case of a fetus being aborted for truly unreasonable reasons - arbitrary reasons such as the one example I gave. Another large concern is a political one. Namely, given the example of the UK, introducing laws restricting third trimester abortions helped resolve the abortion conflict so that early trimester abortion rights are essentially safe now in Brittain. Here, those rights are not safe - especially given the more concervative weight of the Supreme Court. Introducing laws restricting third trimester abortions to more generally acceptable exceptions could well have a similar effect to what I understand it had in the UK. Namely, it could leave early term abortion rights here safe as well. Otherwise, in trying to preserve 100% arbitrary abortion rights, you might well be supporting a policy that risks losing all abortion rights.",
