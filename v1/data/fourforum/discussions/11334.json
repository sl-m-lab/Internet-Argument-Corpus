   "Really? Here's a link where 58 of your posts and opinions can be read by all jason. So please tell us, when were you lying, now in this most recent incarnation or then when you sounded like me. http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=4958 And it really doesn't matter, because what is very obvious is that either you were lying then about your beliefs or you're lying now. Not to mention the incredible hypocrisy in your condemnation of my beliefs when you sounded just like me back then. Here's a taste of your past posts...\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=114804&postcount=29\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=115083&postcount=33\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=115089&postcount=35\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=115100&postcount=37\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=115128&postcount=39\n\n \n Of course my views were different back then! Have you not listened to anything ive said about my past struggle with me being gay? I thought that if I could somehow dedicate my life to god or something that the attraction would go away. But guess what.. It didnt!\n \n So I became more self loathing more negative and hateful. And those posts were made out of ignorance and strife. Im not denying that my views have changed drastically because I have changed drastically myself. \n \n I look at those posts and think wow was I blind and wretched or what? Point is we all change and I have never been happier or more at ease with myself.",

Unfortunately, you are going in the wrong direction. But look, you go away for months and then try to come back and rekindle old animosities. I'm past being angry with your attitudes, I've moved on to pity by now. I just plain ole feel sorry for you at this point jason, and the deception that has gripped your life.",

I'm not trying to rekindle old animosities in any way. Am I debating and maybe clashing with your ideals sure but I dont hate you or something like that. \n \n In your opinion im going in the wrong direction but I can assure you where I used to be full of negativity loathing self doubt and fear due to being a totally closeted gay, I believe its a step forward.\n \n If deception has gripped my life, If me attaining my goals with my career with my dreams and working towards them and not being afraid with who I am, if that is deception then I guess anyone can be duped.\n \n But I dont think its deception at all Archie. I know where your at in your life cause I used to be there. Afraid of accepting and afraid of change. Am I calling you weak? No not by any means. I can just understand where your coming from.",

I can just understand where your coming from.\n\n \n When you asked how to approach your parents, I was honest and up front about a truthful way to appeal to their christian and parental love for you. I would add to that that nothing about Gods love for you has changed. After all, God knew you were struggling with this issue before you realized it yourself.\n \n So this is what I will leave you with, if you will work this out with God personally as one who has accepted Jesus as your Messiah, then I will applaud your courage and your salvation. Remember jason, it is I who has always said that Jesus died for homosexuals also, and He loves you as much today as He did the day you were born. So don't believe the great lie of the gay community that you must either choose them or choose God, because long after they have abandoned you, God will still be there for you if you'll only trust Him.",

In fact I feel much more closer than I was before because now I know who I am and that god still loves me above all. \n \n The only thing that tears me is peoples pure ignorance and their misguided narrow views towards gays. I hope that one day people can see us as equals and we can all live happily in a community free from hate and fear of your fellow man.",
