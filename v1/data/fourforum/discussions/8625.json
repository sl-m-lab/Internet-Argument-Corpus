Good people caring for each other are the building blocks of society. That can take many shapes and forms and it is the intent of the people who will make it strong - not the specific construct. I used to be part of two \"traditional\" families and it they were a living hell.

   "Allow me to welcome you, too, Mrs. K.\n \n As to this fear of homosexuals these people have (at least in fora like this), I think the \"latent traits thingy\" has more to do with it than you think, and the God thingy is just a convenient justification--especially that the latter is so full of contradiction and depends to such an extent on removal from context and arbitrary verse interpretation. Not that they're all  complete closet cases--most people are at some mid-range of the continuum, and are either comfortable with it to some degree or not--but I think their rating on the Kinsey probably increases in direct proportion to the amount of time and energy they devote to posting messages on Gay Rights internet boards. I mean, if they can't tell us -- even when repeatedly asked -- what actual, real-world impact the topic has on their own lives, then it logically stands to reason that that impact is something they don't want to admit to.
