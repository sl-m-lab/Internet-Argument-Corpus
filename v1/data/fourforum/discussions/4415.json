Placing body parts in an orifice that is used for excreting bodily waste and is the end of the digestive tract..... emoticon_wow \n\n \n I might as you the same question, for the description you have provided here is as accurate for homosexual sex as it is for heterosexual sex. And in fact, not all sodomy fits your description (such as oral sex).\n \n But, in order to put it simply, if you practice that sort of sex responsibly, then it does not cause harm. Certainly it is possible to practice it unsafely, but the same is true of heterosexual sex as well. Using the right precautions, it will not cause harm.\n \n \nAnd yes, I realise that there are some heterosexual couples that practice this filthy sex..... And in my eyes they are just as wrong as homosexual males who practice this.\n\n \n Well, my question is then, why do you feel they are wrong?
