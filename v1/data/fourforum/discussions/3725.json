   "I'm getting fed up with America's ill-habbit of snooping around. Why the FUC K do they care!? There was an all-people's referendum held in Byelorussia in October, 17. That day almost 80 percent of Byelorussian population supported Lukashenko in his intention to stand as a candidate for presidency for the third time. Just think, it's almost 5.6 million people which is 11 times as much as those who were in opposition against Lukashenko's intention. Isn't it a genuine democracy? The Americans can't even dream of such unity of sentiment! So what the fuc k do they want now? Why doesn't it go with them? Why not accept Lukashenko as an estimable politician and worthy President of a free country? No, they cut the visa status of Byelorussia possibly trying to poison the whole nation's mind against Lukashenko. George Soros founded The Open Society Fund in neighboring Lithuania which secretly supports Byelorussian radical youth organization ZUBR (similar to Georgian KMARA). I think Soros suffers a kind of mania to subdue all to his will. First comes Georgia and its Velvet Revolution. It looks like the situation in Byelorussia will resolve into another revolution. As far as I know Lukashenko he won't give up that easy. There's only one way for America. That is to overthrow him by force. To be more specific, by force of the ZUBR.",
