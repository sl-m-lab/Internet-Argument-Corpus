   "Mighty self rightious of you Nurglitch thinking all others should agree with you on the topic of eliminating attitudes of selfrightiousness in our posts. And don't say you're not self rightious.\n No, self-righteousness would be asserting that I'm right and that you're all wrong. In suggesting that we should cut down on the self-righteous assertions and engage in dialogue, I assert no claim that I'm right that we should eliminate attitudes of self-righteousness. I merely argue, fallibilistically, that it might be a nice idea.

Which says more about your own attitudes than mine.\n I don't think you're being self-righteous when you're serious and sober. So long as you're willing to engage in constructive dialogue, which is what serious and sober people are willing to do, then you're not being self-righteous.\n \n \nWhat are we here for, if not to learn/expand mental horizons?\n If people are going to self-righteous and assert the truth of their position, rather than argue or explore that position, then coming here to learn about things is pretty pointless. Sure, you might learn some astonishing things about the XXXXXX that you're here with, but I don't think you'll learn anything about the subjects at issue that you couldn't by talking to yourself. \n \n On the other hand, if people are willing to discuss their positions, and co-operate to examine their reasons for holding those positions, then we all might learn something about the subjects to which these positions pertain. \n \n Peer review is a useful way of learning, if people are willing to engage in it.",
