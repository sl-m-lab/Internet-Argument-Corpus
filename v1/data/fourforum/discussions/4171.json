   " \n Unarmed, yes, running away you can still shoot them in most states as long as they are still armed, the rational being that as long as they are armed, they are dangerous.\n \n\n \n Basically, this is how it is near me.\n \n  Should a party be assailed, he may undoubtedly repel force by force, but in most instances cannot, under the pretext that he has been attacked, use force enough to kill the assailant or hurt him after he has secured himself from danger; such as if a person unarmed enters a house to commit a larceny, while there he does not threaten any one, nor does any act which manifests an intention to hurt any one\n \n  no one will be justifiable to do him any injury, much less to kill him; he ought to be secured and delivered to the public authorities. \n \n But when an attack is made by a thief under such circumstances, and it is impossible to ascertain to what extent he may push it, the law does not requirethe party assailed to weigh with great nicety the probable extent of the attack, and he may use the most violent means against his assailant, even to the taking of his life.\n \n It's basically as I said. You can only use deadly force on intruders, robbers, theives if they initiate deadly force onto you, such as shooting at you, beating you, hitting you, or running toward you swinging a giant club. You aren't justified in shooting or chasing after or hitting the perp if he backs down, is incapacitated, runs away, or leaves.\n \n You can persure, but only untill the perp gets away, according to the document. YOu are allowed to defend yourself when attacked.\n \n \n http://www.lectlaw.com/def/d030.htm\n \n \n \n What you are allowed to do in defending yourself\n \n The law generally only allows a proportional response in self defense. You must stop your counter once the immediate threat of attack has been stopped - even if you know that it's only temporary. The key word is \"immediate.\" If a guy takes a swing at you, you can block it and counter punch. If it stuns him, you must stop and back away, even if he's still snarling and yelling that you're a dead man and it's obvious he's going to take another swing at you once he figures out where you are. (Backing away might not be the smart or correct thing to do if your goal is to make sure you aren't injured or beaten, but it is nevertheless only legal action you can take. Like I said, it's a judgment call as to whether you prefer to be a law-abiding citizen or whether you want to get a broken jaw and eat your meals through a straw for the next month.) You can't follow up by kicking out his knee and elbowing him into unconsciousness. Likewise, if you duck under his punch and shove him away, that's all you are allowed to do, even if you know he'll try again. You cannot pick up a convenient shovel and try to cave his skull in.\n\n \n http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/martial_arts/110256\n \n You are allowed a little more leeway if you are attacked while at home. The key word here is \"attacked.\" If you surprise a burglar and he immediately starts running out the door, you can't shoot him, or tackle him and pound on him, or anything like that. Even if he has your stuff in his hands. You may only hurt him (or try to hurt him) if he decides to use violence against you or your family. However, while he remains on your property, you can certainly pound him until he's unconscious or he manages to get off your property. (Once he's off your property, that's it, however. You may not chase after him and tackle him to administer more chastisement, nor can you shoot him as he's running down the street.)\n \n \n You are allowed a little more leeway if you are attacked while at home.

You may not chase after him and tackle him to administer more chastisement, nor can you shoot him as he's running down the street.)\n\n \n This is primarily what the law is near me described in both.\n This is why i agree with the actions of the shopkeepers. They were shot at, therefore they can defend themselves. It never mentioned the robbers running away or dropping weapons or anything.\n \n \n Now, this does differ depending on where you are. In florida, for example, I hear this: A. Florida law justifies use of deadly force when you are:\n \n * trying to protect yourself or another person from death or serious bodily harm;\n * trying to prevent a forcible felony, such as rape, robbery, burglary or kidnapping.\n \n \n But they still have aspecial clause which states that you can only use: force for force, and if the person flee's or is running way, you can't shoot. You cannot kill or injur if the person is incapacitated. When you are in your home, the law refers to what is known as \"castle doctrine.\" You don't have to flee, whereas the law states you do in other cases.\n \n \n \n \n WRONG, though in some states, that is how rediculous things have become. This is not the old west where you have to line up in the street for a fair showdown. If they turn to walk out the door and you blow thier head off, that is a defensible action. If, on the other hand, theya re out of the building and running for the car and you blow their head off, it is less so (though in most cases probably OK, since if you can hit them, they very likely can hit you, therefore they are still a threat).\n\n \n I am not wrong if that's what the law states. WHether or not you personally deem it ridiculous is inconsequential. In some states, it is like that, therefore, it exists. \n \n businesses fall under the category of the castle doctrine. YOu don't have to run, but in several states, you only use equal force and if the perp runs away and/or is incapacitated, you stop acting. Are you denying the law and saying it doesn't exist? I don't get what you are saying.\n \n No. it's not a defensible action to blow their head off if they walk or run away. That's where you are not understanding liability and defense law.

   "It's not that they are illogical on my behalf. I am stating the law. YOu are't allowed to shoot people when they are A. Running away. B. Unaremed.\n\n Wrong. Here's an example:\n \n\n 77-year-old woman shoots intruder\n By Lexington Herald Leader staff reporter\n Publication date: October 30, 2001\n SCOTT COUNTY, KENTUCKY -- A 77-year-old woman who lives alone on Rogers Gap Road shot one of two 19-year-old men who tried to break into her home early Sunday, police said.\n Wesley Mays of Sadieville was still being treated yesterday for a wound to his abdomen at University of Kentucky Hospital, said Detective Jack Patrick of the Scott County sheriff's department.\n He will probably be charged with second-degree burglary, Patrick said.\n Thelma Vance told deputies she awoke around 1:30 a.m. to banging on her back door. She grabbed her .38-caliber gun and fired four shots, including one that struck Mays, who Vance said was trying to climb through a bedroom window.\n They fled by car before crashing into a guardrail on I-75. Deputies later caught up with them at a gas station, where Mays, wounded, collapsed to the floor, Patrick said.\n Andre Newcomb of Lexington was charged with complicity to commit burglary and is being held at the Scott County jail in lieu of a $10,000 bond.\n http://www.kc3.com/self_defense/77yo_woman_shoots_intruder.htm\n \n\n \n Many states have Home Invasion Laws that make an intruder breaking into an occupied domicile \"fair game\" whether or not they are carrying a weapon. The theory is that anyone breaking into an occupied domicile is a threat to do bodily harm (and a felon) and not just a petty burglar.\n \n\n YOu can only use equal force according to what they have.\n\n Wrong, unless you live in Joizey. See above\n \n\n ANd it's negligent to go waving guns around in the dark, in your home, with other people around. That's not illogical.\n\n Negligent? If I'm the only person in my house and an intruder comes in, I can't wave my gun? Jeez.\n \n\n Why do you think police are only allowed to use necessary force. \n\n Whole different argument. John Q. Public hasn't had hand-to-hand combat training, so S&W becomes the great equalizer.\n \n\n Like i mentioned earlier. In shops, if someone shoots at you and is facing you, you have the ability to shoot back and attack, but it ceases to be self defense if they are moving away or getting away.\n\n Not true, again. Do you seriously think that you aren't allowed to attempt to stop someone who has just taken shots at you?\n \n\n It's irresponsible to shoot at burglars when other people/customers are around. Many robbers don't plan on killing anyone when they rob. They are there to rob. Armed robbery must means they want to scare you. There's the rare occasion in which they come in to specifically harm you, but that's rare.\n \n\n o you know what they call many victims who hold your beliefs? Corpses.\n \n\n As for the home, anything that occures in the middle of the night, in the dark, is far more dangerous than what occures during the day. YOu can't really known your target when you are tired, groggy, and stumbling about in the dark.\n\n I can if I say \"Halt! Who goes there!\" and I don't hear a familiar reply. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Many states have Home Invasion Laws that make an intruder breaking into an occupied domicile \"fair game\" whether or not they are carrying a weapon. The theory is that anyone breaking into an occupied domicile is a threat to do bodily harm (and a felon) and not just a petty burglar.\n\n \n In Kansas (my home state), if somebody breaks into your home, you are more than welcome to splatter their brains all over the wall, regardless of circumstances. A few years ago there was a guy in (IIRC) Enterprise who caught a burgalar in his home. He held the guy at gunpoint, on his knees in the middle of the living room floor. As they waited for the sheriffs department to arrive (Enterprise is not big enough to have its own cop), the perp was talking to the homeowner. Nobody really knows what went on in that exchange (since the perp ended up dead and the homeowner isn't talking), but the homeowner ended up getting up, walking behind the guy, and executing him. \n \n No charges were ever filed because in Kansas, if somebody breaks into your home, you can shoot them, no questions asked and no exceptions. Whether they are armed and coming at you, or on their knees on the living room floor is of no consequence.\n \n \nNegligent? If I'm the only person in my house and an intruder comes in, I can't wave my gun? Jeez.\n\n \n You should never wave your gun around. Once you identify the fact that there is an intruder in the house, you should hunt them down, take a tactical stance, say something, (to ensure it is not somebody you know) then blast away. You should not empty your mag, though. There might be another one. \n \n \nNot true, again. Do you seriously think that you aren't allowed to attempt to stop someone who has just taken shots at you?\n\n \n Of course you can. The fact that they are walking away does not mean you can't fire at them. The safe thing to do is assume that they are moving to a better firing position, or that they are headed to the car for a bigger gun to kill you with, and blow them away. \n \n This is like the whole \"like force\" argument. It doesn't mean that they have to have a gun for you to use yours, or that if they have a knife you can only use a knife. If you feel that they intent to kill you, or inflict greivous bodily harm, you can do the same to them. If some XXXXX prosecutor somewhere gets a hard on over the incident and decides to take to to tsk over it, they are stuck trying to prove that you did not feel you were in danger. \n \n Sombody who has just threatened you with a gun and is still in the area (still in range) certianly constitutes a clear and present danger. \n \n \nShould a party be assailed, he may undoubtedly repel force by force, but in most instances cannot, under the pretext that he has been attacked, use force enough to kill the assailant or hurt him after he has secured himself from danger; such as if a person unarmed enters a house to commit a larceny, while there he does not threaten any one, nor does any act which manifests an intention to hurt any one\n \n no one will be justifiable to do him any injury, much less to kill him; he ought to be secured and delivered to the public authorities. \n \n But when an attack is made by a thief under such circumstances, and it is impossible to ascertain to what extent he may push it, the law does not requirethe party assailed to weigh with great nicety the probable extent of the attack, and he may use the most violent means against his assailant, even to the taking of his life.\n\n \n This is from Blackstone (though the site you linked to plajorised it and failed to preperly cite). Not the part about master/servant relationships:\n \n \nThe party attacked may undoubtedly defend himself, and the law further sanctions the mutual and reciprocal defence of such as stand in the near relations of hushand and wife, patent and child, and master and servant. In these cases, if the party himself or any of these his relations, be forcibly attacked in their person or property, it is lawful for him to repel force by force, for the law in these cases respects the passions of the human mind, and makes it lawful in him, when external violence is offered to himself, or to those to whom he bears so near a connexion, to do that immediate justice to which he is prompted by nature, and which no prudential motives are strong enough to restrain.\n\n \n I seriously doubt your state has enacted laws directly out of blackstone.\n \n Your second article is fluff. It is by a guy who is a freelance writer. An economics writere no less, and a martial artist. \n \n New Jersy has the most stringent laws in the country regarding self defense \n Here is the law in New Jersey regarding defending your home:\n \n \nDefense of Real Property (Your Home) and Criminal Liability\n \n A section of our criminal law provides that:\n \n \"the use of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable when the actor is in possession or control of premises or is licensed or privileged to be thereon and he reasonably believes such force necessary to prevent or terminate what he reasonably believes to be the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass by such other person in or upon such premises.\"\n \n A person commits a criminal trespass if, knowing that (he/she) is not licensed or privileged to do so, (he/she) enters or surreptitiously remains in any structure or separately secured or occupied portion thereof.\n \n Our criminal law further provides that, in defense of your home:\n \n \"the use of force is justifiable...only if the actor first requests the person against whom such force is used to desist from his interference with the property, unless the actor reasonably believes that (a) such request would be useless; (b) it would be dangerous to himself or another person to make the request or (c) substantial harm will be done to the physical condition of the property which is sought to be protected before the request can effectively be made.\"\n \n \"The use of deadly force is not justifiable in the defense of premises unless the actor reasonably believes that:\n \n (a) The person against whom the force is used is attempting to dispossess him of his dwelling otherwise than under a claim of right to its possession; or\n \n (b) The person against whom the force is used is attempting to commit or consummate arson, burglary, robbery or other criminal theft or property destruction; except that\n \n (c) Deadly force does not become justifiable under subsections (a) and (b) unless\n \n (i) The person against whom it is employed has employed or threatened deadly force against or in the presence of the actor; or\n \n (ii) The use of force other than deadly force to prevent the commission or the consummation of the crime would expose the actor or another in his presence to substantial danger of serious bodily harm.\"\n\n \n So, even in New Jersey, you can shoot a burglar, even without saying anything (since alerting to them of your presence before you blow their head off could certainlybe dangerous) and you are not first required to attempt other means (sinc to do so could also be dangerous).\n \n \n When you talk abotu a duty to run away or escape, this is what you are talking about<b></b>:\n \n \nDeadly Force and Civil Duty to Retreat\n \n A deadly force is not justifiable when an opportunity to retreat with complete safety is known by the defender to be at hand. The use of such force is not justifiable if the defender knew that it could have been avoided with complete safety to himself by retreating. Where these conditions are present, the defender has a duty to retreat, and his use of a deadly force under these circumstances cannot be justified as an act of self defense.\n\n \n Note \"with complete safety\". That does not mean that you have to escape the first cahnce you get. That means that if you can retreat with COMPLETE SAFETY, you are legally bound to do it. If it is even concievable that by retreating you could be injured or killed, you are not bound to do so. \n \n Here is New Jerseys \"like force\" requirements:\n \n \nDeadly Force and Criminal Prosecution\n \n The use of deadly force may be justified only to defend against force or the threat of force of nearly equally severity and is not justifiable unless the defendant reasonably believes that such force is necessary to protect (himself/herself) against death or serious bodily harm. By serious bodily harm, we mean an injury that creates substantial risk of death or which causes serious permanent disfigurement or which causes a protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\n \n One cannot respond with deadly force to a threat of or even an actual minor attack. For example, a slap or an imminent threat of being pushed in a crowd would not ordinarily justify the use of deadly force to defend against such unlawful conduct.\n \n In addition, one can under limited instances use force in the protection of others (NJSA 2C:35-5). Limited force under certain instances is also afforded in the criminal code for the defense of personal property (NJSA 2C:3-6C).\n\n \n What makes NJ different from most other states is that an \"imminent attack\" is not covered here, where as most states, you do not actually have to wait for somebody to start beating you like a rented mule before you defend yourself.\n \n This came from http://www.njlaws.com/self-defense.htm The web page belongs to a law office. The pertinent criminal code is offered in its entirety at the bottom of the page.\n \n See, that is what is called a \"credible source\". It is not some freelance writer hack who has taken it upon himself to misinform the public.",

   "Basically, this is how it is near me.\n \n  Should a party be assailed, he may undoubtedly repel force by force, but in most instances cannot, under the pretext that he has been attacked, use force enough to kill the assailant or hurt him after he has secured himself from danger; such as if a person unarmed enters a house to commit a larceny, while there he does not threaten any one, nor does any act which manifests an intention to hurt any one\n \n  no one will be justifiable to do him any injury, much less to kill him; he ought to be secured and delivered to the public authorities. \n \n But when an attack is made by a thief under such circumstances, and it is impossible to ascertain to what extent he may push it, the law does not requirethe party assailed to weigh with great nicety the probable extent of the attack, and he may use the most violent means against his assailant, even to the taking of his life.\n \n It's basically as I said. You can only use deadly force on intruders, robbers, theives if they initiate deadly force onto you, such as shooting at you, beating you, hitting you, or running toward you swinging a giant club. You aren't justified in shooting or chasing after or hitting the perp if he backs down, is incapacitated, runs away, or leaves.\n \n You can persure, but only untill the perp gets away, according to the document. YOu are allowed to defend yourself when attacked.\n \n \n http://www.lectlaw.com/def/d030.htm\n \n \n \n \n http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/martial_arts/110256\n \n You are allowed a little more leeway if you are attacked while at home. The key word here is \"attacked.\" If you surprise a burglar and he immediately starts running out the door, you can't shoot him, or tackle him and pound on him, or anything like that. Even if he has your stuff in his hands. You may only hurt him (or try to hurt him) if he decides to use violence against you or your family. However, while he remains on your property, you can certainly pound him until he's unconscious or he manages to get off your property. (Once he's off your property, that's it, however. You may not chase after him and tackle him to administer more chastisement, nor can you shoot him as he's running down the street.)\n \n \n \n This is primarily what the law is near me described in both.\n This is why i agree with the actions of the shopkeepers. They were shot at, therefore they can defend themselves. It never mentioned the robbers running away or dropping weapons or anything.\n \n \n Now, this does differ depending on where you are. In florida, for example, I hear this: A. Florida law justifies use of deadly force when you are:\n \n * trying to protect yourself or another person from death or serious bodily harm;\n * trying to prevent a forcible felony, such as rape, robbery, burglary or kidnapping.\n \n \n But they still have aspecial clause which states that you can only use: force for force, and if the person flee's or is running way, you can't shoot. You cannot kill or injur if the person is incapacitated. When you are in your home, the law refers to what is known as \"castle doctrine.\" You don't have to flee, whereas the law states you do in other cases.\n \n \n \n \n I am not wrong if that's what the law states. WHether or not you personally deem it ridiculous is inconsequential. In some states, it is like that, therefore, it exists. \n \n businesses fall under the category of the castle doctrine. YOu don't have to run, but in several states, you only use equal force and if the perp runs away and/or is incapacitated, you stop acting. Are you denying the law and saying it doesn't exist? I don't get what you are saying.\n \n No. it's not a defensible action to blow their head off if they walk or run away. That's where you are not understanding liability and defense law. Look above.\n\n \n Regarding home invasion, for burglary or any other intent, in most Western and SW US states other than California I'm familiar with the legal issue isn't type or amount of force involved, be it fists, knifes or guns, but the fear of one's life and/or family being in danger and employing what ever means necessary to protect that/those lives as intent. Equal force is not even a legal consideration. 911 calls, all recorded, are also important in proving intent. After disposing of the intruder, the caller should simply state that his home has been invaded, he/she has shot the intruder and an ambulance and the police are required. The ambulance will not approach the scene until police have secured it, but requesting it is important in establishing intent. You had no intent of harming anyone, but did so out of fear for your life. \n \n Outside my home in my home state, I'm allowed to use my concealed weapon for primarily the same purposes. If I feel my life or that of my spouse is endangered, I'm allowed to use whatever force is required to save our lives. Force to force is not a factor. If an assailant physically attacks or makes an effort to attack either one of us by whatever means, I'm allowed to protect myself by whatever means I have at my disposal. We have few aggravated assaults or home invasions in our state, primarily due to law enforcement supporting concealed weapon permits for private citizens.\n \n Anyone who has ever talked with law enforcement officers/officials or prosecution lawyers on an informal basis in states that reserve the right for private citizens to protect themselves can tell comforting stories. If intent to protect yourself from a home invader is present, and few investigating police officers consider a stranger in your house anything but a direct threat in these days of plentiful meth, you'd be a fool to wound them and then possibly be the victim of defending yourself against an expensive federal civil lawsuit using equality to breed even more mediocrity. Public service has many facets. \n \n Living in US cities and/or states with legislation allowing only criminals to be armed and employing government equality social engineering to protect them is obviously a different situation. I pity those who live under such conditions and wonder what they think when viewing their senior elected officials, who are always protected by armed guards.",

A guy with a knife, probably couldn't claim justification if you drill him at 100 yards. A guy with a gun, sure, since a gun is just as deadly at 100 yards as it is at 1. If he is in your range, it is logical to assume that you are in his, and therefore he is still a threat. \n \n If you were to persue the guy several block and then finally plug him in the back, you would likely have trouble.\n \n As I asid before, New Jersey has the harshest self defense laws in the nation. Most states have a lineof sight provision. If you can still see the guy, he is fair game.\n \n \nAs for the second part, however, it really is irrelevant who he is. It's the information presented that's the problem. Attacking the source is a fallacy of origin; it has no relevance. But you are right anyway with the former part.\n\n \n No, it is not irrelevant as to who it is. If the guy was the attorney general of New york, his opinion would stillcarry weight, despite the fact that it is presented on what is essentialyl a blog page. The fact that he is not, he is just some guy commenting entirely outside his field is certainly relevant. \n \n Of course, the fact that he starts out with the IANAL do don't take my advice disclaimers houdl have been a pretty major red flag.\n \n \n \nIsn't this part of the somewhat silly for the defender if the person is armed? WHy would someone ever legitimatly call out for the person to stop invading the home etc? I doubt that will ever work, since the person is there for a reason in the first place. \n \n \n That is not the intention of the law. Withou that section, this portion would essentially legalise shooting trespassers without warning. While I can certianly agree that sniping trespassers has a certian appeal, we should probably not codify such acts.\n \n \n \n \nNow, the criminal, even if you are successful in self-defense case, can try to sue you. Isn't that a waste of time? I think that's an abuse of the system. What about you?\n\n \n Certinaly. I think that kind of thing is what George was referring to when he said our legal system has not been runnign on all cylinders for a long time. It is like the whole OJ mess. Guilty or innocent, he was found not guilty. That should have been the end of story,.\n \n \n \nHow do they work around this? What do they consider threaten? Employment is obvious.\n\n \n I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.",

   "Not the model way to do things, bu that is how it is here. We ahve a law that specifically protect homeowners when somebody breaks into their home. Regardless of circumstance, you are justified in using deadly force against a burglar. \n \n In retrospect, it might have made sens to make the law a little more restrictive. But, they didn't, nor does anybody seem inclined to go to the trouble of changing it as the result of a single criminal being killed\n \n\n \n Few acomplished burglars are apprentices. Their skill levels are seemingly honed as juveniles through peer association, natural instincts, illegal drug requirements and/or incarceration. Redeeming social qualities? If that question was directed to a victim, that victim would have to be very naive and extremely idealistic to champion the civil rights of a burglar. \n \n To question the motivation behind a resident killing an intruder is an obvious false dependency on official protection from such occurances based on equality issues, which should have no bearing in life threatening circumstances. Any cop can tell you the chances of a patrol seeing a burglary take place are slim to none. If a person makes the determination to enter a private residence without invitation, he or she should understand his or her death could well be the outcome of that decision. All the counseling, education and legislation in the universe does not make that intrusion correct, partially correct or provide any grounds other than immediate personal opinion for mercy.",

   "All you need is a good snub-nosed revolver, a few lessons and a little practice. You'd do well.\n\n \n Nah - it would just give the hoodlums in my neighborhood something else to want to steal - right after I shot myself in the foot.",
