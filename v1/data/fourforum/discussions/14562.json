   "There are moments throughout time where evolution pushes forward and different species are capable of evolving at a faster rate than usual. However, this accelerated rate of change takes anywhere from 10,000 years to a million years to occur. With the acceleration of technology in the past 50 years it may become impossible for human evolution to keep up with the pace of technology. What do we do when evolution can't keep up with the rate of change in technology that humans are now forced to confront? \n \n Could global warming and environmental catastrophes be an example of how our technology is improving faster than we can see the biological impact on our planet Earth?\n \n I remember seeing a discussion like this on evolution and technology on a Facebook community page The Watchman&#039;s Rattle | Facebook\n \n Here's a link to the actual video on evolution.\n Videos Posted by The Watchman&#039;s Rattle: Rebecca Costa - The Rate of Evolutionary Change | Facebook",
