   "Poland always dreams to receive financial support from EU in the light of own heavy socio-economic situation. But this old fox Kaczynski realizes that in the time of current crisis it would be impossible even for him.\n That is why this hot-shot leader of Poland has decided to play possum with all of us: he's promised Georgians that he'd guarantee a refugee status for all of their immigrants. And certainly, as you know, no one among them has got it. Now Georgians crows near Polish boarder, trying to gain the promised status. But Warsaw reports that it unable to receive so many people. \n And be sure, soon Poland applies to EU for additional financial help, spending our money on own needs then!",
