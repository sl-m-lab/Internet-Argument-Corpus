   "I know a lot people here have argued that we need to fight them on their \"own ground and crush them.\" Most of this is in reference to basically, using violence to solve the issue (of terrorism that is). I disagree with this notion. Why? Violence does nothing to achieve a thing in these kinds of situations. All it does is it make it worse. We could make them docile and comply, like a child who was beaten flinches at the slightest quick movement of a hand, and when that child grows up, who will he take his anger and emotions out on? I'm not going to say \"let's all hold hands and love each other\" because I know that isn't something that is quite possible either and neither am I saying to not defend yourself, on the contrary we should. What I am saying is violence perpetrates violence when it is not warranted. We should not use torture, we should not indiscriminately bomb, kill, people if we do not know for sure that they are terrorists or not. Just because they act like animals doesn't mean we should as well. We should not support laws that place government power above our civil liberties, we should not support nations that violate civil liberties of people because it undermines our own principles. \n \n So what the heck do we do then? I say attack the message, not the messenger. The only way we are going to stop terrorism from spreading is by destroying the very cause they stand for, not physically, but philosophically. If we can do that, terrorism would not be appealing to anyone. Added with the above suggestions in the 1st paragraph, terrorism will defeat itself. How can they have a \"cause\" if we do not support those that gave them that cause in the first place? Also, let's stand by our principles and as well try to do this the right way. It will save not only American lives, but those that would otherwise fall prey to the infectious disease of terrorism. I know this isn't an easy task, but nothing is easy in life.",

We most certainly do, BUT we have not gone about this the right way. Tactics do not win wars, strategy does, and as far I know from the information provided to us, we had no clear strategy when we went into Iraq and Afghanistan. We have to take into consideration collateral damage, our intel and legitimacy if are to start or initiate in a campaign. Think about this. Why is it that the FBI has not listed OBL as being responsible for the 9/11 attacks? You know what they said? They said they did not have sufficient evidence to indict him. Why the heck was president Bush saying he was our target when we don't even enough evidence to even indict him in a court of law! That's just ludicrous! First, we need to establish who is really responsible. Target them and ONLY them. There is no need for us to take in part of other countries problems. Reduce collateral damage, we have not done that; 600,000+ dead vs 3,000 dead in the WTT, there is no excuse for that. All we are doing is creating more terrorists that way. Don't believe me? Search CNN, Foxnews, etc all of them say terrorist activity has gone up since 9/11. You cannot fight terrorism with conventional war tactics and strategy. There has to be another way devised in order to deal with them. We should not use torture, that's exactly what the terrorists want. It gives them a big and viable reason for their cause. All they do is say \"see the Americans torture our people, they are not so democratic as they say they are!\" That is the biggest blunder the Bush Administration made and we, as well as the rest of the world, are paying for it.",
