   "What gives you faith in god? If you had never read the bible, heard his name spoken, or knew how to pray, what made you believe in god?\n \n Good question. Faith is not automatic, it is a process. Not only in reguards to God, but anything in life. Obviously if a person has never heard of God, then the idea does not exist (assuming this hypothetical person hasnt pondered of a higher power), muchless have faith in God. But faith comes about when concrete facts are presented in a theory ( evolution, creation), and there are missing pieces to the theory. An example of this would be how the universe came into existance. Neither evolution or creation can provide concrete evidence for the begining of the universe. Both theories attempt to explain it. And with the concrete evidence they have, both camps have faith that their explanation is the correct one.\n \n This probably isnt the answer you were looking for, but that is how I explain my faith.",

Now when i say proof, i mean physical undisputed proof, proven evidence etc.\n\n I do not necessarily agree. Because something has been proven, it still does not mean that they automatically believe it. For example, I would say that we have enough proof that the world is round. However, there are still some today, both atheists and theists, who deny this on the grounds that they haven't actually seen it. If you want, another example. In the \"My Signature Debate\" thread, I think it's really quite clear that both I and Epharas Faith proved that there are absolutes. However, it's still being rejected, regardless of the proof.\n \n If something is proven, it does not mean that one automatically believes it. Secondly, the burden of proof, again, is on your shoulders to prove that a born atheist would accept theism if he was granted proof.\n \nOn the other hand, lets assume a second person does believe in god.\n \n If this person is brought up to believe in god, and is asked to provide proof that god exists, he cant, he cannot provide any evidence whatsoever, but even with the lack of any evidence, this person still bel[ie]ves in god.\n\n With all due respect, that is complete speculation. You've repeated this quite some times and haven't given any sufficient grounding for it.\n \n Secondly, I think it's absurd to demand that one must prove something in order to properly believe it. Can you prove to me that you are not deceived by your senses? That matter exists? That you exist? If not, then why do you believe it?\n \n Your second objection is that \"he cannot provide any evidence whatsoever\", which is even more absurd if I might say. No-one believes or does anything for no reason. To say that they have no evidence is, again, false. I can go over this if you like, but really- everything is evidence. Even my opinion might be evidence for one believing something even thought it's not too convincing.\n \n I have plenty of evidence for the existence of God. But, I'm also quite sure that such evidence would not satisfy the atheist.\n \nNow you say i have to provide proof to support my statement, the fact that people believe in god without any evidence that a god exists proves my statement. \n\n No-one believes that God exists without evidence or a reason. The Bible itself is evidence for the existence of God, regardless of whether the atheist finds it convincing.\n \nhow am i making a steroetype?\n\n You are stereotyping and invoking your prejudices because you have wrongly presumed that all theists have no evidence for the existence of God. The statement is still on your shoulders to prove so, which, I might say, is an impossibility.\n \nThe onus is on you to provide evidence, my statement simply states that a religious person believes without evidence or proof, now if a person is inclined to to believe without any evidence or proof then that person is unlikely to to listen to any reason, thats why he believes in something without any proof or evidence.\n\n You have repeated the same point in your post three times. I might remind you of ad nauseam - things are not correct because they are being repeated. The fallacy of repetition.\n (i) They do have evidence.\n (ii) I think that I can prove the existence of God within reason via the Hartshorne's modal argument, particularly for anyone accepting the axiom, \"it is possible for God to exist\".\n (iii) You have presented no proof or evidence for the non-existence of God, so therefore, your argument falls on yourself.",

They don't even bother to give a disclaimer: \"evolution only works in type 'X' universes\". If you believe in God then you don't believe you are in a type X universe for God grants free will or choice. Science will have to prove that there is no choice and thus no God.

   "I do not necessarily agree. Because something has been proven, it still does not mean that they automatically believe it. For example, I would say that we have enough proof that the world is round. However, there are still some today, both atheists and theists, who deny this on the grounds that they haven't actually seen it. If you want, another example. In the \"My Signature Debate\" thread, I think it's really quite clear that both I and Epharas Faith proved that there are absolutes. However, it's still being rejected, regardless of the proof.\n \n If something is proven, it does not mean that one automatically believes it. Secondly, the burden of proof, again, is on your shoulders to prove that a born atheist would accept theism if he was granted proof.\n \n With all due respect, that is complete speculation. You've repeated this quite some times and haven't given any sufficient grounding for it.\n \n Secondly, I think it's absurd to demand that one must prove something in order to properly believe it. Can you prove to me that you are not deceived by your senses? That matter exists? That you exist? If not, then why do you believe it?\n \n Your second objection is that \"he cannot provide any evidence whatsoever\", which is even more absurd if I might say. No-one believes or does anything for no reason. To say that they have no evidence is, again, false. I can go over this if you like, but really- everything is evidence. Even my opinion might be evidence for one believing something even thought it's not too convincing.\n \n I have plenty of evidence for the existence of God. But, I'm also quite sure that such evidence would not satisfy the atheist.\n \n No-one believes that God exists without evidence or a reason. The Bible itself is evidence for the existence of God, regardless of whether the atheist finds it convincing.\n \n You are stereotyping and invoking your prejudices because you have wrongly presumed that all theists have no evidence for the existence of God. The statement is still on your shoulders to prove so, which, I might say, is an impossibility.\n \n You have repeated the same point in your post three times. I might remind you of ad nauseam - things are not correct because they are being repeated. The fallacy of repetition.\n (i) They do have evidence.\n (ii) I think that I can prove the existence of God within reason via the Hartshorne&#8217;s modal argument, particularly for anyone accepting the axiom, \"it is possible for God to exist\".\n (iii) You have presented no proof or evidence for the non-existence of God, so therefore, your argument falls on yourself.\n\n \n Interesting points, i understand what your saying.\n \n I think youve gone too deeply into the point i was trying to make to draconis.\n \n Let me give you an example, the story of noah, if only 8 people survived, how could they repopulate the earth? and what race were they?\n \n Now to me, the whole story is fiction, firstly there is no evidence of a great flood, and nobody can answer the questions i posed without resorting to religious doctrine. Now if somebody is prepared to firmly believe in such a story based on the writings and teachings of somebody totally uknown to them, then to me theres a form of brainwashing involved.\n \n If i insist the world is flat and not round you will ask me to provide you with evidence, if i say, i was told it was flat and read it in a book, and thats my only evidence, you will doubt me wouldnt you? you will doubt me even further if i refuse to accept scientific facts that prove the world is round.\n \n My point is if you provide someone with facts scientific facts and evidence, and they still dispute them, then theres nothing else you can do that would persuade such a person to change there views, such is the case with religious people.\n \n Now im going to make an assumption, that your a religious person and you believe in god, What would it take to change your views on god?",

   "Dear Plotter,\n \n You claim to have understood my points, and yet - you pursue the same points without giving them any rational grounding. I first commented on your point to Draconis, but later, I addressed the points you made towards me. Let's go through this:\n \n You have to firstly recognise that there are different types of Christians just as there are different atheists and agnostics. An efficient way that these are divided is: (i) Fundamentalists, (ii) Conservatives and (iii) Liberals. Fundamentalists take the word of the Bible literally. There is no big Christian denomination, (to my knowledge) who claims to be fundamentalist. There are but a few in different Christian denominations and they certainly make up the minority. Conservatives acknowledge that the Bible is often in metaphors, and that that is the way that God communicates often throughout the Bible. That is also why Jesus taught in parables and stories. The third, liberals, are obviously - liberal. They often vary - some acknowledge the Bible as metaphorical (generally), and some do not abide by it particularly. That is - they use all types of sources to gain their belief on God. All three, by definition, acknowledge that Jesus is God Incarnate. What unites them, really, is the Nicene Creed. There's one word difference in the Catholic and the Orthodox creed but there really is no difference.\n \n The Catholic Church (which is the largest denomination) is, to my understanding, conservative. They can accept that evolution could occur, but do not give a definite stance on it. The Church of England and the like are more liberal. The Orthodox Church, again, I would say are conservative.\n \n Now, to your post:\n \n Let me give you an example, the story of [N]oah, if only 8 people survived, how could they repopulate the earth? and what race were they?\n\n The Christian story of Noah and the ark says that there was Noah and his wife, three of his sons, and their three wives. The Biblical story says that the three sons were of different races - and that the different races sprung from them. Your question, \"how could they repopulate the earth?\" I fail to understand properly. Do you have some evidence to show why the couldn't possibly have re-populated the earth? \n \n Now to me, the whole story is fiction, firstly there is no evidence of a great flood, and nobody can answer the questions i posed without resorting to religious doctrine.\n\n I think that you will have to remember that you are by no means attacking the whole of Christianity with this comment. The Conservatives and Liberals are entitled to think of the story as metaphorical. You are referring but to a small minority - fundamentalists. Nevertheless, who said that they have no evidence? It may not be completely correct, but it's still evidence:\n http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/HydroplateOverview7.html\n http://www.custance.org/Library/Volume9/index.html\n \n Also, the fact that a \"great flood\" appears in so many other cultures (i.e. Hinduism etc.) also provides further evidence of such an event.\n \n Now if somebody is prepared to firmly believe in such a story based on the writings and teachings of somebody totally uknown to them, then to me theres a form of brainwashing involved.\n\n That's a bit equivocal. Because someone believes something without proof or significant evidence, this does not mean that they are automatically brainwashed. I am quite sure that you can provide no proof for the non-existence of God. Does this mean that you are in the same position as those who accept things on faith? Logic is a fine thing, and so is Science. Science will take me as far as it can, but faith takes me further. Plus, some people have made their decision without the influence of others. Are they brainwashing themselves?\n \n If i insist the world is flat and not round you will ask me to provide you with evidence, if i say, i was told it was flat and read it in a book, and thats my only evidence, you will doubt me wouldnt you? you will doubt me even further if i refuse to accept scientific facts that prove the world is round.\n\n Whether I doubt it or not is really quite irrelevant. You have still provided evidence to some degree. Of course, it's terribly unconvincing to me, and it's also unconvincing to the atheist when the theist uses the Bible as evidence. And yet, you cannot deny that it is evidence. It is, by definition.\n \n My point is if you provide someone with facts scientific facts and evidence, and they still dispute them, then theres nothing else you can do that would persuade such a person to change there views, such is the case with religious people.\n\n You are once again stereotyping. You have grouped all religious people into one group and you proclaim that since they believe things without scientific proof, that they are mislead. The same applies for you, let's not forget. Plus, it is also not the case that because someone holds a position that is contrapositive to yours, that it is wrong or stupid. I truly believe that two very intelligent people can hold opposing views.\n \n I assure you, I am a rational man. I would very much like to see your scientific evidence that might dispute my religious beliefs.\n \n Now im going to make an assumption, that your a religious person and you believe in god\n\n Indeed, I believe in an almighty Supreme Being, and that we might know of such a being through Jesus Christ.\n \n What would it take to change your views on god?\n\n Do you want to change my views on God? The theist can have a reason (they want them to go to Heaven) but what might an atheists reason be? I shall answer you this question, and I hope that you will answer mine. For me to change my views on God, the world would have had to have been a place of chaos - not as if it had God's stamp on it. I would say that there are many ways, and I could mention very many different wacky situations. \n \n Now, for you. What evidence would you need to change your belief on God? If I were to present an entirely logical argument (with no logical fallacies) showing the existence of God, I am quite sure that you would still not change your position, but that is the nature of the human. And I wouldn't blame you for such a position. But, if this is so, you should sympathize with the theist rather than demanding that they provide \"scientific\" evidence for their beliefs. Particularly, if you have none to show for yourself. I should also remind that the position that things the belief that \"we should only believe things that can be verified empirically\" self-destructs itself.\n \n Good day to you sir,\n dreamweaver.",

   "What choice? Explain.\n\n \n \n Is choice independent of the environment? The foundation of evolution requires the universe to work in a certain fashion orderly yet random fashion divorced from choice effecting the gene pool. The mutation that survives or occurs CANNOT be predetermined. It can't be brought forth by another's will. Also interactions within the environment can erode at evolution. If a predator has to choose on what prey it eats given equal opportunity it has effected the gene pool of its prey by its own will. This is not natural selection.\n \n BTW \"inbreeding\" does not hurt in the classical sense. It is no different than the problems of cloning. When a gene pool homogenizes odd things happen. The genes amplify each other until it starts to becomes a problem. I was reading someplace that humans have more genetic diseases than other wild animals this could be contributed to inbreeding and not the fact that we care for the infirmed.\n \n Also even evolutionist (now days) agree that humans are all the same species. So there will be incest either way, and you still have a \"problem\" of race. Now that we understand genetics we see race is a cosmetic illusion. I wish I had the study, but they found that you share more genes with people outside your race than with the small population of individuals you claim to be your race. Most racial characteristics are more dependent on geography, nutrition, and culture, than heredity.\n \n Africans and Indians have the same skin color. Africans and Asians the same eyes. Indians and Europeans the same hair. And when races mix all bets are off. Look at African Americans we look like every thing. Some families barely look related and others like clones. And we have been here over 200 years and the gene pool has not reached equilibrium.",

   "Im sorry i will not retract my statement as i still believe it to be true.\n\n Your original statement is so obviously drenched in prejudice that I really cannot see the problem. You have presupposed that all religious people will never change their mind. You have provided no grounding for such a sort of thing, and you have attacked fundamentalists with your story of Noah and the Ark - a very small percentage of Christians. Do you think that there have never been religious persons who have changed their mind and become atheists? If so, then that proves your statement wrong already. \"Deeply religious persons\" have become atheists, and have \"changed their mind\" - so your statement is wrong via empiricism.\n \nYou are effectively asking me to provide you with evidence that god doesnt exist, you are putting the onus on me to prove what you believe.\n\n You are very right, but notice that this is not the shifting the burden of proof fallacy. I am not claiming that God exists because you cannot prove otherwise. I have made no secret of claiming that I believe that God exists via faith. But also, this faith is backed up by logic which I can demonstrate if you want. Since I have made the statement that I can accept it on faith - I need not prove it to you. However, if you are not to claim that your beliefs are based on faith, according to your own methods, you are going to have to provide some convincing evidence to hold up your position. \n \nIts you that has to prove your views are true, im questioning your beliefs by stating theres no evidence that a god exists, i also question the bible of which most christians base there beliefs on, and i picked on one story to prove my point.\n\n Actually, our sub-debate began through your claim - you are defending it. \n \n The story of noah is a story a myth, nothing in it can be real\n\n A statement on its own, as you have made (x is true) is terribly weak in debate. You want to explain why you think so and possibly provide evidence. A statement that takes the form X because of Y is far more acceptable. \n \n i stated that its impossible for him to have 3 children of different races, unless he wasnt the real father. \n\n You have made many, many statements but you have not backed them up. That makes them useless. \n \nI also stated that 3 couples could not repopulate the earth, it is physically impossible, and you respond with comments based on fantasy and mutations. You even question factual research regarding inbreeding. \n\n Wrong, and really - that's a classical strawman fallacy. I asked you a question regarding inbreeding - and you did not answer it. Again, the fundamentalist can quite easily claim that God created more people for them to breed with. \n \nThe fact that you believe such a story and try to explain it using myth and conjecture, and totally ignore reason and common sense proves my point that there is nothing i can say or do that will make a you, a \"religious type\" change your views, im afraid its a sort of brainwashing.\n\n That's wrong again. I would request, that if you could, highlight the specific part where I stated that I believed in the story as it is literally presented in the Bible. You are in no position to conclude that I have been brainwashed; you are not aware of my life circumstances or the people that I am around with. The decisions that I have made regarding religion I have founded from both logic and through God's love. Not because someone \"convinced me so\". \n \nYou say i have ignored your questions, how can i answer something which has no basis\n\n That is quite clearly evading the point. I asked you questions that had all logical basis. Had they not had one, or if you were misunderstood on what I was requesting - you should have rather asked, instead of ignoring the question. A debate is not a monologue - it is a discussion. It might be a lot easier if you go back and take a crack at answering them.\n \nhow do i know a god doesnt exist, apart from the onus being on you to prove a god does exist, you are attempting to avoid answering a question you quite obviously cannot answer.\n\n I am not shifting the onus per se. I answered your question regarding evidence and proof for the existence of God. I applied your same logic onto you, and you avoid answering the question. That is, because your position self-destructs itself. You fail to abide by your own standards - it's almost paradoxical. \n \nHaving faith and hope in something and believing in something are two totally different things, i have faith that one day i will win the lottery but i dont believe that in reality i will ever win it, the chances and the mathematics are against that, so i dont believe that i will win the lottery.\n\n Not really. You have faith that it is possible to win, but you also believe that you will not win by reviewing the statistics and probability of such a process. \n \nif you say you have faith and hope a god exists, thats different from beleiving that a god exists.\n\n In this context, it really isn't. They can be taken as the same meaning. \n \nYour above statement is really beyond belief, if you were a juror would you belive a defendant or a prosecutor simply because they said so, if a prosecutor said \"he did it, the defendant commit[t]ed the crime because i said he did\" would you believe him or would you ask to see undisputed evidence? You would ask to see evidence before you be[lie]ve he's innocent or guilt, wouldn[']t you? So evidence is everything. \n\n You still have failed to distinguish between convincing evidence and evidence. I truly have no clue on where you attained your conclusions here. I said that I would not believe because your simple opinion is not evidence enough, to which you reply, \"if you were a juror would you be[lie]ve a defendant or a prosecutor simply because they said so\". You're furthering on the exact same point that I made. \n \n Jurors actually rarely ask for \"undisputable evidence\" - they ask for sufficient evidence. \n \n The only reason you discard evidence in debates such as these is because there is no evidence to prove your beliefs, so its easier for you to answer such questions with statements like \"evidence is almost anything. Strong, convinving evidence isn't everything.\" Statements like that are simply avoiding the issue.\n\n Wrong. Copy and paste from a previous post:\n \n How are you defining \"evidence\"? Dictionary.com gives three definitions, I think that the first one is approrpiate and the most used:\n \n ev\u0095i\u0095dence ( P ) Pronunciation Key (v-dns)\n n. \n A thing or things helpful in forming a conclusion or judgment: The broken window was evidence that a burglary had taken place. Scientists weigh the evidence for and against a hypothesis. \n \n By that, I might well say that near enough anything might be evidence. Whether it is strong evidence or not is a whole other issue. Although it is a logical fallacy to appeal to authority, there is nothing wrong with saying that there is evidence for the existence of God because I believe it. It sounds absurd, but it's true. Anyways, I clearly wasn't referring to that.\n \n I can say that the Bible is evidence for the existence of God, and indeed - it is. However, just most atheists don't accept it as so. However unreliable it might be considered, it's logically erroneous to say that \"there is no evidence\". What would be valid is \"I think that there is no evidence\" - and it's only valid because it's a subjective claim. Which, won't get you far....\n \n I really don't think we need to go deeply into this. I should think it to be true by definition. There are only three ways we can know things: authority, inference and experience. I'm not saying that I'm necessarily in a substantial position of authority, but it really doesn't matter. Authority is evidence for something because someone else says it is true. Even though this has been thoroughly discredited and even been given a fancy latin name, which suggests you can't rely on authority. Still, it is one of the ways that we know things.\n \n Let's take a quick example. If 5 different friends that you have, come up to you, and tell you that they think that John is stupid, that is evidence for the case that John is stupid - however useless it might be.\n \n Interesting you would only think about it, that would be undisputed evidence that god didnt create you, somebody else did, but that still wouldnt convince you, why? Brainwashing maybe, maybe you are too scared to believe otherwise.\n \n If you dont mind me asking would i be far from the truth, regarding my above comment.\n\n I think that you are wading away from the truth with your last statement there. Please explain how aliens coming and telling us that they made us is \"undisputable truth\". \n \n I have fully explained why your statement is false. If you want to go on pursuing the same, senseless argument you may. But, you are only fooling yourself.\n \n [edited to fix syntax]",

   "However my original remark to draconis is now more truthfull than ever.\n\n What you are suggesting and acussing me of is really quite absurd in the light of evidence. I have taken every single one of your points, refuted them as much as can be - and you still pursue the same seneless argument without taking into consideration what has been said. You only answer to the points which you can. I highlighted most points in my old post. Could you go back and please try to reply to these? Especially this one, which you have completely ignored:\n \n Your original statement is so obviously drenched in prejudice that I really cannot see the problem. You have presupposed that all religious people will never change their mind. You have provided no grounding for such a sort of thing, and you have attacked fundamentalists with your story of Noah and the Ark - a very small percentage of Christians. Do you think that there have never been religious persons who have changed their mind and become atheists? If so, then that proves your statement wrong already. \"Deeply religious persons\" have become atheists, and have \"changed their mind\" - so your statement is wrong via empiricism.\n \nI am banging my head against a brick wall, it amazes me how you try to avoid issues that make your argument irrelevent.\n\n You are banging your head against the wall due to the self-contradictory nature of your argument. Your whole thesis is rather hypocritical, and furthermore - entirely invalid.\n \nYou are asking me to answer questions that have no meaning, i have questioned your beliefs and all you can say to me is, prove that god doesnt exist. Its amazing, its why psychologist study it.\n\n That is absurd. I have never said \"prove that God doesn't exist. You can't, therefore God exists\". You have once again resorted to a strawman. If you cannot deal with the actual light of my argument, you shouldn't create an argument that is not mine, and attack that. It's a logical fallacy. Pscychologists study lots of things. Brainwashing, no doubt, is one of them. I do not know of any denomination of Christianity that condones brainwashing.\n \nCan you understand what your saying regarding noah? you are obviously closing your eyes and seeing only what you wish to see. Your beliefs are completely irrational and are all based on fantasy, conjecture and unproven writings. Do you honestly believe that 6 people could repopulate the earth?\n\n My argument on Noah and the Ark has not changed since the beginning. I have already told you that I am not a fundamentalist, and I presented the fundamentalists argument. Your argument, has clearly, not been efficient for neither the fundamentalist, but it is non-applicable to the conservatist and the liberal. \n \n Argument ad nauseum is another logical fallacy that you have consecutively resorted to. Something is NOT true because you keep repeating it. You have provided no sufficient evidence for any of your radical claims, so there is nothing that we cannot conclude otherwise, than that they are false in their entirety. \n \nI cannot answer your questions as they have no basis, they are not questions, they are merely ways of avoiding the real issue, its a way for you to avoid the real truth.\n\n I haven't avoided any of your questions, and that is a complete falsity. All of my questions have a basis. Show me one of my questions that has no basis.\n \nI would ask them why they think he's stupid and wait to hear the evidence before i make my assumption, if i just go along and believe what they say without evidence, i would be just following the crowd.\n\n Believe it or not, people follow the crowd every day - including yourself. I never once mentioned that you would have to make a final decision based on the opinions of these 5 persons, I simply said that it might be used as evidence. Whether you think it is strong evidence or not is entirely irrelevant. I suggest that you consult the dictionary for the definition of evidence, or less - you should cease using the word.\n \nYou are correct, i dont know you, i only know your views as you have presented them here, but its interesting as to why you think theres a need to defend yourself, and you are attempting to defend yourself with the above statement. You state you made your decision using logic and gods love, \n\n It really wasn't a defence - it was the reality. \n \nHow did you find gods love? How did you know of god? Did he/she visist you and told you they loved you? Or did someone tell you about god?\n You also say logic, what logic? Are you refering to the bible? The bible is not logical, so what was the first thing that compelled you to the love of god.\n\n Here, we are presented with another logical fallacy - a slippery slope. How I found God's love and how I know of God is a whole seperate issue. What logic? There are several arguments for the existence of God. Among my favourites are the Modal argument and the moral argument. If you want, I can present the modal argument here for you. It's no worry. \n \nLet me guess, as a child you were taken to church, or you were taught about the love of god in school, in other words you were introduced to the love of god, you were also told from a young age, as to what happened to people who didnt believe in god, eternal damnation and all that, so you beleived, because you fear what might happen to you if you didnt believe. Its called brainwashing.\n\n Another slippery slope. You are, once again, in no position to talk about my past life. I was not taken to a Christian school from childhood and we rarely attended Church. You keep acussing me of being brainwashed, while I have presented logical points and rebutted all of yours. You, on the other hand, have failed to do so. You have presented no sufficient evidence for your position. Who's the one being brainwashed? I thought we'd let others decide but thanks for assuming that it was me.\n \nAnd finally to my hypothetical question, you believe that god created us, if alians visited earth and said and provided evidence that they genetically engineered us from apes and created us as an alternate species, that would mean the alians created us not god, would you then cease to believe in god, hypothetically of course.\n\n Not just evidence - they would need sufficient evidence. If they showed sufficient evidence, and they'd also have a lot of explaining to do, then yes - I would change my beliefs. Now, you can answer my question. If I present you with an entirely logical argument with nay a logical fallacy in it, would you change your beliefs?\n \n In conclusion, might I suggest that you take each of my points one by one, instead of quoting the whole reply. Then, we might get somewhere.",

If so, then that proves your statement wrong already. \"Deeply religious persons\" have become atheists, and have \"changed their mind\" - so your statement is wrong via empiricism.[QOUTE/]\n \n You maybe right, of course there will be some who question the evidence and see common sense and begin to doubt, or if something has happened to them and question why god who they believe in, has done something bad to them, then question if a god really exists. Of millions theres always one or two, but lets be honest you believe in god and you still do even theres no evidence to prove the existence.\n \n [QUOTE=dreamweaver]You are banging your head against the wall due to the self-contradictory nature of your argument. Your whole thesis is rather hypocritical, and furthermore - entirely invalid.[QUOTE/]\n \n Im banging my head against a brick wall because you will not accept that there is no evidence for the existence of god, yet you still insist in believing.\n \n [QUOTE=dreamweaver]I have never said \"prove that God doesn't exist. You can't, therefore God exists\". You have once again resorted to a strawman. If you cannot deal with the actual light of my argument, you shouldn't create an argument that is not mine, and attack that. It's a logical fallacy. Pscychologists study lots of things.[QUOTE/]\n \n You did say prove a god doesnt exist, and the fact is, you say that to move the burden of proof and evidence away from yourself, you cannot provide any evidence that a god exists, so its very easy to shift the burden on to me to prove a god doesnt exist, its called avoiding the issue. YOu can call it what you like, strawman, logical fallacy, but you are simply avoiding the issue.\n \n [QUOTE=dreamweaver]Brainwashing, no doubt, is one of them. I do not know of any denomination of Christianity that condones brainwashing.[QUOTE/]\n \n NO, Then explain this, why is there a hell, where bad people and sinners and non belivers go to? Seems to me there trying to frighten people into believing, again call it what you like, but its a form of brainwashing, more so if its preached to the young.\n \n \n [QUOTE=dreamweaver]Argument ad nauseum is another logical fallacy that you have consecutively resorted to. Something is NOT true because you keep repeating it. You have provided no sufficient evidence for any of your radical claims, so there is nothing that we cannot conclude otherwise, than that they are false in their entirety.[QUOTE/]\n \n You are again attempting to shift the burden on to me to provide you with proof and evidence, you are asking me to prove your beliefs, my claims are not radical, there fact, again call it what you like, you are still attempting to avoid the real question.\n \n \n [QUOTE=dreamweaver]Believe it or not, people follow the crowd every day - including yourself. I never once mentioned that you would have to make a final decision based on the opinions of these 5 persons, I simply said that it might be used as evidence. Whether you think it is strong evidence or not is entirely irrelevant. I suggest that you consult the dictionary for the definition of evidence, or less - you should cease using the word.[QUOTE/]\n \n Following the crowd is what programmed people do, i do not follow the crowd, i do not agree with someone simply because they said so, i do not belive in anything unless it has a basis a substance, its called reality, its called truth supported by evidence. Trying to ridicule me, by suggesting i dont know what the word evidence means, suggests you cannot provide any real evidence, so you are attempting to change the rules. \n \n [QUOTE=dreamweaver] while I have presented logical points and rebutted all of yours.[QUOTE/]\n \n Where have you presented any logical points? All you have attempted to do is try to prove that noahs story is true, you dismiss my points, by calling all of my comments fallacys and avoided answering the main question i have posed to you.\n \n [QUOTE=dreamweaver]You have presented no sufficient evidence for your position.[QUOTE/]\n \n YOU are providing my evidence, the fact that you believe in something that has no basis, that cannot be proven, proves my point, i have on many occasions asked you for evidence for the existence of god but you still have not provided a whisker of evidence, nothing. But yet you still believe. Thats why im banging my head against a brick wall, and the fact that you and others like you still believe, proves my point that theres nothing i can say to you that will change your minds. \n \n [QUOTE=dreamweaver] Now, you can answer my question. If I present you with an entirely logical argument with nay a logical fallacy in it, would you change your beliefs?[QUOTE/]\n \n I would change my beliefs if you show me evidence, proven physical evidence that a god exist, no arguments, no religious babble, simple evidence, proof.",

   "Okay, let's go this real slow. I'll ask you questions simply:\n [quoite] The reason i pursue such a senseless arguments is because it is senseless, i claim that religious people cannot or will not change their views whatever anybody says to them, there is NO evidence to support such beliefs but you still continue to do so.[/quote]\n Do you think that no theist has ever become an atheist?\n \n If you say no, then I would say that you are most definitely wrong, by empiricism. It is common knowledge that people have been raised a theist, and even at once embraced theism, while they later rejected. Of course, the opposite has happened as well, but that is irrelevant for the moment. \n \n If you answer yes, then your argument is automatically invalid. Since you have admitted that religious people have changed their mind, it is self-contradictory for you to now say \"religious people don't change their mind\". It's a blatant contradiction. Are we okay so far?\n \n Evidence. You say that there is no evidence for being a theist. I have demonstrated why this is incorrect, but I can explain again. A suitable definition, I believe, for evidence might be found at www.dictionary.com. Most certainly, it is a very common one:\n \n ev\u0095i\u0095dence P Pronunciation Key ( v -d ns)\n n. \n A thing or things helpful in forming a conclusion or judgment\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=evidence\n \n By that, we can see that anything that helps one form a conclusion, is automatically evidence. There are three ways that we can know things. Reasoning it out (a priori), authority (someone having told us) and experience ( a posteriori - empirical). This shows that we can know things simply from what others have told us. If my brother tells me that he failed his exam today, I do not ask him for evidence of it. He, himself, is evidence - I trust him, based on my prior experience with him.\n Similarly, one might conclude that from the complexity in the Universe, there must be a creator. This isn't necessarily valid, since the idea that there is complexity or evidence of design is more subjective. Anyhow, if we are agreed on the proposition \"there is complexity in the universe\" - then it is evidence. Whether it necessarily points to a divine creator is completely another issue. Nevertheless, we can account it as evidence.\n In conclusion, practically everything is evidence. Anything, pretty much, can help one make a conclusion. So, therefore, by definition, it is evidence. The Bible is evidence for the existence of God, but really - it's quite poor evidence. It is based on a petito principii fallacy; \"it's true because it says it is\". Nevertheless, it is evidence, but quite poor evidence - particularly for the atheist. Still, we must, by definition, agree that anything is evidence. It is therefore false for you to say that there is \"no evidence\". I might influence you in making a decision, so perhaps my opinion can be evidence, no matter how meagre it may be.\n If you understand this - then you can go on with the rest of the post. If you have an objection - then the rest is quite useless, and you need not respond to it. It's better that we clear up that and move on, then get entangled in one issue and just make a mountain. (Except the argument at the end.)\n \n You also say you refuted my points as much as you can, im sorry you havent, you still havent answered the most important point, why do you beleive in something that has no evidence?\n\n If we agree so far, this statement is therefore incorrect - since I do have evidence. So far, quite obviously, you are not happy with the evidence I have provided - but no worry, we can get to that later.\n \n am not being prejudice, i have stated my opinion which i still stand by, i do not believe that there is anything i can say or do to change your views, there is no evidence to prove your views and beliefs are true, but you still believe in them, why?\n\n You are most certainly entitled to your opinion, and I would certainly not want you to restrict you of this. However, when you reach such a conclusion on a faulty proposition(s), I feel that it is my duty to at least explain why I think so. That is the very nature of debate. Are we agreed?\n \n As far as noah is concerned you are now trying to pass of that story to the fundementalists and are trying to distance yourself from such an absurd story, but you still attempted to defend the story in an earlier post, which meant you believe it, even though it can never be possible.\n\n With all due respect, I am not passing on the story. I haven't once claimed that the events with Noah, and the story in the Bible should be taken literally. I think I mentioned from the beginning that I am not a fundamentalist. Plus, I do not worship the Bible, I worship God.\n \n Defending another view most certainly does not mean that you agree with it. Ever heard of Advocatus Diaboli - Devil's advocate? It simply means arguing the opposite or another position. Plus, since I felt that your conclusion was faulty, I thought that I should point it out. For example, if I now said, \"The world is round because I hold it up\", would you not disagree, or, defend the opposite notion? I have reached the correct conclusion - that the world is round, but by obviously, the wrong line of thinking. I was just doing the same thing. I do not necessarily think that such a great flood occurred, but the conclusion by which you had reached such a thing could be scrutinized by the fundamentalist. \n \n I never mentioned that the story is absurd - and really, you haven't proved that it is not possible. The fundamentalist can always say, \"Oh, but God made more humans,\" or \"God made it so that there wouldn't be a problem with the inbreeding at that time\". What we could do to this is demonstrate that it's highly unlikely or just Ockham Razor it, but really - you haven't proved it impossible.\n \n Of millions theres always one or two, but lets be honest you believe in god and you still do even theres no evidence to prove the existence.\n\n Well, since again you have made that claim - you will have to back it up. In fact, it's logically impossible for you to prove such a preposition. You say that there is \"no evidence to prove the existed [of God]\". For you to know this you would have to know all of the proofs (or pretty much) that are in existence. Also, you would have to pretty much know all of the evidence. If we are agreed that you're not quite omniscient, then we can move on. \n \n Im banging my head against a brick wall because you will not accept that there is no evidence for the existence of god, yet you still insist in believing.\n\n Already answered. \n \n YOu can call it what you like, strawman, logical fallacy, but you are simply avoiding the issue.\n\n Never once did I say, \"prove God's non-existence. Since you cannot, He exists.\" Instead of consecutively making that claim, show me the post or bring in the quote from the post. You have mentioned this twice now. You should not make a claim that is faulty in debate and it is a logical fallacy. Is that settled? \n \n NO, Then explain this, why is there a hell, where bad people and sinners and non belivers go to? Seems to me there trying to frighten people into believing, again call it what you like, but its a form of brainwashing, more so if its preached to the young.\n\n You may think of it as you please. Why do they go there? It's quite simply - their decision. Believe in God - go to Heaven. Do not believe in God - do not go to Heaven (at least, temporarily - depends on your denomination and belief). It's quite simply, the choice is down to the human. \n \n You are again attempting to shift the burden on to me to provide you with proof and evidence, you are asking me to prove your beliefs, my claims are not radical, there fact, again call it what you like, you are still attempting to avoid the real question.\n\n Shifting the burden of proof is not applicable if I have already answered the question. You suggest that I have no proof for the existence of God. Let's presume that I agree to this. Fine. Now, since that is done, we see if your system and line of thinking works for you. If you dismiss my beliefs since I cannot prove them, it logically follows that you should dismiss your own if you cannot prove them. Do you seen?\n \n In fact, your statement is more like a classical Argument ad ignorantiam. You are saying that since I cannot prove the existence of God, that he therefore does not exist. That is erroneous. \n \n Following the crowd is what programmed people do, i do not follow the crowd, i do not agree with someone simply because they said so, i do not belive in anything unless it has a basis a substance, its called reality, its called truth supported by evidence.\n\n You might suggest so, but you do trust people. That is following the crowd in one way. The vast majority of people in my school are not theists. There, I am not following the crowd. When my Physics teacher tells me something about science, I generally accept it as true. He has been true in the past, and I trust him enough on the majority of his claims to not have to further verify him - I trust him. The rest of the class does the same. In that fashion, I am following the crowd. \n \n Trying to ridicule me, by suggesting i dont know what the word evidence means, suggests you cannot provide any real evidence, so you are attempting to change the rules.\n\n The only reason I suggested that you weren't aware of the definition was because you seemed to have your whole thoughts on evidence wrong. Hopefully, now, it is cleared up. \n \n Where have you presented any logical points? All you have attempted to do is try to prove that noahs story is true, you dismiss my points, by calling all of my comments fallacys and avoided answering the main question i have posed to you.\n\n I didn't try to prove the Noah story true - I simply tried to prove your arguments wrong. They are not the same thing. I wouldn't call a single one of your claims a fallacy if it was not. Logical fallacies have no place in debate, really. If you understand why they are logical fallacies (and I assume you have since you haven't yet objected) then you shouldn't pursue in the same argument. If your argument is based on a logical fallacy, or has it in its inferences, it is automatically <u<invalid</u< - regardless of whether the conclusion is true. \n \n I would change my beliefs if you show me evidence, proven physical evidence that a god exist, no arguments, no religious babble, simple evidence, proof.\n\n What do you think that God is? Do you think that He is some kind of thing - located at some point and we can just go there, and then say, \"ah, yes - God exists\". Or, that we can just bring him in and trot him around? Are you really going to argue that the Supreme, transcendental being of everything is based at some point? If not, then physical evidence isn't necessarily going to work. A logical argument, I should think, should do us just fine. If you reject a logical argument, then you are, by definition, illogical. You can pursue your position but you will have to accept that it is based on faith. I'll present the modal argument just to further the debate. This is logical evidence. \n \n This argument, of course, is not my own. It originally was inspired by St. Anselm, and later developed by Platinga and Charles Hartshorne. If you are agreed that it is possible that God exists, then this argument should prove His existence just fine. \n Let G = God qua Supreme [Necessary] Being [Existence]. As Anselm first proposed, \"perfection cannot exist contingently\". We can affirm that a being might have Necessary Existence if we can prove that it is possible. That part, actually, is terribly easy. You can see the proof of it here. I do not believe that I am fully equipped to defend this argument, but I am certainly aware of the majority of misunderstandings and I should be able to point out any problem you might have.\n \n Just in case you are not familiar with Modal logic:\n \n []G - Necessarily G (true in all possible worlds)\n <<G or ~[]~G - Possible for G (true at least one possible world)\n G - G is true in actuality (true in the actual world)\n \n If something exists necessarily, then, of course, it exists in the actual world since our world is a possible world. Premise one is a conditional statement, it does not presuppose the existence of God.\n \n 1. G -< []G - From the definition of God \n 2. ~[]~G - It is possible that God exists\n 3. []G -< G - The Modal Axiom\n 4. ~[]G -< []~[]G - Becker's Postulate applied to 3 by Reductio ad Absurdum\n 5. []G v ~[]G - Law of Excluded Middle applied to 3 and 4\n 6. []G v []~[]G - Substitution from 4 and 5\n 7. []~[]G -< []~G - Modal Modus Tollens from 1 and 6\n 8. []G v []~G - Substitution from 6 and 7\n 9. []G - Disjunctive Syllogism on 7 and 2\n G - Modus Ponens from 9 and 3\n \n I'd also like to apologise for the tone of my previous post. Looking back over it now, I clearly lost my temper. There is no excuse, and I apologise. It shouldn't happen again. :)",

   "Its seems we're going round in circles, youre just repeating yourself which in turns is forcing me to repeat myself.\n \n Either you refuse or do not understand what im trying to say. I'll repeat it again, You believe in something that has no bases, no evidence, it is like a \"fantasy\".\n \n Because you believe in such a way, your views and beliefs are so entrenched in religios teachings that you are in a way brainwashed to believe in something that has no evidence of existing, therefore if you are prepared to belive in such a manner, there is obviously nothing i or anyone can say to you that will change your views.\n \n The fact that theres no evidence to prove the existence of god or a supreme deighty proves my point.\n \n Because you have no evidence, you attempt to change the rules to suit your points and try to justify your argument. Because of the lack of evidence you have attempted to change your intepretation of god and religion, by suggesting fundemantalist and so on have different views, if you all believe in the same thing then you should all accept responsibilty for your beliefs. \n \n If one religious person says one thing and another says a different thing, it means that the concept is flawed if you cannot even agree together as to the meaning of a said story. (I used noah as an example) In other words your contradicting yourselves and try to pass it away as intepretation.\n \n You have gone off in many directions, you have attempted many ways to prove that im wrong, but it boils down to one thing, that a religious person belives in something that has no basis and no evidence and is totaly contraditory and so irrational. \n \n The only conclusion i can arrive to is brainwashed, you have attempted to avoid the issue by using a number of diversionary tactics, changing the rules, intepreting words and meanings to suit your argument, avoidance, ignoring the main and important facts.\n \n [quote]What do you think that God is? Do you think that He is some kind of thing &#8211; located at some point and we can just go there, and then say, &#8220;ah, yes &#8211; God exists&#8221;.

A logical argument, I should think, should do us just fine. If you reject a logical argument, then you are, by definition, illogical.[quote/] Again you are attempting to avoid the the issue, what is logic based on? how can you have a logical argument/debate if your logic lacks substance, you cannot have such a debate in logic, you need evidence, as you dont have any you attempt to change the rules once again.\n \n And as far as model logic is concerned it is an attempt by people to try and justify there beliefs by removing the burden of evidence from them.\n \n I hope you dont think im being personal to you in any way.",

That is a strawman fallacy. It is where you presume that I said something different in order to attack it more easily. You may not do that in a formal debate. I would be very happy if you could graciously point out to me where I said that \"conclusions are evidence\".

It is evidence (poor evidence) and clearly it will not convince you. Not all evidence convinces all people. There are varying states of evidence. You are attempting to imply that if there is evidence for something, then it must be true. Not all evidence convinces everyone.

And by calling everything a fallacy and using an impressive word doesnt make you more believable, in fact its making you look desperate to try and prove a point that cant be proven.\n\n It might not make my argument more believable (and I wouldn't want it to on those grounds) but it does make your argument weaker and less believable. \n \n I am not trying to change the meaning of a word in the dictionary, you are.

Well you would be hard pressed to find anyone else that used their house as evidence for the second coming. So what you are really saying is, if you can find anyone who used something to form a conclusion then it is evidence. So if it is helpful in one person forming some conclusion, then it must be evidence because of the way you interpret the definition. \n \n In a debate forum like this, evidence is used to prove a point. Therefore it is assumed by most that you are using the concept of evidence as is used in a court, as something that is actually helpful to any reasonable person in forming a conclusion, not just something that ONE person says is helpful in forming their conclusion.

The reason that I and Plotter have had this terribly long debate was because of his original statement:\n \n \"you cant win an argument with the deeply religious types\"\n \n Except from being factually incorrect, it is most certainly palpable that it is prejudice. Nevermind.\n\n The reason why i made such a comment is because, however many times i or anybody else asks a deeply religious person a question they cannot answer, they reply by saying its gods will, you point out many contradictions in the bible, its gods will, how can anybody win an arguament with someone that refuses to accept that there beliefs, and the facts surrounding there beliefs cannot be proven, they cant prove what they believe in.\n \n You can have faith that a god exists, but theres no evidence to prove a god exists, so if people belive in something which has no basis, how can you win an argument? You cant.\n \n Thats not being prejudice in any way. I may believe that a giant invisible hand pushes the earth round the sun, if you ask me to prove it, and i provide no evidence, but still believe that a giant invisible hand exists, then you would be banging your head against a brick wall if you attempt to explain to me otherwise, just like i do.",

   "I am pressed for time because of the virgin birth debate but let me see if I can bring a little clarity to the subject of evidence. I am one of those 'a rose is a rose by any name' thinkers. I debate based on concepts, not definitions or words. Therefore as long as I know what you mean when you use a word, I can work with that. However evidence is a word that is used by lots of people on this forum so it's impossible to have an intelligent conversation if there is a different concept, regardless of the definition. Therefore I have no problem with the definition that dreamweaver gives, only his concept of the word. Maybe the following exchange he and I had earlier will help explain my point.\n \n In post # 33 of the \"Open the close minded?\" thread in the General\\Debating Techniques and Styles section:\n \n \nHow are you defining \"evidence\"? Dictionary.com gives three definitions, I think that the first one is approrpiate and the most used:\n \n ev\u0095i\u0095dence ( P ) Pronunciation Key (v-dns)\n n. \n A thing or things helpful in forming a conclusion or judgment: The broken window was evidence that a burglary had taken place. Scientists weigh the evidence for and against a hypothesis. \n \n By that, I might well say that near enough anything might be evidence. Whether it is strong evidence or not is a whole other issue. Although it is a logical fallacy to appeal to authority, there is nothing wrong with saying that there is evidence for the existence of God because I believe it. It sounds absurd, but it's true. Anyways, I clearly wasn't referring to that.\n\n \n Then in post # 36\n \n \nSo if I told you that I read Peter Pan and I'm now convinced that fairies exist, you would accept that as evidence, albeit not strong evidence, but nonetheless evidence to you. Is that what you are calling evidence?\n\n \n To which dreamweaver replied:\n \n \nIndeed, it would be. I still wouldn't trust you, because this type of evidence is the flimsiest that you can get.\n\n \n Now maybe I'm wrong, but I do not think most people would consider the book Peter Pan (I'm assuming there is a book by that name) as evidence that fairies exist. But since I would not consider it evidence, dreamweaver and I disagree on what can be called evidence. I don't mean to critize him, I just disagree.",

   "It seems to me that keeping it in the original form is confusing because there are a lot of double negatives. How about just pointing out where my simplified version is incorrect.\n\n Nope, there are no double negatives. A double negative, really, would be \"~~\" and there are none in the proof above.\n \n1 : likely but not certain to happen : POSSIBLE\n\n Something possible, is, something that exists in at least one possible world. To better understand possible world semantics in modal logic, read this extract by Tisthammer:\n \n Our world is reality. Nevertheless, there are many other ways reality could have been like, i.e. many other possible worlds. Suppose we have a supercomputer called OmniSim that can simulate all possible worlds. Every world that is possible has a simulated environment in this supercomputer. (I'll refer to this hypothetical supercomputer a little later when I describe a few terms.) Modal logic mainly deals with \"necessary\" (signified by a square, like this one: []) and \"possible\" (signified by a diamond, like this one: <<) modal operators. For example:\n <<p\n \n This means that p is possibly true. According to <<p, there exists at least one possible world in OmniSim where p is true. An example of a possible (but not necessary) statement would be that Abraham Lincoln was not president of the United States. This is indeed possible, but not necessary. There exists a world in OmniSim (even if it is not our own) where Abraham Lincoln was never such a President, because such a world is possible. However, there also exists at least one possible world where Abraham Lincoln was in fact the President of the U.S. (e.g. our own). Therefore, the statement is possible even if it is not true in every possible world. A statement that's true in some possible worlds but also false in some other possible worlds is called a contingent statement (because it can be either true or false). Another example:\n []p\n \n This means that p is necessarily true. That is, it is true in all possible worlds. Using the supercomputer analogy, statement p would be true in all of OmniSim's simulated worlds. Examples of a necessary truth would be 2 + 2 = 4, the law of noncontradiction (this law states that for any specified proposition p, it is impossible for both p and not p to be true; e.g. it is impossible for me to exist and to not exist at the same time), and the law of excluded middle (which I describe a little later). All of these things are true in all possible worlds. Note that a possible statement (one that's true in at least one possible world) can also be necessary (true in all possible worlds), and all necessary statements are possible. However, a contingent statement (one that's true in some possible worlds, and false in some others) cannot be a necessary statement, and no necessary statements are contingent. A brief summary of the terms that describe statements can be found below. \n http://www.angelfire.com/mn2/tisthammerw/rlgnphil/ontological.html\n \n2 : not logically necessary; especially : EMPIRICAL\n\n I don't know what you mean here by empirical, but what you seem to be describing \"not logically necessary\" (but possible), is something that is contingent. It is described above.\n \n\n But since you say it is being used as something that might be true or false, then the argument would be \"perfection cannot exist (true or false)\"? I don't understand the statement. Can you explain how this proves that if God were to exist, then he would exist necessarily?\n\n I don't follow, perhaps you could clarify? Then, I'll try to explain as best as possible.\n \nCan you describe the difference since the descriptions given are exactly the same?\n\n Sorry, that's my fault. Premise six should read:\n \n (6) []G v []~[]G\n \n Either it is necessarily the case that God exists, or, necessarily it is not the case that necessarily God exists.\n \nI see the equations.

   "Training in mathematics will help a lot in understand propositional and modal logic. Mathematics is mother to logic. So, for you, I do not think that it should take you too long. 1 and 2 are the ones most likely to be rejected (because if you reject three, then you're going against a lot of computer science, and common sense). Anyhow, it depends on what you mean by \"substituting in\". If you're saying that you mean Supreme Being, but want to call it \"pair of gods\" or \"pineapple juice\", then, that's fine. That's not logic, that's semantics. This argument only works for Supreme Being - the greatest possible being. There cannot be two greatEST beings.

   "Plotter- To save my sanity, I will not respond to any of your comments in that last post. I will say this though, and I do not mean it in a bad way, but this is truly what I feel. And, if you are an intelligent person, then you will take this into consideration.\n \n I have visited and been a part of many, many forums in my time. Some of them have been literature-based, some have been quotation-based, and some have been philosophy/debate-based. I have had the pleasure of meeting many people on the forums, and sparring with persons from all different belief systems. I have come to value many people both as friends, and as fellow humans. While I do not agree with arguments at times, I can accept that we disagree. I think that it is entirely possible for two intellectual people to disagree on a subject. Even God.\n \n However, never in my history of the forums have I come across someone who incessantly repeats the same things, and continuous such a blind and strenuous argument. If I had to base my opinions of the entire atheistic population on you - I can tell you that I would think them to be so terribly illogical, but also irrational. You reply to what suits you, and you block out everything else that suggests otherwise. Now, I needn't reply to a thing you say, because I can sum up your whole argument very simply:\n \n Plotter: You believe in God even though you do not have the slightest bit of evidence.\n \n Plotter: Why are you asking me if I have evidence? The onus is on you. I don't need to prove that God does not exist because that is what I believe, only the theist, because he thinks that He exists.\n \n I have replied to both of those questions over 8 times (I have counted them). Your reply is disimmilar, it is:\n \n Plotter: You believe in God even though you do not have the slightest bit of evidence.\n \n Plotter: Why are you asking me if I have evidence? The onus is on you. I don't need to prove that God does not exist because that is what I believe, only the theist, because he thinks that He exists.\n \n Furthermore, I am sure that you will reply with exactly the same reply, which, would be:\n \n Plotter: You believe in God even though you do not have the slightest bit of evidence.\n \n Plotter: Why are you asking me if I have evidence? The onus is on you. I don't need to prove that God does not exist because that is what I believe, only the theist, because he thinks that He exists.\n \n Dreamweaver asks: define evidence for me since you intend on continuously using it incorrectly to what the dictionary says. \n \n Dreamweaver says: I have provided you with a logical argument for belief in a Supreme Being. Not only do you not seem to understand it, but you interject superogatory claims that it is invalid because of technicalities. Absurd, per se.\n \n I can truly say that never in my life time have I come across someone who ignores and repeatedly states the same things, and who has no intention of progressing debate. It is entirely useless to debate with someone who cannot reason. And hence, it proves to be entirely futile to debate any logical argument with you. On all of the websites I know, members such as you would probably have their posting prohibited, or would at least get a warning. However, since this forum is extremely badly moderated (if at all), it has been allowed to flourish. And that is the truth.",

This debate is now pointless as you have continuesly used every tactic you can think of in avoiding answering a question which you clearly and obviously cannot answer, but you still insist. I have to hand it to you, your determined. Ive stuck to the main issue of this debate, you on the other hand have attempted everytrick to alter the debate and avoid admitting you cannot answer the question. have you ever thought of studying law, you may be good at it.",

   "Its not in mainstream teachings for the simple fact, its nonsense, its not used by any reputable or notable institution or person, it has not been taught anywhere, other than religious institutions, and even they question it. no philosopher or scientist has ever or will ever use it, and thats why its not in mainstream teachings.\n\n The OA caused serious problems for many materialist logicians, and it's absurd to suggest that it wasn't taken seriously or that it hasn't been used by anyone. Names, eh? Plantinga, Hartshorne, Suber, Kant, Anselm, Russell, Godel, Malcolm, Miller and Stoebenau. To say that any of these logicians are not rebutaple would be completely absurd.\n \nNot my lecturer, but they use proven science in there assumptions, something that cannot be said about your equation, again it cannot be proven, nearly every scientific equation can in one way or another be proven, or even proven when technology allows, but the only way your equation can be proven if a supreme deity suddenly apears and performs a few miracles that cannot be explained by any other means.\n\n Nonsensical dogma. The \"principle of verification\" was refuted a long time ago. Furthermore, check those links I provided if you want to understand the argument, since all that you're saying is really quite incorrect. It's not just an \"equation\", it means something.\n \n You say that I've used so many \"tactics\". Oh my. I've asked you to do one thing from the very beginning: define evidence. Otherwise, don't use the word.",

   "This isnt getting us anywhere is it? we are just repeating the same old things, i ask for evidence, you insist on defining evidence, although evidence is evidence, never mind.\n\n That doesn't help at all. Evidence is evidence, grass is grass, and I am who I am. This actually tells us nothing about each of the things in each case - they're all tautologies. They might always be true, but they tell us nothing new, and so it means nothing.\n \nLets assume a supreme deity exists, where would he or shes origins be.\n \n Where did they come from, and why did they create us?\n\n Those are other philosophical questions, not within the scope of modality. The modal proof has nothing to do with them; do you now see that it is valid? If you take it to be unsound, which premise do you reject? You must reject one, otherwise, the proof is sound and you must accept its conclusion.\n \n I think it's misleading to speak of God having an \"origin\". Origin is a spatial word, and it's problematic to refer to God as some \"thing\" located at \"some point\". Such a God, I should think, would be obviously transcendental. To speak that they \"came from\" anywhere is nonsensical as well, since a necessarily existing being cannot come into existence. The being defines reality. And, everything is contingent upon it.",
