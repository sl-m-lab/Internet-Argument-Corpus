   "There's a pretty good chance that the wrong decision in Afganistan will result in a higher death toll. Given the dire state of US healthcare the chances of that happening with the healthcare bill are pretty minor. Secondly, the nature of the decisions are totally different. One is a decision made by the President, another is made by congress. With healthcare it's not an issue of thinking time, it's wrangling time - pretty much everyone involved has already made up their mind, and the situation on the ground isn't changing much. Afghanistan is constantly evolving and the President must make that decision himself. Would you really rather he blundered into whatever decision plays well on TV, like his predecessor did? Mission accomplished anyone?",

   "Certainly. Health care has been in a state of horror for well over forty years. The reason why it is so urgent to fix the health care system is because over 44000 legal American citizens die every year from not having health insurance. That comes out to roughly 122 a day.\n \n As far as Afghanistan is concerned Obama does not want to make a mistake whether or not to send more troops into the region when there will be no positive outcome with a corrupt government in place.\n \n \n The Afghanistan conflict is a major one, and certainly I am relieved that Obama is weighing the issue and taking the time to debate strategy and certain goals to see if there is a possibility of improving the situation.\n \n And I hate to beat a dead horse but if you remember the Bush Administration diverted our resources and military capability from Afghanistan to a failed and unjust war in Iraq, abandoning our main objective which was to capture or kill Bin Laden. \n \n The result, is that eight years of negligence in this region has now come to the tipping point to where drastic measures must now be made to either attempt to reestablish the region or abandon it altogether.\n \n Sadly, it has been debated that if we only send more troops over it will turn into \"nation building\". Where NATO and other allies are soon to abandon Afghanistan altogether due to the sheer level of corruption and instability in the government.\n \n \n Can we as Americans spend another eight years in Afghanistan and sacrifice more troops for a corrupt and uncaring government? And even worse a majority of the Afghan people see us as invaders and occupiers of their country.\n \n Sure there are a few villages that think otherwise, but I think the only reason we are even still there is the growing concern over Pakistan and it's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of radicals.",

The only \"Al Qaeda\" in Afghanistan now are there because the American presence makes it easy to recruit new members.\n \n To mix some metaphors, the horses have bolted, and you're beating the dead one left in the stables.\n\n \n So you favor a return of the taliban to power with the mass murders to surely follow?

I did follow this link from the one you provided Jo....List of civilian casualties of the War in Afghanistan (2001?present) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Please do read it. Especially the parts citing Canadian and British troops who have killed MANY civillians and not in airstrikes. I did not find any reference to the U.S. using depleted uranium or white phosphorus. \n \n If you are going to accuse the U.S., you might want to look at the UK as well since they have been accused of the same thing. You really should stop believing everything the Guardian prints. \n \n Now to white phosphorus. You are aware it is also used in common rodent poisons? Fireworks? As for use in munnitions, the military...ALL militaries have used it. It is used as a smoke shield against the enemy and to disable their equipment. Once hitting the air, it's composition is reduced to harmless chemicals within minutes. WP also flushes out of our systems via urine and fecal matter within a day or two. So unless you are eating a whole lot of rat poison or HIGHLY contaminated fish....I wouldn't get too concerned about it Jo. \n \n Last time I looked, we were asked to aide A'stan. Hence, we are there. The civilians know we are there as well. If they persist in aiding the enemies, they are part of the problem. As long as they choose to aide the poppy pushers, they are part of the problem. If they also choose not to get out of the way, there again they are part of the problem. Until they become part of the solution....people (civilians) will die, but NOT INTENTIONALLY at the hands of our military. You getting the picture here Jo? \n \n Here is a real big kick in the butt for people like you Jo.....I am of the mind set, we should go in and carpet bomb the whole damn desert and every cave hiding enemy combatants. Burn every poppy field and run the heroin dealers into the ground. However, our panty waist socialist politicians just don't seem to grasp how to WIN a war. \n \n Sidebar: Just remember who saved Britain's butt in WWII Jo.

My mother told me the relief that everyone felt when Hitler declared war on Russia was incredible.\n America was our grocer and armourer during that time, in exchange for arms and food the States took immediate payment of gold or assets including foreign bases for their own armed forces.\n They waited for us to become bankrupt which inevitably happened.\n When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour they declared war on the USA and Britain. America did NOT declare war on Germany..Germany declared war on the US.\n \n Without the USA the Allies could not have won the war against the Axis powers. Neither could the Allies have won without Russia or the British and ( at that time) the armies of its empire.\n \n If you want to go native then ok but you run away...so your opinion means nothing",

   "85 sharia courts, voluntary ones, in the whole of the UK. \n\n \n \n \n \n Which has a population of about 1 million Muslims. This is your evidence of a Muslim takeover?\n\n \n Let's start with your first bit of misinformation, shall we? Here is the point Pippie is attempting to make. The headline says it all. Muslim population 'rising 10 times faster than rest of society' - Times Online And here's the relevant quote from it. The Muslim population in Britain has grown by more than 500,000 to 2.4 million in just four years, according to official research collated for The Times. \n \n The population multiplied 10 times faster than the rest of society, the research by the Office for National Statistics reveals. In the same period the number of Christians in the country fell by more than 2 million. \n \n Experts said that the increase was attributable to immigration, a higher birthrate and conversions to Islam during the period of 2004-2008, when the data was gathered. They said that it also suggested a growing willingness among believers to describe themselves as Muslims because the western reaction to war and terrorism had strengthened their sense of identity. \n \n As for sharia law and its impact on the British Judicial system, remember that old verse that says \"A house divided is a house fallen.\" And when it comes to different forms of justice for different people within the same country, that is a recipe for chaos. \n Women are likely to suffer more if sharia law, which does treat women equally to men, becomes an accepted legal avenue\n The revelations sparked uproar yesterday, with warnings that the fundamental principle of equal treatment for all - the bedrock of British justice - was being gravely undermined.\n Critics fear Britain's Islamic hard-liners will now try to make sharia law the dominant legal system in Muslim neighbourhoods, and warn that women often receive less favourable treatment at the hands of the traditional Islamic courts.\n \n The Archbishop of Canterbury sparked controversy when suggesting recognition of sharia seemed 'unavoidable'\n The issue erupted into a major controversy earlier this year after the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams claimed publicly that formal recognition of sharia law 'seemed unavoidable', and Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips gave his backing to the use of Islamic courts to deal with family, marital and financial disputes.\n Sharia courts have operated unofficially for years among Britain's Muslim communities but until now their rulings could not be enforced, relying instead on parties agreeing voluntarily.\n The Muslim Arbitration Tribunal panels, set up by lawyer Sheikh Faiz-ul-Aqtab Siddiqi, are now operating in London, Bradford, Manchester, Birmingham and Nuneaton, with more planned for Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n Mr Siddiqi said: 'We realised that under the Arbitration Act we can make rulings which can be enforced by county and High Courts.\n 'The Act allows disputes to be resolved using alternatives like tribunals. This method is called alternative dispute resolution, which for Muslims is what the sharia courts are.'\n Cases handled by the courts so far include Muslim divorce and inheritance to nuisance neighbours, he said. \n But as well as civil disputes they have also handled six cases of domestic violence.\n In all six cases, he said, sharia judges ordered husbands to take anger management classes and mentoring from community elders, but issued no further punishment. \n All the women subsequently withdrew their complaints to the police, who halted investigations.\n Mr Siddiqi claimed the advantage was that marriages were saved and couples given a second chance.\n But critics fear Muslim women victims will be pressured into accepting a sharia court settlement, and husbands will escape with lighter punishments than in a mainstream criminal court.\n In one recent inheritance dispute in Nuneaton, a Muslim man's estate was spit was between three daughters and two sons with each son receiving twice as much as each daughter - in keeping with sharia law.\n In a mainstream court all siblings would have been treated equally.\n Douglas Murray, the director of the Centre for Social Cohesion, condemned the latest development as 'appalling.'\n 'I don't think arbitration that is done by sharia should ever be endorsed or enforced by the British state.' \n Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said: 'These tribunals have no place in passing binding decisions in divorce or criminal justice hearings.\n 'Far from handling more criminal cases. They should be handling none at all.\n 'British law is absolute and must remain so.'\n \n \n Read more: Islamic sharia courts in Britain are now 'legally binding' | Mail Online\n Now where are all of these liberals and feminists who believe that women's rights need to be protected?",

   "the latter of which is post-marxist).\n\n \n Sorry to take this off topic, but could you provide some expansion on what that means?\n \n I took a couple of weeks of uni classes dedicated to post-marxism, and I can honestly say that after those two weeks, still no one, including the lecturer, could really define what it meant.\n \n The wikipedia is no more illuminating\n \n Post-Marxism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n At best, the collection of writings I came across being identified as \"post-marxist\" appeared to loosely take marxists themes (alienation, exploitation), divorced mostly from marxist theory, bolster support? credibility? for those themes with an eclectic collection of writers in other areas (often groups associated with identity politics), and attempt to cobble these writings together into some kind of vague minority consensus about what future action to take or who was a great hero. Often these writings would devolve into self-referential meandering diatribes about how language itself had been co-opted, so now authentic political discourse would have to be written in an unorthodox style (using 5 or 10 languages within a single sentence, extensive use of non-words to express ideas)\n \n One paper in particular appeared obsessed with describing corporate funeral home chains as \"merchants of death\", with this pun repeated every few lines, in case we didn't quite get it the first time. The essence of this extremely long article was this; consumers want a personalised funeral experience, so they tend to go for small operators. However, small operators are often bought up by larger ones - worse still, the large operators then fail to alter the branding, staff or practises of the boutique funeral home they bought, so that future customers still receive a small operator experience - we are supposed here, to recoil with horror, since the funeral home is corporate owned, the small business experience is inauthentic. (and this is very, very important).",
