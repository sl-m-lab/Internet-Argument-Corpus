   "Ill state up front: Im a smoker. Im in the process of quitting with the aid of Zyban, but I still count myself as a smoker.\n \n I am totally opposed to this ban. The reasons are multiple, here are a couple:\n \n FIRST - We are told this ban is to protect the public. We are told that second hand smoke causes cancer. This is highly probable; if \"first hand\" smoke causes it, it logically follows second hand smoke would as well. The problem occurs when you look at the first statement from a logical perspective. Surely, if there was such massive public outrage on this subject, there would be non-smoking establishments? Oh yes, there are already, yet people choose not to patronise them to the extent that they become predominant. Simple supply and demand; the general reaction to \"would you like smoking to be banned\" before the ban was proposed was, paraphrased of course; \"meh\". Hardly the raucous outburst of public opinion the politicians have repeatedly talked about. Numerous studies have concluded that fan-based ventilation systems of sufficient power are more than enough to prevent second hand smoke being a health risk, yet government never even debated making such systems a manditory condition of being granted a pub license.\n \n SECOND - We are told that the ban is to protect those who work in locations which allow smoking, as unlike the public, many dont have a choice about which job they take. There are several problems with that assertion, the most obvious being that many \"lower class\"/\"blue collar\"/etc workers are \"forced\" to work in dangerous manual labour employment constantly, with a much higher risk than that of getting cancer from second hand smoke in a pub. The other main fault is with the assertion that second hand smoke is actually a serious threat to the health of bar staff. An article in one of the newspapers around the time the ban was first brought before the Scottish Parliament(I apologise, I cant find a copy online to link to, Ill try and root it out to scan later) quoted statistics which indicated someone working in a pub was around ten times more likely to die as a direct result of alcohol-fuelled violence than they were as a result of second hand smoke, and five times more likely to die in a road accident near their place of work. Does this mean that alcohol should be banned in enclosed public places? Afterall, it clearly presents a serious health risk to those who work in pubs and clubs who, afterall, may not have a choice about their place of work.\n \n In the end, this ban was an exersise in spin. The Labour/Lib-Dem coalition government here have been seen as poor managers of the nation's health for a long while. The NHS is, ironically, unhealthy, and so are the Scottish people. This ban presented an easy oppertunity for the government to score points with voters, and in the end comes down to the fact that it's easy to persuade someone who doesnt like the smell of smoke that smoking deserves to be banned.\n \n Well, I dislike the smell of a lot of things; alcohol, the puke and #### that lines our streets every Saturday morning, car fumes. That doesnt give me the right to deprive others of those things, even though all of them cause significantly more damage to the nation than second hand smoke.",

If it's private property, and the owner as well as the person doing it is ok with it, why shouldn't they be allowed to? And it's banning smoking in their house?
