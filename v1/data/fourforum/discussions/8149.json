   "USA is endangering the security of many countries by keeping of sizeable nuclear potential (480 units) at the territory of Europe. Well, US military base Incirlik which is situated in Turkey has 90 nuclear aviation bombs of B-16 type. As I know each of them it in many times exceeds by power the bomb which was dropped at Hiroshima. \n At present time Ankara is alarmed by US nuclear weapons presence at its own territory especially on the threshold of possible US aggression against Iran. It's clear that this base will not remain aside in case of war and Iran could strike it as a preventive or reciprocal blow. And the results of it could have disastrous affect for Turkey. It will be enough to remember about Hiroshima but the nuclear weapons stores in Turkey exceed that bomb by power in hundred or thousand times. And one more thing - nuclear weapons depot could become a target for international terrorism (al Qaeda). It's well-known that a lot of Chechens ('asleep' members of al Qaeda) came to Turkey from Georgia with the connivance of Saakashvili's regime.\n That's why we have to demand to withdraw US nuclear weapons in order to prevent possible catastrophe. And European countries need to follow our example because Americans pursue their own interests by keeping here their nuclear weapons in Europe. They don't care about consequences - USA is far-far away from us.",
