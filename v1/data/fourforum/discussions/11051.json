And how did they become defined as hybrids? Is it because Man cross bred them with other animals to create the new hybrid species originally? If so, then that isn't an example of evolution at all but is another example of human genetic manipulation which led to the existence of hybrids. Therefore, to say that any of those hybrids which can reproduce are examples of one species evolving into another species is specious to the max. So as you can see, your shallow concern about a no true scotsman fallacy argument misses the mark all together.",

   "One obvious example of a reproducing hybrid would be the granny smith apple, but I'm sure others can point out dozens if not hundreds of others.\n \n Granny Smith - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n My favourite animal is the liger, which can reproduce somewhat successfuly with its parent species. It doesn't usually form in the wild, but no real reason for that apart from the parents having different habitats.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly%E2%80%93polar_bear_hybrid\n \n here's a good one, grizzlies and polar bears, happen by themselves. Maybe we forced them together by global warming (sic)\n \n I mean the only way to ignore this is to retrospectively redefine what we mean by species when we find two things that cross boundaries. Feel free to define species however you want, its a pretty poorly defined term at the best of times, but I don't like going back and changing the definition afterwards.\n \n \nthat isn't an example of evolution \n\n \n I'm not trying to give examples of evolution, I'm trying to give examples of reproducing hybrids and correct the incorrect but common belief that all hybrids are sterile.",
