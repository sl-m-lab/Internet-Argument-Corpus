It will call \"anti-evolutionary fervour\" an \"indictment\" on the Church.\n \n The apology, which has been written by the Rev Dr Malcolm Brown, the Church's director of mission and public affairs, says that Christians, in their response to Darwin's theory of natural selection, repeated the mistakes they made in doubting Galileo's astronomy in the 17th century.\n\n Any move towards ending this absurd storm-in-a-teacup has to be welcome.",

I am neither shackled to a cave of ignorance, nor have I abandoned common sense or critical thinking in order to believe as I do. Ask yourself this, why do we agree with each other in just about every area except for religion if I am steeped in ignorance because of religion, and you are enlightened due to your freedom from religion?\n \n The reality is that God is alive and well and I have met Him personally according to the promises as laid out in the Gospel of Christ. That you and other unbelievers can't see that, speaks to your inability to think critically, not mine. So we must agree to disagree on this issue as we agree on so many others. I don't hold your spiritual blindness against you at all though. I continue to hope that you will evolve to my level of understanding one day and become aware of the truth as I know it to be. :)",
