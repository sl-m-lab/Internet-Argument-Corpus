Case in point. Archie argued that the Earth during creation was \"void and empty\" and wasn't molten as commonly accepted today as an argument against the various heat problems of creationism. Except how did Earth's core and mantle become molten? Remember that we can actually measure the temperatures down there. Logically, his argument makes absolutely no sense. How do you build upon a small point of logic against an opponent who is inherently illogical? \n \n \nAnd if the others challenge your logic, and reason, and you cannot win, then perhaps you must question your logic, or.. your evidence.. or.. your presentation of it.. as I have found.. that no matter\n\n \n So what's your advice if your opponent has a tendency to ignore whatever they don't like and plug their ears saying \"I'm not listening?\" \n \n IMO, you stop even acknowledging that person.
