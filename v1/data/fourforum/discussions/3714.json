I would have thought it was more than that. (That would be 15% of the increase in the defense budget from 2002 to 2003 according to this page:\n http://www.csbaonline.org/4Publications/Archive/U.20020204.2003_Defense_Budge/U.20020204.2003_Defense_Budge.htm\n Titled: \n 2003 Defense Budget Request: Large Increase in Funding, Few Changes to Plans\n \n\n Today, the Bush Administration requested that $396.1 billion be provided for national defense in fiscal year (FY) 2003, including about $379.3 billion for the Department of Defense (DoD) and $16.8 billion for Department of Energy and other defense-related programs. The request is about $45.3 billion higher than the level provided for FY 2002. This would make it the largest single-year increase since the early years of the Reagan administration.\n \n During the 2000 presidential campaign, then-candidate Bush argued that the US military must be transformed to effectively counter the very different kinds of challenges projected to emerge over the next several decades. He also suggested that transforming the US military would require not only investing in new kinds of capabilities, but also reducing investments in some other more traditional types of forces and weapons programs. Notwithstanding these statements, with few exceptions, the administration's new defense plan appears very similar to the defense plan this administration inherited. For example, it would maintain the same number of Army divisions, Air Force fighter wings and Navy aircraft carriers, as called for in the last Clinton plan. And, like the previous plan, the new defense plan, with few exceptions, is focused on the acquisition of traditional kinds of weapons programs, such as tactical fighters, aircraft carriers and heavy artillery systems.\n \n The administration's defense plan includes a number of initiatives to add to or expand existing transformation-related efforts. Some of these initiatives, such as the conversion of four Trident ballistic missile submarines to carry conventional Tomahawk cruise missiles, represent significant changes. But the funding levels provided for these efforts is relatively small compared to the levels provided for some other programs which appear ill-suited to the emerging threat environment.\n \n Perhaps most questionable, is the administration's decision to continue to move ahead with three new tactical fighter programs, whose total costs could exceed $300 billion over then next several decades. This focus on relatively short-range tactical fighters seems at odds with recent experience in Afghanistan and elsewhere which suggests that, in the future, the US military may often have to operate in wartime without access to forward bases. Likewise, the Crusader artillery system seems inconsistent with the goal of having an Army that is light enough to rapidly deploy to regions where the United States does not have easy access to ports and other facilities. \n \n\n I do believe that the crusader (a huge cumbersome howitzer) that was deemed not mobile enough for the new transformed military.\n http://www.army-technology.com/projects/crusader/\n Anyway, this is apples and oranges.\n We are talking about the war on terror which is and should be primarily fought through intellegence gathering and law enforcement agencies. \n So these increases in defense spending are likely not going to the right places, all the while Porter Goss is revamping the CIA to be a tool for the white house.\n http://www.startribune.com/stories/587/5090052.html\n http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/8086\n \n Well, so anyway, if the EPA were totally streamlined and cut their budget in HALF. That would be a pittly $3.5b to throw onto the defense pile. If we totally got rid of the EPA and we went back to acid rain and smog everywhere\n that would be $7 billion dollars to buy a few B2 bombers)\n http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0087.shtml (dems 1998 dollars)",

Figure 50 guards on shift at a time, what do you really think their odds of survival would be in a full scale revolt and break out attempt at a prison. \n \n\n \n In 1992 I was on a hunting trip in Wyoming and one of the party was a manager from a California maximum security prison. A man about middle 40s in age, he had started his career as a line guard and stayed with it. Typical prison career (his words) in that he took a degree and then post-grad degree while employed and used that to climb the civil service ladder.\n \n His comments were eye opening to say the least. This was around a campfire in the middle of nowhere and I can't recall one member of the party that could remotely be referred to as liberal in a social sense, especially after drawing blood with firearms and consuming not a few libations. \n \n Prison guards in a maximum security setting provide window dressing and control mostly automated systems that separate the guards from the\n general prison population. He said we've basically put a fence around a bunch of psychopaths and they do pretty much as they want with little interference from society. Drugs and sex are rampant, drugs smuggled in by guards for small monetary gain and avoidance of threats of bodily harm to their families by outside associates of inmates, with sex according to inmate status, also related to violence. TV, exercise equipment and other 'niceties' are, as mentioned by other posters, replacements for guards in that they reduce thinking and provide a semblance of structure. \n \n Like Daewoo, if I was facing 10-years in one of those places without a professional criminal background, I'd do whatever I could to avoid it. The US has the highest per-capita prison population of all developed countries. Our judicial system long ago reached a point of saturation where a majority of criminal cases are resolved by plea bargaining under federal sentencing guidelines to avoid further clogging of the courts. And we've finally reached a point where it's less expensive to imprison a murderer for life than to execute them, regardless of the nature of the crime, quite a comment on our system of government that we're using armed aggression to instill in other countries.",

   "the death penalty works.\n \n No convicted fellon excecuted by the state of Texas has evr gone on to kill again.\n\n \n Capital Punishment and Deterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas. Authors John Sorenson, Robert Wrinkle, Victoria Brewer, and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997. They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist, it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state. Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas, the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect. The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general, and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates. (45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 (1999)). \n \n Deterrence, Brutalization, and the Death Penalty: Another Examination of Oklahoma\u00d5s Return to Capital Punishment. In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium.
