   "I've noticed more than a few posters here debating the person and not the point.\n \n They seem to be able to remember what every other poster has said in past threads and bring it up to show that they are contradicting themselves.\n \n But really this leaves little room for one to play devil's advocate or defend a position they don't necessarily agree with.\n \n Sometimes I like to play the creationist or the fundamentalist just to see what the arguments against my points are. \n \n It's actually more boring to chase particular posters down and tell them why they are hypocrites than to debate the points they raise in a particular thread.\n \n And it's definitely more boring for the readers who are not familiar with either poster involved in the personal dispute.",

It's quite possible that we could be unaware (at a conscious level) that our reasoning is not as purely impartial as we think.",
