   "Its really simple. They want to kill us. No amount of good intentions or well wishing is going to end it and frankly I don't CARE who did what to whom. It won't matter to the defeatists anyways. They started this and now we are going to FINISH it. Turn the middle east into a modern day DRESDEN, and wipe out the degenerate, backwards civilization that DARED to challenge our supremacy. ESCALATE this conflict! Show our defeatist brothers and sisters that our cause is righteous and, more importantly, realizable! All you have to do to support us is continue to pay your taxes. In a country of 400 million there will always be those with superior wills who are able to staff and operate a powerful military. If we push hard enough, NO ONE will be able to resist us. Before we invaded Iraq, my seniors told me stories that people told them our entire regiment would die. That Iraq was \"ready\" and willing to fight this time. In 2003 the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battlions of the 5th Marine Regiment struck like a lighting bolt and obliterated most of the Iraqi resistance within DAYS. Had it not been for a dehibilitaing Sand Storm in the middle of the operation, we would have crushed them much sooner. As it was, the defeatists and nay-sayers were wrong and my seniors eventually accomplished a mission which was part of a larger strategic victory against Iraq. The Marines are READY to jump to Iran, Syria, Jordan, and the muslim afflicted areas of the phillipines, Malaysia, and indonesia as well. They are ready to disprove the pathetic cynics once again and wipe the enemy that is Islam from face of the earth. If you are between 17 and 28 years old and feel as strongly as we do about the mission consider the Marines. Its hard as hell but you will be at the forefront of the Mission.",

   "What Hitler may or may not have said is immaterial. These are different times and circumstances. I'm attempting to bring to you to the reality (kicking and screaming) that they have declared HOLY WAR on US! Please brother, get that through your head! I will repeat again what I said in the last post. I am doing this for revenge, but I have good reasons for harboring this sentiment, reasons which do not include wanting to be inflammatory or trying to get attention! Their religion, their culture is fundamentally different than ours! THEY DO, AS A PEOPLE, MEAN US HARM. The missing link \"moderate muslim\" does exist, but he is in the vast MINORITY. In the case of Hitler and the jews, Hitler had ONLY rhetoric and a ridiculous conspiracy theory to justify his solution to the \"jewish problem.\" HITLER WAS WRONG AND HE WAS EVIL! However, the threat from Islam is REAL brother! IT IS THEY WHO, LIKE HITLER, WANT TO IRADICATE US AND THE JEWS! OPEN YOUR EYES BROTHER!Again, read Al Qu'ran for yourself and see that this is a SYSTEMIC PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELIGION/CULTURE! The defeatist media has convinced everyone that they're just like us, good peace loving counterparts to christians/buddhists/mormons etc and they defend this view point by never defending it AT ALL. They want you to take them at their word! I am telling you once again : READ THE AL QU'RAN FOR YOURSELF! And then read scholars' views on it! Educate yourself and I am confident you will begin to see how menacing they are! Now you may never agree with me that they need to be wiped out, but at least you'll be in a position to take action based on an enlightened point of view!\n\n \n So, the actions of some groups of radical muslims (no different than the radical christians we see today even in the US) are justification for wiping out muslims? Somehow it makes us less evil than Hitler to wipe out over 1.4 billion people (much more than what Hitler did)? You are one sick :xcensored .\n \n And yes, most are peace-loving counterparts to christians(not that all christians are like that - you and Archie being prime examples)/buddhists/mormons/wiccans, etc. - I happen to know quite a few.",

Using a few out of context passages to justify annihilating an entire people is undefensible and MONSTROUS. I GET IT. This is what I've been getting at this whole time though Sym, its NOT just a few passages that have minor significance but rather, holy war is a FEATURE of Islam. It is CODIFIED in Al Qu'ran and what we are seeing now is a NATURAL EXTENSION of the culture that such a horrific religion creates. Judiasm IS NOT EQUAL to Islam. Just because they are both referred to as \"religions\" doesn't make them \"basically the same\" in a touchy, feely, kind of way. If the Torah DID require Jews as A CONDITION of their religion to make Holy War on the rest of the unbelieving world that would be something VERY different. But you see, the Torah imposes NO SUCH CONDITION. You need to come to grips with the fact that some things are EVIL. Some things are BAD. You can only run away from them for so long. Get your head out of the sand brother! This talk of a peaceful, moderate Muslim majority is nonsense, and has been long before 9/11. So to answer your question totally honestly, yes, his problem was that his killings were unjustified, not that they were some how, a priori, wrong in of themselves. We can and will defend ourselves, and if we are pushed far enough, enduring constant attacks from those who MAKE IT CLEAR they seek our destruction and subjegation we will end the conflict PERMANENTLY.\n \n To \"Shadowpicachu\":\n \n \n And your rhetoric and ridiculous conspiracy theories\n to justify your \"solution\" to the \"Muslim problem\" is different, how, exactly?\n\n \n These aren't conspirarcy theories. Read Al Qu'ran.\n \n \nYou make me sick.\n\n \n Take some Keflex. I hear it cures cliches. \n \n \nSo, the actions of some groups of radical muslims (no different than the radical christians we see today even in the US) are justification for wiping out muslims? Somehow it makes us less evil than Hitler to wipe out over 1.4 billion people (much more than what Hitler did)? You are one sick .?\n\n \n I would submit to you that if we launched a nuclear missle and it wiped out Dublin, and the entire United states of America was cheering and holding signs praising their leaders and urging them to commit more atrocites, and that further more it was written in the Constitution of these fictional United States that we should commit these acts on the behalf of some malignant god named halla, you would be a FOOL, if you lived in this fictional version of Dublin, Ireland to think that it was just an isolated incident perpetrated by a few \"radicals.\" ALL OF THEM ARE RADICALS. GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE SAND. Havent you been watching the news? \n \n Oh and before I leave I just have to demolish this little Gem:\n \n \nAh, yeah, what were we americans thinking of? \n Hitler said the same things about the Jews, about their inequality, etc.\n \n\n \n You're missing the point and committing a kind of logical fallacy(equivocation, amphiboly, blah blah I'm too lazy to google it), sufficed to say what I mean by Inequality is that their RELIGION is not \"equal\" (READ : DIFFERENT, VERY DIFFERENT) to that of christianity, buddhism, shintoism etc. Not that the PRACTIONERS of that religion are, AS PEOPLE, not equal/inferior, merely that their religion is very different, or not created equal if you like. But now that we're on the subject let me say that NO MAN IS CREATED EQUAL EITHER!\n \n And how is it all you \"defenders of the non-existent muslim moderates\" are so well versed in Hitlerian? Nevermind, I think I can already guess your rebuttals to this one : \"Oh uh, ....OF COURSE I read Mein Kampf! It was..uh.. so that I would know the mind of an evil man and to know what not to do!\" or maybe even \"I don't have to respond to that! You're a meanie who's scaring me by presenting me with the reality that I may have to fight! Mommy said fighting never solves anything!\" Sorry, but seriously, its time to face facts.\n \n \nAnd yes, most are peace-loving counterparts to christians(not that all christians are like that - you and Archie being prime examples)/buddhists/mormons/wiccans, etc. - I happen to know quite a few.\n\n \n Now on to this nonsense of you having lots of muslim friends. QUIT LYING. Seriously, you don't have to have lots of friends who are black, white, brown, yellow or who believe in buddha, jesus, or the Qu' ran to make an argument valid. I don't really care that you don't have any Muslim friends, but really wish that you did so you could really \"stick it to me.\" All I care about is whether you have ACTUALLY read Al Qu'ran yet. Get to it brother and let me know what you think. \n \n \n \n P.S. - And in the future, you should realize that employing the ole' Politically Correct saw of the equality thing doesn't work on me. I've read WAY too much Nietzsche. Thats not an arrogant brush off, I'm just letting you know that if you want these PC Bumper sticker like accusations to stick you're going to have to be a heck of a lot more convincing. Go Fish...",

History has proven otherwise...\n \n\n \n Your Sources and your argument please.\n \n \n \nYou're the one to talk about being disingenious.\n \n Let's take a look at some of the things you attribute to Islam:\n \n - religious intolerance and politics not necessarily separated from religion.\n \n Apparently you missed the fact that the same applies to Christianity in the US\n \n - subjugation of women\n \n If you think that here in the West women are equal to men, you're a fool.\n \n - barbaric punishments for crime and moral laxity\n \n Did they get rid of the death penalty in the US? And how about those punishments for polygamy...\n \n - suicide bombing as an instrument of policy\n\n \n \n I didn't know that all Muslim countries had armies consisting of suicide bombers...\n\n \n They do. Go on CNN's website and start sifting through footage of HEZBOLLAH'S parades through Lebanon and Syria. See those guys with fake Dynamite marching along like XXXXXX? Yeah, like I said before they DO. The Shia's especially are known for this tactic. To them, the words of their prophets and Imams is HOLY WRIT. Don't believe me? Go google \"Shia\" and start digging. Also this is not exclusive to the Shia sect. Sunnis are using these tactics in Fallujah and Baghdad EVERY DAY. And, on a side note, take it from someone who KNOWS, these things are doozies!\n \n \n Now, on to the main point: \n This is nothing more than a massive comittal of the TU QUOQUE fallacy. You claim that \"we do it too\" so therefore James point is somehow invalidated or \"BS.\" It makes no difference if we were pure and angelic or if we ourselves were WORSE than those whom we are discussing (namely the Muslims, as influenced, necessarily, by their most holy text Al Qu'ran), in so far as his point is that \"Hey, they're VALUES differ radically from ours and because of that they DO this. Wake UP.\" Again let me echo this: WAKE UP. The Muslim problem is SYSTEMIC. Its not isolated psychopaths suffering from scizophrenic dillusions. ITS CODIFIED AS A PART OF THEIR RELIGION! Like I have told you atleast 10 times : READ AL QU'RAN AND THE OTHER RELEVANT HOLY TEXTS AND THEIR ANALYSIS. Moving on...\n \n \nVictory is a bunch of dead people lying around and rotting, I take it.\n \n Who should the dead people be?\n \n It depends upon the person who is screaming for \"Victory!\"\n\n \n Defeatist, Cynical, Nihilistic nonsense. \n \n How many times do I have to say this? The rotting dead people are, on one side, soldiers and Marines who VOLUNTEERED to fight, and on the other side, scared, cowed, pathetic, weak foreign fighters whos fight VOLUNTARILY for their Global Jihad.\n \n There IS NO dictator screaming at the top of his lungs while weeping conscripts with only a few weeks of training trudge by. I am an ex-marine now BEGGING YOU to let us FIGHT! If I knew we were going into Syria or Iran I would re-up this INSTANT. And so we're clear, VICTORY is going to involve the dissolution of an entire dysfunctional civilization. It involves a lot more than Dead bodies, although that certainly figures prominently into my solution. That isn't the ONLY way to do it though. However, I would argue that by not physically fighting and ending this once and for all, we are prolonging the conflict which will result in the deaths of a great many more civilians lives and enormous damage to our everyday lives, economically speaking. \n \n Moving on...\n \n Symbiote:\n \n \nLiberty in the western world is increasingly a joke, when the US institutes \"free speech zones\", Europe jails people for \"holocaust denial\", taxation, inflation and general government attempts to control the economy and specific industries are on the rise. Meanwhile \"suspected terrorists\" or people suspected of in some way aiding terrorists are held without charge for periods of 5+ years in Guantanamo Bay, and typically only get trials (Oh I'm sorry, not real trials, but military tribunals hearing their cases) after mounting political pressure forces the issue.\n \n\n \n We're agreed on this, however my point is that this trend is not (yet) CODIFIED as part of a religion, which Muslims LITERALLY WORSHIP. Although I guess you could argue that some rulings of the supreme court and certainly some of the laws put in by [insert a President's name here] do, in a sense CODIFY this trend, my point is that it is NOT CONSCIOUSLY done for the sake of taking away our freedoms. Our government short-sightedly views these things as necessary sacrifices. Also, and most importantly, we do not (yet) view the INITIATION of the use of force against another nation or people as a good. It MAY have been done, but again, it was always justified or rammed down our throats at a time of crisis. The Muslim viewpoint holds ALL THE WORLD THAT DOES NOT BELIEVE IN ISLAM AS A CRISIS WORTHY OF INITIATING THE USE OF FORCE. Don't believe me? FOR THE 11TH TIME, GO READ AL QU'RAN!\n \n \n Moving on...\n \n James:\n \n \nNobody, in his senses, advocates \"killing ALL Muslims\" - for whatever reason.\n\n \n I do advocate such a killing, and for good reason, but I'm open to hearing another solution as long as it doesn't involve a prolonged, and misdirected \"War On Terror\" that will last far beyond our Grandchildren's lifetime.\n \n \nSo if western liberty is a \"bad joke\", I assume you have a more worthy political ideal in mind that we should aspire to? Civil liberties are very precious, but it is sanctimonious nonsense to pretend that they should never be sacrificed to security. Only the just constraints of morality and law make liberty possible. \n\n \n 110% correct. However, I should add the caveat that such constraints on Human Behavior by Morality and law (which is how I read it) which are added temporarily must be distinguished by those Human Behaviors which are considered Mala in Se. I think you would agree for example, that there is no reason for a temporary suspension of Habeus Corpus to last till the end of a civilization or nation, once inacted. We must make temporary sacrifices (where necessary), execute the mission, and relinquish those liberties back to the people, who are, afterall, the reason for sacrificing ourselves (as military men acting within the confines of that mission where necessary) in the first place.\n \n Moving on...\n \n \nI'm not saying that the Islamic theocrats are nice people, far from it, they're scum, but don't be fooled in thinking that we're any better. The only difference is that the theocrats oppress their own people and the West oppresses other people.\n\n \n If you really were informed and believed that Islamic theocrats were scum you would be arguing about a solution to the problems which these theocrats explicitly and DIRECTLY pose to our way of life, instead of commiting another TU QUOQUE fallacy. I don't think any of us care that you think we're \"just as bad in the west\" as the muslims are because of \"imperialism.\" The issue before us is a practical one, not trying to see who's better. They threaten and kill us, and now we need a solution. Think before you write. Also, READING AL QU'RAN (for the 12TH time) would be a good idea before you decide to post again.\n \n Moving on...\n \n \nSo if there was a passage in the Torah interpretable as demanding violence of Jews, Hitler would be a good guy?\n\n \n No.\n \n \nRight, according to you, even babies born to muslims are deserving of death, they're EVIL because of where they happen to be born.\n\n \n Babies aren't mature enough to believe in anything so, no, babies born to muslims are NOT deserving of death. \n \n \nI would submit to you that if we launched a war on Iraq and Aghanistan, and the entire United states of America was cheering and holding signs praising their leaders and urging them to commit more atrocites, and that further more it was written in the laws of these United States that we should commit these acts on the behalf of some malignant god named \"democracy\", you would be a FOOL, if you lived in this Middle East, to think that it was just an isolated incident perpetrated by a few \"radicals.\" ALL AMERICANS ARE RADICALS. GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE SAND. Havent you been watching the news? ALL AMERICANS SHOULD BE NERVE GASSED\" ~ quote from Islamic version of Tanstaafl, you are the same.\n\n \n Again with the TU QUOQUE fallacies. The point hinges on the fact that they INITIATED and praised the use of force, not that we may or may not be doing the same thing. I am not trying to be the \"better man.\" I am not interested in having my cake and eating it too. I fully realize that annihilating Mecca in a pillar of atomic destruction and wiping out the insects will make us look bad. Oh well. This is a practical problem and I only have to establish that they have aggressed against us and that the vast majority of people are ongoingly complicit with whatever their leaders have planned for us. Also, another primary problem with your argument by the way, is that our \"launch[ing] a war on Iraq and Aghanistan, and the entire United states of America ... cheering and holding signs praising their leaders and urging them to commit more atrocites, and that further more it was written in the laws of these United States\" came AFTER their attacks. We are the defenders, they are the aggressors. End of story. We have the moral highground, for what its worth to you. You can sleep now.\n \n \nYes, killing people because of what they believe (or what you think they believe) is bad.\n\n \n Unless what they believe is evil and they believe it willingly, and act on it CONSTANTLY every hour of every day - literally. Again READ AL QU'RAN AND ALL RELEVANT TEXTS for the 13TH TIME!\n \n Educate yourselves!",

   "The comments I've read here are not surprising...on either side of the question. The OP exposes numerous truths about the goal of Islamo-facists (radical Muslims).\n \n It is not that all Muslims are bad. It's just the cancerous ideals of a few that drive the hatred between us.\n \n Not only do I suggest reading about the Muslim religion, I suggest a study of the origin (in Egypt) of Al Queada and how the influence on Osama Bin Laden of another nutcase radical Muslim activated a belief in their camp that all infidels should convert or die.\n \n What many people in many relatively peaceful countries fail to realize is that all cultures do not think rationally. It is NOT GOING TO HAPPEN that appeasement, a handshake and a nice cup of tea will cause the RMs (Radical Muslims) to change their minds and agree to live alongside us 'infidels' in peace. One cannot negotiate with these people. This appraoch (the tea party) may seem rational to two non-theocracies in settling a land dispute, but it will not work with irrational goons who scream, shoot in the air and praise Allah for the non-existent virgins they believe to await them after they die for the cause.\n \n Is there any among you that denies the stated goal of radical Islam is to wipe out the rest of the world? Is there any among you that are so obstinately stupid as to believe we can talk our way out of this? Is there anyone so blind as to think withdrawal from Iraq will make things hunky dory with the radical Muslims? I know...Osama has said we should get out. He's also said he is pushing for the destruction of the Western (the non-Islamic) world.\n \n I thank every serviceman who has aided in this battle, both in the field and in support venues. I am saddened by deaths on both sides (except for those of the radical Muslims) and I do wish that the fighting would stop. Unfortunately, when one small mass of people live under the 14th century tribal beliefs that killing EVERYBODY ELSE is God's will and that they will be rewarded for doing so, there's no solution for the peaceful side other than to kill all radical Muslims...and their children!\n \n Kill emoticon_xkill all radical Muslims and those who support them!!!!!",

Oh wait, thats right, IT HASN'T. \n \n In fact the path Israel has followed, or has been forced to follow by the UN, has been appeasment and it dosen't work. The Muslims have made it clear that they seek global Jihad on the world. Get your head out of the sand. Muslim prosperity only means better armed, better fed jihadists. This is the kind of pseudomarxist materialist #### that only holds us back. The argument goes \"Oh if only they had what we had\" or \"If only they had more than they have now things would get better!\" \n \n God, this is so Naive.\n \n You have to look at why they're poor in the first place....you know what? Im forgetting myself. This is pointless. No matter how many bombings, no matter how many 747's crash into buildings, no matter how many british oil caches get set on fire, the marxists/materialists will always point to some marginal lack of something relative to us having lots of. This is about revenge and VICTORY. The issue of real poverty and starvation is a serious topic, however no amount of appeasing Muslims with food, medicine and whatever else is going to stop Jihad. It is part of their religion; part of their culture. They will ever strive to act on it. Get your head out of the sand AND READ AL QU'RAN FOR THE 14TH TIME!",
