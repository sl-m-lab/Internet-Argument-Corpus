Riot police detained gay rights activists as they tried to present a petition asking Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who has called gay marches satanic acts, to lift a ban on the parade. Nationalists and extreme Russian Orthodox believers held icons and denounced homosexuality as \"evil\" while a group of thick-set young men turned up with surgeon's masks, which they said would protect them from the \"gay disease.\" \"We are defending our rights,\" said a young gay man named Alexey, with blood pouring out of his nose after he was beaten up by a man screaming \"homosexuals are perverts\" opposite the mayor's office. His attacker was detained. \"This is terrible but I am not scared. This is a pretty scary place, a pretty scary country if you are gay. But we won't give up until they allow us our rights,\" he said. Hundreds of riot police lined Tverskaya street in central Moscow and plain-clothes police mingled with a large number of foreign and Russian journalists. Parade organizer Nikolai Alexeyev told Reuters by telephone from a police station that about 20 people had been detained, a figure confirmed by police. \"We are sitting in the police station right now. We were detained outside the mayor's office when we tried to present the petition,\" said Alexeyev.\"",

   "It's worth noting that the anti-gay violence in Russia is frequently promoted by priests of the Orthodox church there. I guess they miss beating up Jews in pogroms. There is something particularly malign in the atmosphere of ex-Communist Eastern Europe that makes most of those countries very hostile to gay people compared with Western Europe, where civil unions and even marriage in some cases are the rule more than the exception.\n \n I am not sure why this is, whether it's just the result of an authoritarian mindset inculcated by years of dictatorship, or whether it's the religious rebound that's involved, or some other cause, but I feel a lot of sympathy for gays in the ex-Communist nations. I don't really fear anything similar will happen in the US, but I can understand the nervousness and need for eternal vigilance.",
