When the statute was enacted, what did marriage mean? That is what the court should have looked for, and that is what they did look for. They never suggested that the legal definition of marriage ought to remain the same in 2006 as it did in 1909. All they said was that there was nothing since the statute's enactment (i.e., no revision to the law) that would justify the court in holding that the legal definition of the word marriage has changed in the law since 1909. This, by the way, does not seem to be a controversial point in this case, as the court noted that no party (i.e., not one of the forty-four plaintiffs) had challenged that construction of the Domestic Relations Law.\n \n \nWhat floors me even more is that they continue to mention that domestic relations law restricts all sorts of other types of relationships, including incest, but it does not exclude same-sex couples, YET they continue to say that the welfare of children is the primary concern of marriage.\n\n I'm not sure where they said the bolded part.

That may seem worse to you, but that may only be due to an inherent fear of the rule of law. The law is what it is. If you don't like it, have it changed the right way.

The court's ruling isn't really about protecting the children of straight couples, but it does harm the children of gay couples. Gay couples will continue to have children reagardless of whether or not the state recognizes their relationship as a marriage or not. Depriving committed couples with children the benefits of marriage will by no means help those children, it can only harm them. What the court seems to fail to realize is that having kids and being married are by no means coupled any more. They may have been some scores of years ago, but they certainly aren't any more. People, gay and straight, have kids out of wedlock, parents break up, divorces happen. If the purpose of marriage, and marriage benefits, is to provide a stable envirnment for kids then it's failed, leaving the court's argument baseless. But if marriage benefits do help a family then that help should be extended to all families. Because the families already exist, gay and straight.",

Apparently, the NY court is utterly unaware of the fact that gay people were quite explicitly mentioned in the criminal code. ahem\n\n They absolutely reached the merits. The challenge was that New York's Domestic Relations law - which limited marriage to opposite sex couples - violated the New York State constitution. The Court took the issue squarely, holding that it did not.\n \n Also, your apparent objection to the court's construing the Domestic Relations law to exlude same sex couples is simply not correct. This is evidenced by the fact that none of the 44 plaintiffs challenged this construction. Zero. And we can be sure that these plaintiffs were made up of people who really, really, really, really want gay marriage to be the law of the land. Either these plaintiffs' attornies are incompetent, or the argument that the domestic relations law included same sex couples is a really, really, really, really bad argument.\n \n \nSecond, they decided that having sincere beliefs is enough to qualify them as \"rational\". It speculated, not found but speculated, that a future legislature could \"rationally\" believe that encouraging marriage between irresponsible, fornicating heterosexuals was so important that banning marriage between same-sex individuals was an OK tactic. ahem\n\n Right, a future legislature could determine that, since sexual relationships between opposite sex couples often lead to the birth of children, that it is best to encourage those relationships to last. Hence, it confers the benefits of marriage. If that is the reason why it would confer benefits (i.e., to encourage those engaging in a sexual relationship that could result in child birth to remain committed to one another), it need not confer those benefits to same sex couples sharing a sexual relationship because such a relationship will never result in the birth of children. In other words, the legislature can make a value choice. They can choose to endorse opposite sex relationships over same sex relationships for the simple reason that opposite sex relationships lead to child birth much more frequently than same sex relationships do.\n \n \nAnd those two absurd points are the MAIN points of the decision. THAT is bizarre.\n\n Actually, I do not think the two points mentioned above are the main points of the decision. Your first point was not even part of the constitutional challenge. I think a much more important point is the decision to evaluate the merits on a rational basis standard rather than an intermediate scrutiny or strict strutiny standard.

   "You -- because you LIKE the decision -- are glossing over its obvious absurdity.\n\n I honestly do not care about what happens in New York on this issue. I am only happy that the decision remains where it should...with the individual states. I am, however, interested in how the New York court handled the case as I anticipate that there will be many more state courts addressing the issue.\n \n By the way, how would you feel if the Federal Courts decided to take up this issue?\n \n \nThe reason rational review is applied is because of the absurd reading of NY legal history towards gay people as being without animus. It is illogical and strikingly dishonest. AND IT'S OBVIOUS THAT IT IS.\n\n I was under the impression that rational review was applied because the statute did not \"...restric[t] the exercise of a fundamental right, one that is\n 'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,'\" nor did it involve limitations based on a suspect class as determined by the Equal Protection decisions. This seems to have nothing to do with NY legal history. In other words, whatever the legal history of NY toward gay people, did it ever involve the adoption of a constitutional amendment that invalidated a traditional definition of marriage?\n \n \nAs for your claim that many states have come to similar conclusions as this court, that is not true at all in the finding about reigning in the rutting heteros.\n\n What I meant was that many states have come to the conclusion that marriage should be restricted to opposite sex relationships. There are a number of reasons for this, and the court discussed two that satisfy rational basis in New York. It is true that the more prevalent view has to do with states wanting to endorse/encourage lasting opposite sex relationships because they feel it is a better environment for child raising. It only takes one rational reason, by the way, to satisfy rational basis review. It is, in the end, a policy preference that, since it does not involve a right deeply rooted in our nation's history, or discrimination based on race or sex, the legislature is allowed to make.\n \n \nYou point out that the plaintiffs didn't address some of the court's issues. Well, duh. They're ABSURD. No one would have imagined such blatent disregard for the honor of the court coming from the court.\n \n Read the dissent.\n\n I have read the dissent.

Gay couples will continue to have children reagardless of whether or not the state recognizes their relationship as a marriage or not. Depriving committed couples with children the benefits of marriage will by no means help those children, it can only harm them. What the court seems to fail to realize is that having kids and being married are by no means coupled any more. They may have been some scores of years ago, but they certainly aren't any more. People, gay and straight, have kids out of wedlock, parents break up, divorces happen. If the purpose of marriage, and marriage benefits, is to provide a stable envirnment for kids then it's failed, leaving the court's argument baseless. But if marriage benefits do help a family then that help should be extended to all families. Because the families already exist, gay and straight.\n\n \n Good points.

The term sodomite was used as an identity, as were other terms, to refer to certain men, even by simply look or mannerisms. Sometimes it was not known if they were taking any action, or those thought to be sodomites, etc., were actually only engaging in hetero activity and identified as heteros, just like today.

Saying that prejudice and morality can be intermixed simply because morality happens to be subjective doesn't follow, because there is a clear difference between the concept of prejudice and concept of morality. Prejudice is an oppressive force, and morality is generally altrusitic (to varying degrees, depending on one's morality). That's my view anyway.\n \n \nYour revisionist history is completly wrong here. I have no idea where you got these notions.\n \n Here's a few major authors who wrote about gays in the late 18th century:\n http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/case3.html\n \n According to Wikipedia the term homosexual was coined in 1869\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology_of_homosexuality\n \n Here's an article about how German police kept lists of gays since 1900\n http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/hms/homosbklt.pdf\n \n Here's an article about \"sex reform\" around the turn of the century.\n http://www.newint.org/issue201/politics.htm\n \n This is 5 minutes of research, there's tons more out there. Everyone knew about gays, it was common knowledge. People wrote books about them, politicians argued about them. It's very similar to today, only the terminology is different. So this idea of yours that there was no \"gay\" or \"heterosexual\" back than is factually wrong.\n\n \n That doesn't prove anything other than society knew there was a contingent of people who preferred same-sex relationships. Doesn't do anything to prove they understood the concept of sexual orientation and being gay. So thanks for reinforcing my view that society's beef was over a behavioral issue (morality).",

   "This seems to me to be standard statutory construction. When the statute was enacted, what did marriage mean? That is what the court should have looked for, and that is what they did look for. They never suggested that the legal definition of marriage ought to remain the same in 2006 as it did in 1909. All they said was that there was nothing since the statute's enactment (i.e., no revision to the law) that would justify the court in holding that the legal definition of the word marriage has changed in the law since 1909. This, by the way, does not seem to be a controversial point in this case, as the court noted that no party (i.e., not one of the forty-four plaintiffs) had challenged that construction of the Domestic Relations Law. \n\n \n Irrelevant.

You wanted them to follow what was \"actually stated\" in the Domestic Relations Law (DRL). Ok, let's give that a try.\n \n \nThere is no restrictions to same-sex couples getting married under the Domestic Relations Law, and they admit to that. So instead they go to what they think the original framers intended.\n\n \n But, there is also no explicit mention in the DRL that same-sex couples are authorized to marry. If the court were to hold that it did, they would not be following what was actually stated.\n \n Secondly, if they were to follow what was \"actually stated,\" I think that they would be forced to the conclusion that the meaning of the word \"marriage\" in the DRL was unintelligible. So far as I could tell, the word \"marriage\" is not defined at all in the DRL (I actually read through the DRL in my spare time). Thus, rather than holding that same-sex couples were authorized to marry under the DRL, the court would have to say that no one is authorized to marry under the DRL.\n \n Finally, I would simply point out what I said in this post: that the court was unanimous (6-0) on this point: that the DRL restricts marriage to opposite sex couples.\n \n Now, you have said that the opinion in this case was \"quite bizarre.\" Well I think that adopting an interpretation that says the legislature had nothing in mind when it used the word \"marriage\" in the DRL is quite bizarre.\n \n \nI apparently cannot higlight sections of the pdf and copy/paste them here. But they do mention that, all else being equal, intuition suggests that a mother and father household would be the best environment for raising children.\n\n There's a little button on the toolbar (where the save, print, search, etc. buttons are) that says \"select.\" That should allow you to do it. I must confess that it is rather hard for me to address this point because I don't know what it is that your are talking about.\n \n \nIn other words, since same-sex couples do not \"naturally\" have children, they do not need the protections of marriage as opposed to opposite sex couples. I guess because many (not all) same-sex couples plan when they have children, they do not need the encouragement of marriage that opposite sex couples do.\n \n I guess they decided to ignore the biological children of gay people (since all gay people apparently adopt). They obviously do not need the protection marriage.\n\n There is nothing in the NY constitution that prohibits the legislature from making a value choice; from deciding to promote one lifestyle over another, especially when the legislature believes that lifestyle x is a better situation for children than lifestyle y. You may not like that. It may be a bad idea. But it is not for the court to insert its own beliefs about what are good ideas to do. That is a legislator's role.\n \n \nIf that is what they wanted to do, then that is what they should have done. But they decided to pull all sort of excuses out of their nether-regions to justify their decision BEFORE deferring to the legislature.

I don't think people should be hurt, and if that's what happens to anyone not getting couple's benefits, then it's wrong. However, the argument that it hurts gay people to not give them marriage benefits it tenuous because it could be made for ANYONE not getting marriage benefits. It probably hurts people to not get marriage benefits who want to marry in groups (polygamy). It probably \"hurts\" people who want to marry underage. Or single people who want to co-habitate. So if you're going to take the stance that gays are being imposed on, then to be consistent you need to fight for ANYONE being imposed on by not getting marriage benefits. Imposition is imposition. That's why this ultimately always goes back to what marriage is--if it's going to not be an opposite-sex institution, then it's going to need to be an anything-goes institution unless you want someone, somewhere being imposed on. And so your claims that you don't want people imposed on ring pretty hypocritically hollow because you're going to get imposition no matter what, unless marriage benefits are given to any arrangement that comes along.",

I started with the generally excepted moral principle and reached a conclusion from it. It seems pretty obvious to me how I got from A to B, but if you don't get it I can fill you in on the steps. I'm emphatically not just saying \"I think this so you should follow it\". I'm starting from a basic principle and applying reason to it to reach a justifiable conclusion. I've never seen anyone attempt to do the same to support an anti-gay policy.\n You take a generally accepted moral principle? You assume others accept that! People don't have to accept your moral code as the one and only. If you moral code only says \"don't hurt others\" and you believe not allowing gays to marry is hurting them than that conclusion would follow very easy. However, you make two judgements on your part. One, that \"don't hurt others\" is high enough on the moral chain for all people to override a belief against gay rights. Two, you make the assumption that people believe that not allowing gays to marry is actually hurting them. So you back it up based on your own beliefs..that is fine...you aren't a hypocrite atleast, however, you can't apply this to everyone else.\n \n \n\n What you call \"my\" code is the basis for every moral system that's stood the test of time. I didn't just make it up, it's the one that we actually use. It's the one that society has adopted because it works. Do you disagree with it? Do you think hurting people is fine and that helping people should be frowned upon? Somehow I don't think so.\n See above for an explanation. A moral code is probaby not going to be as simple as \"don't hurt others\". If your moral code goes 1) Obey God (christian) 2) don't hurt others than (assuming not allowing gay marriage hurts gays) obeying God will override don't hurt others. \n \n So what you are doing is taking your belief on morals and saying we have to live by that...but who says thats bad ;)",

   "Other people are free to do what they want. But for many religious people, certain actions are wrong (\"sinful\"). It's not about who does them, it's about the action. You might as well be asking why I should think it's wrong for OTHER people to tell lies, instead of just knowing it's wrong for me to do so.\n\n \n Okay, but there are compelling reasons why there is a general agreement among all people, that telling lies is wrong. No one wants to be deceived. Therefore, one should convert to your specific religion, in the case of the belief that sexual relations among gays is wrong, but that shouldn't be put on society, in terms of laws. \n \n \nAs I've made clear here before, I think keeping couples' benefits away from gay couples is not a good thing. I don't think people should be hurt, and if that's what happens to anyone not getting couple's benefits, then it's wrong. However, the argument that it hurts gay people to not give them marriage benefits it tenuous because it could be made for ANYONE not getting marriage benefits. It probably hurts people to not get marriage benefits who want to marry in groups (polygamy). It probably \"hurts\" people who want to marry underage. Or single people who want to co-habitate.\n\n \n Using the same logic, doesn't giving couples benefits, without marriage, to gay and straight couples, probably hurt polygamists too, and hurt single people who just want to co-habitate, but don't want to register for as a couple? Wouldn't it hurt those who want to get couples benefits for their underage partner?\n \n \nSo if you're going to take the stance that gays are being imposed on, then to be consistent you need to fight for ANYONE being imposed on by not getting marriage benefits. Imposition is imposition. That's why this ultimately always goes back to what marriage is--if it's going to not be an opposite-sex institution, then it's going to need to be an anything-goes institution unless you want someone, somewhere being imposed on. And so your claims that you don't want people imposed on ring pretty hypocritically hollow because you're going to get imposition no matter what, unless marriage benefits are given to any arrangement that comes along.\n\n \n It's fair enough your point about imposition being imposition. However, you make it seem like the only choice is your imposition of different-sex couples and excluding gay couples. We have the choice of including both gay couples and straight couples in marriage. If we can impose it for straight couples only, we can impose it for gay and straight couples only.",

   "Wow I guess if 2/3 and 3/4 forths is not a majority then what is it a cow?\n\n In the American system, it is blurring a clear and important line to say that a Constitutional Amendment passes with the vote of a majority, because that only implies that it was passed by over 50%, when in fact the Constitutional Amendment process is designed in such a way that it would require much more than 50% + the smallest amount.\n \n \nWhich brings me back to my point about a group getting together to have another group killed.

I have said the only people who I have ever heard want a vote on marriage or even have marriage run through the legislature are those who are anti gay. So when I read your statements that you are gald the court kicked the marriage back to the legislature then I can only assume you are anti gay and anti gay people believe in oppression and discrimination. You have not made any claims to the contrary so my assumtion holds. This is an assumtion not a strawman.\n\n Let me clear this up. I am glad the court deferred to the legislature in this case, not because I support opression and discrimination, but because I respect the rule of law. In this case the law required that the court defer to the legislature, and that is what they did.\n \n To further alleviate any doubt, if the law had required the court to overrule the legislature (and extend marriage to same-sex couples), then I would be glad that the court did so. In other words, I don't support court decisions only when they favor my policy preferences.\n \n \nYou know this is like a doctor saying he will treat the person and not the disease. I think it is very relevant. How can you discuss a law and not its effects? I asked you a simple question were do you stand on this issue? Is there a reason you won't make you position clear? Untill you do my assumtion must stand.\n\n I have already stated why my personal opinion on this issue has no bearing on the question at hand: did the New York Appeals Court decide the case correctly?

I can support that as long as those past breeding age and those that can not have children are also excluded from marriage. I suggest fertility tests and proof of consumation be kept on record at the court house. Also those who are married and their children grow up or they go past the age of breeding must have their marriages ended. If as they say marriage is the bedrock of society for the production of children I see no use in two 70 year olds being allowed to marry or remain married.

Top Court Rules Against Gay Marriage\" so we can discuss the rulling, gay marriage, or the effect of the ruling.\n\n You can discuss what you like, but that does not mean it is on-topic. I would explain this, but it would be awkward for the person insiting that the thread remain on-topic to then proceed to take it off-topic.\n \n \nThe courts ruling was based upon the effects of gay marriage on children. So Phyllis, Answer me this;why does society allow couples who can't have children to get married or couples in their 70's and 80's to get married but won't let gay people get married? Last I looked I haven't seen too many pregnant 70 year old women. If as the court ruled marriage is about children then none of these groups should not be allowed to get married.\n\n Why does society allow it? Why does society allow anything? Because it wants to.\n \n Just one quick question as well: Have you read the court's opinion in its entirety?",

   "That's the bit that doesn't make sense to me. Your statement, and the legal argument, assumes that getting married is some sort of prerequisite to having children. IE, you get married, then you have kids. Therefore if you don't want gays to raise kids, don't let them get married. The problem is that it doesn't work that way. Gays already have kids, they already are in families. The families already exist, and will continue to exist regardless of the marital state of the adults involved. So if the benefits in question are there to help families then denying them to gays isn't helping kids at all, it's directly hurting them.\n\n \n I think you keep on missing how the court decides this. The judge doesn't have to be convinced that children are better off in straight homes...they just have to be convinced that someone could reasonably believe that(ie this is not just out of hate). It is the job of the legislature to determine if the evidence is meaningful or not.\n \n In other words, you are taking it farther than a judge can go.",

Let's take as a working assumption (which I think is wrong, but leave that aside for now) that kids are better off in straight homes. How is this ruling supposed to help with that? You don't need to be married to have kids. Gays can't get married in most of the country, but they still have kids, and if they continue to be denied the right to marriage they will still continue to have kids. We're not talking about adoption laws or rules concerning artificial insemination here, we're talking about marriage. Straights tend to assume that if you want kids you'll get married first, but if you're forbidden to marry than you don't make that connection. If a gay couple want children they'll get them, even if they aren't married. So denying them the right to marry won't keep them from raising children, all it will do is make the task harder.
