   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/20/opinion/20marsh.html\n \n January 20, 2006\n Op-Ed Contributor\n Wayward Christian Soldiers \n By CHARLES MARSH\n Charlottesville, Va.\n IN the past several years, American evangelicals, and I am one of them, have amassed greater political power than at any time in our history. But at what cost to our witness and the integrity of our message?\n \n Recently, I took a few days to reread the war sermons delivered by influential evangelical ministers during the lead up to the Iraq war. That period, from the fall of 2002 through the spring of 2003, is not one I will remember fondly. Many of the most respected voices in American evangelical circles blessed the president's war plans, even when doing so required them to recast Christian doctrine. \n \n Charles Stanley, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Atlanta, whose weekly sermons are seen by millions of television viewers, led the charge with particular fervor. \"We should offer to serve the war effort in any way possible,\" said Mr. Stanley, a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention. \"God battles with people who oppose him, who fight against him and his followers.\" In an article carried by the convention's Baptist Press news service, a missionary wrote that \"American foreign policy and military might have opened an opportunity for the Gospel in the land of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.\" \n \n As if working from a slate of evangelical talking points, both Franklin Graham, the evangelist and son of Billy Graham, and Marvin Olasky, the editor of the conservative World magazine and a former advisor to President Bush on faith-based policy, echoed these sentiments, claiming that the American invasion of Iraq would create exciting new prospects for proselytizing Muslims. Tim LaHaye, the co-author of the hugely popular \"Left Behind\" series, spoke of Iraq as \"a focal point of end-time events,\" whose special role in the earth's final days will become clear after invasion, conquest and reconstruction. For his part, Jerry Falwell boasted that \"God is pro-war\" in the title of an essay he wrote in 2004.\n \n The war sermons rallied the evangelical congregations behind the invasion of Iraq. An astonishing 87 percent of all white evangelical Christians in the United States supported the president's decision in April 2003. Recent polls indicate that 68 percent of white evangelicals continue to support the war. But what surprised me, looking at these sermons nearly three years later, was how little attention they paid to actual Christian moral doctrine. Some tried to square the American invasion with Christian \"just war\" theory, but such efforts could never quite reckon with the criterion that force must only be used as a last resort. As a result, many ministers dismissed the theory as no longer relevant.\n \n Some preachers tried to link Saddam Hussein with wicked King Nebuchadnezzar of Biblical fame, but these arguments depended on esoteric interpretations of the Old Testament book of II Kings and could not easily be reduced to the kinds of catchy phrases that are projected onto video screens in vast evangelical churches. The single common theme among the war sermons appeared to be this: our president is a real brother in Christ, and because he has discerned that God's will is for our nation to be at war against Iraq, we shall gloriously comply.\n \n Such sentiments are a far cry from those expressed in the Lausanne Covenant of 1974. More than 2,300 evangelical leaders from 150 countries signed that statement, the most significant milestone in the movement's history. Convened by Billy Graham and led by John Stott, the revered Anglican evangelical priest and writer, the signatories affirmed the global character of the church of Jesus Christ and the belief that \"the church is the community of God's people rather than an institution, and must not be identified with any particular culture, social or political system, or human ideology.\" \n \n On this page, David Brooks correctly noted that if evangelicals elected a pope, it would most likely be Mr. Stott, who is the author of more than 40 books on evangelical theology and Christian devotion. Unlike the Pope John Paul II, who said that invading Iraq would violate Catholic moral teaching and threaten \"the fate of humanity,\" or even Pope Benedict XVI, who has said there were \"not sufficient reasons to unleash a war against Iraq,\" Mr. Stott did not speak publicly on the war. But in a recent interview, he shared with me his abiding concerns. \n \n \"Privately, in the days preceding the invasion, I had hoped that no action would be taken without United Nations authorization,\" he told me. \"I believed then and now that the American and British governments erred in proceeding without United Nations approval.\" Reverend Stott referred me to \"War and Rumors of War, \" a chapter from his 1999 book, \"New Issues Facing Christians Today,\" as the best account of his position. In that essay he wrote that the Christian community's primary mission must be \"to hunger for righteousness, to pursue peace, to forbear revenge, to love enemies, in other words, to be marked by the cross.\"\n \n What will it take for evangelicals in the United States to recognize our mistaken loyalty? We have increasingly isolated ourselves from the shared faith of the global Church, and there is no denying that our Faustian bargain for access and power has undermined the credibility of our moral and evangelistic witness in the world. The Hebrew prophets might call us to repentance, but repentance is a tough demand for a people utterly convinced of their righteousness. \n Charles Marsh, a professor of religion at the University of Virginia, is the author of \"The Beloved Community: How Faith Shapes Social Justice, from the Civil Rights Movement to Today.\"",

   "WEEK IN REVIEW DESK \n \n \n Wrath and Mercy; The Return of the Warrior Jesus \n By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK (NYT) 1421 words\n Published: April 4, 2004\n \n WRITERS and artists have been imagining the Second Coming of Jesus for 2,000 years, but few have portrayed him wreaking more carnage on the unbelieving world than Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. \n In their new apocalyptic novel, ''Glorious Appearing,'' based on Dr. LaHaye's interpretation of Biblical prophecies about the Second Coming, their Jesus appears from the clouds on a white horse with a ''conviction like a flame of fire'' in his eyes. With all the gruesome detail of a Hollywood horror movie, Jesus eviscerates the flesh of millions of unbelievers merely by speaking. \n \n \n ''Men and women soldiers and horses seemed to explode where they stood,'' Dr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins write. ''It was as if the very words of the Lord had superheated their blood, causing it to burst through their veins and skin.'' The authors add, ''Even as they struggled, their own flesh dissolved, their eyes melted and their tongues disintegrated.'' \n \n Dr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins did not invent fire and brimstone. But some scholars who study religion say that the phenomenal popularity of their ''Left Behind'' series of apocalyptic thrillers -- now the best-selling adult novels in the United States -- are part of a shift in American culture's image of Jesus. The gentle, pacifist Jesus of the Crucifixion is sharing the spotlight with a more muscular warrior Jesus of the Second Coming, the Lamb making way for the Lion. \n \n Scholars who study religion in American culture say the trend partly reflects the growing clout of evangelical Christians and the relative decline of the liberal mainline Protestant denominations over the last 30 years. The image of a fearsome Jesus who will turn the tables on the unbelieving earthly authorities corresponds to a widespread sense among many conservative Christians that their values are under assault in a culture war with the secular society around them. The shift coincides with a surging interest in Biblical prophecies of the apocalypse around the turn of the millennium, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and the two wars with Iraq. And the warlike image of Jesus also fits with President George W. Bush's discussions of a godly purpose behind American military actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. \n \n There are signs of the same shift in Mel Gibson's movie ''The Passion of the Christ,'' which dealt almost exclusively with the submissive Jesus of the Crucifixion. ''When you see him stand up at the end of the movie, he reminds you of Schwarzenegger,'' said Stephen Prothero, a religion professor at Boston University and author of ''American Jesus,'' a new cultural history. ''I think that movie shows more of a macho Jesus, who, in this case, is brutalized instead of brutalizing.'' \n \n He added, ''I definitely think the pendulum is swinging toward a darker, more martial, macho concept of the Messiah.'' \n \n (More)",

   "Some worry that the turn toward a more warlike Jesus reflects a dangerous tendency to see earthly conflicts in cosmic terms. ''I think a lot of people are looking at contemporary conflict around the world and seeing it as a kind of religious war,'' said Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton. ''And there is no kind of conflict that becomes more intractable than when people are convinced that they alone have access to God's truth and the other side are the people of Satan.'' \n \n But Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, called the warrior Jesus of the ''Left Behind'' novels a healthy corrective, reminding people that Jesus is judgmental as well as merciful. ''The fear of God is a worthy emotion,'' he said. \n \n He argued that the wrathful Jesus in the book series was an antidote to what he called ''the effeminate Jesus'' that has sometimes prevailed in the culture. ''In our stained-glass windows and our popular culture, Jesus is a kind of marshmallowy, Santa Claus Jesus, which is not at all in keeping with the gospels,'' he said. \n \n The fight for a manly Jesus has been long-running. At the beginning of the 20th century, some Christian critics railed against what they called ''bearded lady'' portraits of Jesus of the Victorian era. But the battle over the manliness of Jesus had settled down by the middle of the 20th century, when the relatively liberal, mainline Protestant denominations were at their apex. \n \n Few liberal Protestants believed in a literal hell or talked much about the Second Coming. Their masculine but soft-spoken image of Jesus was exemplified by the once-ubiquitous portrait ''Head of Christ,'' made by Warner Sallman in 1941, which depicted a handsome man looking serenely upward. ''It is the classic Mr. Rogers Jesus picture,'' Professor Prothero said in an interview. \n \n But a less visible subculture of more evangelical Protestants held on to a far sterner, more bellicose image of Jesus that centered on the apocalypse. Like Dr. LaHaye, they maintained a darker ''pre-millennialist'' view that the Bible predicts a period of turmoil before Jesus returns in a final apocalyptic battle to overthrow the Antichrist. \n \n Bible scholars holding this view have often sought to apply Biblical prophecy to current events, frequently taking the creation of the state of Israel as a welcome sign that history is nearing a close. Dr. LaHaye's ''Left Behind'' series starts when all the born-again are summoned to heaven in the Rapture. Then the Antichrist uses the United Nations to create a single world government, world currency and world religion -- all signposts on the road to Armageddon, in Dr. LaHaye's view. The Antichrist establishes his global capital at the Biblical Babylon, now known as Baghdad. \n \n The overarching themes in such Biblical interpretation also bear a strong resemblance to contemporary talk of a culture war pitting secular liberals against conservative Christians, said Timothy Weber, president of Memphis Theological Seminary. ''The culture war fits into the pre-millennialists' expectation of the end of history -- the decline of civilization, the breakdown of morality, a general breakdown of order,'' he said. ''The warrior Jesus returns to set everything right again.'' \n \n Until about 30 years ago, evangelical Christians who leaned toward such views tended to shun engagement with politics or the larger culture as a little bit dirty and a little bit pointless, said John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron who studies religion. But that changed around the 1970's, when many conservative Christians began to feel that their traditional values had come under attack by the secular culture around them. When conservative Christians began to join the culture war, Dr. LaHaye was on the frontlines, joining Jerry Falwell in founding the Moral Majority. \n \n Not all evangelical Protestants agree with Dr. LaHaye, but they are much more likely than other groups to sympathize with him. ''The groups that had those views are much more visible than they used to be,'' Professor Green said. ''They are more politically active than they were in the past.'' \n \n Even in the Catholic Church, which does not share Dr. LaHaye's interpretation of the Second Coming, a growing number of conservatives, including Mr. Gibson, identify with conservative Protestants, he said. \n \n They have also helped put allies in the White House. President Ronald Reagan occasionally alluded to Biblical prophecies of a final battle at Armageddon, stirring fears among liberal Christians that he envisioned a nuclear showdown with the Soviet Union. \n \n President George W. Bush, a born-again Methodist, has not talked publicly about Armageddon, but he has been unusually outspoken about the role of his faith in both his own life and his foreign policy, suggesting the United States was doing God's work by spreading freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq. \n \n For his part, Mr. Jenkins, co-author of ''Glorious Appearing,'' acknowledged that the ''tough love'' Jesus might not please everyone. ''Some people might say, 'We like thinking that Jesus is the man who spoke in paradoxes and beatitudes,' and they might not want to find out that he is also the one who is going to judge at the end of the world,'' he said, adding: ''But, of course, that is the way it is in the Bible.''",
