   "3 suspects part of 'Lowlifes' group\n By Tony Manolatos and Amy Oakes\n UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS\n August 2, 2006 \n \n Police are accusing a 24-year-old man and two teenage boys of sneaking up on six men and beating them - in five separate attacks - as they left the San Diego gay pride festival Saturday night in Balboa Park. \n \n The assaults, which officials are calling brutal hate crimes, angered the city's gay and lesbian community and drew a dogged response from San Diego police. \n \n \"People are outraged,\" said Sean Wherley, a spokesman for The San Diego Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Community Center. \"We're obviously very concerned by the viciousness of the attacks, but we're heartened by the swift action\" by the police. \n \n James Allen Carroll, a convicted felon, was taken into custody Monday night at a San Diego apartment where he was living, police Capt. Chris Ball said. A 17-year-old was arrested yesterday afternoon while walking on Scott Street in Point Loma after picking up his paycheck from a restaurant. \n \n Police have asked prosecutors to charge the 17-year-old as an adult, department spokesman M\u00f3nica Mu\u00f1oz said. He is being held in Juvenile Hall. \n \n A 16-year-old boy was arrested downtown at 7:10 last night. He was to be booked into Juvenile Hall on suspicion of the same charges as the other teen, police said. \n \n Police have not released the teenagers' names. \n \n Court records show Carroll, who is being held in the downtown jail pending arraignment tomorrow, pleaded guilty to felony burglary in April in San Diego. He was sentenced to three years' probation. He was convicted of a similar crime last year in Texas. \n \n Police are expected to ask prosecutors to charge Carroll and the teens with multiple felonies, including attempted murder stemming from a hate crime and assault with a deadly weapon, Mu\u00f1oz said. \n \n The three are part of a loose-knit group known as the \"Lowlifes,\" Ball said. Police don't know much about the group, which they said has about 50 members. \n \n Rally against hate \n The San Diego Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Community Center plans to hold a rally Friday to denounce hate crimes and support the victims attacked Saturday night in Balboa Park. The rally will begin at 5:30 p.m. at the center, 3909 Centre St. \n \n \"We will find out more about who they are,\" Ball said. \n \n One of the victims remains hospitalized with a fractured skull. Ball said a tracheotomy was performed to help him breathe. One victim was stabbed. \n \n The break in the case came a day after the assaults when a witness called police, Ball said. The caller provided enough information for detectives to secure a search warrant for Carroll's apartment in the 2100 block of First Avenue. \n \n \"We found evidence in the apartment that links the suspects to the crime,\" Ball said, declining to elaborate but noting that baseball bats and a knife were used in the attacks. \n \n The victims were assaulted, starting about 10:45 p.m., on Redwood Circle near the lawn bowling center east of Sixth Avenue and north of Laurel Street in Balboa Park. \n \n Police said the victims were taunted with anti-gay insults during the beatings. \n \n \"Lying in wait in bushes, . . . nothing can get much lower,\" Councilwoman Toni Atkins, whose district includes Balboa Park, said of the assailants. \n \n Carroll was wearing a T-shirt that said \"ERACISM,\" Ball said. \n \n Leaders in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community praised police and city officials for their immediate response to the attacks. \n \n \"We're extremely proud of the stand the mayor has taken and the position of the police chief,\" said Ron deHarte, executive director of San Diego Pride. \n \n Five detectives were assigned to the case. Ball credited the investigators and the District Attorney's Office for \"excellent work by some dedicated folks.\" \n \n He said the nature of the crime warranted the around-the-clock focus. \n \"This was a brutal attack,\" Ball said. \"These victims were going about their business and this attack was unprovoked. It was violent.\" \n \n The Rev. John Gill of Metropolitan Community Church, a predominantly gay congregation, said people have called and offered to help the victims. \n \n \"People want to help in whatever way possible,\" Gill said. \n \n A few years ago, the church established a fund to aid victims of anti-gay hate crime. The fund, in response to the high-profile 1998 killing of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyo., has raised $2,500. \n \n For Gill, the attack was an anomaly to a very positive weekend of Pride events. \n \n \"It's just so sad when everything was so positive and upbeat in every other way,\" he said. \n \n http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20060802-9999-7m2gayhate.html",
