   "As it was reported by Turkish high-ranking military (namely Gen. N. Aslen), neither USA, nor Turkey (US main ally in this region) will raise objections to Azeri decision of solving Karabakh problem by force at this moment. Moreover, the both \"supporters\" are sure of Azerbaijan's victory in the case of recommencement of the just war for reconstruction of Azeri territorial integrity. Turkish military leadership is ready to lend any type of assistance for Azerbaijan when push comes to shove. Why? The explanation is self-evident. The matter is that Azeri authorities should fulfill responsible mission in accordance with an agreement, which USA, Turkey and Azerbaijan have signed recently. As agreed by these sides, Azerbaijan is involved in military preparations of future war against Iran. And Washington will turn a blind eye to Azeri military actions against Karabakh in exchange for chance of deployment of US military base in Pirallakhi (Artem-Ostrov) and involving Azeri troops in possible military operations against Teheran.",
