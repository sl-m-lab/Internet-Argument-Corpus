I don't understand how an intelligent person can read:\n \n \"A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"\n \n and interpret that law to mean guns are only for hunting all other uses are unconstitutional.

   "I think Kerry is catering to leftwing elements here for votes\n\n \n Yes, just like Bush. Neither one of these guys is a friend to the gun owner. On the one hand, you have kerry who gives a great deal of lip service to gun owners but when the time comes, routinely votes for every gun control measure that comes along.\n \n On the other hand, you have Bush, who has not had the chance to vote on a gun control measure, but has assured us he will pass the AWB if he gets the chance.\n \n These guys are both willing to sell out gun owners for a few votes from the GG's.\n \n The NRA is backing bush, but does that really surprise you from the organisation that has helped compromise the majority of the rights we have lost since 1968 away?\n \n I think the biggest mistake any gun owners can make is in actaully believing we have any friends on capitol hill. \n \n Join GOA. Make them the new NRA. They don;t seem particulalrly interested in compromise, nor are they shy about calling on their memebrs to vote a republican out of office for supporting gun control legislation. The theory seems to go \"if you are not going to support our issue, we sill get you out of there, and if we have to deal with a democrat for a couple of years first, then so be it\". \n \n The NRA, on the other hand, almost ended up giving us the idiotic AWB back in return for immunity for gun manufaturers. In reality, the gun manufaturers don't need immunity, despite what has been said about them being bankrupted by legal proceedings, they seem to have done quite nicely looking at their numbers. They have established important case law in almost every district, which means that law suits in the future can be handled by a single attorney in a pretrial motion to dismiss. The problem has more or less rectified itself.",

   "Is thier gun magazine any good? My NRA membership is expired this month. I really like the magazine.\n\n \n Nope, the GOA newsletter is a dry thing, which generally focuses soley on legal issues. If you want a good gun magazine, I would suggest guns and ammo. It is available at your local news stand, or you can subscribe for roughly half off the cover price.\n \n If you want to join a gun control group that is going to fight for your second ammendmnet rights, I would sugges the GOA. It is thanks to the GOA that we can now sue the BATFE for harassment and illegal seizure of firearms (they have lost their immunity....hehehehe).\n \n Unlike the NRA, which encouraged republican reps to accept a renewal of the AWB in return for the passage of the immunity for gun makers (from whom the NRA recieves millions per year) act, the GOA does not compormise on any issues. They even advocate an end to the unconstitutional tax on NFA items.",

   "Is thier gun magazine any good? My NRA membership is expired this month. I really like the magazine.\n\n \n Depends on what you want... I've always liked Rifle and Handloader for good general reading. American Handgunner is a bimonthly and chocked full of stuff, they're 1911 nuts though. Handguns is better all around. I used to prefer Shooting Times to all but the first two mentioned, but ever since their exec editor change, I've not liked them as much. Guns is ok and on par with Guns and Ammo imo. I personally just browse them at the bookstore and buy what I want. There are some months that they have nothing but **** (imo) and it's worth it to buy what I want to read rather than paying for a bunch of monthly mags with nothing in them.",
