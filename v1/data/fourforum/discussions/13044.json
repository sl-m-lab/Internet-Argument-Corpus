   "The traffic in firearms by criminals, convicted and unconvicted. This is fed by lost or stolen firearms. What is overlooked is the loss by government of firearms. A quick search reveals the following lost or stolen from the feds:\n FBI 160 over a 4yr period\n ATF 76 over a 5 yr period\n DEA 22 lost over a 5 yr period\n DEA 69 stolen over a 5 yr period\n \n The GAO reports a loss of 1012 by 15 of 18 agencies over a 4 yr period ending in 2002. It took the FBI an average of 4 1/2 yrs to report lost of stolen firearms.\n \n Military weapons lost or stolen are unknown except for those lost overseas which may or may not leak back to the US. This does not take into account lost or stolen firearms by the 50 states or local law enforcement.\n \n These figures pale in comparison to the studies that show 500,000 firearms stolen each year. \n Stolen Guns Database Now Available To The Public",

   "The Department of State has weighed in officially on whether the sale of military weapons to Mexico through U.S. private-sector arms exporters might be a source of the high-caliber firearms now being employed by drug trafficking organizations in the bloody drug war south of the border.\n \n The response is not very reassuring.\n \n The U.S. State Department oversees a program that requires private companies in the United States to obtain an export license in order to sell defense hardware or services to foreign purchasers - which include both government units and private buyers in other countries.
