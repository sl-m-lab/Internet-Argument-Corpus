It doesn't really matter to me where it goes, I just like the idea of having a fair idea of what the thread is about. But it's happened before and it will happen again. In fact, I might be the one to do it next time.\n * * *\n I wanted to explain what a red haring was. This was used by my Fiction Writing instructor on a story that I did where the readers want something but there is something else given to them. The word itself is meant to be a kind of fish. The phrased was used for being led to want something that you won't be given. (Sorry for placing my Creative Writing stuff out there. I'm a Creative Writing major and it's one of those things I try to pick up on to improve my writing. Please, just except the fact that I'm weird and move on.) As far as the education part goes; I would have liked to study math in the 1960's or 70's in Texas or California. Since you said you didn't really mind where it went, I thought I'd go ahead and give an opinion on both.",
