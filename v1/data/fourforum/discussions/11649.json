   "I'm aware of verses that can be construed to mean that it is an \"abomination\" for a man to lay with another man as they would with a woman.\n \n What about verses that say lesbians are wrong? Where does it say that it shoudn't be practiced?\n\n \n Rom 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,\n Rom 1:19 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.\n Rom 1:20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.\n Rom 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\n Rom 1:22 Professing to be wise, they became fools,\n Rom 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.\n Rom 1:24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.\n Rom 1:25 For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.\n Rom 1:26 For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,\n Rom 1:27 and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.\n Rom 1:28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,\n Rom 1:29 being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; {they are} gossips,\n Rom 1:30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,\n Rom 1:31 without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;\n Rom 1:32 and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.\n Now, notice after verse 26,the \"IN THE SAME WAY\", IN VERSE 27 that refers to the men abandoning the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. So he first is speaking to what we call lesbianism, and then homosexuality. \n \n I posted the rest of the passage just because it is so powerful in stating the seriousness of what it means to be in rebellion against God.",

   "So expound for us on what the bible means in verses 26 and 27 by a woman's \"function\"?\n\n You mean their NATURAL function? Which they exchanged for that which is unnatural?

Verse 27:\"and in the same way also\" the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. Now go back and read them both together and if you have the comprehension of a 5th grader, you should clearly get the intended message.\n \n Rom 1:25 For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever.

   "Heterosexual \"nature\" is all there is for the heterosexist. We're all in this world with a heterosexual nature and perspective, or should have that, is the false assumption. Gay people are not thought to have a homosexual nature, and even if we do, it's the heterosexual one, which is subjectively judged the better contribution. That's why when they see a Bible verse, suggesting going against nature, heterosexists don't see it as only going against one's personal nature, but against all there is or all that matters in terms of nature. The \"law of nature\", is a more modern concept, not thought of in the time the Bible was written. \n \n It's all an irrational denial of our existence and humanity as gay people. The lesson was taught deliberately over a long period of time by the biases of a culture, that is finally changing. Our knowledge and understanding on the subject is changing, so with that we may look at Bible verses, and determine if that's what was really meant. If it was what they meant, the writers in that time period, had a misconception of what it means to be gay, or to have a homosexual orientation/nature and live one's life accordingly.",
