   "As Sakata so eloquently posted on another thread, \"I'm pro-choice, up until the moment of conception.\"\n \n As a Catholic, I believe that the fetus is an individual. As a liberal, I am for expanding an individual's rights. So while I usually believe that a person has a right to do whatever he\\she wants with their body, in the case of an abortion, the fetus' right to live overshadows this. \n \n Biblically speaking, there are verses which say that the fetus is indeed a human being with a soul, while that abortion is a crime.\n \n The Following is from www.catholic.com\\abortion.asp\n \n \"As the early Christian writer Tertullian pointed out, the law of Moses ordered strict penalties for causing an abortion. We read, \"If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely [Hebrew: \"so that her child comes out\"], but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\" (Ex. 21:22-24). \n \n This applies the lex talionis or \"law of retribution\" to abortion. The lex talionis establishes the just punishment for an injury (eye for eye, tooth for tooth, life for life, compared to the much greater retributions that had been common before, such as life for eye, life for tooth, lives of the offender's family for one life). \n \n The lex talionis would already have been applied to a woman who was injured in a fight. The distinguishing point in this passage is that a pregnant woman is hurt \"so that her child comes out\"; the child is the focus of the lex talionis in this passage. Aborted babies must have justice, too. \n \n This is because they, like older children, have souls, even though marred by original sin. David tells us, \"Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me\" (Ps. 51:5, NIV). Since sinfulness is a spiritual rather than a physical condition, David must have had a spiritual nature from the time of conception. \n \n The same is shown in James 2:26, which tells us that \"the body without the spirit is dead\": The soul is the life-principle of the human body. Since from the time of conception the child's body is alive (as shown by the fact it is growing), the child's body must already have its spirit.\" \n \n Finally, Christians that support abortion perhaps also forget that Jesus said in Matt. 25:40, \"as you did it to the least of my brothers, you did it to me\" The human fetus has been called many demeaning things, such as a parasite or an insignifcant speck. When we kill these babies, we are essentially killing Jesus.",

Peace.\n\n \n \n Maximus;\n \n How are you , fine I hope\n I am new to the site and am glad ,for some people on this site need to search scripture much deeper, then their own beliefs.\n \n Christians who support abortion are like lost sheep from Gods word who follow their own interest in life not hearing what the scripture's say following the evils of the world.\n \n Abortion is evil, it is murder, and anyone who has a abortion can not go around and say ,killing someone is wrong when they do the same to the unborn child.\n For Christ said, I know you in your mother's womb.\n So by Christ saying this,he is saying you are a child of God, so it is are will to pray for those who do this evil act, and that Christ come's into their life and show them the truth from the Church , the pillar and mainstream of truth stated from scripture.\n \n Peace to you; Drac",

It seems that they are limiting the option for abortion to rape and a pregnancy that would endanger the life of the mother. They are not condoning the use of abortion as birth control. It seems to me that in the case of rape, the woman did not want the baby, and did not willingly engage in the act to concieve that baby. Should she be forced to bring that baby into the world, care for it, and love it? I don't see how many women could do that. In the case of danger to the womans life, why allow her to die? If the woman dies prior to giving birth, chances are the fetus dies anyway. If the fetus can be salvaged (usually with profound brain damage), it must either put up for adoption, or raised by the father if he is around. And even then, it will require special care for the rest of it's miserable life. Your attitude of anything for the unborn but screw the woman is really disgusting.",
