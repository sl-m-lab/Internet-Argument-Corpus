   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia\n \n \nPedophilia (American English) or paedophilia (British English), from the Greek &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#966;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#945; (paidophilia) < &#960;&#945;&#953;&#962; (pais) \"boy, child\" and &#966;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#945; (philia) \"friendship\", (ICD-10 F65.4) is the condition of people (either adult or adolescent) whose primary sexual attraction is toward prepubescent children. It is a chronophilia, i.e. a paraphilia in which the paraphile's sexuoerotic age is discordant with his or her actual chronological age and is concordant with the age of the partner. Pedosexuality is used as a synonym. It is sometimes used informally to describe sex offenders or child pornographers.\n \n In the United States and some other countries, the term is sometimes used more broadly to describe people attracted to adolescents. In cultures or countries where love relationships or dates between adults and adolescents are socially or legally accepted (at least with parental consent) or are viewed with tolerance, such as France or Brazil, the word pedophilia is almost never used in this sense, either formally or informally.\n \n In most countries of the world, adolescents above a certain age can be legally emancipated through marriage, economic self-sufficiency, pregnancy or by other means. The marriageable age is generally below the age of majority and in some cases below the legal age of consent. Sexual relations with emancipated minors are not considered pedophilia.\n\n \n \n \n http://www.exgaywatch.com/blog/archives/2004/10/homosexuality_a.html\n \n \nOctober 24, 2004\n Homosexuality and pedophilia: The false link\n By Joe Kort, MSW\n Originally published in \"In the Family\" magazine, Fall 2003\n \n I thought I would publish this here on this site as I know that those involved in the ex-gay movements often believe that homosexuals are pedophiles. In my research I found useful arguments for those who wish to speak up and teach the truth to those who misunderstand. \n \n Q: I've heard therapists say that a male adult who sexually abuses a boy isn't necessarily 'homosexual.' This seems confusing: If he isn't homosexual, then why would he sexually molest boys, instead of girls?\n \n This is a very good question, and there are several ways to respond to it. First, we need to clarify our definitions. When discussing sexual abuse and molestation of children, there's often conflict over terminology. One frequently quoted researchers on the topic of homosexuality and child molestation, Gregory Herek, a research psychologist at the University of California, defines pedophilia as \"a psychosexual disorder characterized by a preference for prepubescent children as sexual partners, which may or may not be acted upon.\" (http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow and http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow//html/facts_molestation.html) He defines child sexual abuse as \"actual sexual contact between an adult and someone who has not reached the legal age of consent.\" Not all pedophiles actually molest children, he points out. A pedophile may be attracted to children, but never actually engage in sexual contact with them. Quite often, pedophiles never develop a sexual orientation toward other adults. \n \n Herek points out that child molestation and child sexual abuse refer to \"actions,\" without implying any \"particular psychological makeup or motive on the part of the perpetrator.\" In other words, not all incidents of child sexual abuse are perpetrated by pedophiles. Pedophilia can be viewed as a kind of sexual fetish, wherein the person requires the mental image of a child--not necessarily a flesh-and-blood child--to achieve sexual gratification. Rarely does a pedophile experience sexual desire for adults of either gender. They usually don't identify as homosexual-the majority identify as heterosexual, even those who abuse children of the same gender They are sexually aroused by youth, not by gender. In contrast, child molesters often exert power and control over children in an effort to dominate them. They do experience sexual desire for adults, but molest children episodically, for reasons apart from sexual desire, much as rapists enjoy power, violence and controlling their humiliated victims. Indeed, research supports that a child molester isn't any more likely to be homosexual than heterosexual. \n \n In fact, some research shows that for pedophiles, the gender of the child is immaterial. Accessibility is more the factor in who a pedophile abuses. This may explain the high incidence of children molested in church communities and fraternal organizations, where the pedophile may more easily have access to children. In these situations, an adult male is trusted by those around him, including children and their families. Males are often given access to boys to mentor, teach, coach and advise. Therefore, a male pedophile may have easier access to a male child. In trying to make sense of an adult male's sexually abusing a male child, many of us mislabel it as an act of homosexuality, which it isn't. \n \n Feminists have argued for years that rape is not a sex act-it is an act of violence using sex as a weapon. In the same way, a pedophile abusing a child of the same sex is not perpetrating a homosexual act, but an act of violence and exploitation using sexuality. There is a world of difference between these two things, but it requires a subtle understanding of the inner motivation of the abuser.\n \n To call child molestation of a boy by a man \"homosexual\" or of a girl by a man \"heterosexual\" is to misunderstand pedophilia. No true pedophile is attracted to adults, so neither homosexuality nor heterosexuality applies. Accordingly, Herek suggests calling men's sexual abuse of boys \"male-male molestation\" and men's abuse of girls, \"male-female molestation.\"\n\n \n \n http://www.aglp.org/pages/cfactsheets.html\n \n \nGay, Lesbian and Bisexual Issues\n \n What is \"Sexual Orientation\"?\n \"Sexual orientation\" is a term frequently used to describe a person's romantic, emotional or sexual attraction to another person. A person attracted to another person of the same sex is said to have a homosexual orientation and may be called gay (both men and women) or lesbian. Individuals attracted to persons of the other sex are said to have a heterosexual orientation. Sexual orientation falls along a continuum and individuals who are attracted to both men and women are said to be bisexual. Sexual orientation is different from gender identity, which refers to the internal sense of whether one is male or female. Sexual orientation is a relatively new concept. In fact, although same sex behavior has always existed, the idea of a homosexual identity or a homosexual person is only about 100 years old.\n \n The concept of sexual orientation refers to more than sexual behavior. It includes feelings as well as identity. Some individuals may identify themselves as gay lesbian or bisexual without engaging in any sexual activity. Some people believe that sexual orientation is innate and fixed; however, sexual orientation develops across a person's lifetime. Individuals maybe become aware at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual.\n \n Is Homosexuality A Mental Disorder?\n No. All major professional mental health organizations have gone on record to affirm that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association's Board of Trustees removed homosexuality from its official diagnostic manual, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Second Edition (DSM II). The action was taken following a review of the scientific literature and consultation with experts in the field. The experts found that homosexuality does not meet the criteria to be considered a mental illness.\n \n What causes Homosexuality/Heterosexuality/Bisexuality?\n No one knows what causes heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality. Homosexuality was once thought to be the result of troubled family dynamics or faulty psychological development. Those assumptions are now understood to have been based on misinformation and prejudice. Currently there is a renewed interest in searching for biological etiologies for homosexuality. However, to date there are no replicated scientific studies supporting any specific biological etiology for homosexuality. Similarly, no specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified, including histories of childhood sexual abuse. Sexual abuse does not appear to be more prevalent in children who grow up to identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, than in children who identify as heterosexual.\n \n American Psychiatric Association, 1400 K St. NW, Washington, DC 20005\n (Revised May, 2000)\n\n \n \n \nFact Sheet on Pedophilia and Homosexuality\n \n \u0095 Pedophilia is defined as an adult having \"recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (DSMIV, reference below).\"\n \n \u0095 Pedophilia is almost exclusively found in men, and the great majority of these men identify as heterosexual.\n \n \u0095 Even among people who sexually abuse children of their same gender, most are attracted to adults of the opposite gender .\n \n \u0095 Sexual orientation, whether heterosexual or homosexual, describes attractions to and sexual behavior with consenting adults. Sexual behavior directed at children is a disorder or a crime, and does not constitute a sexual orientation.\n \n REFERENCES\n \n 1.

Just as with the case of John Wayne Gacy and many of the Priests who were caught up in the sex scandals...they all claim to be heterosexual. John Wayne Gacy had been married twice, had two children in each marriage but all his victims were young males. Why? \n Simple actually, boys are what he had access to.

Louis Lamonica, 45, pastor of Hosanna Church in Ponchatoula, a town of 5,000 about 40 miles northwest of New Orleans, is both the chief suspect and the man who broke the case, which deputies had been investigating since a woman called from Ohio five weeks ago. She said her children had been abused but was reluctant to give specifics, Deputy Reed said.\n \n On Monday afternoon, the authorities said, Mr. Lamonica walked into the Livingston Parish sheriff's office and began to confess. \"I don't really know what motivated him,\" said Detective Supervisor Stan Carpenter in Livingston Parish. \n \n Deputy Reed said Mr. Lamonica \"began to recount some horrific instances where children from the age of toddlers to pubescents to teenagers had been involved in sex acts in affiliation with this church.\" \n \n Mr. Lamonica also spoke of a poodle and cat that had died from abuse, Deputy Reed said. Among those arrested was Chris Labat, 24, a deputy sheriff in Tangipahoa Parish. \n \n Mr. Lamonica was charged shortly after he confessed on Monday, Mr. Labat the next day, and the other two on Wednesday. Last night, three more people, including the pastor's wife, Robbin Lamonica, 45, were arrested and charged with aggravated rape, Deputy Reed said. \n \n The Hosanna church was once led by Mr. Lamonica's father, who was respected in the community, the authorities and neighbors said. After some interim pastors, Mr. Lamonica took control, and the church became increasingly isolated, they said. \n \n \"His mother was secretary when he took over, and he put his momma out,\" said Tim Normand, who lives next door to the church.\n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/20/national/20louisiana.html",
