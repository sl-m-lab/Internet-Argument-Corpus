   "http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=44214\n \n \nWASHINGTON, March 11 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The tragic fatal shooting in Atlanta of a judge and several courthouse personnel by a defendant who stole the duty weapon of courthouse deputy shows the value of model \"disarming\" legislation written and promoted by the Law Enforcement Alliance of America (LEAA). This model legislation is designed to be used as a tool by prosecutors against criminals who fight with police and attempt to take the officer's duty weapon. As we have seen in Atlanta, when a subject goes for an officer's gun, the intent to commit murder is clear.\n \n LEAA's disarming legislation has been introduced in nearly two dozen states and become law in several states. Law Enforcement officers frequently train to retain control of their firearms during a violent struggle. In the last decade, police agencies have begun using special holsters designed to aid the officer in retaining his firearm during a fight. \n \n http://www.townhall.com/news/politics/200503/POL20050311b.shtml\n \n \nThe Law Enforcement Alliance of America has drawn up model legislation called the \"Disarming a Law Enforcement Officer Act.\"\n \n \n The bill would provide severe penalties, above and beyond assault on an officer, for criminals who attempt to take an officer's firearm.\n\n \n Do I really need to say anything, or do we all understnd the two year old logic here?\n \n \n why don't we just make it illegal to be a criminal. Then they will all go away.\n \n sheesh",

NO way am I going to do that !!!!\n \n \n \n WHAT is scary is the fact that we have people with judiciary powers, actually coming up with this kind of legislative proposals. :( That same mental power could have been used to draw up law enforcement departmental policy to ASSURE in its BEST effort that : \n * a monetary budget exists for every police department to have enough officers ON HAND, to keep the felon under control, with the physical abilities to handle the felon present at ALL times\n * proper training and procedure is taught and ENFORCED , and monitored by supervisors routinely , on the proper handling and SECURING of felons. all jmo",

   "Perhaps I'm ignorant but I cam up with three possible examples of what this law would most likely be used for, and that there is no need for it.\n \n Model 1:\n A criminal is being arrested or being held in court. The criminal sees the officer has a gun. The criminal steals the gun.\n \n Felony- Theft\n \n Model 2:\n The criminal is struggling to escape. The officer has a gun and the criminal sees this. Seeing this, the criminal tries to fight the officer for possession of the gun.\n \n Felony- Assault\n Felony- Theft\n \n Model 3:\n The criminal is able to attack the officer and steal the gun. The criminal fires the gun at the officer, injuring or killing him.\n \n Felony- Assault\n Felony- Theft\n Felony- Murder (or attempted murder)\n \n Obviously, I agree that the law is stupid. It's redundant. Plus, this law suggests that there is a major difference between steling the gun of an officer and stealing the gun of a farmer. It's the asme thing, and this law makes you wonder if the farmer gets any rights for having his gun stolen instead of an officers. Any kind of stealing of a possession is illegal, this law suggests there is a mjaor difference; enough than a new law must be in palce.",
