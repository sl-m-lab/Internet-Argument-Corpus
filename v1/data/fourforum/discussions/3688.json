   "Karl Rove also mentioned that Bush was going to aggressively pursue a constitutional ammendment defining marriage as only between a man and a woman, so I am sure that with a purely republican majority throughout our next four years - such an ammendment is possible. However, the democrats still have enough seats to hold up a the useful fillabuster blocks to the proposed ammendment - which require a 60 vote majority to overturn.\n \n Here's my argument: (aforementioned in the Providence Journal Forum)\n \n We can all agree that marriage was created though religion and thus, is a religious sacrament that has existed for thousands of years. Marriage, then, is most certainly not a secular idea and then would not exist in its current form without religious history.\n \n If the previous paragraph is true, and the constitution states that practice of religion is protected but not legislated, then how can any aspect of religious ceremony ever be included in the constitution?\n \n Of course, this is an age-old argument, and I'm sure there are a number of religious posters who have pre-written rebuttles:), so I'll offer this also:\n \n America is religious, and therefore, those Americans who are out of the mainstream are going to have to understand the inability of others to understand them.\n \n Here's a mind blower: The problem is not that gays want to get married emoticon_wow Instead - the problem is that people know about it.\n \n Now think about that. If most Americans had no idea that homosexuals were getting married or that they even wanted to, then most everyone would still be voting on issues that really matter to our personal well-beings.\n \n The Solution:\n \n Most religious Americans that I've spoken to root their issue with gay marriage in the fact that it's called \"marriage.\" That apparently is \"their word,\" and there is no further debate. However, most are not against civil unions - even President Bush supports those.\n \n Gays, on the other hand, want to be completely equal. That means full marriage recognition.\n \n I suggest the following: Homosexuals should create their own name for their unions which would be recognized by the state as equal to a Christain marriage, but not called \"a marriage\" on paper. Forget \"civil unions\" because it was created by non-gays who are just trying to get votes.\n \n Gay people could certainly come up with some good names and I'm looking forward to hearing what they are!",

Marriage as an institution has portability. Civil inions and other names registries do not. Marriage has federal protections, civil unions do not. \n \n Even if you came up with a whole new system, it won't work because the chrsitian right will still be standing there saying marriage is better. It would be nice to get the government out of marriage all together, but that is unlikely. So working with what you got, marriage for straight and gay is the only way to provide \"Equal protection under the law\" and that is what the constitution provides for.",

   "Because marriage was not always historically just between a man and woman. According to John Boswell, former professor and chairman of the history department at Yale University and other distinguished scholars, gays were allowed to marry during the early Christianity period. In \"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\" Boswell states:\n \n Chapter 3 Rome: The foundation\n \"Many homosexual relationships were perminent and exclusive. Among the lower classes informal unions like that of Giton and Encolpius may have predominated, but marriages between males or between females were legal and familiar among the upper classes. Even under the Republic, as has been noted, Cicero regarded the younger Curio's relationship with another man aw a marriage, and by the time of the early Empire references to gay marriages are commonplace. The biographer of Elagebalus maintains that after the emperor's marriage to an athlete from Smyna, any male who wished to advance at the imperial court either had to have a husband or pretend that he did. Nero married two men in succession, both in public ceremonies with the ritual appropriate to legal marriage.\"\n \n Now, marriage has never really had a clear definition. I'm an American of mixed African descent and it's terrible for George W. Bush to have the nerve to think that he can write bigotry in the constitution. Most Americans are ignorant when it comes to equal rights for same sex couples, but most black educators and historical figures such as Coretta Scott King, Julian Bond, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Rev. Joseph Lowery, Michael Eric Dyson, Carol Moseley Braun, Joycelyn Elders, Rev. Peter Gomes, Rep. John Lewis, Rev. Al. Sharpton, Rev. William Sinkford, Bishop Desmond Tutu, and many other people of African descent support rights for all Americans. The regular rank and file is the problem.",

   "Church Leaders Back Calif. Gay Marriage Bill\n by Lisa Less, Associated Press \n \n Posted: December 8, 2004 12:01 am ET \n \n (San Francisco, California) A group of San Francisco church leaders lined up Tuesday to declare support for a bill that would allow same-sex couples to get married in California, arguing that the measure was a logical extension of the principle mandating separation of church and state.\n \n Flanking the legislation's lead author, Assemblyman Mark Leno, in the sanctuary of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, clergy representing Baptist, United Church of Christ, Metropolitan Community and Unitarian congregations said the bill is consistent with Christian teachings because it promotes equality for gays and lesbians.\n \n \"I enjoy the idea that human beings have evolved to a place where we don't have to have relationships defined by what goes on 'in the barnyard,'\" said the Rev. Yvette Flunder of City of Refuge United Church of Christ, poking fun at a recent statement by Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell on why marriage should be limited to a man and a woman. \"We live in a democracy, not a theocracy.\"\n \n Leno's bill, which he renamed the \"Religious Freedom and California Civil Marriage Protection Act\" for the legislative session that began Monday, would amend a section of California's family code that defines marriage as \"a personal relationship arising out of a civil contract between a man and woman\" to read \"between two persons.\"\n \n The new version of the bill, which cleared an Assembly committee earlier this year but was withdrawn by Leno because he did not have enough votes to get it through the full Assembly, also contains a section that specifically says clergy members are not required to participate in a marriage ceremony against their beliefs.\n \n The additional language should \"help Californians understand there is a definite difference between religious marriage and civil marriage,\" Leno said.\n \n The Rev. Amos Brown of San Francisco's Third Baptist Church agreed.\n \n \"As a Baptist, I will not be a bigot,\" he said. \"I will not impose my religious convictions on anyone else, especially not law-abiding adults.\"\n \n Tuesday's show of support from a group Leno affectionately termed \"the religious left\" came the day after an evangelical Christian group, the Orange County-based Traditional Values Coalition, announced a campaign to strip same-sex couples of domestic partner benefits. (story) The coalition also wants to insert the existing definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman into the California Constitution.\n \n The Rev. Cecil Williams, Glide Memorial's longtime leader, said such efforts to undermine the rights of gays and lesbians were not consistent with the nation's values.\n \n \"If I went against freedom at the pulpit, I would then push out a segment of the community,\" he said.\n \n \u00a9Associated Press 2004",
