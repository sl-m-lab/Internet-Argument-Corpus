Like I've said before, my learning started off with the practical side of childcare, I love children. But...I can also say that my theory training has proven invaluable, I use it all the time. If you were taught by someone with experience, that information would grant merrit...and if the student who was taught passes on that information (even an inexperienced one) that information would still be usefull. Not many childcare teachers haven't done childcare in their life though (my teachers have been social workers, nursary nurses, child pyschologists etc). And you may say they became teachers because they couldn't do the above proffesions, but actually, they just wanted to do something different (which is perfectly natural if you've been at the same job for 15+ years).",
