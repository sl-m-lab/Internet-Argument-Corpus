   "Today, Obama rolled out a new economic stimulus plan. The new plan would cost $60 billion over the next two years. The main points of the plan include:\n \n - 90-day moratorium on foreclosures for homeowners making good-faith efforts to pay their mortgage.\n \n - $3,000 tax credit for companies for each new job created in the U.S. over the next two years.\n \n - Penalty free withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA retirement accounts up to$10,000 for the next two years.\n \n Source: Truly Newsworthy, www.TrulyNewsworthy.com\n \n I think this is a good start. I know McCain is also reworking the dialogue of his campaign. I heard his new stump speech today. It sounds much better than previous speeches. I still think anything can happen in this election.",

   "The plan is ####.\n \n \n90-day moratorium on foreclosures for homeowners making good-faith efforts to pay their mortgage.\n\n \n We have done this in the past. People who can AFFORD their mortgage and make \"good faith efforts\" to pay it do so. They do not end up in foreclosure. People who CAN NOT afford their mortgages make good faith efforts, come up short, and end up in foreclosure. Nobody is doing anybody any favors by helping people stay in homes they cannot afford, or homes that it does not make financial sense for them to hang on to. \n \n \n$3,000 tax credit for companies for each new job created in the U.S. over the next two years.\n\n \n That is sure going to convince them to keep jobs here. BTW...on average US companies save roughly $21,420 PER EMPLOYEE per year when they offshore manufacturing jobs. The number is twice that for engineering jobs. $3000? COME ON.\n \n \nPenalty free withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA retirement accounts up to$10,000 for the next two years.\n\n \n This one I like. Give those poor dumb suckers who actually fell for the 401kaput pitch a chance to run like hell from the market like the rest of us.",

The market WILL correct itself in the long run. Any new money we throw at it is just sacrificing the middle class to preserve profits for the wealthy.\n \n People need to eat...which is why we have food stamps and dumpsters. 3 sets of even relatively cheap clothes will last you 2 or 3 years, and as far as shelter...well....they were called \"Hoovervilles\" last time around. \n \n \n \nAny sanctions on the snake-oil salesmen who bamboozled people into signing these poisonous mortgage documents, or are they part of the great engine of capitalism?\n\n \n How many people do you think got \"bamboozled\" into signing a poisonous mortgage? Seriously, I want to know. The best numbers I have seen say less than 1.2%. People signed these bad loans because they wanted something (in this case a new house) and by god it is your birthright as an american to have anything you want. \n \n When you see these XXXXXX complaining that the ARM they signed went bad, they are not complaining because they did not know how the loan worked, or because they did not understand that it was adjustable rate. They are whining because they did not think it would go as high as it did...in other words, these brain dead XXXXXX took out adjustable rate loans during a period of record low interest rates and did not bother to do any projections to see exactly where that would put them. Frankly to take out an ARM in that environment and not realize that your payments were going to be going up, you would have to be mentally retarded.\n \n \nHere's a suggestion: Prior to signing a mortgage note, the prospective buyer has the paperwork reviewed by an attorney of her/his choice PAID FOR BY THE LENDER OR MORTGAGE BROKER AT THE BROKER'S EXPENSE WITH NO PASS THROUGH.\n\n \n Do you really think an attorney would have stopped these people from signing? The loan provisions that are knocking these people out of their houses are not new or tricky. They are standard stuff. We never had problems to this degree before because credit standards were MUCH, MUCH tighter. \n \n The counterparty in an agreement is not responsible for doing your due dilligence. You do that yourself, and at your own expense. Do you really thing that the $100 that most attorneys woudl charge to review a basic real estate contract is what got people in trouble? Frankly if you cannot EASILY afford to pay an attorney to review such a contract, you have NO BUSINESS signing it.",
