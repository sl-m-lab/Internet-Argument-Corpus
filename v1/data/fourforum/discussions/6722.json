   "There are two primary pro-choice arguments:\n 1. The fetus is not a person.\n 2. The fetus is a person, but the mother isn't required to keep them alive.\n \n Why I believe both are not justifications for abortion:\n \n 1. The first argument can never be proven. We all know this debate to be a slippery slope in either direction. Any attempt to define a clear starting point for personhood appears arbitrary. If you have debated abortion before, you know this to be true. If the argument can never be proven either way, the morally correct thing to do is to not abort, avoiding the risk of committing murder, which I believe is greater than the risk of denying women the ability to avoid an inconvenience, particularly because a pregnancy does not just jump out of the blue.\n \n 2. If there is no obligation to keep the child alive, then a mother should be allowed to leave her baby stranded in the middle of nowhere. Clearly, it is immoral for a parent to leave their 14 month old child in the middle of nowhere to die. However, if this is acceptable, then what about leaving it in a dangerous jungle? What about leaving it floating on an inflatable raft in the middle of the ocean? There is a slippery slope here, as well, that lends itself to allowing a parent to leave their child to die in virtually any setting. However, one might argue that the parent is merely allowed to withdraw their services, but they cannot go out of their way to put the child in danger (i.e. floating on a raft). If this is the case, then what if the mother is on vacation, floating on a raft with her baby, and decides she is tired of taking care of it. What obligation does she have to bring the baby back with her? Now it only matters where the parent is when they make their decision to no longer care for their child, and the slippery slope appears all over again. We end up with a society that allows mothers to leave babies lying around to die in any precarious situation imaginable.",

Now it only matters where the parent is when they make their decision to no longer care for their child, and the slippery slope appears all over again. We end up with a society that allows mothers to leave babies lying around to die in any precarious situation imaginable.\n\n \n This argument is essentially that following the pro-choice argument to its conclusions is not in accordance with our intuitions. But if it is true a mother has the right to leave her baby in a dangerous jungle, this merely proves out intuitions have been incorrect, as they often are.\n \n Nevertheless whether such an allowance by law would result in social acceptance of abandonment is certainly a tenuous position. Certainly in eskimo societies, when there was not enough food to go around, babies were indeed abandoned. But most groups, not under such extreme harsh conditions, even when there is no legal threat, I expect would not provide social acceptance for abandonment. Maybe I just give people more credit tha n you do.\n \n There are several other responses, some argue that the right to place someone in a dangerous position and then abandon them (just as you can not have an abortion which causes the fetus to fall into a volcano upon exit, or force someone to get out of your car travelling at high speed). \n , with creation in a womb excepted since it is a) the least dangerous (indeed only) place for a fetus to be placed, and b) not transferred there, created there ex-nihilo.\n \n Others (see Rothbard, I think For a New Liberty) that babies under a system of private property rights would be treated as property until they reached an age where they could object to this. Under such a system they would be valuable in their own right, and although abandonment would be allowed, there would be monetary incentives in selling rather than abandoning a child.",

It was not only due to food shortages, but also used as a method to improve the male to woman ratio and to avoid conflicts regarding inheritance. The roman-catholic church forbade the practice and managed to make it illegal in most (if not all) european countries. Nevertheless the practice continued for quite some time. I think you give people to much credit if you think that they are uncapable of hidous acts based on material self-interests. But wether legislation matters or not, I do not know.",

Pro-lifers get that there are two parties involved and that a conflict arises between the two. Pro-choicers want to give no say to the unborn (as they don't realize he/she is there) but rather have the women decide the conflict...or rather get it her way. The pro-lifers say \"wait a minute\"...the baby has every right the women has. Above all they both have the right to live (as no right can really come about if you don't have a right to life).

   "Symbiote:\n With all due respect, I find this sort of silly. What you are saying is that, because abortion is correct, and the logic that allows it (under supposition #2) leads to the allowance of leaving babies stranded to die, then leaving babies stranded to die must be allowable. However, which do you think is a more defensible argument: That leaving babies to die is wrong, or that aborting a fetus is not wrong?\n \n Unkerpaulie:\n We aren't debating current law. Similarly, I could turn the tables by assuming abortion was illegal, and then say to you that aborting a fetus is ridiculous because the mother could always go through with the birth and give it up for adoption. Your response would be that she is being forced to carry it against her will. Well, similarly, in your argument, she is forced to put her unwanted child up for adoption against her will, because all she really wants to do is leave it sitting where it is.\n \n Also, after stating \"clearly this is immoral\" I stated \"however, if this were allowable\" because I anticipated your response. Please read more carefully.\n \n Sigma:\n Can people make mistakes? I argue that they can. Could SCOTUS be incorrect in their interpretation? Could the Constitution be faulty? But the fact of the matter is that I do mean morally, as I suppose you mean the word. And yet you state that morals cannot be proven. How is it, then, that I should not kill you? I do not believe that I should, even in the absence of repercussions, do you? Is it because an imperfect document created by imperfect people said so? Is this what you worship?\n \n Prove it? If every time I toss a penny out of my 40th story penthouse in NYC, I may be killing someone, the morally correct thing to do would be not to toss any pennies.\n \n Yes, it must be technically illegal to be labeled \"murder\" by the law. However, is everything that is legal also right?\n \n No, I wouldn't say you WILL be denying women anything. Women have a choice in getting pregnant. But even without that glaring fact, forcing a woman to go through with birth is so absolutely miniscule compared to ending a living human being's life, that our current ignorance and inability to prove the matter either way puts the responsibility on our shoulders to not tolerate abortion.\n \n As for your last response: With any amount of reasonable effort, a woman can avoid getting pregnant in the first place. To abort is to ignore the myriad of options open to a woman who is not ready to have a child. But, even the act of calling this argument disingenuous is to proclaim ignorance of its logic, which, though sound, is not mine, but other pro-choicer's.",

What I'm asking you is what common thread causes a behavior to be acceptable in a given culture. I understand that different cultures reach different conclusions on what is and is not acceptable. But inside each culture, what is their reason for allowing any particular behavior? \n As I said, there are various theories on this and no one has a theory that is even generally accepted by a majority of anthropologists. I suggested that the reason for allowing certain behaviors (these are often referred to a noa) and making others unacceptable (taboo) was a combination of basic instincts and individual experience. That is a direct answer. That is why taboos and noas are different in different geographical areas and different cultures.\n \n \nAfter you've answered that question, you might take it a step further and imagine what a member of that culture might tell you if you could somehow ask them why a certain action was allowed, particularly an action that might seem foreign to either of us.

If I sat down with an ancient Hawaiian I have no idea what he would tell me about that kupu (taboo). Maybe allowing in his shadow to touch the chief presages the man is going to try to kill the chief or that the man is a threat to the people, or is simply a sign of neglectful disrespect that is not allowed. I really don't know. Wilhelm Wendt's theory is that all taboos stem from fear, but what the exact fear is in the Hawaiian example, I am not sure.

A law stating that injuring another with no reason is illegal, is also stating that stabbing a person, kicking them, and hitting them with a bat are illegal. These actions are thus against the law. Hence, that a person may be killed after conception is part of our law precisely because of the way it is interpreted.\n \n I didn't respond because a law stating that I can't hit a random citizen in the face with a baseball bat is also a literal imposition of law. The point is moot. And if your response is that hitting a person in the face is not an \"imposition\" because the law is agreed on by many, then you are only saying that it is a popular law. Popularity has nothing to do with justice (see Preamble), hence, again, the point is moot.\n \n\n The pro-life stance contends that the fetus has a right to life, while the woman has a right to freedom. These conflict in the case of abortion, so who would resolve this issue?\n \n\n Both have a right to life and freedom. Let's say that I do not like to have to look at people when I go to the store. So, when I go to the store, I kill them. I have freedoms, don't I? You see, it is not a case of who has freedom and who doesn't, but a case of when our \"freedoms\" impinge on another person's rights. Abortion is a textbook case. A women's supposed freedom impinges on the rights of the infant, thus it ought not be a freedom at all.\n \n\n This is not my stance, it is simple fact. Blacks didn't \"become\" eligible, they are eligible by the definition of eligibility. This was modified by an amendment, if I remember correctly, defining them as less than a person.\n \n\n Ok, so now you are telling me that blacks became affected, we'll call it, by the preamble due to an amendment. That amendment was passed by a handful of old men. So, now we see that it is not the Constitution, as you said before, that is the all-powerful decider of citizenship, but Congress. What gives these old men the authority to determine who should and who should not be affected by the principles of the preamble?\n \n I said: \n \n\n If you can provide an example, besides abortion, where a person changes the negative direct consequences of their actions to be \"non-negative,\" then I will do my best to provide an example of how that might hurt someone else.\n \n\n You said: \n \n\n You know that you have a chance to get hit by a bus when you cross the street.

And, since you acknowledge that this is a possibility, you should not recieve medical attention since you need to accept the consequences of your actions, isn't that right?\n \n\n The example you wanted:\n \n Ok, now let's say you ran out into the street, and did not take all the \"necessary precautions.\" Let's say that the person driving the vehicle, upon hitting you, swerved into a light pole and was hurt far worse. Let's say there is only one doctor, and if he stops working on the driver to help you, then the driver will die. In this case you should NOT receive the medical attention, at least not now, because to do so would cause the driver much greater loss than it would cause you.\n \n This example is synonymous with abortion. Both the driver and the fetus had no choice but to be in the situation that the mother/uncareful street-crosser put them in. Because of this, the person who put them in their situation may need to hold off on \"altering their consequences\" because it hurts the person whom they put in the situation far worse.",

Hence, that a person may be killed after conception is part of our law precisely because of the way it is interpreted.\n\n \n Except that an interpretation of an already existing law is not making a law to impose upon people, and any interpretation, even leaving the interpretation that already existed, would be exactly the same imposition that you think a new interpretation imposes. Abortion isn't \"part of the law\" in the way you suggest; State law cannot make any decision regarding it.\n \n \n\n I didn't respond because a law stating that I can't hit a random citizen in the face with a baseball bat is also a literal imposition of law. The point is moot. And if your response is that hitting a person in the face is not an \"imposition\" because the law is agreed on by many, then you are only saying that it is a popular law. Popularity has nothing to do with justice (see Preamble), hence, again, the point is moot.\n\n \n It is not. There is currently no imposition of law in regards to abortion (except perhaps on State legislatures), and you propose an imposition of law on citizens. You oppose what you believe is an imposition of law, yet you propose your own?\n \n \n\n Both have a right to life and freedom. Let's say that I do not like to have to look at people when I go to the store. So, when I go to the store, I kill them. I have freedoms, don't I? You see, it is not a case of who has freedom and who doesn't, but a case of when our \"freedoms\" impinge on another person's rights. Abortion is a textbook case. A women's supposed freedom impinges on the rights of the infant, thus it ought not be a freedom at all.\n\n \n A few things, Oliphant.\n \n First, where did this right to life come from? Life is not a principle of the Preamble while freedom is, so what basis do you have for even stating there is a conflict?\n \n Second, flip your example around. In the case where the fetus impinge upon a person's rights (the woman's), the fetus should not have rights. The fetus has no right to life, while the woman still has the right to freedom. In fact, the fetus is not eligible for any rights, but that's besides the point for this point.\n \n Thirdly, I did not ask what the solution should be, I asked who resolves it.\n \n \n\n Ok, so now you are telling me that blacks became affected, we'll call it, by the preamble due to an amendment.\n\n \n No, I am telling you they were prevented from receiving rights because of an amendment, if I remember correctly.\n \n \n That amendment was passed by a handful of old men. So, now we see that it is not the Constitution, as you said before, that is the all-powerful decider of citizenship, but Congress. What gives these old men the authority to determine who should and who should not be affected by the principles of the preamble?\n\n \n The Constitution gives Congress that power.\n \n \n\n Ok, now let's say you ran out into the street, and did not take all the \"necessary precautions.\" Let's say that the person driving the vehicle, upon hitting you, swerved into a light pole and was hurt far worse. Let's say there is only one doctor, and if he stops working on the driver to help you, then the driver will die. In this case you should NOT receive the medical attention, at least not now, because to do so would cause the driver much greater loss than it would cause you.\n\n \n Nice try, except you're wrong. The triage principle is that, in a case where two people may die, the person most likely to survive with help is worked on first, not the least likely. Similarly, in a situation where both woman and fetus would die, the woman is saved first.\n \n Also, in a situation where only the driver may die, you yourself can find help for yourself without any negative consequences to the driver. There is no connection or dependence between you and the driver. The driver receiving medical care does not preclude you receiving it, just not from that doctor and one does not have the right to care from any particular doctor. Your rights are not forfeit for his, as is the case in forced pregnancy.\n \n \n\n This example is synonymous with abortion. Both the driver and the fetus had no choice but to be in the situation that the mother/uncareful street-crosser put them in. Because of this, the person who put them in their situation may need to hold off on \"altering their consequences\" because it hurts the person whom they put in the situation far worse.\n\n \n Except the driver being in that situation does not affect your rights. Whether the driver lives or dies does not affect your rights and you can seek care on your own without the driver being a part of it. If the doctor needed your kidney or blood in order to save the driver, then it would be more analogous. As it stands, it is a very poor analogy.",

There was a State law imposed upon the community, but the older law of the Constitution over-rode that law and removed it.\n \n\n I do not believe that what matters here is the number of written laws, per se. What matters is the interpretation of all those laws combined, and the overall effects they have on the nation. Bear with me for a quick illustration: Let's say an entire nation is composed of one family, with one woman and one man (and we'll say a grandmother, to allow for 2 to 1 decisions). If the woman was pro-choice, and the family agreed to allow abortion, then anyone conceived in that nation would be subject to the death penalty. The laws of the land, whether you view them as restrictive or not, allow for such behavior. Let's say she decides to abort her first (would be) born. Did the aborted have a say in the law? Certainly not. Hence, those things which the laws \"allow,\" were forced upon him without his input in shaping the laws of the land. Now lets reverse it and pretend a one-nation family is pro-life. The woman conceives, wants to abort, but cannot. She gives birth, and the baby lives. Here, no law has been imposed on the community, because everyone that the law takes \"freedoms\" from is able to fairly participate in the forming of the laws of the land.\n \n\n If you alter the interpretation of citizenship (how in heavens name would you do this, anyway?

Not knowing that does not negate this fact.\n \n\n If the woman put the fetus there, how are her rights being impinged? She put it there. Let's say I latch my one year old son's wrist to mine with some sturdy handcuffs to which there is no key. Now he is a real nuisance, and I'd rather not deal with dragging his weight around any longer, so I smash him to a pulp against a wall until he breaks apart and I don't have to drag him around any longer. His presence was impinging on my rights, even though I put him there, so I am justified in this behavior, correct?\n \n\n lol. Quite a dance you're doing here.

I do not believe this is a better scenario than the law that does not prevent abortion.\n \n Is today opposite day? What you are trying to describe is exactly the opposite of reality. You are trying to say that no law forcing a woman one way or the other is an imposition of law, and trying to say a law forbidding abortion is not an imposition of law. This truly baffles me.\n \n \n\n What do you mean we would alter the law but not be imposing any laws that were not imposed already?

Period.\n\n \n It's not new law. It is an old law. New law is legislated.\n \n \n\n So are you now arguing that a fetus is not yet alive in the first place? Because, if it is alive, then it should have the right to not be killed. If it is not alive, then I'll allow that you may be correct in saying that it does not have a right to become living.\n\n \n Um, no. I am not arguing that the fetus is not alive, I am arguing that there is no right to life in the Preamble. Where do you believe this right-to-life you speak of comes from? It is not a liberty. I do see you are hedging by now calling it the \"right to not be killed\". Are you switching to that?\n \n One does not have Constitutional rights merely because one is alive.\n \n \n\n If the woman put the fetus there, how are her rights being impinged?\n\n \n If the fetus is using her body against her will and without her consent, it is violating her rights to her body (though, technically speaking, her rights are only violated if the gov't steps in to stop her from removing the fetus, but you get the point). Unless she signs a legal document signing over her womb, you have no basis to claim the fetus has a right to be there.\n \n \n\n His presence was impinging on my rights, even though I put him there, so I am justified in this behavior, correct?\n\n \n What right is his presence impinging upon, and how is it that killing him is the only way to stop this? Your example is not analogous.\n \n \n\n The \"conflict\" of abortion is as ridiculous as the conflict of my son and I after I latch his wrist to mine. My son's liberties include not being murdered, like anyone in the womb.\n\n \n Your son's liberties stop where they impinge upon another's rights. If killing him were the only way to stop your son from impacting other's rights, killing may indeed be justified. Just like anyone in the womb, your son has zero right to live attached to someone else without that other person's desire or consent, regardless if that other person caused their condition.\n \n You haven't answered my question. Someone must decide conflicts of rights... who is it?\n \n \n\n Ok...\n\n \n Do you understand, or is more clarification needed?\n \n \n\n Do you agree that the Constitution is a document based on the founding father's personal beliefs?\n\n \n Not only their personal beliefs, but yes.\n \n \n\n But there is a connection between your well-being and the driver's. The driver's existence is a physical annoyance, because if he just died right now, the doctor would fix you up and you would be right as rain.\n\n \n However, the driver is not impacting your rights. His presence is not connected to your well-being (the doctor is not enough of a connection) unless he is physically drawing bodily resources from your body. That someone, somewhere is having the doctor care for them and that is the reason you do not receive care is not enough of a connection to be analogous to abortion.\n \n \n\n But I never said your rights were being forfeit in my scenario. My whole point is that the driver is the one who has the right to the doctor, not you.\n\n \n To be analogous to abortion, one party's rights would have to be forfeit.\n \n The driver doesn't have the right to the doctor. You do not have the right to the doctor. You both have the right to medical care, not the care of any specific doctor. If you go into a crowded medical clinic, the fact that others are being treated by doctors does not impact your right to medical care. Again, whether or not you are able to find treatment does not change that you can change your consequences if you are able. You do not have to live with your injuries because you were irresponsible or you caused your condition yourself.\n \n Extreme examples do not provide any meaningful insight into this issue.",

Conception has not occurred, so we know with certainty that the criteria for personhood, whatever they are, have not been met.\n\n my point is that abortion is preventing a human from being born. it cannot be correctly considered murder, because murder only applies after the baby/person is born. but for discussion's sake, lets consider abortion a form of murder. \n \n abortion kills the baby before it has a chance to be born. as such, the woman avoids becoming a parent after having sex. contraceptives kill the sperm/egg before the baby has a chance to be conceived. as such, the woman avoids becoming a parent after having sex\n \n the egg and sperm are essential in forming the embryo which grows ito a fetus. by killing either the egg or the sperm, you essentially kill the source of the embryo. particularly in the case of birth control pills, the egg becomes incapacitated in the mother's body, making it impossible for the baby to be born. \n \n on touching \"personhood\", a person is a product of a unique combination of genes from both the father and mother. the entire composition of genetic information, and therefore all the information about the physical and chemical features of the \"person\" are contained in the sperm and egg nuclei, even before they are fused. therefore, and unfused egg/sperm pair is just as much a potential \"person\" as a fused pair. do you disagree?\n \n for some reason, you have no problem with the morality of killing the sperms or eggs, which are essential for the creation of a born baby, but you have an issue with killing the embryo, which is also essential for the crreation of a born baby. why is this?",

I don't think you'll get a good answer. Apparently at the exact time the sperm goes into the egg, the union becomes a sacred human life, but not before. This is supposed to be because it finally has a whole genome, and it's a new genome. Therefore it is a tragic loss of life when a zygote fails to implant, but not when jillions of sperm and eggs die without making a baby. They don't seem to want to be won over. \n \n God bless.",

They don't seem to want to be won over. \n \n God bless.\n\n how do you suppose all eggs and sperms be preserved? the male and female bodies produce these cells constantly for the major portion of every huma's adult life. in women, from the age of 11-13 they start having menstruation, which is the body's way of safely discarding the unused egg before it becomes toxic. similarly with sperm, which are produced by the millions per day, become problematic if they arent discharged for a long time.\n \n the reason why animals spawn in massive amounts is to ensure that some of the next generation have a very good chance of survival. and it also necessarily means that the vast majority of possible offspring do NOT survive. it makes no sense feeling depressed about the 2 billion sperms that didnt make it, or the hundreds of unfertilized eggs that get flushed down the toilets. these are all potential humans that didnt make it, because the parents decided to not have children at the time, for a number of very legit reasons.\n \n if youre going to be forcing mothers to give birth to a new baby everytime an egg/sperm pair fuses, on the grounds that you dont want a \"precious life to die\", you might as well force to stop having periods/wet dreams, because the same \"precious\" life producing material that is dumped after an abortion is also dumped all the time in every person that has passed puberty",

   "Cone:\n \n \nWhat do you mean by God doesn't exist in the realm of knowledge?\n \nWhat I mean is that God exists in an eternal realm outside of our frame of reference and that we limit God if we believe that he exists in a realm that we can even conceive of. In fact, we have very little knowledge of the universe, let alone of the source of its existence. Knowledge is such a limited sphere. Even we humans understand intuition, instinct, emotion, premonition - these are all outside the realm of \"knowledge\". \n \n \nHmmm. You believe in an all perfect being who has no ability to speak. Even more notably, you believe in the God of Abraham and Moses, the one who said \"Let there be light\" and there was light.\n \nFirst of all, in Genesis \"elohiym\" say, \"Let there be light. \"elohiym\" is a plural, so the correct translation would be \"The Gods (plural) said let there be light.\" Second, I do not limit God to a \"being\". That is a personification of God. As I have said before, \"God made man in his image and likeness and man returned the favor.\" \n \n God is not some chubby guy up in the clouds with a long white beard. God is far beyond the capacity of our minds to fully comprehend. The God of Abraham and the God of Moses is expressed in the \"shem\" of God in Exodus 3, \"hayah hayah\", a most stunning revelation and the basis of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. That \"shem\" indicates that God is both creation and creative force. We have obscured that revelation with our own needs and projections.\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by Howard Beale\n You may believe that so-called \"forming process\" began \"before conception\", but that is a personal belief. I happen to believe that the \"forming process\" does not exist in a time continuum.\n \n\n Could you expound this a little?\n \nWith the caveat that God is beyond my ability to fully grasp, I will tell you what I have come to understand.\n \n God, creation and the source of all creation, does not exist in time, but (for lack of a better word) in eternity; not the simplistic human \"forever\" but a realm beyond that, a realm perhaps where there is no time, no past, no present and no future. There is simply the eternal \"is\", \"was\" and \"will be\": a realm where all eternity exists in the moment, where the oak tree is already present in the acorn... and this doesn't even scratch the surface of the \"shem\" of God given to Moses in Exodus 3.\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by Howard Beale\n That is your religious view, and that is fine, but that is not the only religious view. There are religious views that say that man cannot know the \"mind\" of God. God brings things into material manifestation and removes them from material manifestation... at what time and through what vehicle and for what reason are beyond our ability to know.\n \n\n And this represents your religious view.\n \n\n That statement simply represents my understanding of the old adage, \"God works in mysterious ways.\" Do you disagree with that statement in bold above?\n \n I am not naive, Cone, I know the purpose of your questions. I choose to answer them as honestly and directly as I can. It is fine.",
