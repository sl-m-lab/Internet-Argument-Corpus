   "EU authorities spent the money on strengthening border controls in order to interdict the flow of illicit trafficking in humans and narcotics. And at the same time they aim to liberalize viza regime between Ukraine and EU. It seems to me these measures disagree. It cannot be done for several reasons. First of all emigrants will flood to Europe from Chechnya. And it's common knowledge Chechen \"refugees\" dream of European market development, interloping weapons, narcotics and \"direct labor\". Moreover, it's clear that Chechen extremists' appearance in Europe necessitates the threat to our European security because of very possible terrorist actions. Poland, Slovakia, Czechia and Austria have already learned \"Chechen factor\" by own experience. And once more Brussels is going to open EU borders for them... Splendid!",
