Here's part of it.\n \n \n\"But the resurrection of a dead person from the grave, and his ascension through the air, is a thing very different as to the evidence it admits of, to the invisible conception of a child in the womb. The resurrection and ascension, supposing them to have taken place, admitted of public and occular demonstration, like that of the ascension of a balloon, or the sun at noon day, to all Jerusalem at least. A thing which every body is required to believe, requies that the proof and evidence of it should be equal to all, and universal; and as the public visibility of this last related act was the only evidence that could give sanction to the former part, the whole of it falls to the ground, because that evidence never was given. Instead of this, a small number of persons, not more than eight or nine, are introduced as proxies for the whole world, to say, they saw it, and all the rest of the world are called upon to believe it. But it appears that Thomas did not believe the resurrection; and, as they say, would not believe, without having occular and manual demonstration himself. So neither will I; and the reason is equally as good for me and for every other person, as for Thomas.\" (The Age of Reason, Thomas Paine, from page 249 of the book \"Common Sense and Other Writings\", Thomas Paine, edited by Gordon S.

But if I have committed a crime, every circumstance of the case is changed. Moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty, even if the innocent would offer itself. To suppose justice to do this, is to destroy the principle of its existence, which is the thing itself. It is then no longer justice. It is indiscriminate revenge.\"\n (Thomas Paine, \"The Age of Reason\", as quoted on page 262 of \"Common Sense and Other Writings\", by The Modern Library, 2003) \n\n \n \n \n\" ... I well remember, when about seven or eight years of age, hearing a sermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great devotee to the church, upon the subject of what is called Redemption by the death of the Son of God. After the sermon had ended I went into the garden, and as I was going down the garden steps I revolted the recollection of what I had heard, and thought to myself that it was making God Almighty act like a passionate man that killed his son when he could not revenge himself any other way; and I was sure a man would be hanged that did such a thing, I could not see for what purpose they preached such sermons. This was not one of those kind of thoughts that had any thing in it of childish levity; it was to me a serious reflection arising form the idea I had, that God was too good to do such an action, and also too almighty to be under any necessity of doing it. I believe in the same manner to this moment; and I moreover believe , that any system of religion that has any thing in it that shocks the mind of a child, cannot be a true system.\n \n ... But the Christian story of God the Father putting his son to death, or employing people to do it (for that is the plain language of the story), cannot be told by a parent to a child: and to tell him that it was done to make mankind happier and better is making it still worse, as if mankind could be improved by the example of murder; and to tell him that all this is a mystery, is only making an excuse for the incredibility of it.\n (Thomas Paine, \"The Age of Reason\", as quoted on page 278-279 of \"Common Sense and Other Writings\", by The Modern Library, 2003) \n\n \n I remember having read other pertinent statements in \"The Age of Reason\", but can't find them now in my quick scan of the book.\n \n \n PS: a bit off the topic, but still interesting...\n \n \n\"As to the Christian system of faith, it appears to me as a species of atheism; a sort of religious denial of God. It professes to believe in a man rather than in God. It is a compound made up chiefly of manism with little deism, and is as near to atheism as twilight is to darkness. It introduces between man and his Maker an opaque body which it calls a redeemer ...\"\n (Thomas Paine, \"The Age of Reason\", as quoted on page 268 of \"Common Sense and Other Writings\", by The Modern Library, 2003) \n\n \n and concerning how the false Christian system persecuted those who attempted to advance human knowledge...\n \n \n\"But when a system of religion is made to grow out of a supposed system of creation that is not true, and to unite itself therewith in a manner almost inseparable therefrom, the case assumes an entirely different ground. ... It is then that the truth, though otherwise indifferent itself, becomes an essential, by becoming the criterion, that either confirms by corresponding evidence, or denies by contradicting evidence, the reality of the religion itself. In this view of the case it is the moral duty of man to obtain every possible evidence, that the structure of the heavens, or any other part of creation affords, with respect to the systems of religion. But this, the supporters and partisans of the Christian system, as if dreading the result, incessantly opposed, and not only rejected the sciences, but persecuted the professors. Had Newton or Descartes lived three or four hundred years ago, and pursued their studies as they did, it is most probable they would not have lived to finish them; and had Franklin drawn lightning from the clouds at the same time, it would have been at the hazard of expiring for it in flames.\"\n (Thomas Paine, \"The Age of Reason\", as quoted on page 275 of \"Common Sense and Other Writings\", by The Modern Library, 2003) \n",

   "I remember having read other pertinent statements in \"The Age of Reason\", but can't find them now in my quick scan of the book.\n\n \n Found them!\n \n \n\"The Christian mythologists tell that their Satan made war against the Almighty, who defeated him, and confined him afterwards, not under a mountain [as the earlier mythologists had done with the Giants that Jupiter defeated], but in a pit. It is here easy to see that the first fable [involving Jupiter and the Giants] suggested the idea of the second; for the fable of Jupiter and the Giants was told many hundreds of years before that of Satan. \n \n ...\n \n The Christian mythologists, after having confined Satan in a pit, were obliged to let him out again, to bring on the sequel of the fable. He is then introduced into the Garden of Eden in the shape of a snake, or a serpent, and in that shape he enters into familiar conversation with Eve, who is no ways surprised to hear a snake talk; and the issue of this tete-a-tete is, that he pesuades her to eat an apple, and the eating of the apple, damns all mankind.\n \n ...\n \n Having thus made an insurrection and a battle in Heaven, in which none of the combatants could either be killed or wounded - put Satan into the pit - let him out again - given him a triumph over the whole creation - damned all mankind by the eating of an apple, these Christian mythologists bring the two ends of their fable together. They represent this virtuous and amiable man, Jesus Christ, to be at once both God and man, and also the Son of God, celestially begotten on purpose to be sacrificed, because, they say, that Eve in her longing had eaten an apple.\n \n Putting aside every thing that might excite laughter by its absurdity, or detestation by its prophaneness, and confinding ourselves merely to an examination to the parts, it is impossible to conceive a story more derogatory to the Almighty, more inconsistent with his wisdom, more contradictory to his power, than this story is.\n \n In order to make for it a foundation to rise upon, the inventors were under the necessity of giving to the being, whom they call Satan, a power equally as great, if not greater, than they attribute to the Almighty. They have not only given him the power of liberating himself from the pit, after what they call his fall, but they have made that power increase afterwards to infinity. Before this fall, they represent him only as an angel of limited existence, as they represent the rest. After his fall, he becomes, by their account, omnipresent. He exists every where, and at the same time. He occupies the whole immensity of space.\n \n Not content with this deification of Satan, they represent him as defeating by stratagem, in the shape of an animal of the creation, all the power and wisdom of the Almighty. They represent him as having compelled the Almighty to the direct necessity either of surrendering the whole of the creation to the government and sovereignty of this Satan, or of capitulating for its redemption by coming down upon earth, and exhibiting himself upon a cross in the shape of a man.\n \n Had the inventors of this story told it the contrary way, that is, had they represented the Almighty as compelling Satan to exhibit himself upon a cross in the shape of a snake, as a punishment for his new transgression, the story would have been less absurd, less contradictory. But instead of this, they make the transgressor triumph, and the Almighty fall.\"\n (Thomas Paine, \"The Age of Reason\", pages 250-252 of the book \"Common Sense and Other Writings\", edited by Gordon S.

Are people who are not debt free int eh grip of satan?\n\n All the same, even taking your next breath is a miracle. On the issue of finances (fodder for a thread??) It is without question that the Bible speaks much on finances because that is an indicator of spiritual maturity. Not whether one is filthy rich or dirt poor, but how well one handles the resources entrusted to them by God. \n \n \nYou still have not answered my question. Why all these grand miracles, then NOTHING? Is god dead?\n\n No God is certainly not dead, He is alive!! I do believe that large and great miracles happen today. However, the reason for the miracles during Christ's ministry was to testify to His deity and glory. When the canon of scripture was completed at Revelation, then God's message of repentance and salvation can be conveyed much more effectively. You see, a miracle can have just an emotional response. When Christ spoke about the different types of dirt, He spoke about the shallow dirt and the seed failing to take root. The seed He spoke of is the Word of God.\n \n \nThis is what gets be about religous folks. They tend to talk in a lot of circles, but never answer questions like this.

Then...nothing....yet people still insist on believeing those old fairy tales. Why???\n\n Again, we are in a period of grace. God's Word is complete, so further written revelation is unneccessary. The true test of Evangelical Christianity is observing believers' lives. How they live, how they can have peace and joy in seemingly insurrmountable circumstances, and how they show love to the unlovely. That's faith in action. Not a blind faith, but a faith firmly rooted in the Bedrock of Christ. A very good book I recommend for you is written by Lee Stroble called: The Case For Christ.

   "THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n REFERENCE\n \n McDowell, Josh.

Why? According to him, because nothing strange happened to the Sun. When he saw all those people kneeling, he understood that it was the happening and that is why he photographed it. \n\n \n A little more in depth:\n \n http://www.notfah.com/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Fatima\n \n \nOn what believers call Mary's last visit to the Cova, a crowd of 70,000 people, including reporters from newspapers, were said to have gathered in a torrential rainstorm. Years after the event, some alleged witnesses who had claimed to be in the crowd in 1917 said that the sun changed colours, began spinning in the sky and went completely dark for several minutes before seeming to plunge toward the earth, then returning to its proper place, an event believers call the great Solar Miracle of Fatima. Despite the alleged presence of newspaper reporters, mainstream newspaper coverage around the world was kept to a minimum. However, Avelino de Almeida, a reporter for the secular newspaper O S\u00e9culo (The Century) of Lisbon, who had been dismissive of Fatima in previous articles, saw and reported some of the phenomena. His photographer Judah Ruah saw nothing but shot pictures of the mesmerized crowd looking up, believing that the people's faith was the focal event. Similar reports appeared in O Ordem and other anticlerical newspapers in Portugal.\n \n There is no independent verification of the solar phenomenon, and no movement or other phenomenon of the sun was registered by scientists at the time. According to contemporary reports from poet Alfonso Lopes Vieira and schoolteacher Delfina Lopes with her students and other witnesses in the town of Alburita, the solar phenomena were visible from up to forty kilometers away. Not everyone in the crowd saw the \"sun dance\", including the children, who reported seeing Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and Saint Joseph blessing the people. Some people only saw the radiant colors. Others saw nothing at all. \n\n \n So basically what you have here is reports from a bunch of religous kooks that not only could not be substantiated by scientists or astronomers (and the sun moving like that would be something that shook physics and astronomy to the bone), but could not even be corroborated by different people in the same crowd, who were standing right there, looking at the same sun.\n \n Which is more likely...that the sun danced around in the sky and NOBODY but the devout at Fatima saw it....or that a bunch of devout religous types went to Fatima looking for some kind of miraculous occurence and when none occured, they generated one. Somebody said \"look at the sky....its a miracle...\" an dpeopel wanted to see the miracle, so they did.\n \n Teh \"miracle\" definition makes no sense given the wide disparity in what people reported seeing. The second explanation, though pretty much explains everything, including the disparity in what people saw (after all, if they are creating the \"miiracle\" in their mind, they don't know exactly what to create, unless somebody tells them).",

Show us the extraordinary evidences and we'll accept your extraordinary claims. Until then, reason forces rational people to reject your/Christianity's supernatural claims.\n \n \nBassman: I do believe that large and great miracles happen today.\n\n \n Such as? And keep it in line with the large and great miracles of the Old and New Testament, not something completely lame like, \"I breathed\".\n \n \nBassman: Again, we are in a period of grace. God's Word is complete, so further written revelation is unneccessary.\n\n \n There's no such thing as written revelation: that's a misnomer.\n \n Here, let me let Thomas Paine once again provide REASON, from \"The Age of Reason\":\n \n \nAs it is necessary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I proceed further into the subject, offer some observations on the word revelation. Revelation, when applied to religion, means something communicated immediately from God to man.\n \n No one will deny or dispute the power of the Almighty to make such a communication if he pleases. But admitting, for the sake of a case, that something has been revealed to a certain person, and not revealed to any other person, it is revelation to that person only. When he tells it to a second person, a second to a third, and third to a fourth, and so on, it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons. It is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other; and consequently, they are not obliged to believe it.\n \n It is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call any thing a revelation that comes to use at second hand, either verbally or in writing. Revelation is necessarily limited to the first communication. After this, it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him; and though he may find himself obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent on me to believe it in the same manner, for it was not a revelation made to me, and I have only his word for it that it was made to him.\n (pages 247-248 of Common Sense and Other Writings, The Modern Library, 2003)\n \n\n \n next...\n \n \nBassman: Not a blind faith, but a faith firmly rooted in the Bedrock of Christ.\n\n \n Uhm, that IS BLIND FAITH!\n \n You're little word games don't change the facts.\n \n \nBassman: A very good book I recommend for you is written by Lee Stroble called: The Case For Christ.\n\n \n I may be wrong, but that might be a book I looked at in my local bookstore. If not, it is another book by Lee Strobel (\"The Case for God\"?). Either way, the one I looked through is junk: it runs through, as a major portion of its content, the list of anti-evolution garbage that Jonathan Wells spews out in his disgraceful \"Icons of Evolution\". \n \n There's an alarming number of scientifically ignorant, anti-science Christians spewing out \"science\" books that \"prove\" God exists: they're worthless.",

   "Steeeeve: See..\n http://www.creationevidence.org/scientific_evid/problems_macro/prob_macro.html\n\n \n I did. It's complete rubbish. It's another example of scientifically ignorant, anti-science Creationist spewing out rubbish that is bogus, flawed, refuted, invalid, and ridiculous.\n \n \n \nRESEARCH PROBLEMS WITH MACROEVOLUTION:\n \n 1. ORIGINS -the chance of life originating from inorganic chemical elements by natural means is beyond the realm of possibility (Hoyle )\n\n \n That's abiogenesis, NOT macroevolution. \n \n \"Problem 1\" for macroevolution rejected due to the gross ignorance of the Creationists.\n \n \n2. DEVELOPMENT -to produce a new organism from an existing life-form requires alterations in the genetic material which are lethal to the organism (Maddox )\n\n \n False, for several reasons.\n \n First of all, the Creationist seems to confuse DEVELOPMENT with EVOLUTION. Development is the, well, developmental changes that occur in a single organism; such as a human zygote developing into a human. Evolution, on the other hand, does not occur in a single organism. Development and evolution are different.\n \n Now for the reasons the Creationist's statements are invalid.\n \n 1) We have direct evidence of BENEFICIAL mutations. Any claim that all mutations are deleterious is refuted.\n \n \n\"4.) Adaptation to a Low Phosphate Chemostat Environment by a Clonal Line of Yeast \n \n P.E. Hansche and J.C. Francis set up chemosats to allow evolution of a single clonal line of beer yeast in a phosphate limited (due to high pH) environment. (A chemostat is a device that allows the propagation of microorganisms in an extremely constant environment.) The yeast clones grew slowly for about the first 180 generations when there was an abrupt increase in population density. This was later shown to be due to better assimilation of the phosphate, presumably due to an improvement in the permease molecule. (Permease is an enzyme that controls what is allowed to come into the cell through the yeast's cell membrane.) After about 400 generations, a second improvement in cell growth rates occurred because of a mutation to the yeast's phosphatase (an enzyme that improves the cells ability to use phosphate). The phosphatase became more active overall, and its optimal pH (the pH where it is most active) was raised. Finally, a third mutant appeared after 800 generations that caused the yeast cells to clump. This raised the population density in the chemostat because individual cells were no longer being washed out of chemostat (which is one of the methods that the chemostat uses to maintain very uniform conditions) as quickly as they had prior to the mutation. (This is just speculation on my part, but I wonder if it wasn't under some similar conditions that multi-cellularity became favored over unicellularity - perhaps on a sea bed or river bottom.) \n \n This experiment was repeated, and the same mutations occurred, but in different orders. Also, in one replication, the processing of phosphate was improved by a duplication of the gene that produces phosphatase. This is experimental evidence of an extremely important mechanism in evolutionary history! It is also a particularly elegant experiment because not only was all of this adaptation shown to occur in clonal lines (descended from a single individual), but the authors also determined the exact mutations that caused the improved adaptations by sequencing the genes and proteins involved.\" (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/EvoMutations.html) \n\n \n \n 2) We have verified instances of the origin of a new species in nature.\n \n \n\"The mechanism of sympatric speciation has been experimentally verified for many plants. One example is a group of species, collectively called hemp nettles, that occurs in temperate parts of Europe and Asia. One hemp nettle, Galeopsis tetrahit (2n = 32), is a naturally occurring allopolyploid thought to have formed by the hybridization of two species, G. pubescens (2n = 16) and G. speciosa (2n = 16). This process occurred in nature but was experimentally reproduced. Galeopsis pubescens and G. speciosa were crossed to produce F1 hybrids, most of which were sterile. Nevertheless, both F2 and F3 generations were produced. The F3 generation included a polyploid plant with 2n = 32 that self-fertilized to yield fertile F4 offspring that could not mate with either of the parental species. These allopolyploid plants had the same appearance and chromosome number as the naturally occurring G. tetrahit. When the experimentally produced plants were crossed with the naturally occurring G. tetrahit, a fertile F1 generation was formed. Thus, the experiment duplicated the speciation process that occurred in nature.\" (Biology: Fifth Edition, Eldra Pearl Solomon, Linda R. Berg, and Diana W. Martin, Saunders College Publishing, 1999, p411-412) \n\n \n \"Problem 2\" for macroevolution rejected due to the gross ignorance of the Creationists.\n \n \n3. STASIS -enzymes in the cell nucleus repair errors in the DNA (Barton )\n\n \n And? Is the claim that mutations do NOT occur at all ... that they are all repaired? That would be completely stupid, even for a Creationist. So what's the point? Apparently nothing: just some \"neat sounding\" words thrown together to impress the ignorant.\n \n There is also the fact that we have direct evidence of mutations occurring, despite the actions of DNA repair enzymes. And moreover, we have direct evidence of BENEFICIAL mutations occuring, despite the actions of DNA repair enzymes.\n \n \"Problem 3\" for macroevolution rejected due to gross the ignorance of the Creationists.\n \n \n5. DESIGN -irreducible complexity within the structure of the cell requires design (Denton, Behe ).\n\n \n \n First of all, Denton has rejected his own arguments for design that were based on his claimed inability of \"IC\" biological systems to originate through evolution: that is, he has turned his back on the position he espoused in his 19865 book \"Evolution: A Theory in Crisis\". That leaves only Behe.\n \n There are numerous arguments against Behe's IC. Here are some, off the top of my head.\n \n First, note that Behe uses a double standard. He demands that science fully demonstrate every single step in the production of an \"IC system\", or else it is to be reject; yet, he allows his own ID \"explanation\" to have ABSOLUTELY NO STEPS EXPLAINED. \n \n Second, Behe is guilty of personal incredulity. He can't imagine how something could evolve, therefore, it must not be able to. That's poor, invalid logic.\n \n Third, Behe ignores that massive amount of evidence that points directly to evolution, and instead accepts blind faith that \"God did it\".\n \n Fourth, NOT EVEN BEHE HIMSELF SAYS THAT IC BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEM CANNOT EVOLVE! There's the \"Behe loophole\" of circuitous routes, which he himself leaves open. \n \n Fifth, there's also the fact that Behe's argument addresses ONLY ONE SPECIFIC AND NARROWLLY DEFINED PATH AVAILABLE TO EVOLUTION. \n \n Sixth, Behe also makes contradictory statements in his \"Darwin's Black Box\", at one time claiming this set of parts comprise a particular IC system, then saying elsewhere that it is a different set.\n \n Seventh, Behe also cannot formulate a single CONSISTENT position for the ID origin of IC biochemical systems without it REQUIRING God, being CONTRADICTORY to science, or being extremely silly and unsupportable. \n \n There are more, and some of the above overlap, but the point should have been made. Simple fact is that Behe's argument for design from IC is NOT science: the scientific community at large has said this, and now, as an added little bonus, a court has legally ruled such too.\n \n \n(DNA REPAIR: The genome is reproduced very faithfully and there are enzymes which repair the DNA, where errors have been made or when the DNA is damaged. - D.H.R. Barton, Professor of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, Nobel Prize for Chemistry )\n\n \n And ... ? Mutations still happen. BENEFICIAL mutations still happen.\n \n \n \n(CHANGE WITHIN GENETIC BOUNDARIES: Microevolution does not lead beyond the confines of the species, and the typical products of microevolution, the geographic races, are not incipient species. There is no such category as incipient species. Richard B. Goldschmidt )\n\n \n Goldschmidt was born way back in 1878!!! And died in 1958. Uhm, science has progressed quite a bit since he lived. For the most of his life he didn't even know that DNA was double helix (not determined until 1953), or even that DNA was the genetic material. Goldschmidt didn't know - even at the height of his career - a ton of things your average student taking BIO101 today does.\n \n \n \n(MUTATION ACCUMULATIONS RELENTLESSLY FATAL: Any random change in a complex, specific, functioning system wrecks that system.\n\n \n False premise. Therefore, any conclusion based on it can't be considered correct (without having other, independent evidence showing such).\n \n \nAnd living things are the most complex functioning systems in the universe. Science has now quantitated that a genetic mutation of as little as 1 billionth (0.0000001%) of an animal's genome is relentlessly fatal. The genetic difference between human and his nearest relative, the chimpanzee, is at least 1.6% Calculated out that is a gap of at least 48 million nucleotide differences that must be bridged by random changes. And a random change of only 3 nucleotides is fatal to an animal. Geneticist Barney Maddox, 1992 )\n \n\n \n 1) The Creationist \"forgets\" to mention that the millions of mutations didn't occur all at once, in a single organism, but were spread out across almost 6 million years.\n \n 2) The Creationist apparently doesn't realize that if we take two humans at random and compare their genomes, they will differ at approximately 0.5% of their base pairs. That ~99.5% identity equates to about one difference in every 200 bases. That comes to millions of base pairs differing between two randomly chosen humans, and yet, oddly enough, both will surely be alive!",

   "Obvious Child: Well, DamEtel can be a little angry... I think she's a convert away from religion.\n\n \n Concerning my bitterness and resentment towards those who formerly enslaved my mind, not to mention my wallet and time...\n \n \n\"Although there are no hard numbers that I have ever seen, it is presumable that most Atheists are not natural Atheists but 'born-again' Atheists - people who have been through the conversion experience and who have 'deconverted' or 'reconverted' back to their original Atheism. However, born-again Atheism must be different from natural Atheism because of the experiences that have transpired in the life of the recovered Atheist. Above all, the recoverted Atheist is a former Theist, so he or she has lived that life, believed those beliefs, been part of that community and that world. I can honestly say that I do not know what that is like. But I know from my friendships with (and in one case, marriage to) former Theists that the experience was not always pleasant and the transition back to Atheism, although not always sudden and traumatic, was often painful and difficult but ultimately liberating. Born-again Atheists possess an intimate knowledge of religion from the inside, but the price of that knowledge is often an anger or bitterness toward those who indoctrinated them and the doctrines they were coerced to conform to. But almost universally, the benefit of deconversion is an experience - sometimes for the first time - of liberation and of the right to claim one's mind for oneself.\n (bold and italics added, Natural Atheism, David Eller, American Atheist Press, 2004, p12) \n\n \n I and other atheists who deconverted from Christianity have reasons to feel bitterness and resentment towards those who formerly enslaved our minds. Christians manipulated us, playing on our emotions and deceiving us, with the fundamentalists being the most guilty. For example, while using their grand stage theatrics, they scared us into 'believing' by preaching of fire and brimstone, and of the horrid misery and eternal torment we'd endure in hell, if we didn't believe. They manipulated us through deceit: they cherry picked only the most righteous passages for their sermons, never mentioning the slaughters of innocent women and children - commanded by God - or the incest, rapes, incestuous rapes, murders, and so on, found in their Holy Bible; they falsely claimed that the Bible is the inerrant Word of the Almighty God, containing not even one contradiction; they spewed out half-truths and/or outright lies about evolution; and so on. \n \n The Christians controlled our minds by manipulating our emotions and deceiving us, all the while demanding our money, and our time. We were \"mentally raped\" and we were robbed: they abused their position of authority. And once freed from the shackles of religious mind control, what were we able to finally see? That we were manipulated, misled and abused for ... a bunch of fairy tales! \n \n It is logical that the greater the degree of manipulation Christians used to exert their mind control over us, the greater the degree of resentment and bitterness we have toward our oppressors once freed. Escapees from a fundamentalist church are the most \"mentally abused\" of them all, and bare the worst scars. \n \n We atheists that deconverted - especially from a fundamentalist church - have good reason to feel bitterness and resentment towards the Christians who controlled us; and, in fact, towards all Christians who wish to control this country - or the world! - by trying to force their God and their Jesus down everyone's throats.",

   "With regards to mutation,\n \n \nGenetic Mutations\n \n Materialistic evolution depends on genetic mutations to account for changes in species. Genetic mutations must be invoked by strict naturalist in order to explain how organisms change from one celled organisms to multicellular organisms to marine life to amphibious life to mammals and so on. Jonathan Wells (PhD Yale [Relligious studies] and PhD University of California Berkeley [Developmental Biology]) explains this deficiency:\n \n Mutations are supposed to provide the raw material for evolution, but they can do this only if they benefit the organism, and mutations in developmental genes are always harmful. In fact, the only DNA mutations that are known to be benficial are those that affect immediate interactions between a mutant protein and other molecules. Such mutations can confer antibiotic and insecticide resistance, but they can never lead to the sorts of changes that could account for evolution. DNA mutations cannot even change the species of an animal, much less change a fish into an amphibian or a dinosaur into a bird.3\n \n In addition to the weak evidence for genetic mutations being beneficial in a way that significantly helps the explanatory power of Neo-Darwinism, there is evidence that genes are not the sole factor controlling development in life. I defer again to the expertise of Dr. Wells:\n \n During the industrial revolution, dark (melanic) peppered moths became more common than light moths, until their proportion declined with the advent of pollution-control legislation. The rise and fall of melanism certainly involved changes in gene frequencies, and experiments in the 1950s seemed to show that these were a result of natural selection: when caged moths were released onto pollution-darkened trees, birds preyed more selectively on the conspicuous light moths, and the proportion of melanic moths increased. In the 1970s, however, biologists noticed that the proportions of light and dark moths in the wild did not correlate with bark color, and in the 1980s they learned that peppered moths do not normally rest on tree trunks. So the evidence for natural selection has been discredited, and the relevance of industrial melanism to evolution is in doubt. Unfortunately, in other supposed cases of evolution by natural selection - such as beak differences in Darwin's finches and adaptive differences in Hawaiian fruit flies - the genetic basis is unknown.4\n \n If the basis for development in evolution cannot be attributed to genes, it seems that there is no materialistic basis for the theory. Even if it could be attributed to genes, there is no good reason to suppose genetic mutations occur in any ways that would significantly help the Darwinian model of life. Therefore, the plausibility of evolution becomes weaker in light of the evidence we have about genes and genetic mutations. \n\n \n \n \n\n You consider that a CLAIM?!?!??! Do you even know how to spell 'biology'? :-)\n Careful with the insults...those get you banned here.\n \n \nUhm, you need to support that assertion.\n I believe I read it on one of your sites that offered \"evidence\"...it suggested that the reason we don't have bones is because of a less dense bone back then...\n \n \nLOL!

Henry Morris, in his 1974 book \"Scientific Creationism\" made the claim that K/Ar dates for lava from the 1801 Hulalalei volcano lava flow ranged from 160 million years to 3 billion years old. With results like these, radiometric dating must be totally useless - how could scientists possibly be so stupid as to believe that radiometric dating could be of any merit when a simple lava flow gives such a wide range of dates - right in their own research? As usual with such claims, we'll have to dig a little further to get at the truth. Morris cited a study by Funkhouser and Norton - \"Radiogenic Helium and Argon in Ultramafic Inclusions from Hawaii\" published in the Journal of Geophysics Research, vol. 73, pgs. 4601 - 4607. What Morris didn't bother to inform his readers was that the study concerned xenoliths - fragments of foreign rock broken off by the magmas intrusion through the crust. Since they are not completely melted by the magma, they are in fact much older than the lava flow (with K/Ar dating, what you are really dating is how long it has been since the rock solidified from the molten state - at this point the daughter Argon can no longer escape from the rock). That particular study confirmed (as geologists already suspected) that xenoliths could not be properly dated with the K/Ar method. The Funkhouser and Norton study clearly stated that the \"ages\" determined by K/Ar dating had no geological meaning and also determined that the xenoliths contained excess argon trapped in \"air\" bubbles inside the rock. Of course there was no mention of these details by Morris or any of the internet postings I have seen that still list this \"problem\" - despite the fact that Dalrymple answered it over 10 years ago. In the same paper, Dalrymple goes on to describe in detail several other quotes taken out of context by Creationists.\" (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html) \n",

   "Easyrider: Now in order to believe in evolution, people have to swallow whole the unlikely concept of spontaneous generation (abiogenesis) ... \n\n \n 1) Wrong. Someone could believe that God created the first life and then let evolution do it's own thing. Maybe God intervened only twice in nature: once to create the Universe and once to create Life. People do not HAVE to accept abiogenesis in order to accept evolution.\n \n 2) Spontaneous generation and abiogenesis are not the same thing: the two terms now have two different meanings. Let me explain some of the differences.\n \n Spontaneous generation involves the recurring - throughout all of Earth's history, and under all different kinds of conditions, including those existing today - essentially instantaneous origin of complex life - including things like rats and flies - from nonlife. Spontaneous generation was laid to rest by Pasteur and others. \n \n Abiogenesis, on the other hand, involves the one-time origin of very simple life, over an extended period, about 4 billion years ago. Very simple life here can mean even less than a single cell: a single, self-sustaining, self-replicating molecule capable of evolving would be considered living.\n \n \nEasyRider: ...

That is just one year after Stanley Miller's experiment, which was the experiment that launched a general interest in the study of abiogenesis. If we look at just about any new subfield of science, just one year after it launched, we would see problems it couldn't solve. You need to update your quote arsenal. \n \n Besides, if you have TODAY'S scientists saying that abiogenesis is literally impossible, then why are you relying on such outdated quotes? The fact that you are relying on such an outdated quote indicates that you can't find a recent one saying the same thing.\n \n \nEasyRider: A Swiss mathematician by the name of Charles Eugene Guye computed the odds of such an occurrence at one chance in 10 to the 160th power.

However, variation does not constitute evidence for evolution because variations are but the outcomes of different combinations of already existing genetic information and they do not add any new characteristic to the genetic information. The important thing for the theory of evolution, however, is the question of how brand-new information to make a brand-new species could come about.\n \n\n \n Well, mutations is where that 'brand new' information comes from. It actually is just small changes over time. A new species is when the 'daughter' species can not reproduce successfully with the parent species. This can be caused\n by isolation from the parent species (look at the faeroe island mouse), with a small population. A small population increases the impact of genetic variation.\n \n Isolation might be as simple as the two populations just using different food sources. Any mutation is 'new' information. \n \n \n\n Variation always takes place within the limits of genetic information. In the science of genetics, this limit is called the \"gene pool\". All of the characteristics present in the gene pool of a species may come to light in various ways due to variation. For example, as a result of variation, varieties that have relatively longer tails or shorter legs may appear in a certain species of reptile, since information for both long-legged and short-legged forms may exist in the gene pool that species. However, variations do not transform reptiles into birds by adding wings or feathers to them, or by changing their metabolism. Such a change requires an increase in the genetic information of the living thing, which is certainly not possible through variations.\n \n\n The statement that a change requiring an increase in genetic information and saying that it is not possible through variation is just 100 percent incorrect.\n \n A thread on this board that discusses it is http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=7097\n \n So much for the first link",

   "Some example of the dishonesty of Creationists.\n \n How many evolutionists have been presented with the following quote, by a Creationist, as irrefutable evidence that evolution is impossible? Well, I know that I myself had this happen more than once.\n \n \n\"To suppose the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd to the highest degree.\" (Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species) \n \n\n \n This is an out-of-context quote in that Darwin immediately thereafter says that he can see how eyes could be the product of natural selection. Darwin's statement is analogous to a physicist who is discussing relativity saying, \"I freely confess that it seems absurd to the highest degree that observer A can see event X occur before event Y, whereas observer B can see the same event X occur after the same event Y\"; then the physicist continuing by explaining how relativity theory actually shows that the time order of two events can be different for two observers in relative motion, traveling in opposite directions between the two widely spaced points of interest. What would be the physicist's actual position? That the time order of two events cannot be reversed, or that they can? Obviously, the latter. And anyone who selectively quotes just the \"absurd to the highest degree\" portion in order to try to make it look like he actually believes the opposite is quoting out of context. Same logic applies to the Creationists' out-of-context quote of Darwin.\n \n And now for the evidence supporting the charge of quoting out of context. Here's a more complete version of Darwin's statement, showing what Darwin's actual position on eye evolution is, which is quite different from what the Creationists would have us believe.\n \n \n\"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.\" (Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species) \n\n \n \n And here's another example of Creationist dishonesty: one that I just posted earlier tonight.\n \n \n\"Well, the first popular technique of creationists is to try to find examples of bad radiometric dates and offer these up as proof that radiometric dating is totally unreliable. Henry Morris, in his 1974 book \"Scientific Creationism\" made the claim that K/Ar dates for lava from the 1801 Hulalalei volcano lava flow ranged from 160 million years to 3 billion years old. With results like these, radiometric dating must be totally useless - how could scientists possibly be so stupid as to believe that radiometric dating could be of any merit when a simple lava flow gives such a wide range of dates - right in their own research? As usual with such claims, we'll have to dig a little further to get at the truth. Morris cited a study by Funkhouser and Norton - \"Radiogenic Helium and Argon in Ultramafic Inclusions from Hawaii\" published in the Journal of Geophysics Research, vol. 73, pgs. 4601 - 4607. What Morris didn't bother to inform his readers was that the study concerned xenoliths - fragments of foreign rock broken off by the magmas intrusion through the crust. Since they are not completely melted by the magma, they are in fact much older than the lava flow (with K/Ar dating, what you are really dating is how long it has been since the rock solidified from the molten state - at this point the daughter Argon can no longer escape from the rock). That particular study confirmed (as geologists already suspected) that xenoliths could not be properly dated with the K/Ar method. The Funkhouser and Norton study clearly stated that the \"ages\" determined by K/Ar dating had no geological meaning and also determined that the xenoliths contained excess argon trapped in \"air\" bubbles inside the rock. Of course there was no mention of these details by Morris or any of the internet postings I have seen that still list this \"problem\" - despite the fact that Dalrymple answered it over 10 years ago. In the same paper, Dalrymple goes on to describe in detail several other quotes taken out of context by Creationists.\" (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html) \n\n \n \n Here's another example.\n \n \n\"On page 123 of EVOLUTION? THE FOSSILS SAY NO! , [Public School Edition, Creation-Life Publishers, San Diego, 1978], Duane Gish says, \n \n \"In a 1937 publication, Boule referred to the Sinanthropus skulls as \"monkey-like'(36).\" \n \n The reference to this quote reads, \"36. M. Boule, L'Anthropologie, 1937, p. 21.\" \n \n Again on page 129, Gish writes: \n \n In an article published in 1937 in L'Anthropologie (p. 21), Boule wrote: 'To this fantastic hypothesis [of Abbe Breuil and Fr. Teilhard de Chardin], that the owners of the monkey-like skulls were the authors of the large-scale industry, I take the liberty of preferring an opinion more in conformity with the conclusions from my studies, which is that the hunter (who battered the skulls) was a real man and that the cut stones, etc., were his handiwork [the nature of this stone industry will be discussed later].'\n \n A quick glance at page 21 of the Boule article shows nothing like this quotation anywhere on the page. Nothing about monkeys is to be found. Moreover, the complete quotation is not to be found anywhere in the entire article, ruling out the possibility that Gish is merely guilty of sloppy scholarship and twice cited the wrong page number. \n \n On the preceding page, p. 20, we do find a fair portion of the text in question: \n \n \"To this hypothesis, as fantastic as it is ingenious, I may be permitted to prefer one which seems to me to be just as satisfactory, being simpler and more in conformity with the totality of what we know: the hunter was a true man, whose stone industry has been found and who made Sinanthropus his victim!\"\n \n Assuming the material in square brackets is material inserted by Gish - in conformity with accepted scholarly practice - we still must ask whence came the crucial phrase, \"that the owners of the monkey-like skulls were the authors of the large-scale industry\"? \n \n That Gish (or a friend who could read French) had indeed seen page 20 is evident from his next paragraph, which gives a reasonable translation for a phrase which I have translated above: \"more in conformity with our whole body of knowledge.\" But where - page 20 or anywhere in the article - does Gish find justification for the conclusion of this paragraph: \n \n \"... Sinanthropus ...must have been a large monkey-like or ape-like creature\"? \n [emphasis added by author of web page]\n \n Nowhere does Boule ever suggest that Peking Man was monkey-like. Unlike Gish, Boule actually i]was[/i] an expert in primate anatomy and it is inconceivable that he could have been so stupid as to suggest that the Peking remains belonged to forty monkeys ...\" (http://www.atheists.org/evolution/maculateDeception.html) \n\n \n Anyone up for another one? :-) This time it's ID Creationists being dishonest.\n \n \n\"DISCOVERY INSTITUTE MISREPRESENTS SCIENTIST'S WORK \n \n Use of out-of-context quote is an attempt to discredit PBS's Evolution series \n \n In a press release issued September 20, the Discovery Institute (DI) quoted Arizona State University anthropologist Geoffrey Clark as stating \"we select among alternative sets of research conclusions in accordance with our biases and preconceptions--a process that is, at once, both political and subjective.\" The DI goes on to assert that Clark suggested \"that paleoanthropology has the form but not the substance of a science.\" \n \n The National Center for Science Education (NCSE) asked Dr. Clark to comment on the DI's use of his statement. He replied: \n \n In an effort to discredit the PBS Evolution series, the quotes attributed to me and circulated on the creationist Discovery Institute's website were taken completely out of context. I do not believe, nor have I ever argued, that paleoanthropology is not a scientific endeavor.

   "Another example of Creationist dishonesty.\n \n \n\"In another page, the Jehovah's Witness Life booklet quotes biologist Richard Lewontin as saying: \"\"Zoologist Richard Lewontin said that organisms 'appear to have been carefully and artfully designed.' He views them as 'the chief evidence of a Supreme Designer.' \" (WTBS, p. 143). The implication here is that Lewontin himself believes that life was intelligently designed by a \"Supreme Designer\". In fact, Lewontin believes no such thing. As he explained in a letter to a creationist publication debunking the misquote, \"The point of my article, 'Adaptation' in Scientific American, from which these snippets were lifted, was precisely that the 'perfection of organisms' is often illusory and that any attempt to describe organisms as perfectly adapted is destined for serious contradictions. Moreover, the appearance of careful and artful design was taken in the nineteenth century before Darwin as 'the chief evidence of a Supreme Designer.' The past tense of my article ('It was the marvelous fit of organisms to the environment ... that was the chief evidence of Supreme Designer') has been conveniently dropped by creationist Parker in his attempt to pass off this ancient doctrine as modern science.\" (Lewontin, \"Misquoted Scientists Respond,\" Creation/Evolution VI, Fall 1981, p. 35) Parker's selective editing, repeated later by the Witnesses in their tract, can only be viewed as a deliberate attempt to distort Lewontin's meaning and make him say what creationists would like to hear him say.\"\n (http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/2437/misquote.htm) \n\n \n Numerous other sites confirm these facts.",

Yet it has been accepted almost as an article of faith in the modern world. However, as the following shows there are many within the scientific community who have voiced serious doubts over what still remains no more than a theory. Don't expect the mainstream media to make too much of the following though; the powers that be would rather we accept Darwin's theory as a proven fact rather than question it. Because that might lead us to question other accepted notions and dogmas, which in turn might even prompt us to start thinking for ourselves. And that is something the powers that be do not want to happen; their power rests on our acquiescence, which in turn depends on our ignorance, cultivated and conditioned by the mainstream media. Ed.\n \n\n \n Wel, this is a statement that shows a total ignorance what a scientific theory is, It immediatley uses the logical fallacy of 'Equivocation' , using the laymans term for 'theory' rather than the definition for a scientific theory. The way science works, is osmeone comes up with a model, and then trys to disprove it. If it goes through enough testing, and can not be disproved, it becomes a 'theory'. The more testing that happens, the stronger a theory it is. Evolution has gone through 150 years of testing, and have not been able to be disproved, It is probably the best understood scentific theory there is.\n \n As for the statemetns from the various people below, that is the logical fallacies known as 'Appeal to Authority'. The vast majority of those people are not biologists. None of those are statements from a peer reviewed scientific journal. Most are statemetns built on ignorance outside of their field.

When you claim something in biology that is as ridiculous as 2 + 2 = 7 is in math, and I show that you are wrong, and you \"refute\" me by simply restating that '2 + 2 = 7', and I point out again that you are wrong and don't know what you're talking about, and you 'refute' me against by simply restating that '2 + 2 = 7', it does get tiring, and it does get us nowhere, and we could go back and forth forever about it. But can you see, in this math analogy to what is happening in our biology discussion, WHY this is the case?\n \n Oh, and here's something about the invalidity of Creationism you might want to read.\n \n \nIn addition to the fallacious pedagogy of the two model approach, Section 4(a) lacks legitimate educational value because 'creation science' as defined in that section is simply not science. Several witnesses suggested definitions of science. A descriptive definition was said to be that science is what is \"accepted by the scientific community\" and is \"what scientists do. ...\n \n More precisely, the essential characteristics of science are:\n (1) It is guided by natural law;\n (2) It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;\n (3) It is testable against the empirical world;\n (4) Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n (5) It is falsifiable (Ruse and other science witnesses)\n \n Creation science as described in Section 4(a) fails to meet these essential characteristics. ...\n \n ...\n \n Creation science, as defined in Section 4(a), not only fails to follow the canons defining scientific theory, it also fails to fit the more general descriptions of \"what scientists think\" and \"what scientists do\". The scientific community consists of individuals and groups, nationally and internationally, who work independently in such varied fields as biology, paleontology, geology and astronomy. Their work is published and subject to review and testing by their peers. The journals for publication are both numerous and varied. There is, however, not one recognized scientific journal which has published an article espousing creation science theory described in Section 4(a). Some of the State's witnesses suggested that the scientific community was 'close-minded' on the subject of creationism and that explained the lack of acceptance of the creation science arguments. Yet no witness produced a scientific article for which publication had been refused. ...\n \n ...\n \n The methodology employed by creationists is another factor which is indicative that their work is not science. A scientific theory must be tentative and always subject to revision or abandonment in light of facts that are inconsistent with, or falsify, the theory. A theory that is by its own terms dogmatic, absolutist and never subject to revision is not a scientific theory.\n \n The creationists' methods do not take data, weigh it against the opposing scientific data, and thereafter reach the conclusions stated in Section 4(a). Instead, they take the literal wording of the Book of Genesis and attempt to find scientific support for it. The method is best explained in the language of Morris in his book (Px 31) Studies in The Bible and Science at page 114:\n \n *************************************\n ... it is ... quite impossible to determine anything about Creation through a study of present processes, because present processes are not creative in character. If man wishes to know anything about Creation (the time of Creation, the duration of Creation, the order of Creation, the methods of Creation, or anything else) his sole source of information is that of divine revelation. God was there when it happened. We were not there ... Therefore, we are completely limited to what God has seen fit to tell us, and this information is in His written Word. This is our textbook on the science of Creation!\n *************************************\n \n The Creation Research Society employs the same unscientific approach to the issue of creationism. Its applicants for membership must subscribe to the belief that the Book of Genesis is 'historically and scientifically true in all of the original autographs.' The Court would never criticize or discredit any person's testimony based on his or her religious belief. While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with a conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of investigation.\n \n ...\n \n The conclusion that creation science has no scientific merit or educational value as science has legal significance in light of the Court's previous conclusion that creation science has, as one major effect, the advancement of religion. ...\n \n (William A. Overton in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas, Western Division)\n",

From there to the assumption that this Great Unknown Thing is somehow like us - that we were created in its image; that it knows or cares whether we live or die; that it cares enough, in fact, to issue directives as to what we can do with our genitals; all of this is a gigaparsec leap from the original conclusion.

Now Barney himself, though dead, was baptized and will be saved.\n \n Because of this weird belief (among others the Mormons hold), Mormons collect genealogies in order to go back and baptize dead people who never were Mormon. One area this has caused a lot of hard feelings is their acquiring names of Jewish people that died in the Holocaust, then baptizing them into Mormonism by proxy.

It would not prove that it DID happen this way. Abiogenesis is an event or set of events in the past.

Why don't you simply provide us with actual examples, with full references and sufficient quoted material to demonstrate what you say?\n \n \n \n PS: Keep this in mind though: It is NOT enough to show origin of life scientists talking about evolution. Why? Because once the OOL scientists assume they have a self-replicating molecule, and therefore already have life in hand, they still want to explain how that first life form became a cell over time, so will discuss the evolution of the molecule into more complex aggegates until arriving at a cell.\n \n This is a historical issue in that life was first defined, inductively, as consisting of one or more functioning cells, with the cell being the fundamental unit of life. In fact, most college biology texts to this day still continue to present this kind of definition for life. But this is NOT the case for scientists actually studying abiogenesis: they do NOT have to get all the way up to a cell before they have explained the origin of life - all they need to do is explain the origin of a self-sustaining, self-replicating molecule and they're done: they will have explained the origin of life.\n \n So what you need to do is provide us with numerous examples of origin of life scientists using evolution to explain the origin of the first life - that is, the first self-sustaining, self-replicating molecule.",

   "Again, you've missed the point. Scientists employ the study of evolution all the time to get to the origins of life. These two sciences are inter-related.\n\n \n They're only a bit related, in that they both study life. And while evolution is used to trace how living things have changed back through time, it has never been used to go all the way back to the beginning. Evolution simply isn't designed to do that, it's the wrong field of study. This isn't to say that the question isn't being examined. It is, via the science of abiogenesis. How life started is a different question than how life changes. Thus, we have to sciences to study these different questions. I don't get why some people think this is such a big deal, or why they insist on conflating the two.",

This is not a black/white, on/off issue. I never said they use evolution to \"explain\" the origins of life. What I am saying is that they use evolution in the study of the origins of life. Like I said, it's silly to indicate that these two sciences are so unrelated when they ARE related. And abiogenesists USE the study of evolution to move back to those origins. (SURELY you realize this.) No one is trying to claim they are the SAME, I'm just taking issue with your idea that they are completely unrelated and people who respond to defenders of ID that evolution isn't relevant because it's not about the origins of life. Its goal as a science may not be to prove the origins of life, but it's used in the study of the origins of life. You know this.\n \n \nKeep this in mind though: It is NOT enough to show origin of life scientists talking about evolution.\n\n \n And there's your backdoor--you've thrown that in because you indeed know that the study of evolution IS used as a tool by people studying the origins of life. It certainly IS enough that they talk about it, because it shows that evolution is related to this study. This idea that there is a definitive, absolute black and white dividing line between these two sciences is just as ridiculous as claiming that biology and chemistry do not overlap and inter-relate, or astronomy and physics. \n \n Yet even if that WERE the case, it still wouldn't change the point that ID proponents make. Oppose them with the science of evolution OR abiogenesis, their position can remain the same.",

The goals of these two disciplines are not the same, and the one is not dependant upon the other. They are obviously related in that both are concerned with living matter, but the origin of life is peripheral to the study of evolution and abiogenesis is not terribly concerned with the mechanisms which drive resultant biodiversity.",

   "And more specifically, there is a definite difference between the two fields of study and the theories behind them.\n The study of evolution concerns itself with, at one level, natural selection, environmental pressures on a species etc, and at another level, adaptive mutation, genetics and speciation. This holds true all the way back to the earliest forms of life that we know about.\n Abiogenesis, although I freely admit I know little of the studies that have been done and the theories proposed, I assume to be more based on pure chemistry, albeit of an incredibly complex variety, and probably incorporates some kind of complexity/chaos theory as a basis for exploring possibilities.",

That's the position creationists take, and that was the point that Strel was arguing against when you called his position a cop out. Whetever similarities the two studies have, the key difference between them, for the purposes of this argument, is that evolution doesn't seek to answer the question \"how did life start\" and abiogenesis does.",
