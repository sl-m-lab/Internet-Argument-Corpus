   "Max Baucus, recipient of millions of dollars in campaign donations from the health insurance and pharmaceutical industry (see previous thread for article and specifics), has finally yielded to public pressure concerning single payer health care, and is meeting tommorow with single payer advocates.\n \n Single payer is supported by the majority of Americans and medical professionals. Yet Baucus has been shutting our many voices out of the health care reform discussion, while having this blatant conflict of interest due to these contributions.\n \n It's been an awful lot to go through to get to this one point. Protests around the country, the Baucus 13 who were arrested, email and letter writing campaigns, the many nurses who stood in silent protest during the Senate Finance Committee hearing to turn their backs on that individual and walk out. \n \n Baucus' office seems to have enough chutzpah to even leak that, the meeting is empty of meaning anyway. (Which is clear to anyone listening to Baucus talking, to begin with. He just goes through the motions of being \"sincere\". He \"listens sincerely\" to Americans and then does what his masters bid him.)\n \n But I think it's a sign of progress, and sooner or later, we shall win. The change to a single payer system is inevitable.\n \n So those who were feeling earlier dismayed, take heart.\n \n As for Max Baucus, after all this, what will his future hold? Will he be able to stay in politics? Will the average American like him? Will he be the man everyone remembers as \"the guy who ****** Americans over on health care for the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries?\"\n \n I still think he should step down.\n \n -------------\n \n Baucus to Meet with Single-Payer Advocates\n by John S. Adams\n HELENA - Sen. Max Baucus is set to meet with five single-payer health care advocates in Washington, D.C., this week.\n \n Baucus, as chair of the Senate Finance Committee, has made health care reform his top priority this session. However, Baucus has consistently said single-payer - a system in which the federal government acts as the nation's sole health insurance provider - is off the table.\n \n \"For more than a year, Senator Baucus has met with thousands of people, representing hundreds of views on how to reform our health care system,\" Baucus spokesman Ty Matsdorf stated in an e-mail. \"This meeting is no different. Max hopes to talk, and listen, to these folks totry and find the best way to make sure every Montanan has access to quality, affordable health care.\"\n \n Last week, members of Baucus' staff held 20 listening sessions across the state on health care reform. At several of those meetings, Montanans expressed anger over Baucus' steadfast refusal to consider a single-payer option.\n \n Last month Baucus had 13 protesters removed from Senate Finance Committee hearings after the protesters demanded that single-payer advocates be given a seat at the table during health care reform hearings.\n \n According to the Web site SinglePayerAction.org, Baucus will meet with Dr. David Himmelstein, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP); Dr. Marcia Angell, senior lecturer, Harvard Medical School and former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine; Dr. Oliver Fein, associate dean, Cornell Weill Medical School and president of PNHP; Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the California Nurses Association; and Geri Jenkins, president of California Nurses Association.\n \n Angell said the group plans to urge Baucus to give serious consideration to Congress' two primary single-payer bills, S. 703, by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and H.R. 676, by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.\n \n \"We will make a case that there should be full hearings on Sanders' bill, and we'll make the case that the (Congressional Budget Office) should cost-out the Sanders and Conyers bills,\" Angell said in an interview Monday. \"We'll make the case that single-payer advocates should have a chance to meet with the president. We will argue for holding public hearings on health reform that include single payer witnesses.\"\n \n Matsdorf said the June 3 meeting was scheduled prior to last week's well-attended health care listening sessions, but Angell said she believes the pressure Montanans put on Baucus in recent weeks helped open the door for Wednesday's meeting.\n \n \"I think Sen. Baucus may be surprised at the amount of push-back he has gotten for just ruling (single-payer) off the table,\" Angell said. \"It may indicate that he's starting to feel pressure, and that's all for the good.\"\n \n Baucus to meet with single-payer advocates | greatfallstribune.com | Great Falls Tribune\n \n ---------------------",
