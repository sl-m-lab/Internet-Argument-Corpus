   "So basically nothing has changed in Iraq other than leadership except on a per/year basis, where we're far ahead of his kill record.\n\n \n \n \n During Saddam's reign, there were over 600,000 civilian executions in Iraq that were documented. \"Human Rights Watch reports that in one operation alone, the Anfal, Saddam killed 100,000 Kurdish Iraqis.\" During Saddam's reign, his regime killed between 75 and 125 Iraqi civilians each day, for 8000 days. \n \n Now look at the deaths in Iraq after our invasion. \"While America mourns the deaths of more than 1,000 of its sons and daughters in the Iraq campaign, the U.S. toll is far less than the Iraqi. No official, reliable figures exist for the whole country, but private estimates range from 10,000 to 30,000 killed since the United States invaded in March 2003.\" Now, some estimates put it as high as 30,000. These deaths are not just by the US troops. They include terrorists attacks, insurgent uprisings, beheadings, and also deaths caused by US troops. \"By contrast, taking at face value Iraq's Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf's recent claims of 500 Iraqi civilian deaths since the start of the campaign we are left with the tragedy of 38 civilian deaths daily since the start of the war. In other words, even accepting the Iraqis own numbers and the highly-suspect assertion that all were caused by US weapons, and discounting the numbers of humanitarian organizations, the civilian death toll has, in fact, fallen since the start of the war. Indeed, it has fallen precipitously.\"\n \n How does that show that the country was better under Saddam? At least our deaths are usually accidental. We don't just pick people out, torture them, and then murder them, unlike Saddam. Ours are in the name of freedom for Iraqis, not in the name of terrorizing and oppressing them.\n \n \n \n \n (http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/news/breaking_news/9612107.htm)\n (http://www.gbn.org/ArticleDisplayServlet.srv?aid=2400&msp=1242)",

   "Got a link to that Nostradomus thing, Cookie? Sounds interesting.\n\n \n \n I heard it on the radio. He has also predicted that 3 large comets would hit the Earth in September 2004. Basically everything he said was so vague that you could basically interpret it any way you wanted.\n \n \n Here is Nostradamus' prediction about JFK's assassination...\n \n \n The great man will be struck down in the day by a thunderbolt. An evil deed, foretold by the bearer of a petition. According to the prediction another falls at night time. Conflict at Reims, London, and pestilence in Tuscany (PON, p. 33).\n \n \n Please note that the facts reveal that there was no specific mention of the name Kennedy as you might have thought, or of his time frame or century, neither was it stated that it would be the brother or even a relative who would \"fall at night time.\" Furthermore, as we look back into history, how did the Kennedy assassinations trigger pestilence in Tuscany? In spite of all of this, however, one of his devotees wishes to understand this quatrain as meaning: \n \n The first three lines here may apply to the assassinations of the two Kennedy brothers. John F. Kennedy was shot down (thunderbolt) in broad daylight at Dallas, Texas on 22nd November 1963 by the psychopath, Lee Harvey Oswald. The other man linked with him who is killed at night, was his brother Robert F. Kennedy who was shot down on 5th June 1968 in the early morning while celebrating his victory in the presidential primary elections at a hotel. Line 2, the fact that the assassination had been told by the bearer of a petition may refer to the many death threats John F. Kennedy and his brother received during their terms of office. The troubles in France, England and Italy would refer to the world repercussions of these assassinations (PON, p. 33).\n \n \n \n This prediction refers to Nostradamus predicting Hitler's uprising...\n \n \n Beasts wild with hunger will cross the rivers, the greater part of the battlefield will be against Hitler. He will drag the leader in a cage of iron, when the child of Germany observes no law (PON, p. 82).\n \n \n This is what that supposedly means: \n One of Nostradamus' most remarkable series of quatrains, with the name Hitler given in anagram as Hister. There can be little doubt that Hitler is implied; who else could be so well described by the last line, the German who observed no law? In 16th-Century handwriting the resemblance is even closer with the use of the long s, Hifter. Commentators before 1930 understood the Hister to be the river Danube, from its latin name Ister. But Hitler recognized himself in these quatrains by the mid 1930s and Goebbells made great propaganda out of them in the pre-war party years. Evidence of this is found in many sources, chiefly Ellic Howe's book 'Nostradamus and the Nazis'. During the first year of the Second World War the development of the war was to a great extent dependent upon the rivers crossed by the Germans who came into Europe in a never-ending stream looting and pillaging (farouches de faim) (PON, p. 82).\n Notice: it is admitted that before 1930 it was understood that Hister (not Hitler) was the subject of the quatrain! \n \n \n \n \n You can see that his prediction are so vague that you cannot come to the conclusion what he actually meant. Also, why did you refer to me as a cookie?",

If that democracy and election had came from within, instigated by the Afghanistan people, not at the point of guns wielded by the US, I would be in agreement. \n \n We (the US) seem determined to follow in the footsteps of mother England when that nation was at the peak of empirical power in determining what's best for other nations using military power, Christian morality and bought individuals to establish puppet governments. There are few 'enlightened' nations from that era that I'm aware of who haven't gone through continual civil war, ethnic genocide and collapsed economies. We're on the same road without the financial strength or military manpower to achieve the forced implementation of democracy using puppet governments in much more than a couple of third tier nations. \n \n Our imperialistic foreign policy is allowing extremist Islamic groups to financially bleed us out at their leisure and at minimal expense to them.

   "So when I found a better source of information I posted it. Showing my mistake.\nActually, nothing in your excerpt shows your mistake. If you meant to set the record straight, you could have said so. On the contrary, you not only failed to note a mistake, but the excerpt you selected seems especially intended to support your earlier claim. You give the reader no reason to think otherwise.\n \n I'll be specific. You had stated that the Communist party was elected to power. Then you followed with an excerpt from Sayed Reshtya's book:\n \n \nAfter eight years of antagonism, the two groups united to become the \"People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan\", under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki, the Khalk leader, who was to become President of Afghanistan. \n \n Babrak Karmal, the Parcham leader, would only be Vice-President, and later, for a few months, Ambassador in Prague. This shows the irreconcilability of the Afghans: once an enemy, always an enemy until death... as we were to see.\nIt is clear that these first two paragraphs of your excerpt concern two Marxist factions, the Parcham and the Khalq. There is also mention that the leaders of these factions went on to become president and vice-president. It appears to me that this opening to your excerpt is especially meant to support the claim that the communist party was elected. You counter by saying that the excerpt was meant to show your mistake, though you neglected to note at the time a mistake had even been made.\n \n Moving on, let's look now at the more pertinent part of your excerpt:\n \n \nThe new Constitution was accepted by the Constituent Assembly and he was elected, in March 1977, as President of the Republic for a term of six years.\nWhat's remarkable here of course is the author's contention that Mohammad Daoud Khan was elected as president. Did you pause to consider by exactly what process Daoud was elected? Did you corroborate the author's opinion with an independent reference on Afghan history, or was Reshtya's personal assessment simply accepted at face value? Indeed, since it seems from your URL that the quote is a translation of the original text, one may wonder if the word 'elected' is even Reshtya's own choice.\n \n \nIt does indicate that there has been at least one election in Afghanistan previous to the one just held which was the main point.\nOr perhaps it indicates that with a keyword search you found an article that mentions 'elected' and 'president' in the same sentence. A keyword search is fine for starters, though if you had made some further effort to verify the opinion that Daoud was elected, you might have quickly learned that it in no way resembled the Afghan general election held last Saturday. Your attempt to liken the two events shows how seriously you have misconstrued the meaning of the word election as used in your excerpt.\n \n Just about every media source has characterized the recent presidential election as the first-ever in Afghan history. That alone should have prompted you to question your conclusion that you had uncovered another 'election' that the international media had overlooked.\n \n So what the real story with Daoud and what sort of election transpired in 1977? Prince Daoud was cousin to the king and took power in 1973 in a nearly bloodless coup while the king was in Italy for medical treatment. He purged the military and established his own political party, the National Revolutionary Party, which became the focus of all political activity. He drew up a constitution that would establish a one-party system of government. Resistance to his regime was suppressed.\n \n Those were the circumstances that existed in Afghanistan when Daoud was elected in 1977. You say your main point was to show that at least one election had been held in Afghanistan prior to the one just held. Yet in truth there has never before been a general election where millions of Afghans could vote. \n \n The process that elected Daoud in 1977 involved no political parties, nor any formal vote. It is what the Afghans call a loya jirga--literally, a 'grand council'. Such councils have been a feature of Afghan society for centuries. To call a loya jirga an 'election' is to use the term very loosely. Besides, there have been more than a dozen loya jirgas in the last century alone. Indeed, several important ones have been organized just since the Taliban were ousted from power.\n \n In my view, there's no equality to your argument. On the one hand you have a 1977 council meeting of less than 400 hundred attendees who, without voting, endorsed Daoud as president of a one-party system of government. While on the other hand you have last week's presidential election in which millions of men and women cast ballots after a period of campaigning by multiple political parties. If you don't see there's a substantive difference between a loya jirga and a nationwide general election, then so be it. What's important is that the Afghan people know the difference, and last week they overwhelmingly embraced it.\n \n One last point, since a loya jirga is how you meant to show that there has been at least one prior election, it's seems odd that you go back to an obscure 1977 meeting that predates the Soviet invasion. Why not simply point to the current era? After all, in June 2002 a loya jirga with roughly 2000 delegates was held in a large tent on the grounds of Kabul Polytechnic University. At that session, Hamid Karzai was named as President for a two-year term, and the transitional government was formed that took office soon afterwards.",
