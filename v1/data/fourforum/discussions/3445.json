Absolutely, we are fighting terrorists in Iraq. But are they the SAME terrorists. That's the disagreement. How will we ever know? We're just all guessing.\n \n The definition of \"terrorist\" is just way too broad. We're defining a terrorist as anybody who uses these unsavory behind the back car bomb, etc. methods. It's their methodology that is so offensive. Yes. It is offensive. It's just plain dirty. But is it correct to fashion a foreign policy where we, by default, group all who use the same offensive war tactics with the WTC. That's all terrorism is. It's an offiensive war tactic. And what's more it's the offensive war tactic of choice in the Middle East. The word is being very loosely used to define an undefined enemy and then lump them all together to invoke the desired emotional response from Americans.\n \n Now a new word -- \"insurgents\". At least we all know who that is. But that line is a bit blurry, too, because an insurgent is also a terrorist. Why is an insurgent an insurgent? Obviously, because they're in bed with the WTC guys. And we're back to \"terrorist\" and the desired emotional response from Americans.\n \n The \"war on terrorism\" to me sounds too reminiscent of the \"war on drugs\". To GWB: Please, when defining an enemy, use a proper noun. If we can't capitalize it, maybe we should rethink it.",

It's very difficult to come up with a valid definition of terrorism. My definition also describes people who bombed family planning clinics. Does their motivation matter? It's it only valid to call them terrorists if they hit civilians? Yet one more reason why I can't get behind the war on terror. I can't define it -- how can I get behind it.
