If you read your Bible it will tell you that all the disciples sold all their possessions and gave the money to the Apostles. There was a odd quirk or two like say you sold your property, but wanted to keep some of the money. After all it was yours, but let's say you sell it and get 1,000 shekels. You tell the Apostles while placing it at thier feet800. The Apostles being the understanding and forgiving types decide to bless you and send you to God for judgement right there on the spot. Don't think to hide it with your spouse because they will kill her to. \n \n Seems like an extreme response for such an odd scenario. There is a contradiction in there somewhere I am sure, Love thy neighbor, thou shalt not kill, a rich man going to heaven. I don't know maybe not. Afterall the Apostle were really just taking the money and redistributing the wealth as every man needs. Personally I have never heard that discussed amoung conservative Christians and appearantly it was legal because they were thrown in jail shortly after but for preaching not murder, at least that is what the story says.",

Passover is also called \"Passover Week,\" so there is more ambiguity. After 2,000 years I don't see it as amounting to a hill of beans.\n\n \n Mark (before the last supper... the Last Supper itself was the Passover meal according to Mark) 14:12: \n \n \nNow on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover lamb, His disciples said to Him, \"Where do You want us to go and prepare, that You may eat the Passover?\" \n\n \n John 19:14: \n \n \nNow it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, \"Behold your King!\" \n\n \n Now, what you are referring to (Preparation of the Sabbath; the day they prepared meals since they couldn't do that on the Sabbath itself) is in Mark 15:42:\n \n \nNow when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 43 Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.\n\n \n There's no confusion here for a person who takes each book for what it says. Mark clearly shows that Jesus ate the Passover Meal that evening, and was killed the next morning (Technically still the day of the Passover since Jewish days started at night instead of the morning). \n \n Put simply, he ate Thursday night, died and was wrapped for burial by Joseph on Friday, Sabbath was Saturday, he rose Sunday morning. \n \n John clearly shows that Jesus died Thursday morning (which was the Preparation of the Passover, since Passover started Thursday evening). \n \n There's no confusion about Passover or Sabbath until you attempt to conflate the two accounts.\n \n \nI believe all three (Matthew 27:45,50-51 NRSV; Mark 15:33,37-38 NRSV; Luke 23:44-46 NRSV) say it occurred at 3 in the afternoon. The word \"then\" shouldn't be assumed to infer immediately afterwards, but can also be construed as back \"then.\"\n\n \n That's a huge stretch to interpret Luke that way. It's listed in chronological order, and is obvious in the way the passages are read and the wording used that Jesus died after the curtain had ripped. \n \n If I said \"I ate dinner. I called my parents,\" it is clear what order I did things. The same can be said in Luke. \n \n \"And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. 46 Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, \"Father, pinto your hands I commit my spirit!\" And having said this he breathed his last.\"",
