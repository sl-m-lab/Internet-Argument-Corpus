I live in Kansas City Missouri, but work over on the Kansas side, so I know plenty about Brownback. He's been quite a bastard toward gay related issues over the years, and I think the same goes for abortion in his case. If he's the Republican nominee for the presidential election, boy am I voting Democrat just on that principle, not to mention the fact I haven't voted Republican since George W. \n \n You know, maybe they should question judges that have attended hetero marriages as to their impartiality as well as those who attend churches that vocally state their anti-gay views. emoticon_xangel\n \n EDIT: Yep, just checked, and he IS strongly pro-life, having referred to the amount of abortions in the United States since Roe V. Wade as \"a holocaust\", and is also one of the Kansas officials in favor of teaching Intelligent Design alongside Evolution. He also opposes stem cell research.",
