   "All in the world is moving by circle. And unfortunately the situation now is moving around two countries - USA and Israel. I don't know why but current events in the world are connected with those countries. The latest events showed a clear line of collaboration between Americans and Jews. \n The G-8 Summit took place shortly after annihilation of international terrorist Shamil Basaev who organized Beslan school seizure and planed to realize acts of terrorism during Summit work. And after the terrorist's death president Bush lost his inspiration for the Summit and it surprised me much. But then I understood that this was for a very particular reason. Most likely Americans knew about the planed acts of terrorism which could give them good trumps. I'll be not surprised if they helped to organize it. The fact is that during Summit it was clear that Bush hated the problem of Europe power security and tried to do everything to push it to the background. Americans were aware that in case of this problem discussion USA could lose some positions in the world. And of course the fact of Europe problem of energy security remained unsolved was better for Bush who dreams of weakening US rival - EU. I think that in the event acts of terrorism were organized Bush could talk about it with pleasure. \n Suddenly for everybody (but not for the US) Israel began a terrorist operation against Lebanon which turned then into real war. And of course the attention of Summit participants was drawn to the Middle East. Bush turned to his regular job of saving the world. I'm sure that this war in the Middle East had to do with the G-8 Summit too, it was the provocation organized by Israel. Americans and Jews planed to organize acts of terrorism and begin the war simultaneously to make Summit collapse. That's why I think that USA and Israel are working in one team and they are destabilizing the situation in the world. And they are working by hands of Chechens terrorists.",
