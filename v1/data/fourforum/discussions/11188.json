   "MEMPHIS - A public high school principal who posted the names of two boys on a list of students believed to be couples, revealing their relationship to their parents as well as other students and teachers, violated the students' constitutional right to freedom of association, the American Civil Liberties Union charged today. In a letter to school board officials in Memphis, Tennessee, the ACLU demanded today that the school reprimand the principal and take steps to ensure such actions never happen again.\n \n In September of 2007, the principal at Hollis F. Price Middle College High told teachers she wanted the names of all student couples, \"hetero and homo,\" because she wanted to monitor them personally to prevent students from engaging in public displays of affection. The two students now represented by the ACLU, Andrew and Nicholas (who have asked that their last names not be revealed), were two A students who had been seeing each other for a short time and were attempting to keep their relationship quiet and private. The principal heard about them through another student, then wrote their names on a list she posted next to her desk, in full view of anyone who entered her office. \n \n One of the boys' mothers personally witnessed the list when she met with the principal a few days later. \"I couldn't believe it when I went to meet with the principal and that list was right there by her desk where anyone could see it,\" said Andrea, Andrew's mother. \"African American people face enough obstacles to succeeding in this world and I want my son to have every opportunity he's worked so hard for. Our schools should be helping our children do well, not tearing them down for something like this.\"\n \n Although the boys had never been observed by any school staff engaging in any sort of display of affection, the principal called Nicholas's mother Nichole. According to Nichole, the principal said things like \"Did you know your son is gay?\" repeatedly and went on to say that she didn't like gay people and wouldn't tolerate homosexuality at her school.\n \n Both students say they've had to deal with verbal harassment from both teachers and students since word got out around the school about their principal's actions. According to Nicholas, he also suffered another consequence of the principal's discrimination. He had submitted extensive paperwork and several recommendations from teachers for a school trip to New Orleans to assist in rebuilding efforts. Having a long history of community service, he was considered a shoo-in to be selected to go before the incident, but then a teacher told Nicholas some faculty were afraid he might \"embarrass the school\" or engage in \"inappropriate behavior.\" A few days later, another student who hadn't even applied to go on the trip was selected in his place. \n \n \"We never bothered anyone or did a single thing at school that broke any of the rules,\" said Nicholas, a junior and honor student. \"Every day I feel like they're still punishing me, and I'm worried that this is going to hurt my chances to get into a good college.\"\n \n \"The principal's outing of these two students to their families, classmates, and teachers is unacceptable. Its only purpose was to intimidate not only these students but all gay students at Hollis Price,\" said Hedy Weinberg, Executive Director at the ACLU of Tennessee. \"Educators should be focused on educating their students and not on harassing them because of their sexual orientation or the people with whom they associate.\"\n \n School officials have already confirmed the existence of the list to the ACLU in prior meetings held in an attempt to resolve the matter privately. In today's letter to the Memphis City Schools Board of Commissioners, the ACLU points out that the principal ordered the boys not to even walk or study together at school. \n \n \"This is a public high school that runs on taxpayer dollars. As such, it is part of the government and must obey the Constitution in dealing with the students entrusted to its care each day,\" said Bruce Kramer, a partner at Borod and Kramer in Memphis and cooperating attorney on the case. \"This school has no business singling these boys out and taking away educational opportunities against them simply because they were dating.\"\n http://www.aclu.org/lgbt/youth/35094prs20080429.html\n If people question why we need to \"attributes\" over which bullying and discrimination can't take place, or why we need \"bullying\" laws at all, look no further.\n \n It's because there are \"some people\" out there who can't figure it out on their own, and realize that their actions are just plain vile.\n \n \n Incidentally, this is coming from the same state that brought you a county that voted (unanimously) to ban gays from the county.\n http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0319-10.htm\n \n Should we bother conjecturing over whether or not they were acting in accordance with their religious convictions? emoticon_xdonno",

If the beef they have is that the school described the separately, then I don't see why that shouldn't be the real basis for their complaint. But if they DON'T employ a 'separate-but-equal' approach and take away having two columns but instead just list all couples together (gay OR straight), people are still going to be able to see the names of the two males together as a couple anyway. Later in the article they're making an issue of 'outing' the couple, which is odd given that the ACLU is taking an approach that this is discriminatory. It seems to me this is a more of a privacy issue.",

   "The school has no business making a list of couples to watch. It's a blanket violation of privacy that is not restricted to the gay couple.\n \n Making a literal list of students to \"keep an eye on\" is unethical. Schools no doubt get away with having unwritten lists, but most districts have strict ethics guidelines that prevent any sort of discriminatory behavior; if it's recorded, it's available via FOIA and grounds for a lawsuit. Furthermore, a student's having a significant other is no justification to be labeled for anything.\n \n This principal sounds like the standard rightwing nutjob who's hellbent on keeping people virgins until age 30 and abusing homosexuals until they can't take any more and leave. I work in a school, and I don't like PDA between students, but if it's not in a classroom where the teacher has direct influence and \"reign\" over the area, a teacher won't stop it. This principal is being stupidly naive.\n \n For another two cents: I agree that the article is written in a misleading way. The list isn't discriminatory, but it's at least not smart and it's possibly unethical and a violation of privacy grounds for legal trouble.

Not supposed \"sexual conduct\".\n \n It will be interesting in the days to come to see how much of these claims can be substantiated or refuted by others...\n Because we have high school students on a college campus, we have to carefully monitor the activities of our students. We are at all times\n proactive in assuring that our students are provided a safe, nurturing and disciplined learning climate. Unfortunately, in fall 2007, we received numerous complaints from LeMoyne-Owen College faculty and staff that some of our student couples were involved in explicit sexual behavior in public view on the college campus.\n \n In light of this information from LeMoyne-Owen faculty and staff, the principal of Hollis F. Price made several general announcements to the student body that this behavior would not be tolerated. Regrettably, the improper behavior continued. Therefore, the principal felt it appropriate to notify the parents of those children she knew to be involved romantically. This was done in an effort to gain the support of the parents in reinforcing the message that such behavior is in violation of Memphis City Schools' Student Code of Conduct. The principal did not list any information other than students' names on her personal call list, and she certainly did not specify the sexual orientation of any student. Additionally, the list was never posted publicly anywhere at the school.\n \n It is the position of Memphis City Schools that the principal did act in an appropriate manner in order to correct a serious issue at the school and that Memphis City Schools has not subjected either of these students to\n discriminatory treatment.http://www.myeyewitnessnews.com/mostpopular/story.aspx?content_id=1d49f672-e98a-498c-b9f0-32e19ef30474",
