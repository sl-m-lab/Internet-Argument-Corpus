Judge Walker issued his ruling on the basis of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, that clause that Steeeeve so hates, because its meaning is unclear. The judge ruled that marriage is a right protected by the 14th amendment against state abrogation, which I know Steeeeve also disagrees with. \n \n And we get back to that pesky question of what rights the 14th amendment protects and whether marriage is one of those rights.

No, just as I do not think that a federal judge who happens to be Catholic should be asked to recuse him or herself from the case. \n \n We do not ask women to recuse themselves from cases involving women's rights. We do not ask African Americans to recuse themselves from cases involving rights for African Americans. We all have identities that probably influence how we see the world, but the role of judge requires that the person focus on the meaning of the law, not on any personal wish for a particular outcome. I think that most judges do try faithfully to interpret the law, without regard to their personal identities or religious affiliations. Of course, judges are human, and they are not perfect. But since we all have personal identities and personal biases and beliefs, we have to trust in the integrity of our judges and that they will do their best to interpret the law.\n \n U.S. Code Section 455 says the following: \n \n \"(a) Any justice, judge or magistrate judge of the United States\n shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality\n might reasonably be questioned.\n (b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:\n (1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a\n party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts\n concerning the proceeding; . . .\"\n \n I do not think that a judge's sexual orientation (we all have one) or a judge's religious affiliation (most of us have one) are adequate reason to assume that a judge cannot be impartial in a case.

   "Being an \"out\" gay man simply means that a man is being himself, just as being an \"out\" heterosexual man means that a man is being himself.\n\n \n As I said, given social climate, it's my opinion that being intentionally 'out' as a gay person means one has taken a sort of 'leap' ideologically regarding what's culturally normative. Therefore it's not so much about the fact he merely has a sexual orientation. \n Perhaps you are right that he should not need to recuse himself, specifically. Nevertheless I think it is an understandable concern that there could be a conflict of interest just as some would be concerned if a Mormon were making judgments on the merits of Prop 8. It has already been brought out by some opinion writers that this issue may play a role in the appeals.\n \n \nHe is being himself without trying to hide who he is. It's no different from my being an \"out\" woman. I simply am a woman, and I do not try to hide it. It's just my personal identity, or who I am.\n\n \n I disagree that this is a good analogy--being a woman or a man is a completely normative part of culture. Therefore being 'out' doesn't really apply to these cases. There's no cultural moralistic issue, in the sense of pride and counter-cultural identity, going on with someone just being a man or a woman. At least not to any comparable extent. Homosexuality-related issues tend to still be extremely controversial. Often 'the jury is still out', so to speak.\n \n \nWe all have identities that probably influence how we see the world, but the role of judge requires that the person focus on the meaning of the law, not on any personal wish for a particular outcome. I think that most judges do try faithfully to interpret the law, without regard to their personal identities or religious affiliations. Of course, judges are human, and they are not perfect. But since we all have personal identities and personal biases and beliefs, we have to trust in the integrity of our judges and that they will do their best to interpret the law.\n\n \n No, I do not just 'trust' judges any more than I would trust an elected public official in other branches of government. (And as I said above, I think the issue of being an 'out' homosexual goes beyond just mere 'identity'.) I see no reason to give judges any more the benefit of the doubt when it comes to bias than elected officials. With all due respect, I think you have an elevated view of the judicial branch. You are right that the role of a judge is that they focus on the law and not their personal wishes, but that means they should all the more be viewed with a critical eye, not less. Officials of all branches of govt. are supposed to be upholding the constitution. I think most people are willing to hold officials of the other branches' feet to the fire, but for some reason some feel judges are above the fray here, and I think that's a bit of a double standard. There should be no automatic benefit of the doubt just because someone is a judge.",

No. But the judge should be smart enough to know people might think that and should address the case in a way to show no bias existed. \n \n In this case I think the judge is just a \"living constitutionalist\" and as such you couldn't get a different ruling.

   "Steeeve, I understand your argument about the 14th amendment, as we have discussed its meaning at length over the past few years. I know you are arguing how you think the Supreme Court should rule on the 14th amendment. And, as usual, I point out that this is not how the Supreme Court historically has ruled on the 14th amendment. The Supreme Court has decided what the justices think are substantive rights protected by the amendment. I know you hate this. But it's what they have done, and it's what they are likely to do now, once this case gets to them.\n \n I do not know how the Supreme Court will rule on this case, though I suspect they may rule that marriage is not a fundamental right protected by the constitution and that the states do have the power to ban same-sex marriage. I have long thought that bringing this kind of lawsuit is a bad idea for supporters of same-sex marriage, because I suspect the Supreme Court will not rule as the supporters of same-sex marriage hope they will, and this will create a precedent that will set the movement back. But I could be wrong about how the justices will rule. I certainly did not expect their ruling in Lawrence v. Texas when they struck down their previous ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick. That doesn't happen every day. \n \n I have long thought that we who support equal marriage rights need to focus on winning legislatively. I think we will win legislatively eventually, but it will take more time. One reason I think we need to win legislatively is because I think that when people vote for something, or when their elected legislators vote for something, it reflects popular opinion at least to some extent. And I think ultimately that we need public opinion on the side of same-sex marriage in order to sustain it. Public opinions is already shifting that way, gradually.\n \n Of course, I could be all wrong about what will happen. I do not claim to be able to see the future.",

I wouldn't be responding to it if I didn't read it. I simply disagree with you. To create different institutions for same-sex marriages and for opposite-sex marriages serves no rational purpose, and it does discriminate against gay people. Same-sex marriages are exactly the same as opposite-sex marriages. There is no difference. \n \n Many opposite-sex couples cannot procreate biologically with each other, or they choose not to procreate. Marriage laws do not permit or deny the right to marry based on someone's ability to procreate with the spouse biologically. I cannot reproduce with a man, because I am 55 years old and not of child-bearing age. But I can marry a man legally despite my inability to reproduce with him. I cannot reproduce with a woman either, but I am not permitted to marry her by law in my state. A marriage with a man would be exactly the same as a marriage with a woman, but one would be legally recognized and the other would not. Oh, and I do have a child, which means that if I married a man, he could adopt my child, and our child would then have the protections of two legal parents. If I married a woman, she probably could not adopt my child in my state (but it's not entirely clear), and our child would not have the protections of two legally married parents in my state, because our marriage would not be legal. The protection of children is a strong reason for legally recognizing same-sex married couples. \n \n Pretty much any kind of marriage between two consenting adults is legal now, except for same-sex marriage in most states and marriage between two people who are already closely related, such as parents and children, siblings, and first cousins in some states. The slippery slope argument doesn't make sense, because there is no slippery slope. Even if there were, the legalization of same-sex marriage does not necessarily mean that all marriages should be legalized. We debate and discuss the reasons for and against legalizing same-sex marriage. We would need to do the same for first cousin marriages, for example, if first cousins pressed a movement to demand the right to marry. But there really are few reasons why two consenting adults are not permitted to marry each other. Even criminals on death row are permitted to marry legally, so long as the person they marry is the other sex and is not a close relative. It's same-sex couples who are glaringly excluded from the right to marry, for no reason except for tradition and some people's religious beliefs.",

   "Jyoshu: I have not responded yet to your last post about judges who are out gay men because my responses have not been getting posted for some reason. I keep getting an error message. In the hope that this post will go through, I will respond briefly.\n \n I think it's irrelevant to questions of a judge recusing himself whether being an out gay man is \"normative.\" The issue you raised is whether an out gay man can be impartial as a judge and rule fairly on the constitutionality of a state law. I think clearly he can, just as I think a judge who happens to be a Mormon can rule fairly. Whether it's \"normative\" to be Mormon or whether it's \"normative\" to be openly gay is irrelevant to whether a judge can rule fairly. \n \n Being openly gay is not the same as being a gay rights activist. I think someone who has been an activist working for same-sex marriage should clearly recuse himself from judging this case. He or she would have a clear conflict of interest. But that is not true of this particular judge in this case. Being an out gay man is simply not hiding who a person is. It's not the same as being actively involved in lobbying on or working politically on the issue before the court. \n \n Do people's religious beliefs and personal identities (gay, female, male, heterosexual, African American, white) mean that someone will necessarily rule based on that identity? No. They might do so, but we need to try to discern this in vetting judges. All people have identities, and those identities inform who they are and how they think. But judges know that they are supposed to interpret the law, not seek an outcome that they may find personally satisfying. If we exclude anyone with an identity from all cases that may be in some way related to that identity, then we won't have any justices to rule on those cases at all.\n \n The Catholic Church lobbied in favor of Proposition 8 in California. Does this mean that all Catholic justices on the Supreme Court should recuse themselves? If we expected that, who would be left to judge the case? \n \n This is why I think that we need to trust that our justices will rule with integrity and will judge the meaning of the law, not what they personally want to see as an outcome. We have a process for questioning federal judges and then confirming them to determine whether they are, in fact, committed to interpreting the law. \n \n People can and do disagree about how to intepret the constitution. I think in this case Steeeeve is right. The federal judge ruled as he did because of how he interprets the 14th amendment and not because he may be gay himself.",

I know you are arguing how you think the Supreme Court should rule on the 14th amendment. And, as usual, I point out that this is not how the Supreme Court historically has ruled on the 14th amendment. The Supreme Court has decided what the justices think are substantive rights protected by the amendment. I know you hate this. But it's what they have done, and it's what they are likely to do now, once this case gets to them.\nwithout a doubt this is how the courts have generally ruled on the 14th amendment.

They won't be able to declare it a fundamental right \"deeply rooted in our nations history\" as was the criteria back when substantive due process first got popular but that is no matter. \n \n \nI have long thought that we who support equal marriage rights need to focus on winning legislatively. I think we will win legislatively eventually, but it will take more time. One reason I think we need to win legislatively is because I think that when people vote for something, or when their elected legislators vote for something, it reflects popular opinion at least to some extent. And I think ultimately that we need public opinion on the side of same-sex marriage in order to sustain it. Public opinions is already shifting that way, gradually.\nThis is much wiser.",

   "Morals have nothing to with it Bennedict.Its about definition.\n Morality is in the mind of the beholder so if you are happy that gay marriage is not morally wrong then you should be free to hold that opinion.\n However, gay marriage is not the same as hetero marriage.\n A gay married couple is as different from a hetero marriage as a man married to his father.\n As for polygamist marriages..if all parties agree then there is no infringement of human right...if we allow gay marriages then we cannot prohibit polygamous marriages.\n\n \n I disagree with your argument that \"a gay married couple is as different from a hetero marriage as a man married to his father.\" A man and his father are already relatives, and if the father is the man's biological father, then the two are close biological relatives. They already have a legal family relationship. \n \n Both same-sex married couples and opposite-sex married couples are not (under most circumstances) already closely related to each other, and they are partnerships of two consenting adults. The fact that many opposite-sex couples can biologically reproduce together does not mean that all of them can. Many opposite-sex married couples cannot biologically reproduce together, and many choose not to. Biological reproduction is not a requirement for opposite-sex marriage. And both same-sex and opposite-sex married couples raise children together. \n \n We need to look at the reality of child-rearing as a critical reason for encouraging marriage, though it is not the only reason. Biology is really not relevant. What is relevant is the social fact of couples raising children together. \n \n Some of the social changes we have experienced over the last century have made biology less important and people's social roles in creating families more important. A century ago, birth control use was illegal in the United States, and heterosexual couples had more difficulty in choosing whether to have children or how many children to bear. Sexual relations were simply more likely to lead to reproduction than they are today. A century ago, most jobs that paid a family wage were closed to women, and marriage partners were therefore not equal. The different marriage roles of men as primary breadwinners and women as homemakers and secondary breadwinners were strongly reinforced by the limited job opportunities for women. Today, marriage partners are legally and socially equal, or at least nearly equal. While men still on the whole earn more than women do, this imbalance has changed dramatically. Many women work full time and earn as much as their spouses do, or at they earn a significant wage. Marriage has become a relationship of equal partners playing, if not identical roles, roles that are closer than ever before. \n \n At the same time, we have seen with higher divorce rates the emergence of more blended families in which married couples raise children who are not biologically the offspring of both spouses. We have also seen the growth of adoption. These changes mean that many children are raised in families in which they do not have two biological parents present. Some people may decry these changes, but they are social reality.\n \n We have also seen a rise in the number of same-sex couples who are raising children together. Many of these children are the biological offspring of one spouse in the couple, and the other spouse may or may not be legally able to adopt the child. There are also many cases of same-sex couples adopting children together. While lesbian couples are still the majority of the same-sex couples raising children together, we have seen more gay male couples raising children together. Same-sex couples in many places can either adopt children as a couple, or one partner can do an adoption first and the spouse can adopt later as a second parent. In adoption, we have different laws and rules all over the United States. But once people adopt children, they can move to another state and not fear that the new home state will try to undo the adoption. (I know something about this because I adopted a child who is now 8 years old). \n \n The social reality is that we have many same-sex couples raising children together and many heterosexual couples raising children together in families where the spouses are not both the biological parents of the children. If one purpose of marriage is provide family stability to children, then we surely need to allow couples in these family relationships to marry legally and provide that stability and protection for their children. Children need these protections whether they are the biological offspring of both adults or not. \n \n We do not prohibit opposite-sex parents who adopt children from marrying each other.

It is discrimination to ban marriage between close blood relatives. But as I said before, the courts have ruled that states can discriminate if they have a legitimate reason for this, at the very least a rational basis. The Supreme Court traditionally uses a balancing test to balance the need of a state to enact a discriminatory law against the individual right being denied. (I know Steeeve hates this way of interpreting the 14th amendment, but it's what the Court has historically done.)\n \n So, is there a legitimate need, at least a rational basis for states to ban marriages between blood relatives? I don't know. That question would have to be argued on its specific merits. Arguments would have to be presented as to why states think marriages between blood relatives must be banned and on the other side why individuals who want to marry blood relatives think that such a ban has no rational basis and should be done away with. I suspect that those who advocate banning such marriages will argue that marriage between blood relatives brings a danger of biological problems for children who are the offspring of such marriages. This argument may be punctured by those who want to lift such bans on marriages between blood relatives. The conclusions people reach may depend on how close the blood relationship is. \n \n I have read that there are people who advocate legalizing first-cousin marriages in all states. They argue that the danger of children being born with biological problems from such marriages is extremely small, and first cousins who marry will not necessarily have children anyway. I find these arguments compelling. If marriage is a right, then why should the remote possibility of a couple having children with biological problems bar them from marrying? \n \n If marriage is a right of individuals protected by the constitution, then states need to make a better argument than, \"This type of marriage is different\" in order to ban that type of marriage. They need to show good reasons, at least a rational basis, for banning that type of marriage. And each specific ban needs to be argued on its own merits. In other words, the legalization of same-sex marriage will not and should not necessarily lead to the legalization of first-cousin marriage. That has to be argued on its own merits, to determine if states do have at least a rational basis for banning first-cousin marriages. \n \n I think Steeeve will probably argue that marriage is not a right protected by the constitution, and that it is entirely up to the states to determine what kinds of marriages will be legal. The Supreme Court may rule this way; I don't know. I cannot predict the future.",

If so, then states need at least a rational basis for making certain marriages illegal, and there is no rational basis for making marriage between people of the same sex illegal.\nSay there is a right to marriage...shouldn't there be a definition to the word \"marriage\"?

   "Ah, good question. It is discrimination to ban marriage between close blood relatives. But as I said before, the courts have ruled that states can discriminate if they have a legitimate reason for this, at the very least a rational basis. The Supreme Court traditionally uses a balancing test to balance the need of a state to enact a discriminatory law against the individual right being denied. (I know Steeeve hates this way of interpreting the 14th amendment, but it's what the Court has historically done.)\n \n So, is there a legitimate need, at least a rational basis for states to ban marriages between blood relatives? I don't know. That question would have to be argued on its specific merits. Arguments would have to be presented as to why states think marriages between blood relatives must be banned and on the other side why individuals who want to marry blood relatives think that such a ban has no rational basis and should be done away with. I suspect that those who advocate banning such marriages will argue that marriage between blood relatives brings a danger of biological problems for children who are the offspring of such marriages. This argument may be punctured by those who want to lift such bans on marriages between blood relatives. The conclusions people reach may depend on how close the blood relationship is. \n \n I have read that there are people who advocate legalizing first-cousin marriages in all states. They argue that the danger of children being born with biological problems from such marriages is extremely small, and first cousins who marry will not necessarily have children anyway. I find these arguments compelling. If marriage is a right, then why should the remote possibility of a couple having children with biological problems bar them from marrying? \n \n If marriage is a right of individuals protected by the constitution, then states need to make a better argument than, \"This type of marriage is different\" in order to ban that type of marriage. They need to show good reasons, at least a rational basis, for banning that type of marriage. And each specific ban needs to be argued on its own merits. In other words, the legalization of same-sex marriage will not and should not necessarily lead to the legalization of first-cousin marriage. That has to be argued on its own merits, to determine if states do have at least a rational basis for banning first-cousin marriages. \n \n I think Steeeve will probably argue that marriage is not a right protected by the constitution, and that it is entirely up to the states to determine what kinds of marriages will be legal. The Supreme Court may rule this way; I don't know. I cannot predict the future.\n\n \n The fact that a particular form of marriage is different from what we have come to regard as marriage is no reason to ban it in a secular society.\n However we must recognise it as being different...equal but different.\n I really cannot see how a society that will allow gay marriages can prohibit any other kind of marriage between consenting adults.\n If I wanted to marry my sister why should this be prohibited?\n If we recognise my marriage to my sister as being different from being married to a a non blood relative then we can start to be able to facillitate the marriage ie..a legal contract could be made that prohibits us to have children....\n Once the Christian morals are disgarded..anything goes...",

   "Say there is a right to marriage...shouldn't there be a definition to the word \"marriage\"? If the definition was thought of as \"a woman and a man\" than naturally the right only pertains to that. In other words it is a bit illogical to just change a definition and then claim a right exists. To give another example lets say somehow people use the term \"citizens\" to include those here legally and illegally. Do we use the definition when determining if they should be able to vote? The answer to that is no because at the time where someone passed a law saying \"All citizens of Virginia can vote\" the word citizens didn't mean anyone legal and illegal.\n\n \n These are good questions. You are making a similar argument to the argument for looking to the \"original meaning\" of the constitution, except that here you argue that we should look to the \"original meaning\" of the laws governing marriage. One problem with this is that the common understanding of marriage has changed in some significant ways from the way people understood marriage when the first marriage laws were enacted. Marriage really is a living social institution. For example, the laws barring inter-racial marriage were enacted early in the colonial era, and there was a broad popular consensus for much of American history that inter-racial marriages were invalid and actually criminal. African Americans were lynched for trying to marry or have romantic relationships with whites. So if we look to the earliest popular views of marriage, we see a broadly shared belief that the right to marriage did NOT extend to people of different races. We can argue, I think, that this was definitional in the minds of most Americans, and there is a lot of historical evidence for this. \n \n Today, few people will argue that inter-racial marriages should be banned. They will argue that inter-racial marriages clearly fit within the \"definition\" of marriage, but that is because these marriages fit within their contemporary definition of marriage. But if we look at how Americans thought of inter-racial marriage in our past, we see enormous hostility toward inter-racial marriages and certainly no shared consensus that marriage should include people of different races. There were specific laws in most states barring inter-racial marriage. Those laws gradually disappeared, except in the South, where the anti-miscegenation laws were struck down by the Supreme Court in 1967.\n \n So, do we really want to \"define\" marriage as people did back when the first marriage laws were enacted? The early marriage laws were also based on a belief that men were the public citizens and women were covered by their husbands. Women's subordination to their husbands was an assumption that can be considered \"definitional\" when the early marriage laws were enacted in the colonies. \n \n I personally think that we should work legislatively to make same-sex marriage legal. I think that we want to ensure that the people come to \"define\" marriage as including same-sex couples, and we do that by winning hearts and minds and accomplishing legislative change. I think we can do this, but it's slow and uneven. \n \n I think if look back to the history of inter-racial marriage, we see that before the Supreme Court struck down the Virginia law banning inter-racial marriage, Americans were gradually changing their views. The intense hostility to inter-racial marriage was not gone from everywhere, but it was gradually softening in the North, and the state laws were gradually being changed. The views of the people were gradually changing.\n \n I think we have recently been changing hearts and minds when it comes to equal and fair treatment for gay people, and I think we need to continue working to change hearts and minds, whatever the courts rule.",

Part of your argument is that \n if we say that same-sex couples should have the right to marry each other, then any two consenting adults should have the legal right to marry each other. \n \n So should they? \n \n This is a hard question. You are suggesting, I think, that if marriage is to be considered a right, then it should be an absolute right guaranteed to every adult. If states cannot ban same-sex marriage, then they cannot ban any marriage between consenting adults. \n \n The Supreme Court has said that marriage is a right, but they have also said that the right is not absolute. And the court has come to use balancing tests to balance the interests of a state versus the individual right to determine if a state can deny a right under certain circumstances. You are suggesting that we throw out the balancing tests and throw out the exceptions for state interests and just say that all marriages between consenting adults are legal. \n \n I don't know. I need to think about this more. The libertarian voice in me says yes, we should make all marriages between consenting adults legal, that a right is a right and liberty is liberty. But the more cautious voice in me says that maybe states do have some legitimate interest in banning some forms of marriage. But maybe they don't. Maybe two sisters should be able to marry each other, and it's not the state's business if they choose to have sex with each other or if they choose to raise children together. This is an individual choice.\n \n I also think that if we were to allow any two consenting adults to marry each other, then this would not lead to \"radical change.\" People already can have sex pretty much as they choose with consenting adults. People already are raising children with partners who are not the biological parents of the child. \n \n Maybe we should say that any two consenting adults have the right to marry each other, and let the individuals decide what their marriage means in real life. I cannot think immediately of any truly legitimate reason to bar people from marrying each other even if they are relatives. Maybe someone else can. \n \n So my response to your proposal is maybe I agree, but I am not sure yet. I need to think about this more.\n \n Thank you for clarifying your argument. I agree that people should have, and they do have, the religious liberty to believe whatever they want and to frown on same-sex marriage if they want to.",

By 1967, the only states with laws banning inter-racial marriage were in the South. Would these states have ever lifted the ban if they had not been forced to? I don't know. Had Loving v. Virginia never happened, how long the South have taken to change its marriage laws? How many inter-racial couples would have been put in jail for marrying or been forced to move from their homes in order to marry? What is the impact on real people of laws, supported by the majority, that discriminate against a minority? \n \n The 14th amendment was enacted, clearly, to prevent states from putting into place laws that discriminated against African Americans and to sweep away the discriminatory laws that then existed in the southern states. It seems clear to me that the original meaning of the 14th amendment, the meaning shared by its framers and by those who ratified the amendment, was that states could no longer enact laws that treated minorities, specifically African Americans, as less than equal citizens. If we read the 14th amendment in a limited way, in a way that is less than what people at the time of ratification thought it meant, then we are not adhering to the constitution, in my view. The 14th amendment was written intentionally in broad language, to prevent states from enacting any kind of law that denied to people the rights enjoyed by the majority. \n \n The problem with relying too much on the votes of majorities is that the majority can and has in our history used the state to oppress minorities and to deny them equal rights under the law.

But majorities can be just as despotic as any court justices. They have been. Majorities have denied to African Americans equal rights under the law for most of American history. The 14th amendment was clearly enacted as an effort to prevent the southern states from imposing the will of white majorities on the black minority. That was clearly its purpose. To interpret the amendment so narrowly that it allows state majorities to do whatever they want is to gut the amendment of its original meaning, in my view. \n \n I do prefer to work legislatively for change, because I think that we secure our rights, ultimately, by convincing the people that these rights matter and that they should extend to all people. When we work legislatively, we work to change hearts and minds, and it is with the support of the majority that we ensure that our rights are secure. But I think that there are times when the majority imposes tyranny on a minority, and they must be prevented from doing this. It's what the 14th amendment was written and was ratified to do.",

There is overwhelming evidence that the \"due process clause\", for example, means exactly what it means in the 5th amendment with the only difference being the application to states. The 5th it was a procedural guarantee and no one thought any different. The equal protection clause was likewise understood as applying a law equally across all men. They mainly talked about punishment...that a white man and black man get the same penalties for a crime. The word \"protection\" was never meant to mean \"benefit\" or \"treatment\" in terms of benefit. This is obviously true because we had a 15th amendment which would not have been necessary if anyone thought the amendment meant what the court thinks it means today. This had a negative consequence though. What if you have the same protection but just segregated out? So have a black school and an equally funded (etc) white school...does this violate the amendment? Maybe not and this is a huge flaw from the amendment. \n \n \nThe 14th amendment was written intentionally in broad language, to prevent states from enacting any kind of law that denied to people the rights enjoyed by the majority. \nLet's no pretend it wasn't mostly about slavery. Yes, it was to protect minorities and disliked people (like a northerner in a southern town ha) but it was a lot to do with slavery.

More in touch with true morality? Unlikely. Yeah, the majority can really mess things up...that's one of the disadvantages of our society. \n \n At some point there needs to be people that decide what the morality of a society should be. The 14th amendment does not suggest this should be up to the judges and frankly that is how it is read today.",

   "It is a dangerous game to assume the ends justify the means. \n yet the people at the time didn't think it meant anything like what it means today. There is overwhelming evidence that the \"due process clause\", for example, means exactly what it means in the 5th amendment with the only difference being the application to states. The 5th it was a procedural guarantee and no one thought any different. The equal protection clause was likewise understood as applying a law equally across all men. They mainly talked about punishment...that a white man and black man get the same penalties for a crime. The word \"protection\" was never meant to mean \"benefit\" or \"treatment\" in terms of benefit. This is obviously true because we had a 15th amendment which would not have been necessary if anyone thought the amendment meant what the court thinks it means today. This had a negative consequence though. What if you have the same protection but just segregated out? So have a black school and an equally funded (etc) white school...does this violate the amendment? Maybe not and this is a huge flaw from the amendment. \n \n Let's no pretend it wasn't mostly about slavery. Yes, it was to protect minorities and disliked people (like a northerner in a southern town ha) but it was a lot to do with slavery. The broad language was broad in that it applies to everyone...not in that it was vague because they didn't really know what they were writing. \n \n And what is the rational for going with the court over the majority? Are they wiser? More in touch with true morality? Unlikely. Yeah, the majority can really mess things up...that's one of the disadvantages of our society. \n \n At some point there needs to be people that decide what the morality of a society should be. The 14th amendment does not suggest this should be up to the judges and frankly that is how it is read today.\n\n \n I agree with you that the contemporary understandings of the 14th amendment differ from the way its framers and its ratifiers envisioned it. The framers and ratifiers saw the privileges or immunities clause as the central protection for the rights of U.S. citizens, and yet the Supreme Court just a few years after ratification rendered that clause essentially meaningless by interpreting so narrowly the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. I enjoyed reading Clarence Thomas' argument for incorporating the 2nd amendment through the privileges or immunities clause rather than the due process clause in the recent gun rights case. I wish the whole court had adopted that reasoning. (I recall that you liked Thomas' reasoning also.) \n \n With what amounted to the gutting of the privileges or immunities clause, the Supreme Court instead began interpreting the due process clause as ensuring not just procedural due process but as guaranteeing substantive rights as well. (I know you know this, but I am filling it in for other readers who may not be familiar with what the Court did.) Substantive due process was not an entirely new concept, and many argue that the ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson before the Civil War was an assertion by the Supreme Court that the constitution protects substantive rights through the due process clause of the 5th amendment. In that case the substantive right was the right to property, specifically slave property. Over time, the Court has applied the doctrine of substantive due process to assert that the constitution protects certain \"fundamental rights\" that are not enumerated in the constitution, through the due process clause of the 14th amendment. Many critics of the Court, including you, have argued that the Supreme Court simply invented the doctrine of substantive due process and that the framers of amendment 14 and amendment 5 and the people who ratified those amendments never intended for the due process clause to mean anything beyond procedural due process. This may be a valid argument, but the Supreme Court has established precedent for substantive due process, and so it is part of current interpretation of the 14th amendment. \n \n But did the framers and ratifiers of the 14th amendment intend for the privileges or immunities clause to protect substantive rights? Did John Bingham, the author of Section 1 of the 14th amendment, write the privileges or immunities clause with the aim of protecting substantive rights? If so, what substantive rights did he and his fellow Republicans in Congress aim to protect? This has been a hotly debated question among scholars. There has been much debate over whether Bingham intended to incorporate the Bill of Rights through this clause, and I think that Fairman's claim that he did not has not stood up over time. Recent scholars have argued, with strong evidence to back them up, that Bingham did intend the privileges or immunities clause to incorporate the Bill of Rights. I think he did, and he and other Republicans did not plan for the selective incorporation or gradual incorporation of the rights in the Bill of Rights one at a time. I think the evidence shows that Bingham sought to incorporate the Bill of Rights and apply it to the states immediately.\n \n An even thornier question is whether Bingham and his fellow Republicans aimed through the 14th amendment privileges or immunities clause to protect rights not enumerated in the Bill of Rights. My reading of Bingham and the writings and speeches of other Republicans on the committee and in Congress suggests that they did aim to protect rights broadly, meaning rights beyond those listed in the Bill of Rights. Bingham's speeches and writings indicate that he aimed to protect \"all rights\" from state abrogation. The Republicans in Congress wrote the 14th amendment in a context of intense conflict between Congress with the southern state legislatures. The Republicans were extremely angry at the southern states for denying what they regarded as fundamental rights of citizenship and personhood to the freed slaves. They were not going to defer to the will of southern majorities; their aim in writing the amendment and pushing it through was to take away from those southern white majorities the power to pass laws that denied rights to the minority, especially the newly freed slaves. We have to remember the context for the creation of the 14th amendment. \n \n Of course, the argument that the framers and the ratifiers of the 14th amendment intended to protect \"all rights\" from state abrogation, that they aimed the amendment at protecting rights broadly, leaves us today with the problem of what rights the amendment protects. I will argue to you that the original meaning of the amendment, to use Antonin Scalia's approach to constitutional interpretation, is a broad protection of rights, beyond just those enumerated in the Bill of Rights, from state abrogation. \n \n The equal protection clause is likewise broad and not specific about what the framers and ratifiers meant. \n \n We are faced with the problem of what the framers and ratifiers meant when they wrote the 14th amendment. My interpretation of their speeches and writings is that they meant the amendment to deny to the states the power to take away rights....not just enumerated rights, but all rights of citizens and the people. \n \n It's not the Supreme Court that trumps the will of popular majorities in 14th amendment rights cases. It's the 14th amendment that trumps the will of popular state majorities. The 14th amendment prohibits states from denying rights to individuals. The 14th amendment was crafted to protect minorities from the tyranny of the majority. That was its original meaning. That should be its meaning today. How the amendment does this, and what specific rights it protects will always be a matter of debate, because the amendment itself is not specific, and so it has been left to the Supreme Court to interpret what it means. Robert Bork argued that if you can't figure out what a provision in the constitution means, if it is an \"ink blot,\" then the Court should not apply that provision at all. But the provision is in the constitution, and I think it's the duty of the Supreme Court to try to figure out what it means. That involves trying to discern the original meaning of the provision, as Justice Scalia has insisted the Court do. \n \n I would not interpret the original meaning of the 14th amendment as Justice Scalia has. I think that the original meaning, if we look back at what the framers and the ratifers at the time said and wrote about the amendment, is that the constitution protects citizenship rights and rights of personhood broadly from abrogation by state legislatures.\n \n I think the 14th amendment fundamentally changed the U.S. constitution. I think the 14th amendment clearly shifted power away from the states and away from popular majorities in the states and established the rights of individuals to be protected by the constitution from state power and state abrogation. This was a huge change, in my view. I think the Supreme Court has largely been correct to apply the 14th amendment to protect a broad array of rights from state abrogation, though the specifics of exactly how they have applied the amendment have sometimes been odd or problematic. I think, for example, that the constitution does protect the rights of individuals to own guns, and the 14th amendment protects that right from state abrogation. But I also think that the due process clause is a weird vehicle for arguing that the 14th amendment incorporates the second amendment right of gun ownership. I think this right is more appropriately incorporated through the privileges or immunities clause. I suspect you agree with that small portion of what I write here. \n \n Oh, gotta run. Busy day ahead for us. Take care.",

   "I didn't know your church had its own form of the gestapo easy... \n\n \n I think you have us confused with the gay Nazis, including Hitler himself at times.\n \n Hitler's \"Gay\" Roots\n \n In 1945 a Jewish historian by the name of Samuel Igra published Germany's National Vice, which called homosexuality the \"poisoned stream\" that ran through the heart of Nazism. (In the 1920s and 30s, homosexuality was known as \"the German vice\" across Europe because of the debaucheries of the Weimar period.) Igra, who escaped Germany in 1939, claims that Hitler \"had been a male prostitute in Vienna at the time of his sojourn there, from 1907 to 1912, and that he practiced the same calling in Munich from 1912 to 1914\" (Igra:67). Desmond Seward, in Napoleon and Hitler, says Hitler is listed as a homosexual in Viennese police records (Seward:299). Lending credence to this is the fact, noted by Walter Langer, that during several of those years Hitler \"chose to live in a Vienna flophouse known to be inhabited by many homosexuals\" (Langer:192). Rector writes that, as a young man, Hitler was often called \"der Schoen Adolf\" (the handsome Adolf) and that later his looks \"were also to some extent helpful in gaining big-money support from Ernst Ro[e]hm's circle of wealthy gay friends\" (Rector:52).\n \n \n In 1945 historian Samuel Igra published \"Germany's National Vice\"[1] (homosexuality was known as \"the German vice\" across Europe in the 1920s and '30s), in which Igra, who escaped from Germany in 1939, alleged that Hitler \"had been a male prostitute in Vienna at the time of his sojourn there, from 1907 to 1912, and that he practiced the same calling in Munich from 1912 to 1914\" (Igra:67). None of Hitler's supposed former clients are known to have come forward during his rise to power or later. In addition, Hitler's friends from his Vienna days - notably his roommate August Kubizek - claimed that he was vociferously opposed to prostitution.\n \n Somewhat more credible arguments that Hitler may have been homosexual were put forward in a book by historian Lothar Machtan called The Hidden Hitler, based primarily upon the \"Mend Protocol,\" a series of allegations made to the Munich Police in the early 1920s by a former soldier colleague of Hitler's. In 2004, HBO produced a documentary film based on Machtan's theory, titled Hidden Fuhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality. Mend was a convicted fraudster, and historian Anton Joachimsthaler (TV interview for BBC2 in 2002) is among those who regard the protocol as unreliable.\n \n Sexuality of Adolf Hitler - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

When people say they oppose same-sex marriage (President Obama says this) I want to understand why. People usually have reasons for the positions they hold, and calling them bigots does not help us to understand people's reasons for anything, and it certainly does not move us toward agreement or reconciliation. \n \n I have said that we need to consider each form of marriage on its own merits, to determine whether there are good reasons for banning it. There may be no reason for banning marriage between a father and daughter. That is a question that we would need to scrutinize, just as we are currently as a society scrutinizing whether there are good reasons for banning same-sex marriage. We have not had an in-depth discussion as a society of father-daughter marriages or even of cousin marriages. These need to be discussed in depth, each on its own terms. Saying that we will allow same-sex marriages should not, I think, automatically open the door to all marriages between anyone. Even saying it should open the door to all marriages between two consenting adults sets limits: they have to be two parties and they have to be adults. \n \n I think it is good that there is widespread debate and discussion over whether to legalize same-sex marriage. I think the consideration of whether this does harm to anyone is important to consider.\n \n Anyhow, before you start labeling me a \"bigot,\" you should bother to read MY posts, as you have accused me of failing to read yours.

Is the perceived harm of such marriages a myth? \n \n I do think that our default position should be individual liberty. Marriage relations should not be banned simply because a majority of people don't like a particular form of marriage or because they believe it is \"immoral.\" The state should have to demonstrate that a particular form of marriage does real social harm. I think this is true of polygamy also. I think that if people want to form polygamous marriages, they should have that right, unless the state can demonstrate that there is real harm to people from such a marriage.\n \n So while I think that we must consider whether any legalization of a new form of marriage does harm to people, it should be incumbent on the state to demonstrate harm in order to be permitted to ban any form of marriage.",

I have said that I think your proposal to open up marriage to any two consenting adults may be a good one, but we have to think this through carefully, and we have to consider whether legalizing any specific form of marriage will do harm to people. I think the standard for determining whether something should be legalized is not whether people dislike the practice or personally oppose it, but whether making the practice legal will do harm to people. \n \n The usual reason given for banning first-cousin marriage is because there is a risk of offspring of first cousins having biological problems. This is an argument for what some believe is a harm that may come from legalizing first-cousin marriages. But advocates for first-cousin marriage have pointed out that the risk of such biological problems for their children is very small. They have also pointed out that many married couples do not or cannot have children at all. And other kinds of couples are permitted to marry even when their offspring may face biological problems. Therefore, they argue, feared biological risk to children is not a legitimate reason to ban first cousins from marrying. I find this argument compelling, and I see no valid reason why first-cousin marriage should be banned. I see no harm that legalizing such marriages would bring. \n \n We would have to consider people's specific arguments against parent-offspring or sibling marriages as well, to determine if there is a harm that would come to people from legalizing such marriages. I have said that the default position should be individual liberty, in this case the right to marry the person of one's choice. States should not be permitted to ban a form of marriage for any old reason, or because that form has always been banned, or because some religious traditions view a particular form of marriage as immoral. Those are not adequate reasons to deny people liberty, in my view. The fact that a majority of voters dislike or disapprove of a particular form of marriage should not be reason to deny people liberty either. I think the burden should be on a state that bans a form of marriage to show that that specific form of marriage does harm to people. \n \n We have been having a public debate over same-sex marriage, which I think is important and healthy.

I did not say that we need to ban such marriages; I said we may need to ban them. I went on to explain at length that I think we need to evaluate each form of marriage on its own merits. I do not necessarily favor banning any form of marriage, but I don't want to make an argument one way or the other about a specific form until I hear the various reasons people may give for why they think a particular form of marriage may be harmful to people. If there are no reasons, if there is no harm, then I say we should err on the side of liberty. The state should be not be permitted to discriminate against people unless there is a clear harm caused by granting the liberty in question, in this case legalizing a particular form of marriage.\n \n On the drug question, we do ban drugs when they are shown to be harmful to people, with some glaring exceptions like alcohol and cigarettes. Should we be able to ban the use or sale of drugs if they are shown not to be harmful? I think not, although I do think it's prudent for us to test drugs before they are permitted to go on the market to determine if they are harmful to people. I also think there are good reasons for the state to regulate the use of certain drugs, for people's safety. We make some drugs available by prescription only, and there may be regulations as to their labeling, etc. There is a good reason to do this. Allowing any drugs to be sold by anyone to anyone at any time is likely to harm people, which is why the state regulates them. \n \n We do allow people who have radically different ideas about sex to marry. The state does not investigate people's views on sex before they are permitted to marry. There are legally married couples who are into sadomasochism, bondage and discipline, threesomes, and various forms of swinging. Married couples can buy and use all sorts of sex toys. Sexual deviance is not a criterion by which the states ban marriages. \n \n Many gay people have traditional ideas about sex and are not sexually deviant. They believe in monogamy with a life partner. That's why many gay people want to marry, to make a social and legal commitment to one spouse for life. Yet most states ban same-sex marriage, based not on the beliefs of the partners about sex but on the gender of the two partners. \n \n So do we allow sexual deviants to marry? Yes, we currently do. That's not at issue, because sexual deviants can already marry, so long as they marry a partner of the opposite sex. Whether we allow sexual deviants to marry is irrelevant to this forum, because we already do allow them to marry. \n \n Do we allow same-sex couples to marry? In a few places, but not in most states of the United States. \n \n Same-sex marriages are simply marriages between two people who happen to be the same gender. They may or may not include sexual deviance, but how married couples have sex is not the business of the state. Probably most married same-sex couples, like most married opposite-sex couples, do not engage in much if any sexual deviance. \n \n As for the \"get a thicker skin\" remark, I think you should refrain from making nasty comments and discipline yourself to engage in civil discourse. It's extremely rude and unkind to call someone a nasty name like \"bigot,\" and it is not true in my case anyway. I'm sure your mother taught you to be polite when you speak to others, and I'm sure your Christian Sunday school teachers taught you to be thoughtful of others. I urge you to remember and to practice what they taught you.",

The state does not investigate people's views on sex before they are permitted to marry. There are legally married couples who are into sadomasochism, bondage and discipline, threesomes, and various forms of swinging. Married couples can buy and use all sorts of sex toys. Sexual deviance is not a criterion by which the states ban marriages. \n \n Many gay people have traditional ideas about sex and are not sexually deviant. They believe in monogamy with a life partner. That's why many gay people want to marry, to make a social and legal commitment to one spouse for life. Yet most states ban same-sex marriage, based not on the beliefs of the partners about sex but on the gender of the two partners. \n \n So do we allow sexual deviants to marry? Yes, we currently do. That's not at issue, because sexual deviants can already marry, so long as they marry a partner of the opposite sex. Whether we allow sexual deviants to marry is irrelevant to this forum, because we already do allow them to marry. \n \n Do we allow same-sex couples to marry? In a few places, but not in most states of the United States. \n \n Same-sex marriages are simply marriages between two people who happen to be the same gender. They may or may not include sexual deviance, but how married couples have sex is not the business of the state. Probably most married same-sex couples, like most married opposite-sex couples, do not engage in much if any sexual deviance. \n \n As for the \"get a thicker skin\" remark, I think you should refrain from making nasty comments and discipline yourself to engage in civil discourse. It's extremely rude and unkind to call someone a nasty name like \"bigot,\" and it is not true in my case anyway. I'm sure your mother taught you to be polite when you speak to others, and I'm sure your Christian Sunday school teachers taught you to be thoughtful of others. I urge you to remember and to practice what they taught you.\n\n \n Saying we MAY need to ban marriages between close relatives is no less descriminatory than saying we MAY have to ban gay marriages..you are using weasel words to try to back out of a statement.\n I didnt ask for your opinion on drugs I used them as an example to show that we cannot always be certain that allowing an activity will not cause harm to society but in the case of drugs one can reban them.\n \n You obviously do not know what the word deviant means.\n \n I have never claimed that sexual deviancy does not occur in hetero marriage but there is no potential for normality in gay marriage..it is sexully deviant in every way...that does not mean that we should ban it..but we should recognise it.\n \n What I keep repeating but still keeps going over your head is that to allow one set of deviants to marry means that we have to allow ALL types of deviants to marry.\n You dont seem to know whether you agree with this or not.\n \n I did not attend Sunday school..it was full of cry babies and bigots",

This is simply false. As I have pointed out, gay people engage in the same varied kinds of sexual behavior as heterosexuals do. Many gay people are monogamous and committed to one lifelong partner. Some gay people engage in what others may regard as \"deviant\" sexual behavior, just as some heterosexuals do. Some gay people do not have sex at all, even gay people who are married. Sexual behavior by a couple is a private matter, and it has nothing to do with marriage laws. We as a society do not inquire into the sexual practices of married couples, and we do not make engaging in a particular type of sexual activity a requirement for marriage. \n \n Same-sex couples are no different from opposite-sex couples. They live in exactly the same kinds of varied ways. Some raise children together and some do not. Some engage in sexual behavior that may be viewed as \"deviant,\" while most probably do not. Some divorce, and some do not. To label gay couples \"deviants\" does not make sense. They are no different from opposite-sex couples except for the gender of the two spouses. Similarly, inter-racial couples are no different from same-race couples except for the race of the two spouses. We should not discriminate against people on the basis of either their gender or their race, unless in not discriminating we do some kind of harm to people. In neither form of marriage, same-sex marriage or inter-racial marriage, does legalizing the marriage do harm. \n \n 2) It's not true that once we legalize one form of marriage that has previously been illegal then we must then automatically legalize all forms of marriage that have previously been illegal. As I have said repeatedly, we need to consider each form of marriage individually to determine if legalizing it will do harm to people. We are currently considering same-sex marriage, and we are realizing as a society that it does no harm to people. Legalizing same-sex marriage benefits people, especially children, by giving children of same-sex parents the protection of having two legally married parents. `\n \n To use your drug analogy, we may legalize a drug that had previously been illegal because we find after study that the drug does no harm and instead benefits people. That does not mean that we should automatically legalize all drugs that are illegal just because we legalized on drug. We need to consider the potential harm and benefits of each drug individually. Same-sex marriage does no harm, and same-sex marriage benefits people. But that does not mean that all forms of marriage do this, though they may. We need to determine that individually. If forms of marriage do no harm, then they should be legal, in my view. \n \n I have said this quite a few times now, and I think my argument is clear.

   "no, but your quote wasnt about gays, it was about gay marriage and how marriage has nothing to do with gay people. forgive me if im wrong, but that sounds an awful lot like an anti-gay marriage stance.\n\n \n Marriage as it is now has nothing to do with gay people because it is not an institution that was made for gays or that gays are participating in.\n Marriage is a union of man and wife..just cant fit anything gay in there.\n The question is where do we fit in gay marriage in the future...hence my statements about gays, incest,polygamy etc etc\n \n I will argue in future that that different types of official unions should be called different things but that is the future",

   "But did the framers and ratifiers of the 14th amendment intend for the privileges or immunities clause to protect substantive rights? Did John Bingham, the author of Section 1 of the 14th amendment, write the privileges or immunities clause with the aim of protecting substantive rights?\nNo is the short answer to this question.\n \n Here is an extremely brief rundown of the amendment:\n (for a better one read the Thomas opinion: Mv. CHICAGO)\n \n Privileges or Immunities Clause:As Thomas suggested, this only applies the bill of rights to the states..the \"minimum baseline of rights\".\n Due Process Clause:Declares that all rights that do exist cannot be taken away with out the required legal processes...ie legislation, court cases, etc.\n Equal Protection Clause:This simply states that the processes from above have to be equal for everyone. \n \n It seems clear that not one of those provisions would protect any varying definition of marriage. As such amendment 10 comes into play and it goes to the states or people. \n \n One obvious piece of evidence for this is that the 15th amendment was created. Any other interpretation of Section 1 of the 14th amendment would make the 15th amendment a moot point. Even if the thought was just to make sure no one interpreted wrong you would still see some evidence of someone suggesting this...and you don't. \n \n \nAn even thornier question is whether Bingham and his fellow Republicans aimed through the 14th amendment privileges or immunities clause to protect rights not enumerated in the Bill of Rights. My reading of Bingham and the writings and speeches of other Republicans on the committee and in Congress suggests that they did aim to protect rights broadly, meaning rights beyond those listed in the Bill of Rights.\nIt doesn't appear so. John Bingham specifically mentioned the Bill of Rights in some of his speeches and never mentioned anything more than that. What is more interesting is Bingham made some contradicting remarks after the adoption of the amendment. \n \n\n The equal protection clause is likewise broad and not specific about what the framers and ratifiers meant. \nSee above, I think it is very clear.",

   "Comparing same sex marriage with interacial marriage is just plain dishonest.\n Hetero couples of different races are EXACTLY the same physically whereas same sex couples are not.\n Accepting gay marriage/sex is accepting deviant sex/marriage...black people are not deviant...maybe you think so but I dont\n Whether they do some of the same things is irelevant.\n You are not to judge whether an incestuous relationship is any better or worse than a gay one.\n To condone a gay relationship but condemn an incestuous one is discrimination.\n ITS not about what YOU think, its about human rights.\n As I said in previous post if we are to abandon hetero marriage as the only official form allowed then all forms of marriage should be considered before we actually do it\n\n \n For most of American history, people believed that inter-racial couples were physically different from same-race couples, and most Americans for most of our history strongly opposed inter-racial marriage and inter-racial sex. The anti-miscegenation laws that were common across the country banned inter-racial sex and inter-racial marriage and in some states made sex and marriage between people of different races a crime. Under state laws, sex between people of different races was regarded as not only deviant; it was criminal. Opponents of inter-racial marriage presented lurid descriptions of what they believed was the great harm that inter-racial marriage would do. Many argued that African Americans were not biologically or socially equal to whites and that allowing inter-racial sex and marriage would pull down the white race both biologically and socially. \n \n Of course, they were wrong. And the legalization of inter-racial marriage, which was passionately opposed by so many people, did not lead to harm. It led to greater freedom for people to marry and be happy and form stable families. The legalization of inter-racial marriage also did not mean that all other forms of marriage were automatically made legal. We have had to debate whether legalizing same-sex marriage will do harm, and this is what we are doing now. We see from our debates and from the experiences in states and nations that have legalized same-sex marriage that it does no harm, and the legalization of same-sex marriage is good for people and especially for children. \n \n People were wrong in our past in their views about race and in their belief that inter-racial marriages were by nature \"sexually deviant\" and dangerous. People who claim today that same-sex marriages are by nature \"sexually deviant\" are wrong also. The only difference between a same-sex marriage and an opposite-sex marriage is in the gender of the two spouses, and it's a difference that matters not at all. \n \n There is no reason why a couple that is physically different from another couple should be set apart into a different category and labeled \"sexually deviant.\" Infertile couples are in one respect physically different from fertile couples, and yet we do not label them as \"sexually deviant.\" Same-sex couples are in one respect physically different from opposite-sex couples, in that they are of the same gender. Yet you insist on labeling same-sex couples as \"sexually deviant\" simply because of the gender of the spouses. This makes no sense.\n \n You then write this: \"You are not to judge whether an incestuous relationship is any better or worse than a gay one.\"\n \n You are right. Whether one form of relationship or marriage is \"better\" than another is not at issue, and there is no way to make such a comparison anyway. I have said that we as a society need to evaluate whether legalizing a particular form of marriage does harm to people. If it does not, then we should legalize it. The standard of judgment is not whether one form of marriage is better than another; it's whether the specific form in question does harm to people. If it does, then there is probably reason for a state to ban it. If it is found to do no harm, then I think the form of marriage should be legalized. We have been considering whether same-sex marriage does harm to people, and it's quite clear that it does not. We have not yet fully considered and debated whether each of the varieties of marriage between close family members does harm to people, and we need to do this in order to determine whether any of these forms should be legalized or remain banned.\n \n You also write this: \"To condone a gay relationship but condemn an incestuous one is discrimination.\"\n \n I have neither condemned nor condoned incestuous relationships. I have said that we need to consider each form of marriage individually to determine if it does harm. If it does not, then the form should, in my view, be legalized. \n \n You also write this: \"ITS not about what YOU think, its about human rights.\"\n \n The issue is about human rights, balanced against the need for society to protect people from harm. This is why the Supreme Court does its balancing tests. To return to your drug analogy, we give people the right to use or not use drugs as they choose, but we balance this right against the responsibility of the state to protect people from harm by regulating drug use and banning drugs that are found to be harmful. \n \n You end with this: \"if we are to abandon hetero marriage as the only official form allowed then all forms of marriage should be considered before we actually do it\"\n \n The main problem with this argument is that the forms of marriage that states currently ban are each different from one another. We cannot conclude from an analysis of whether same-sex marriage does harm that marriage between a mother and a son will have the identical impact on people as same-sex marriage. The effects on people of different forms of marriage are likely to be different, because the forms of marriage are themselves different. For example, the argument against legalization of marriage by first cousins has to do with a belief that such a marriage may produce problems for biological offspring of the couple. Whether this is true or not has been debated. But this is not the same reason why some people have argued against legalizing same-sex marriage, where biological effects on the offspring of the couple are not an issue. \n \n There is no reason to wait until all possible forms of marriage are considered and debated in order to legalize same-sex marriage. We have debated same-sex marriage, and we have considered it thoroughly. We have found that same-sex marriage is not harmful to people and that it is beneficial for both adults and children. To insist on waiting until every possible form of marriage is considered before we allow same-sex couples to marry legally is just foot-dragging; it's just an excuse to deny same-sex couples a right that will protect their families and their children.\n \n On this issue, I am more of a splitter and you are more of a lumper. I look at the different forms of marriage that are now banned as each being different from the others, and I call for each one being evaluated individually and separately from the others, to determine of legalization of that form would do harm. You lump same-sex marriage into a category with other forms of marriage that you label \"sexual deviance.\" And you insist on treating all forms of marriage in this category that you have created as identical. I have a problem not only with treating them as identical, but I have a problem with the category you have created, which I think is just your invention and not a useful or appropriate category. Same-sex marriages are not characterized by \"sexual deviance.\" They are characterized by spouses who happen to be the same gender. In every other respect, the respects that matter, same-sex marriages are no different from opposite-sex marriages.",

   "This is an unassailable argument. You are absolutely correct.\n \n The issue isn't about gay marriage. Gays can get married in all 50 states already. The issue is about tax breaks reserved for one group of people which are denied to another group.\n \n As a renter, I understand that discrimination all too well. That doesn't mean I have a 14th Amendment right to tax breaks and legal advantages currently enjoyed only by borrowers.\n \n There's no way the U.S. supremes are going to let this stand. I'm all for gay marriage, but there's no constitutional right to have one's marriage recognized by the federal, or by any state, government. That is a fiction.\n\n \n If gays and other sexual deviants can get the tax breaks and other legal advantages reserved for hetero couple then there is no reason that 'no sex' couples can get the same rights.\n Two brothers could be married without having to consumate the union for instance and get the same pension rights etc as married couple.",

The libertarian argument espoused by the judge can be used to justify consanguineous marriage, polyandrous or polygamous marriage -- you name it.

They are not entitled to protection from their own decisions. There goes that argument.\n \nin incestuous marriage, so many things are wrong that i dont even want to get into it\n\n In refusing to get \"into it,\" you have torpedoed your libertarian justification for state-sanctioned marriage between gays.\n \n Again, if government has no legitimate interest in defining marriage, then it has to recognize all marriages.\n \ntheres a difference to people who arent used to vast differences, especially in something like marriage, but its equal and the same to people who have been exposed to diversity within society.\n\n You make a great argument for a legislative right to gay marriage.

   "People had moral objections to inter-racial marriage also. People had moral objections to black children going to public schools alongside white children. Should the moral objections of the majority be sufficient to deny a minority the right to marry and the right to an education in the same schools that the white majority could attend? \nYes, considering it was a majority that instilled the right to begin with (or in the gay marriage case forbid it). Moral objections make up a rather large portion of our laws. \n \n \nIf a moral objection is sufficient to deny rights to a minority, what meaning does the 14th amendment have?\nThese two ideas are not related. The 14th amendment never declared what \"processes\" have to exist but only that 1) you get all of them that do exist and 2) that those processes are the same for everyone. The Privileges or Immunities clause made the bill of rights immune to a simple majority. \n \n \nThe framers and ratifiers of the 14th amendment clearly meant the amendment to prevent the majority in the southern states from using the state legislatures to deny rights to the minority.\nNo. The amendment clearly has three relevant clauses in Section 1. As I have stated the due process and equal protection clauses do not help as they relate to processes and the Privileges or Immunities clause relates to enumerated rights in the constitution which mostly is the bill of rights and Article IV Section 2. \n \n In other words, the Privileges or Immunities clause is basically taking the meaning from Article IV Section 2 and applying it to the federal rights. Article IV Section 2 (the first line) says if you have a right in a state than if someone else comes in than you gotta give them that right. The idea is that same...if you are in the US you get the rights set by the federal government...which will include every state. \n \n So this has nothing to do with making a random set of rights and making it so certain reasons for restricting these random rights cannot be used.\n \n I reject the idea that the framers of the 14th amendment wanted to grant the courts unlimited power to decide what rights exists and what is or isn't a good reason for creating a law. There is just zero evidence to support they wanted this.",

   "Being born black isn't a moral issue. Consciously making a CHOICE to engage in illicit gay sex sin is.\n\n \n Whether black people and white people should be permitted to marry was long viewed as a \"moral issue\" by most Americans. People argued in essence that \"consciously making a choice to engage in illicit\" inter-racial sex \"sin\" was a moral issue, as was making a choice to violate God's laws by marrying someone of a different race. You may disagree with this, and I applaud you for that, but American majorities long opposed and state laws long prohibited inter-racial marriage and inter-racial sex, and many people insisted that it was a sin. \n \n Should the voters be permitted to deny rights to other people simply because they view a behavior as a \"sin?\" Or does there have to be a reason beyond people's religious beliefs, a clear harm to people or society, for legislatures to deny rights to people? That's the fundamental question here. The question before us is not whether \"gay sex\" is a sin. The Supreme Court has already declared that states cannot ban sexual relations between two consenting adults of the same sex. It doesn't matter if people view it as a \"sin;\" the consenting adults have a right to be intimate with each other if they choose, according to the Supreme Court. Now we are asking a similar question of the right to marry. \n \n The Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that the voters, through their legislatures, could not deny people of different races the right to marry even if the people did think that inter-racial marriages and inter-racial sex were sinful. Now the question arises whether the Supreme Court will make a similar ruling about the right of people of the same sex to marry.\n \n I think we preserve religious liberty best when we do not impose any particular religious doctrine on everyone through laws. Churches and other religious bodies are free to espouse what they choose, and people are free to believe as they choose about same-sex relations and marriage, and they are free to believe that such relations are sinful. I think we should not allow religious groups to impose their beliefs about sin on everyone else by pushing through laws that deny rights to people purely on the basis of their religious doctrine. Laws that deny rights to people need to have a reason that goes beyond people's religious beliefs.",

Maybe sexually active gay couples don't deviate in their sexual activites from what the majority does. How do you know what sexual activites gay couples engage in? \n \n For example, it may be that most sexually active heterosexual couples engage in oral sex. It may be that most sexually active gay couples engage in oral sex. That's not being \"sexually deviant.\" Both same-sex and opposite-sex couples are doing the same thing sexually. The anatomy of one of the partners is different. But why should people's anatomy being different matter?\n \n In an earlier post you insisted that the Oxford English dictionary defines same-sex relations as \"deviant. But let's look at what the dictionary actually says, starting with a background explanation of what dictionaries do. \n \n Creators of dictionaries have long differed over whether their dictionary is descriptive or prescriptive. Prescriptive dictionaries aim to determine what words mean, to tell people how to define words. They prescribe word usage. Most dictionaries today are not prescriptive. Descriptive dictionaries simply describe how people in the society use words or have used them in the past. They provide definitions of words that people have used even when those definitions have been vulgar or offensive. \n \n Most modern dictionaries are descriptive rather than prescriptive. The Oxford English Dictionary is descriptive; it does not tell us what words should mean; it tells us how people actually use words in real life and have used them in the past. \n \n Here is an explanation from the WordIQ website of descriptive vs. prescriptive dictionaries:\n \n Dictionary - Definition\n \n \"Dictionary makers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: prescriptive or descriptive. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is descriptive, and attempts to describe the actual use of words.\"\n \n The WordIQ website goes on to explain that most modern dictionaries, besides informing readers of how words are currently used, also explain how words have been used in a way that has been offensive or vulgar. From the website:\n \n \"The prescriptive/descriptive issue has been given so much consideration in modern times that most dictionaries of English apply the descriptive method to definitions, while additionally informing readers of attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused.\"\n \n Now, let's go to the Oxford English Dictionary Online definition of \"deviant.\" Remember that this dictionary is descriptive; it is describing how people use this word, not telling people how they should use the word. \n \n definition of deviant from Oxford Dictionaries Online\n \n \"deviant (de\u0095vi\u0095ant) \n \n \"Pronunciation:/&#712;d&#275;v&#275;&#601;nt/\n \"adjective\n \n \"\u0095 departing from usual or accepted standards , especially in social or sexual behavior:deviant behavior a deviant ideology \n \n \"\u0095 offensive homosexual\n \n \"noun\n \n \"\u0095 a deviant person or thing\"\n \n Notice that in its second definition, the dictionary does say \"homosexual,\" but this is preceded by the word \"offensive\" in italics.

   "You consider people to be \"sexual deviants\" because they deviate in their sexual activities from what the majority does? Maybe sexually active gay couples don't deviate in their sexual activites from what the majority does. How do you know what sexual activites gay couples engage in? \n \n For example, it may be that most sexually active heterosexual couples engage in oral sex. It may be that most sexually active gay couples engage in oral sex. That's not being \"sexually deviant.\" Both same-sex and opposite-sex couples are doing the same thing sexually. The anatomy of one of the partners is different. But why should people's anatomy being different matter?\n \n In an earlier post you insisted that the Oxford English dictionary defines same-sex relations as \"deviant. But let's look at what the dictionary actually says, starting with a background explanation of what dictionaries do. \n \n Creators of dictionaries have long differed over whether their dictionary is descriptive or prescriptive. Prescriptive dictionaries aim to determine what words mean, to tell people how to define words. They prescribe word usage. Most dictionaries today are not prescriptive. Descriptive dictionaries simply describe how people in the society use words or have used them in the past. They provide definitions of words that people have used even when those definitions have been vulgar or offensive. \n \n Most modern dictionaries are descriptive rather than prescriptive.

Many people, including many Christians, do not regard it that way. But in a society that guarantees religious liberty, you can view any marriage you want to as \"institutionalized sin.\" \n \n I personally see sex as only one small part of a marriage, and some marriages involve no sex. Marriage is a committed life partnership and decision to form a family with someone. Sex is usually part of a marriage relationship, but only one part of it. \n \n I am suggesting that if you don't like other adults' decision to have sex with each other that you just ignore it and go on about your own business. Sex between consenting adults is a private matter, after all.\n \n Adulterers are consenting adults, and whether people commit adultery is their business and their problem. Some states still call adultery illegal, but adulterers are rarely prosecuted, and it's not clear that laws barring adultery would stand up before the Supreme Court if a case were to be brought. Given previous Supreme Court decisions regarding privacy, the Court might well strike down state laws making adultery illegal. The adultery laws are rarely enforced.\n \n I personally think adultery is morally wrong, because it harms a spouse and it harms families. \n \n If Congress and state legislatures ratified an amendment to the U.S. constitution banning gay sex, then yes, such a ban would be legal because it would be part of the U.S. constitution. It won't happen, of course, but if it did, then the ban would be part of the federal constitution. But this is not going to happen, because it's extremely difficult to amend the U.S. constitution. And my question was not about a constitutional amendment; my question was about passing a simple law. \n \n A state constitutional amendment banning gay sex would surely be struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court as a violation of the U.S. constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled that Americans have a right to privacy that is protected by the U.S. constitution, and this right extends to the choice by consenting adults of the same sex to have intimate relations. If such a ban on such intimacy were passed by a state, people would immediately file a federal lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the ban under the U.S. constitution.\n \n Again, you are free to believe whatever you wish about higher law and God's will and \"abominations.\" I don't agree with you, but you have the right to your own beliefs.",
