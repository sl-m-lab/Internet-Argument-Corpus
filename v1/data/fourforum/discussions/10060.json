   "I've been listening to all sorts of arguments lately regarding oil, price of gas, dependence on foreign oil, alternative fuels, etc. The mindset of our society is we all get up in the morning and drive to work, and as a result we are dependent on fuel for absolutely everything. It occurred to me, that with the technology at our disposal today-computers, webcams, VTC, fax machines, etc-couldn't many government and private sector white collar jobs easily be performed at home? I'm not an environmental whacko and don't buy the insanity of global warming, but seems to me if we cut back that much in fuel consumption, those people should be satiated and the concerns of global warming should fade. Furthermore, these same people would have orgasmic pleasure in watching oil company profits plummet. As a result, our spineless elected officials on both sides of the aisle would no longer be slaves to this group of people and public policy can possibly return to some degree of sanity (meaning that not every governmental regulation would need to consider global warming issues above all else). We could all (well, REAL Americans anyway) take great joy in thumbing our collective noses at the AYrabs-let them pour oil on their cereal. Furthermore, Americans cutting back drastically on fuel consumption would make gas prices drop substantially, making the price per gallon much more affordable for all. This in turn would cause monthly expenditures on gas in homes to also drop, freeing more money for other matters. Quality of life improves, people would have more time for their families, wouldn't be spending 3 hours a day in traffic. We won't have to watch the price of farm products skyrocket because of the shortsighted, knee jerk reactions that have resulted in increased use of ethanol. No question, there are downsides, one of which is personal responsibility (which as we know is a quality many do not have). I would like to hear any other pros and cons",

   "The work from home and telecommuting model has been tried and failed miserably. At one time it was supposedly going to save american companies billions by lowering support and office expenses.\n \n First, a liability nightmare reared its ugly head. If you are working form home, and go to the bathroom, and trip and fall on a toy your kid left out and break your arm, who is responsible? After all, you were working! Workmans comp companies nearly killed the work at home model. Several companies held out until.....\n \n They found that workers who wre working from home were not productive over time. In fact, their productivity dropped by over 70% in the first year. Apparently your average office worker who has the option of either sitting on their butt watching TV, or being on the computer working, chooses the soaps every time. \n \n I was doing a lot of work with Sprint when this little epiphany about the american worker came along. They had a fairly extensive \"work from home\" program and they ended up either recalling or firing all those people because they just would not do their jobs. I remember the guy I dealt with there (VP) telling me \"I told them this was a bad idea from the start. Anybody who can actually do their job without being babysat is already self employed\"..",
