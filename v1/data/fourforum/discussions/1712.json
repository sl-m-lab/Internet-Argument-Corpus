   "science and biology has never been my forte, i'm more of a history and literature person.\n\n Nothing wrong with that.\n \ni believe evolution because it is accepted as fact within scientific circles and there is overwhelming evidence supporting it.\n\n That is true. Several polls have determined that of all people who might be called \"scientists, about 95% accept the theory of evolution as correct. The numbers of geologists and biologists are upwards of 99%.\n \n But your wording is interesting. You say that you believe because scientists accept it as correct based on evidence. I think that that is also a logical position. You accept the opinions of those who are educated in the field.\n \nyou might criticize me for believing evolution happened simply because scientists say it did, but alas, thats the reason why. anyway...\n\n No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do. Creationists do the same thing. the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who aren't any more educated than they are. Thus, a creationist will accept Hovind's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as \"proof\" of a young earth.\n \nwhenever i tell someone that i believe in evolution, they always tell me that if evolution were really true, there would be half-human, half-ape people walking around. i know that this is a ridiculous comeback and there is obviously a scientific explanation why there are not, so i was wondering if someone could let me know the reason why. next time i get told something like that, i want to be able to explain myself. thanks\n\n There actually were organisms that had a mixture of ape-like and human-like characteristics. There are many fossils that date back some 4 to 5 million years. And the interesting thing is that the older the fossil, the more ape-like it tends to be. But it is also true that humans didn't descend from modern apes. We shared a common ancestor with chimpanzees about 7 million years ago. Chimps have also changed. Before that, the chimp/human lineage shared an ancestor with the gorilla.\n \n As to why there are none around now, other hominids have gone extinct. Investigating the reasons why is an interesting line of research. The most recent was the Neandertal which disappeared about 30,000 years ago. At one time there may have been several species of hominid living.\n \n Here's an interesting series of fossils. The first is a chimp and the last is human. The rest are in chronological order from about 2 1/2 million years ago to the present.\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/images/hominids2.jpg",

If your asking why there are no other intelligent, technology using creatures, you have to remember that intelligence is not the goal of evolution. Give us an example of an animal that hasn't evolved......\n\n \n \n \n \n Since 1822 thousands of previously unknown animals have been found, many of which are known as \"living fossils\" - animals that once known only by its fossilized bones and presumed to have been extinct for millions of years and used as \"proof\" of evolution. But then, to the embarrassment of scientists, these animals were later found to be alive in remote parts of the world.44\n \n Charles Darwin, himself, coined this term. In the Origin of Species he called lungfish and other species whose form remained unchanged since its inception \"anomalous forms\" that \"may almost be called living fossils.\"11\n \n Living fossils are living proof of the accuracy with which plants and animals reproduce themselves and the fact that many are not changing at all.46\n \n The Okapi was once thought to have been extinct until they were found still living. These animals were once used as evidence that the horse had evolved.44\n \n Because coelacanths have lobed fins evolutionists thought them to be ancestors of the first amphibians, and hence, us. The earliest coelacanth appears in the fossil record in the Devonian period about 375 million years ago [ET*]. The last fossil was dated at about 80 million years ago [E*] in the Cretaceous period.11\n \n The discovery of living coelacanths in this century electrified the scientific world. A fish that had thought to have died out with the dinosaurs was found alive. The first was taken in 1938 about three miles from the mouth of the Chalumna River, southwest of East London, South Africa. The second was caught in 1952 off Anjouan Island in the Comores Islands, northwest of Madagascar. Another was discovered off Sulawesi, Indonesia in 1998. The Indonesian locals call the coelacanth Rajah Laut, \"King of the Sea.\"11\n \n How could the Coelacanth disappear for over 80 million years [ET*] and then turn up alive and well in the twentieth century?44\n \n In 1987, a German naturalist, Hans Fricke, observed and photographed coelacanths in their habitat off Grand Comoro Island. He found that they swam forward, backward, and even tilted head down, but never once walked, crawled, or otherwise moved on the bottom with their lobed fins, as some thought. So the coelacanth would never have moved up on land as hypothesized in the evolutionary scheme. It wasn't a missing link after all; it was a fish and it always had been a fish - for 400 million years [ET*].11\n \n Evolutionists try to explain \"living fossils\" by calling them \"primitive,\" That is, some specie was more primitive, but now it is not.11\n \n The primitive-looking coelacanth has a massive organ in its head that has scientists scratching their heads. Some speculate it might be an electro-receptor unlike any that we know about today. Also, it seems that this fish generates an electric field around its body, as an electric eel does. We can't explain its coastal navigation skills. It turns out that coelacanths are not so primitive after all.11\n \n The Australian and African lungfish are also living fossils. They all look \"primitive\" and have lobed fins. Obviously lungfish can't be our ancestors because they have remain unchanged, again for 400 million years [ET*]. Another animal, the horseshoe crab, would be a great candidate for our ancestor. It looks \"primitive\" and leaves the ocean to spawn on dry land. However, it, too, is a living fossil, appearing about 425 million years ago [ET*] in the Silurian period, and remaining unchanged.11\n \n Similarly, gars, sturgeons, bowfins, and paddlefish all look \"primitive\" but are living fossils. Yet they are doing nicely in today's environment.11\n \n IN 1994. in Wollemi National Park (in the Blue Mountains) the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Services found a pine tree once thought to be extinct. They are close relations to plants only found in the so called \"Jurassic and Cretaceous\" periods. (65-200 million years ago [ET*]). There are very few of these trees left in an isolated area.44\n \n The following aquatic animals alive today are also examples of creatures that have not evolved since their fossil ancestors:- lobsters, crayfish and rays (fossils found in Jurassic rock), lampshells, mussels oysters, thumb nail shells (fossils found in Carboniferous rock), sharks (fossilized teeth found in Devonian rock), mackerel, perch, herring, jelly fish, fogs, the nautilus etc.46\n \n Of the 12,000 fossilized insects the majority are similar to living types of insect found today.46\n \n The fossils of bees, ants, cicadas, beetles, termites or cockroaches, and other insects are always practically identical with (though often larger than) their modern descendants. The same applies to the arachnids and myriapods.51\n \n Other famous living fossils include the tuatara (supposedly extinct since the Cretaceous Period until found still living in New Zealand), the Lepidocaris crustacean (only found as fossils in Devonian rocks), the lingula brachiopod (\"extinct\" since the Ordovician), and even the trilobite (chief index fossil of the even more ancient Cambrian Period).51\n \n If all of these species have not evolved in 50 million [ET*], 100 million [ET*] or even 200 million [ET*] years, then why should we believe that they (or anything) have evolved? Some changes due to speciation have occurred, but not the large scale changes that evolution supposes.44\n \n http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/living.htm",

As I said about crocodiles- they have remained virtually unchanged because change was not necessary for them as a population. This is what you don't seem to be grasping- just because some of a species remain virtually unchanged does not mean that \"the species\" has remained unchanged. In the case of a hypothetical population where one group become isolated, a single or many differences may evolve in that location whereas the \"original\" group remains virtually unchanged.\n \n To answer your question \"why would we believe that they (or anything) have evolved?\"- based on all evidence, that it what appears to have happened.

   "How could the Coelacanth disappear for over 80 million years [ET*] and then turn up alive and well in the twentieth century?44 \n \n Easy, first of all it didn't disappear, it just evolved. As Lurch stated the modern Coelacanths are not identical to the fossilized ones. They live in a different enviornment and what are the consequences of them living in a different environment? They evolved of course! Yes this was a surprise for the scientific community, but it does nothing to falsify evolution. Quite the contrary, it gives support to the theory. \n \n So the coelacanth would never have moved up on land as hypothesized in the evolutionary scheme.  \n \n These modern coelacanths wouldn't, they are evolved to live in a deep water environment, but the ancient coelacanths were shallow water dwellers and so they could have evolved to live on land eventually. Please, you really don't understand the theory of evolution at all!\n \n The primitive-looking coelacanth has a massive organ in its head that has scientists scratching their heads.

I looked up sharks, skates and rays and you are outright lieing when you say they have not evolved! from here:evosharks \n \n \"There are many misconceptions regarding the evolution of sharks and rays. Contrary to popular belief they have not remained unchanged for 300 million years. However, many of the families we have today have been in existence for perhaps the last 150 million years. Compared to our own paltry 3.5 million years this makes the elasmobranchs very ancient indeed. The fossil record is sketchy at best when it comes to sharks. Cartilage is preserved very poorly so the bodily structures of many early sharks are purely speculative. Fortunately for the paleontologists, sharks discard their teeth on a regular basis and these teeth which fossilize well are often enough to allow accurate identification of individual groups and help place them correctly in the evolutionary time line.\"\n \n So sharks and rays HAVE evolved! Took me all of 5 minutes to disprove your little list.\n \n Of the 12,000 fossilized insects the majority are similar to living types of insect found today.46 \n \n OK, let's check out insects. From here:insectevo \n \n \" Just as the Paleozoic is often called the age of the trilobite, modern time is often called the age of the insect. The insect fossil record extends back some 400 million years to the lower Devonian. The Pterygotes (winged forms) underwent a major radiation in the Carboniferous. The Endopterygota* underwent a another major radiation in the Permian. Survivors of the mass extinction at the PT boundary evolved in the Triassic to what are essentially the modern Insecta Orders that persist to modern times. Most modern insect families appeared in the Jurassic, and further diversity probably in genera occurred in the Cretaceous. It is believed that by the Tertiary, there existed many of what are still modern genera; hence, most insects in amber are, indeed, members of extant genera. What seems most fascinating is that insects diversified in a brief 100 million years (give or take) into the modern forms that exist with minor change in modern times.\"\n \n And I like this part myself from the same sources:\n \n \" Insect evolution is characterized by rapid adaptation with selective pressures exerted by environment. Rapid adaptation is furthered by their high fecundity. It appears the rapid radiation's, and to this day the appearance of new species result in insects filling all available environmental niches.\"\n \n So it appears insects evolve rather rapidly, your points are refuted by the experts, in the future rely on sources that don't lie to you.",

It seems that someone fed you a line and you went for it. the ancestors of the \"lowly\" chimp family weren't preserved in numbers. In fact, I don't know of any examples of fossil chimps. Their environment is not very conducive to fossilization. However, the climatic changes that changed parts of Africa from forest to scattered woodlands and savannas tended to create drier conditions that tended to preserve fossils much better. That is why we have many examples of the human lineage since divergence from chimpanzees than we do of chimpanzees over the same period.\n \n So the case that you state is backwards. We have quite a few examples of fossils that have characteristics that are midway between an apelike ancestor and humans, but none that show the divergence of chimps from that same ancestor. I'm sure you aren't going to be so ignorant as to claim that fossils like the australopithecines are really just early chimps. That would mean that that chimpanzees went from a knuckle-walking quadraped when it had a common ancestor with the gorilla to a biped and the time of the split with the human lineage and back to a knuckle-walking quadraped. By the way, there is also a lack of early gorilla fossils for the same reason that we don't have chimp fossils. Same with Orangs. They all live in environments that don't preserve fossils very well.\n \n For more information about ape and hominid evolution you might go to the library and consult Scientific American. In August of 2003 there was an article (Planet of the Apes) by David R. Begun on the origins of the great apes (Proconsul, Dryopithecus, Sivapithecus, Oreopithecus, and Ouranopithecus). There is an article by Ian Tattersall in the January 2000 issue called We Were Not Alone that summarized the hominid fossils.\n \n Possibly if you became better informed you wouldn't get the claims backward and say that there are lots of chimp fossils and no hominid fossils.",

   "Unkerpaulie,\n \n Do you know the difference between a monkey and an ape? There is no such thing as a monkey counterpart to an early hominid. Our relationship to any monkey is the same as the relationship of a chimp to a monkey.\n \nI never said anything about 'upward' evolution.\n\n But it seems that it was implied. Maybe you didn't mean that, but you aren't very clear what your point is.\n \nhowever, early humanoids would have had the ability to create and use tools as well as solve relatively complex problems.\n\n How early? Homo habilis was so named because of his association with tools. Some earlier species seem to have used very crude tools.\n \nIm sure they would have been more resourceful than their small-brained monkey counterparts.\n\n As I mentioned, there are no monkey counterparts. And what does resourceful mean in this context. Do you have examples.\n \nEven more puzzling is, if they existed in small narrow populations and they weren't to successful in survival, how come humans exist?\n\n But they were successful in survival. The fossil record shows that there were hundreds of species of apes over 40 million years. Most of them didn't survive but some of them evolved. In fact, in the changing environment of Africa some 5-7 million years ago, the hominids were more successful. The chimps are still restricted to forest dwelling while the hominids became adapted to the drier open country. Hominids also became bipedal. And there were probably several different species of hominid that lived at the same time.\n \nalso, if the successors of these humanoids were in competition with their ancestors, how could they survive?\n\n The were hominids, not humanoids. And they may not have been in direct competetion with other lineages. What is it about competition that you don't grasp. Do you believe that since two teams compete in the Superbowl that neither can win?\n \nwould the evolving offspring kill off their parents? (yes, it sounds sarcastic... but its not)\n\n No, it's not. It just shows shallow thinking. Populations evolve. Maybe you can explain to me why there are any humans since we seem to try to kill each other off frequently - just look at the history of the Christian wars of Europe where one sect tried to wipe out the others. Or the Crusades. How about WWI or WWII. Why are there still humans?",

   " \"but we had the aptitude for tools that they lacked. isnt that kinda amazing as well?\n\n There is an evolution of tools going on alongside the hominids, it didn't just appear from nowhere, woudl start of like in the form some chimps use tools now and would eventually progress as brain size increases (as the ability to better recognise possible tools, and alter to make better tools becomes a fitness increasing trait) \n \n \n\n were the \"small-niche\" hominids the direct predecessors of modern man? and if so, how did they all die out, yet leave an abundant human population at the same time?\n \n\n No, not in all cases and the proper niche ones (nut and dedicated vegetarian ones) evolved at the same time as the human predecessors. However generalists can survive greater climate change easier than specialists, so as the forests increasingly gave way to grassland and savanas the plains dwelling generalists survive and the forest dwellign specialists die.\n \n \n\n did the \"earlier\" hominids and the \"emerging\" hominids coexist for there to be competition? and how does one species assimilate another to become like them? if the \"earlier\" hominids were ancestors of the \"emerging\" hominids, how would there be competition? \n\n Species is a dodgy word as it isn't actually a real concept just something invented to make classifing similar orgainsms easier- it is actually impossible to define in a realistic way. They would not actual exist but the 'more human' hominids of a group were more sucessful and reproduced more, so the group would tend to have more hominds with 'human' traits than ones without, this process carries on over generations witha varity of different mutations and you find that without the two 'species' competing and ever really coming into contact the recent members of the same family group would be unable to breed with their ancesters many generations ago and one 'specise' has replaced another.\n In odd cases where the more human family groups moves back to where there are older types of homind (where the humanifing mutation hasn't emerged and otehr oens have) the more human ones do compete with the other group which is closer to the ancestral type and the 'older' type die out because they are not as well adapted.",

   "Okay, unkerpaulie, I'm going to try to explain this process to the best of my abilities, keeping in mind that the last physical anthropology class I took was about ten years ago. \n \n Creatures live in groups according to their social organization, right? That means, not all together like in a big football stadium, but in seperate groups. These groups may meet each other incidentally, change and grow, sometimes split up if their number become to great to be supported, etc. \n \n Over time, some characteristics would begin to dominate particular groups, because of these happening to be somehow advantageous to the situation of that particular group. Other groups might remain pretty much unchanged, due to new characteristics by chance not being advantageous, and the dominant characteristics therefore remain stable. \n \n As more time passes, these groups become more and more distinct, and what used to be a large population of similar creatures becomes several populations of different creatures. Some groups die off, either because of competition from others around them, or changes in predators, or catastrophic events. In this way, you have similar species living side by side, sometimes in competition, sometimes evolving ways to change their niche, sometimes dominating or dying off, according to various conditions. \n \n If you were to imagine the structure of a tree as an analogy- while some branches come off the trunk and don't bend all the way to the tip, side branches can form off them and grow parallel just as far out.\n \n See the graph of the fossil record on this page for a visual representation of homonid evolution. Note how at a particular time, Australopithecus africanus were living side by side with Australopithecus robustus and Homo habilus. Later, while all record of Homo habilus are gone, we have Homo erectus. Did they kill their parents? No, this was a change that occurred over millions of years. Slowly, the characteristics associated with erectus began to predominate, until the entire population differed from their their ancestors. At the same time, Australopithecus robustus remained basically the same. Eventually, for whatever reason, they died out completely, and no ancestor of theirs is alive today.\n \n Where monkeys and apes come into this is that at some point our common ancestry split, so they evolved in parallel but separate populations. Our closest ape relatives still have a 95% genetic similarity to us.",
