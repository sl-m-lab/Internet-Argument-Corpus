   "What is the Judeo-Christian-Islamic name of the Creator?\n \n The Holy Bible-Qur'an names YHWH Allah.\n \n YHWH Allah = LORD God?\n\n \n The answer to your question is simply, NO! And here it is shown archeologically why that is an historical FACT. allah was a pre-islamic moon deity which to this day is represented in the symbol of islam which is the crescent moon. http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/images/crescent.gif Here's an excerpt from the link. \n Allah - the Moon God\n \n The Archeology of The Middle East\n \n The religion of Islam has as its focus of worship a deity by the name of \"Allah.\" The Muslims claim that Allah in pre-Islamic times was the biblical God of the Patriarchs, prophets, and apostles. The issue is thus one of continuity. Was \"Allah\" the biblical God or a pagan god in Arabia during pre- Islamic times? The Muslim's claim of continuity is essential to their attempt to convert Jews and Christians for if \"Allah\" is part of the flow of divine revelation in Scripture, then it is the next step in biblical religion. Thus we should all become Muslims. But, on the other hand, if Allah was a pre- Islamic pagan deity, then its core claim is refuted. Religious claims often fall before the results of hard sciences such as archeology. We can endlessly speculate about the past or go and dig it up and see what the evidence reveals. This is the only way to find out the truth concerning the origins of Allah. As we shall see, the hard evidence demonstrates that the god Allah was a pagan deity. In fact, he was the Moon-god who was married to the sun goddess and the stars were his daughters. http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/moongod.htm",

   "If you look hard enough you'll find people who claim the Judeo-Christian God is actually the thunder god of a pre-judaic pantheon, doesn't make it any more sensible than claiming that Muslims worship the moon. Your link presents a false dichotomy. Muslims could still be worshipping God even if their understanding of him has been impaired by Mohammed's errors.\n\n \n But that isn't what my link contends at all. It shows archeological evidence that the PRE-ISLAMIC arabs worshiped a pagan moon god who's religious symbol, the crescent moon is even exactly what the current symbol for islam is. Why in the world would you deny that kind of evidence with nothing more than your own opinion? Do you have archeological evidence of your own that disproves what I have submitted?\n \n La illah ila Allah....There is no god but Allah.\n \n Muslims claim they worship the same God as the Christians and Jews. They claim that Allah is a generic term that just means God. Allah is not the name of the Arabic god, they claim, but simply a word meaning God in Arabic. Muslims claim that Allah was always the biblical God and that Islam just continued and perfected these religions with the same God. This claim of continuity of their religion is profoundly important in their attempts to convert people to their relgion and to legitimize their faith. Muslims also cite that since Christian arabs call God Allah, this is proof that Allah is a title or word, not a name. They claim this was always what they called Allah and some even try to claim that Allah is mentioned in the Bible.\n \n Throughout the ancient Middle East, the people were predominantly pagans. They worshipped a moon god. The word for god in Arabic is ilah. Archaeologists have uncovered temples to the moon god throughout many areas. This was the most widespread religion in that part of the ancient world. The symbol for this moon god was the crescent moon. This same symbol is still used throughout the Middle East today.\n \n The Sumerians left thousands of tablets describing their moon god. He had many names. The most predominant name they used was Sin. Remnants describing this god were also found throughout Mesopotamia. The Assyrians, Babylonians, and Akkadians also worshipped the moon god Sin. This god married the sun goddess and had daughters. Sacrifices were constantly made to them. The title of the highest god, the moon god, was Al-ilah or Allah. Pagan arabs even used the name of Allah in their children's names, such as Abdullah. Mohammad's father's name was Abdullah (slave of Allah.) Evidently, Allah was the name of a pagan god long before Islam was established.\n \n The most prominent deity in Mecca (Mohammad's birthplace) was Hubal (Hub'al - the Allah reference is there.) This seems to be a variation of the sun god Baal who is referenced in the Bible and detested as a pagan diety. Baal is also referred to as Beelzebub or Satan, a coicidence worth noting. Hubal was the chief god among 360 other deities. He was the Meccan's moon god . Since he was their highest god, he was likely the al-Ilah or Allah of Mecca. The Koran does not mention Hubal but speaks of 3 daughters attributed to Allah. They were, Al-Lat (the feminine version of Allah,) Al-Uzza and Manat. The moon god of the Arab world was always known to have daughters. But the Koran chastises the pagan Arabs for attributing daughters to Allah specifically. Since the Koran claims that the pagans credited Allah with 3 daughters, Allah had to have been a specific god and could not have just meant \"The God.\" The god with 3 daughters was the moon god. The highest god was always called Allah. Logic would lead to the conclusion that Hubal and Allah were one and same god. The Koran never warns against worshipping Hubal. Why did Mohammad stop short of warning the new Muslims of worshipping Hubal, who was their greatest pagan god?\n \n The following verses show that Allah was a god who the pagans worshipped along with other deities:\n \n Say: O people! If you are in doubt as to my religion, then know that I do not serve those whom you serve besides Allah but I do serve Allah, who will cause you to die, and I am commanded that I should be of the believers. (10:104)\n \n I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon besides Allah when clear arguments have come to me from my Lord, and I am commanded that I should submit to the Lord of the worlds. (40:66)\n \n Evidently, the pagans were already worshipping Allah, along with many other gods before Islam was introduced. Ilah is used for any god but Al-ilah (contracted to Allah), was the name of the SUPREME. \n \n The supreme god was the moon god, as witnessed by all the moon references that still exist in the Middle East today. When Mohammad professed \"Allau Akbar\" (Allah is the greatest) he was professing that his favorite god, known as Al-ilah or Allah, was greater than all the others and was the only one to be worshipped.\n Mohammad could not give up so many of his pagan and animist habits, and knew that he could not convince the masses to follow his new religion if he expected them to give them up. So he kept many of those rituals in Islam. The pagan Arabs worshipped the moon god by praying towards Mecca several times a day. Muslims today pray towards Mecca several times a day. The pagan Arabs worshipped the moon god by making a pilgrimage to Mecca, walking around the Kaba, and kissing the black stone. Muslims today do all these things. The pagan Arabs sacrificed animals to the moon god. Muslims today sacrifice goats to Allah during a celebration called Eid-ul-Adha. Pagan Arabs threw stones at figures representing the devil. Muslims today do the same. Muslims today fast during Ramadan which is the month that begins and ends with a crescent moon. They have never given up their moon god.\n \n \n \n The Koran even admits several times that Allah is the name of an Arabic god:\n \n Pronounce the name of Allah over it: and fear Allah; for Allah is swift in taking account. (5:4)\n \n Call upon Allah, or call upon Rahman: by whatever name ye call upon Him, it is well: for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. ( 17:110)\n \n And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of Allah, Allah's name should be celebrated? (2:114)\n \n The Koran also gives itself away when it purports that the Christians and Jews did not believe in Allah. Of course they didn't, only the pagan Arabs did.\n \n O people of the Book! Do ye disapprove of us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah, and the revelation that hath come to us and that which came before, and that most of you are rebellious and disobedient?\" (5:59-60)\n http://www.islamicide.com/id43.html",
