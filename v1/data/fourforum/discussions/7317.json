   "Okay, before I say anything, let me just say that I have not seen Brokeback Mountain and there for I don't have any real opinion on it. And there for will not say any remarks on the movie it self but...\n \nSickening new film trashes America's cowboy heritage\n \n As our national mental health sinks ever lower, the media masters in Hollywood are figuring out how to cash in on -- and accelerate -- the trend.\n \n Of course, BrokeBack Mountain is just one of many outrages committed by the Hollywood elite. This \"gay cowboys\" propaganda is just the latest in a long series of culturally destructive efforts by this elite.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=7256...\n\n Siegfriedson, are you capable of giving your own personal opinions on anything with out just simply quoting your white supremacy websites? I've noticed a few other places where you start a thread where you quote from one of those websites and then don't even give your own personal opinion on it. You are able to think for yourself aren't you? Or do you let those websites do your thinking for you?\n \n Now I know that it was asked that only people who have seen the movie or read the book to post and as I said, I haven't done either. But my post wasn't really about the movie or book. If I ever get around to seeing it on cable, I might have an opinion but I don't have one to give. So I'm not going to go off on a tangent about it.",

   "I don't know how anyone can say \"Sickening new film trashes America's cowboy heritage\". If they knew about history then they might know that many of the cowboys were in fact gay. Cowboy heritage is being trashed, it's being shown.\n \n And then there's this quote \"But there are still plenty of Ennis Del Mar's out there who long for love and intimacy and end up with a broken heart because our culture doesn't permit them to accept who they really are.------Libby Post\". Well even though most people don't believe it, and gays will probably go ballistic after hearing this and rant on about how I'm wrong even though I'm not, being gay isn't part of who anyone \"really is\". It is a choice made later in life. No one \"is gay\". They choose to be. How many children in elementery school look at other kids of the same sex and think they are cute? None. They are still pure and haven't been corrupted by society. Homosexuallity isn't a part of life, it is a corruption of it. It is no different than having sex with a camel. Both are wrong.",
