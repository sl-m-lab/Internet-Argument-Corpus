   "Thank you Joe. I think that when a person is confronted with the issue that they have previously only had opinions on, they are forced to be real and honest. We can fight all day long as to whether or not a fetus is a worm or child but when it's yours....and it's growing inside you and you carry it around all day (and makes you nauseous aaalllll day emoticon_rolleyes ), yet you know that you cannot accept it....there is nothing else you can do but be honest with yourself.",

   "On this day 33 years ago woman were giving rights above anyone else...the right to kill their own children. The world finally realized that woman are so wise that they know when it is best to kill their children...however, once the child is born then the woman is not as wise anymore. Let us dance in the streets of blood of the 40 million innocent that have been killed in the worst genocide in history. Sing and Praise for the selfish of this world.\n\n \n This is one of the most ignorant things I have ever read. \n \n I have news for you Steve, there were abortions before Roe v. Wade. Abortion in fact, is older than history, it has been around as long as humanity has been having families. Before people lived in the highly developed community's they live in nowadays, they lived of the land, and ate what they could find. As a result they knew how the resources in their environment affected their bodies, they knew what gave them the energy they needed, and they knew what was poison, and you better believe they knew what leaves or roots they had to eat to educe a miscarriage. The abortions that take place in clinics in modern times are no more than scientific developments on this entirely natural human practice made for the sake of safty. Abortion and other forms of abandonment are and always have been a harsh and difficult part of life. Roe v. Wade did nothing more than protect the rights and the privacy of the unfortunate women who have to deal with this difficult reality in their own lives.\n \n It was a ruling that protected them from people like you who causally dismiss this part of nature as \"immoral\" or \"wrong\" because you don't have to deal with the consequences of that dismissal.",
