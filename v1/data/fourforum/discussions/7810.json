   "An Afghanistan man who converted from his Islamic faith to Christianity has been arrested in Kabul for apostasy. Under Sharia Law, death is the penalty for apostasy. Afghanistan clerics, who are commonly judges and supreme court members, and the general population support Sharia Law, which in this case is at odds with one of the basic tenets of US imposed democracy, freedom of religion. \n \n Is this another in a long series of seemingly unresolvable differences between Western style democracy being imposed on conquered nations with indigent belief systems and customs? Or is it an issue that if freedom of religion is forced by Western powers and the puppet Afghanistan President that will strengthen general Afghanistan resolve against US occupation, considering US and formal Afghanistan government troops control only about 15% of Afghanistan? \n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/25/AR2006032500484.html",

   "IMO .. It is another example as to how arrogant the elected government of the U.S. has become.\n \n These people are not now, nor have they ever been intrested in the type of democracy that America is exporting. This is a group of people that think their way of beliveing is the only way of believing. ( kinda like others I know ) They are not apt to change just because a bunch of rich business men disguised as politicans wish it to be so. We are creating more problems than we are solving.\n \n As a side note .. I find it very ironic that the president that rose to power on the coat tails of the christian religious right to power, has now been faced with the reality of the situation !!",

The US administration is, unfortunately, reaping what is sowed.\n\n \n I view it as another US reward for supreme arrogance. After displacing the fundamentalist Afghanistan Government and again turning Afghanistan into the world's largest producer of opium and heroin, our (US) leadership is now attempting to influence their national belief system. In a country 99% Muslim. \n \n I've read that that Afghanistan President Karzai (US sponsored) has given assurances to world leaders supporting his government, such as it may be with the majority of Afghanistan loyal to tribal leaders who prefer the opium trade and not Karzai's heavy-handed democracy, that Afghanistan will not execute the individual in question. That statement is against quotes from powerful Afghanistan clerics encouraging death.",

Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\" Article 18 of the declaration guarantees the freedom to worship and to \"change\" religion or belief.~\n \n A newer release says the Afghanistan Government is now going to have him examined to determine if he's psychologically fit to stand trial.
