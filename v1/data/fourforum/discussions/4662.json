   "Many Germans want to bring back the Berlin Wall.\n \n http://today.reuters.co.uk/News/newsArticle.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyID=2005-03-26T130834Z_01_DOB647286_RTRIDST_0_OUKOE-GERMANY-WALL.XML\n \n BERLIN (Reuters) - Nearly a quarter of western Germans and 12 percent of easterners want the Berlin Wall back -- more than 15 years after the fall of the barrier that split Germany during the Cold War, according to a survey.\n \n The results of the poll, published on Saturday, reflected die-hard animosities over high reunification costs lowering western standards of living and economic turmoil in the east.\n \n The survey of 2,000 Germans by Berlin's Free University and pollsters Forsa found 24 percent of those living in western Germany want the Wall back -- double the eastern level.\n \n In Berlin itself, 11 percent of westerners and 8 percent of easterners said \"yes\" when asked: \"Would it be better if the Wall between East and West were still standing?\".\n \n The Berlin Wall was breached on November 9, 1989, paving the way for the unification of Communist East Germany with the West on October 3, 1990. But billions of euros (dollars) spent rebuilding the east have failed to prop up the depressed region, which is plagued by high unemployment and a shrinking population.\n \n The poll also found that 47 percent of the easterners agree with the statement that the West \"acquired the east like a colony\", while 58 percent of the westerners back the statement that \"easterners tend to wallow in self-pity\".",
