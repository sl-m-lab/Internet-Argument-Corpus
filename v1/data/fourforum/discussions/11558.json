   "Putting Lieberman on the Democratic ticket in 2000 was clearly a mistake. He seems most comfortable in the Republican Party. His stance on the Iraq war has put him at odds with most Democratic leaders nowadays. If he wants to switch allegiances, that's up to him. He won't be missed by most Democrats. (He reminds me of Zell Miller. When I used to live in Georgia, folks there called him Zig Zag Zell.)",

In protest, He ran under the banner of the Independent Party and overwhelmingly defeated the Democrat by a hundred thousand votes. And for a State election, that is a huge margin. \n \n Now, to show the absolute hypocrisy that IS the Democratic Party, when they saw that the Senate numbers were then 49 Dem, 49 Rep, and 2 Independents, as a result of Leibermans victory, they claimed Leiberman as an Independent Democrat which gave them the majority in the Senate. So they'll try to destroy the man, but if they fail, they will still use him for all the political clout they can get out of him. \n \n That's why there's nothing at all they can or will do to try to punish him for supporting John McCain. Because they need him more than he needs them. All he needs to do is change his Senate status to an Independent Republican and he can change the Senate majority over to the Republicans. \n \n I just heard on the News that Leiberman is going to give a press conference demanding that the DNC in Florida stop implying that Sarah Palin is a Nazi Sympathizer because she once wore a Pat Buchanon for President button. Can you imagine such a presumption? But that is the level of politics that the extreme left is stooping to. \n \n The good news is that it proves beyond any shadow of a doubt how absolutely apoplectic and threatened they are by her very real credentials. They see no other way to neutralize her impact than to attempt to utterly destroy her reputation. emoticon_smile Can anyone say thank you Jesus? And don't forget PTL. emoticon_xangel",

CNN is putting story headings on their website about teenage pregnancy! Why are they not focusing on Palin and her views? Why is Palin and her family not getting a fair shake? Obama made such a big deal about his family being off-limits, but there is MUCH more dredging going on against Palin and her family than he had to deal with. It's a sad and pathetic state of affairs for the media and left-blogoshere, really.",

It's a sad and pathetic state of affairs for the media and left-blogoshere, really.\n\n \n It's obvious that they fear her in a big way. They know her record is real and substantial for being so young, compared to the artificial and manufactured record that Obama is attempting to run on. Look, do a search on whether most Presidents have been elected out of Congress or from Governors over the States. You will find the vast majority have been Governors. And that's because Running a State Government is exactly like running the Federal Government, just on a smaller scale. But nothing that Legislators do is in any way practical preparation for the Presidency. \n \n In fact, they have absolutely nothing in common at all, so Sarah Palin in fact is better prepared in real practical terms than any of the three men, with her experience first as a Mayor for 2 terms, then as a Governor of the largest State, and the largest Energy State in America for the last 2 years. And the evidence of her quick adaptation to that job was her many accomplishments in only TWO YEARS on the job. She hit the ground running.\n \n These attacks by the left are also very telling in that they completely ignore an 80% bipartisan approval rating in her home state of alaska. It takes some real nerve and lack of respect for the truth to attempt to demonize her in light of the affection she enjoys at home by her constituency.",

You have bought into this Republican strategy, to bash the media as allegedly being unfair to Palin, when it's not true, and you present no evidence that it is true. \n \n The mainstream media have been fair to Palin. What you call the \"left blogosphere\" consists of individuals posting blogs. Anyone can post a blog and say whatever they please. Take a look sometime at what posters in the \"right blogosphere\" have said about Hillary Clinton, calling her names like \"Shrillary.\" \n \n There is a huge difference between people blogging, who are responsible to and under the control of no one, and journalists who work for responsible media outlets like the New York Times and the Washington Post. The journalists for the mainstream media labor to provide fair reporting, and their writing is overseen by editors. Different from them are the writers of opinion pieces, who are presenting their personal viewpoints, not reporting the news.",

They did a press release to kill that rumor.\n \n You have been taken over by the Obama bias news (no it isn't liberal bias...they hate Hillary too).",
