   "This was really a letter written by a soldier, but some of the \"facts\" have come under question.\n \n \n\n As I head off to Baghdad for the final weeks of my stay in Iraq, I wanted to say thanks to all of you who did not believe the media. They have done a very poor job of covering everything that has happened.\n \n \n I'm sorry that I have not been able to visit all of you during my two week leave back home. And just so you can rest at night knowing something is happening in Iraq that is noteworthy, I thought I'd pass this on to you. This is the list of things that has happened in Iraq recently: (Please share it with your friends and compare it to the version that\n your paper is producing)\n \n -Over 4.5 million people have clean drinking water for the first time\n ever in Iraq.\n -Over 400,000 kids have up to date immunizations.\n -Over 1500 schools have been renovated and ridded of the weapons that\n were stored there so education can occur.\n -The port of Uhm Qasar was renovated so grain can be off loaded from\n ships faster.\n -School attendance is up 80% from levels before the war.\n -The country had it's first 2 billion barrel export of oil in August.\n -The country now receives 2 times the electrical power it did before\n the war\n -100% of the hospitals are open and fully staffed compared to 35%\n before the war.\n -Elections are taking place in every major city and city councils are\n in place.\n -Sewer and water lines are installed in every major city.\n -Over 60,000 police are patrolling the streets.\n -Over 100,000 Iraqi civil defense police are securing the country.\n -Over 80,000 Iraqi soldiers are patrolling the streets side by side\n with US soldiers.\n -Over 400,000 people have telephones for the first time ever.\n -Students are taught field sanitation and hand washing techniques to\n prevent the spread of germs.\n -An interim constitution has been signed.\n -Girls are allowed to attend school for the first time ever in Iraq.\n -Text books that don't mention Saddam are in the schools for the first\n time in 30 years.\n \n Don't believe for one second that these people do not want us there. I have met many, many people from Iraq that want us there and in a bad way. They say they will never see the freedoms we talk about but they hope their children will. /DIV<\n \n \n We are doing a good job in Iraq and I challenge anyone, anywhere to dispute me on these\n facts. So If you happen to run into John Kerry, be sure to give him my email address and\n send him to Denison, Iowa. This soldier will set him straight.. If you are like me and very disgusted with how this period of rebuilding has been portrayed, email this to a friend and let them know there are good things happening.\n \n Ray Reynolds, SFC\n Iowa Army National Guard\n 234th Signal Battalion\n\n \n \n http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_ray_reynolds.htm gives some of the inaccuracies.",

   "I bet we could have similar results if we invested 114 billion dollars in any major city in the United States. Maybe we should try that experiment next time. You can market it any way you like, but the bottom line is we were out of line, it wasn't our place to remodel Iraq. Unfortunately, no one asked the average taxpayer if they agreed with our foreign policy. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "There is a a pretty good article at http://urbanlegends.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.orwelliantimes.com/2004/04/26.html that shreds Sgt Reynolds letter pretty badly.\n \n In Reynolds defense, my wifes uncle just got back from Iraq. HE has been in every good sized conflict since vietnam. He knows the Army, has seen how things work, and knows all the tricks. He was telling me about how terrible things are in Iraq right now, and I told him \"If you keep saying things like that you are not going to get to be on fox news to tell everybody how the media is distorting the truth and how much we have helped those poor people\". HE laughed and said something about \"the kids actually fall for the **** they are told by our PR guys\".\n \n According to him, the soldiers in Iraq are assaulted with endless propoganda about how bad the IRaqis had it and how much better it is now. He told me a story about going out to secure a helicopter that had hit some power lines and gone down (safely) and the pilont (who is an officer and should no better) was dumbfounded that they had hit power lines, sine just that morning he had heard that there had never been power in that section of Iraq (there was power almost everywhere in Iraq pre-war). \n \n Reynolds took a lot of **** for this when it came out (wince it is full of inacuracies), but in all fairness to the guy, he was repeating what he had been told and what he had been led to believe.",

   "Self-serving indoctrination and ongoing propaganda is nothing new in military service. The primary motivation desired by any military command is building unit cohesiveness and inter-dependence based on doing the 'right' thing while facing possible death. For good reason few of them understand, many ex-military consider their serving squad mates the closest friendships they ever bonded. \n \n Many of the officer fragging incidents in late Vietnam were the result of newly arrived jr officers full of fresh army training, indoctrination and propaganda attempting to order seasoned troops on virtual suicide patrols because the US was the 'superior' force doing the 'right' thing. As our common sense as a nation and in youthful indivuduals has seriously eroded over the past 30 years, I'm not at all surprised the propaganda has become more effective. The power line story is almost pathetic.",
