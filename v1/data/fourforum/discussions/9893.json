   "In 1984, Falwell called the gay-friendly Metropolitan Community Church \"a vile and Satanic system\" that will \"one day be utterly annihilated and there will be a celebration in heaven.\" Members of these churches, Falwell added, are \"brute beasts.\" Falwell initially denied his statements, offering Jerry Sloan, an MCC minister and gay rights activist $5,000 to prove that he had made them. When Sloan produced a videotape containing footage of Falwell's denunciations, the reverend refused to pay. Only after Sloan sued did Falwell cough up the money. \n \n (snip)\n \n As with his positions on abortion and homosexuality, the basso profondo preacher's own words on race stand as vivid documents of his legacy. Falwell launched on the warpath against civil rights four years after the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision to desegregate public schools with a sermon titled \"Segregation or Integration: Which?\" \n \n \"If Chief Justice Warren and his associates had known God's word and had desired to do the Lord's will, I am quite confident that the 1954 decision would never have been made,\" Falwell boomed from above his congregation in Lynchburg. \"The facilities should be separate. When God has drawn a line of distinction, we should not attempt to cross that line.\" \n \n Falwell's jeremiad continued: \"The true Negro does not want integration.... He realizes his potential is far better among his own race.\" Falwell went on to announce that integration \"will destroy our race eventually. In one northern city,\" he warned, \"a pastor friend of mine tells me that a couple of opposite race live next door to his church as man and wife.\" \n \n As pressure from the civil rights movement built during the early 1960s, and President Lyndon Johnson introduced sweeping civil rights legislation, Falwell grew increasingly conspiratorial. He enlisted with J. Edgar Hoover to distribute FBI manufactured propaganda against the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and publicly denounced the 1964 Civil Rights Act as \"civil wrongs.\" \n http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070528/blumenthal",

But I believe that we have the ability to experiment in every direction. Experimentation can lead to habitual practice, and then to a lifestyle. But I don't believe anyone begins a homosexual.\"\n \n On Martin Luther King Jr.: \"I must personally say that I do question the sincerity and nonviolent intentions of some civil rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. James Farmer, and others, who are known to have left-wing associations.\"\n \n On Martin Luther King Jr., four decades later: \"You know, I supported Martin Luther King Jr., who did practice civil disobedience.\" \n \n On public education: \"I hope I live to see the day when, as in the early days of our country, we won't have any public schools. The churches will have taken them over again, and Christians will be running them.\"\n \n On the separation of church and state: \"There is no separation of church and state.\" \n \n On feminists: \"I listen to feminists and all these radical gals. ... These women just need a man in the house. That's all they need. Most of the feminists need a man to tell them what time of day it is and to lead them home. And they blew it and they're mad at all men. Feminists hate men. They're sexist. They hate men; that's their problem.\"\n \n On global warming: \"I can tell you, our grandchildren will laugh at those who predicted global warming. We'll be in global cooling by then, if the Lord hasn't returned. I don't believe a moment of it. The whole thing is created to destroy America's free enterprise system and our economic stability.\"\n \n On Bishop Desmond Tutu: \"I think he's a phony, period, as far as representing the black people of South Africa.\"\n \n On Islam: \"I think Mohammed was a terrorist. I read enough of the history of his life, written by both Muslims and non-Muslims, that he was a violent man, a man of war.\"\n \n On Jews: \"In my opinion, the Antichrist will be a counterfeit of the true Christ, which means that he will be male and Jewish, since Jesus was male and Jewish.\"\n http://www.slate.com/id/2166220/fr/flyout/",

   "Your comparison was flawed, jim's trucking. Your statment was that some posters celebrating this man's death are equal to (or at least as bad as, if you wish) those who wish for and plan the death of millions. This would mean either celebrating his death is equal to planning the death of millions (since both groups wish for someone's death) or that those that wish his death also planned his death if we ignore the millions of deaths part.\n \n \n \n A better phrasing would be: \"Those who have penises... than those who have vaginas\" to avoid overt redundancy, though it is still a poor example since your original statement referred to behavior instead of rigid, biologically determined groups. \n \n No, it would mean that having a penis and having a vagina are equal (or at most equal to, if you wish) in some significant way.\nFirstly, there's no need for you to change my wording. \"Are no better than\" is what I wrote and what I meant. \n \n Secondly, you still fail to see the flaw in your assumed connection of the first party to the actions of the second.\n \n I'll put it to you one more time:\n \n A's who do B are no better than C's who do D. \n \n There is no implication here that A's do D, or that B and D are in any way identical...regardless of what B and D are. There is no way a sane, logical person should infer what you did.\n \n As I said, get your money back if at all possible. You were \"jipped\"!",

   "\"Falwell took his prejudices to such an extreme that at times you wondered if the man was sane. Take this quote about the American Civil Liberties Union: \"The ACLU is to Christians what the American Nazi party is to Jews.\" All those ACLU concentration camps, with their poison showers and crematoriums? How have they managed to hide them so well?\n \n And speaking of his stupidity, \"The whole (global warming) thing is created to destroy America's free enterprise system and our economic stability.\"\n \n Falwell was not, as he claimed, a theologian. When you examine his belief system, it becomes evident that his god wasn't God, or Jesus. It was only the status quo. He supported patriarchy; it gave him his power. He supported capitalism as though God had a preferred economic policy. He supported the death penalty because revenge is easier than turning the other cheek. He supported the destruction of the environment because he couldn't even think so far out of the box as to treasure the Garden of Eden and be concerned about its fouling.\n \n Anti-Semitism? \"The Jews are returning to their land of unbelief. They are spiritually blind and desperately in need of their Messiah and Savior,\" Falwell said. Another time, he announced that the Antichrist is alive and living as a Jewish male.\n \n No, Falwell was not a man of God. Falwell was a snake oil salesman, a hustler of the first water.\n \n It must feel so good to be able to hate like that. To be so self-righteous. So egotistical. So proud. So sure of your own damned, small-minded prejudices that you feel no shame in attributing them to God himself.\n \n Bullies, hustlers, hypocrites, fanatics and the rest of the rats who hide behind the Bible must be called out. Falwell is only one of a pack. Pat Robertson is another. George W. Bush is one, too. There may be too many to name. And don't forget their followers.\n \n All hiding behind Christianity in the pursuit of power. All interested only in their own self-aggrandizement. All ignorant. All uncreative. All lacking in empathy. All happy to pick on those they perceive as weaker than themselves. All indifferent to the pain of others.\"\n \n CommonDreams.org",

   "Other than the comment about Falwell not being sincere about his beliefs, I found some things to agree with too. The only reason I bring up the sincerity issue is that I see no reason to think he didn't really believe what he was preaching. Hate isn't always intent-to-deceive; sometimes people who speak hate really do believe what they're saying. I think he probably believed what he preached. Religious people sometimes believe some bizarre stuff.\n \n FWIW, he did apologize (if I remember correctly) for the post-9/11 comments. Doesn't make them any less despicable, but it is the record.\n\n \n Well, perhaps. But he was a liar, and he wouldn't correct himself. Believing in the hate speech one preaches doesn't really excuse it, when the opportunity for correction is there, in the presence of Soulforce. He turned his back and continued to spew hatred. As for his apology, it was of the \"I'm sorry if my remarks offended anyone\" variety. Not much of an apology.\n \n Falwell may not have been Satan incarnate, but he was not a good man.",

   "To malign is to basically say nasty things about a set of people. To say \"you're no better than those you malign\" is to say that those nasty things you have said apply to yourself as well (for reasons not specified in this example). This is the most rational and reasonable interpretation. It does indeed imply \"badness\".\nNo cigar this time either.\n \n Just because you malign someone for being a whore does not mean that the person who says you are no better thinks you are a whore also.\n \n There are three entities involved in the sentence, \"You are no better than those you malign.\"\n \n One is you.\n One is the set of those you malign.\n One is the speaker of the sentence, which in no way should automatically be considered to be in agreement that the set of people being maligned by you should be maligned at all.\n \n As previously stated, \"no better than\" does not automatically imply badness on the part of whatever follows \"than\".\n \n I scored 97 on a pop quiz in college.

   "Wow. It seems that those here who hate Falwell are a lot more obsessed with the man than any evangelical Christian I've ever known. Given how much fun and gloating some here seem to be having with this man's death. Let's not forget Falwell was willing to not only meet and dialogue with Soulforce when Mel White was meeting with him, he agreed to some of the things they asked and found some common ground(http://www.soulforce.org/article/528). He was also apologetic about some of the things people here have berated him for. Not to mention the charity work he's done for the poor.\n \n Given the fact this has basically become the Falwell-bashing thread, I think it's time for a more fair perspective, and this editorial hit the nail on the head about the circus going on over this preacher's death.\n \n While I did not care at all for his dispensationalism, his hawkishness on foreign policy, and his apologetics for the Bush administration, Falwell did do a number of good things and his ministry helped out many hurting people. Whether you agreed or disagreed with him politically and/or theologically, it is completely unfair and ignorant to think that his large ministry did not do a great deal to help people over the years.\n \n I am always sad at any loss of life, especially when it is unexpected. Apparently, many others out in the blogosphere disagree with me on this point and are celebrating Falwell's sudden and unexpected death. When I heard the news, I immediately said to myself, \"I bet some on the hard left think this is funny or are celebrating.\" And indeed a cursory blog search indicated this to be exactly the case.\n \n The comments I've read from anti-Falwell types have been disgusting and heartless. Celebrate the death of a man because you disagreed with some of his opinions and political activism? How humane. The most passionate anti-Falwell types hated him because he did not support homosexual behavior and because he was anti-abortion. This alone makes someone a hateful, worthless bigot according to the hard left. But let's just say for a moment that Falwell is a bad as these folks claim. How does celebrating his death and laughing about such a tragedy make his critics any better? In fact, it arguably makes them look much worse. For all the talk about Falwell being a hypocrite from these people, perhaps they should stick their own self-righteous faces in front of a mirror.\n \n I cannot recall a time I read about Falwell making statements where he laughed off or celebrated the death of a gay person. I can't remember a time where his writings celebrated when misfortune fell on someone from the pro-abortion community - even though his disagreements with their beliefs were just as passionate as their disagreements with his beliefs. Also, can't someone rest in peace for an hour before we start bringing up their shortcomings? Apparently not, based on the statements from some of Falwell's most fierce critics.\n \n Of course, in political debate, some folks on all sides of the spectrum are able to dehumanize anyone who disagrees with them. Therefore, who cares about the people close to Falwell, his family and friends who are grieving, and who cares about the loss of life? Ding-dong the bigot is dead. That's all that matters.\n \n The worldview of such people is to judge another's personal worth solely based upon whether they are for or against abortion, pro or anti gay rights, or whatever other hot button issue riles them up. While I think Falwell got some issues wrong, this does not make him a piece of dirt in regards to everything else. I'm quite sure I don't have it all together on everything either; and really, neither does anyone else for that matter. Therefore, we all should be careful about making blanket statements about a person's worth or intentions.\n \n Certainly many who are laughing off Falwell's death regularly pat themselves on the back for being so much more tolerant than the \"Religious Reich.\" Many of Falwell's critics despised him because of his \"hate\" (hate being defined as opposing abortion and homosexual behavior). But how does acting like a hateful, intolerant crank show ones love and tolerance? Or does love and tolerance only extend to people who think and act just like they do?\n \n What are some of the nice words being posted around the web in remembrance of Falwell in the hours since he's passed? Here's a sample from this site:\n \n \"You're pulling my leg! No wonder everyone is so happy and shiny faced today. I think we all should have lots of premarital (or in some other way offensive to him) sex to celebrate. Yes, I see no ill in celebrating the death of a man who has caused so much pain and suffering to others. Not in the least.\"\n \n \"I had hoped the fat bastard would have pulled through and lived the rest of his life as a vegetable. Darn, there goes my veggie soup.\"\n \n \"I think a stake through the heart would be appropriate... just to make sure...\"\n \n \"wow - this feels as good as the day Reagan died!\"\n \n \"We've been singing this great song in my office 'Somebody's burning in hell,\n \n Somebody's burning in hell!'\"\n \n \"Yeah - maybe if we're all nice and respectful and Xtian about it, the fundies will be impressed and like us. Burn in hell you fat hateful lying hypocrite pig!\"\n \n There's dozens of other nice, tolerant, and loving memorials that can be read at that site. But how about hearing from the diversity celebrating folks over here on this page:\n \n \"I hope he is gang-banged in Hell by Satan, Saddam, Hitler, and Liberace.\"\n \n \"makes me want to sodomize as a tribute to him. now, if only I knew the sexual preferences of other gawker readers...\"\n \n \"So how soon is the funeral, and where? Some serious grave-dancing is in order, here.\"\n \n \"Our Father which art in heaven, please let Pat Robertson be next!!\"\n \n I could go on and highlight posts from plenty of other blogs, but I think you get the point. If these individuals want to act so uncivilized and uncaring, then they certainly have the right to think and say whatever they want, no matter how nasty it might be. But if they make the claim that they are more loving, kind and tolerant than Falwell, or really just loving, kind and tolerant in general, then they should stop lying to themselves. They ought to just admit that they are as uncaring and nasty as the next rigid ideological extremist.\n \n The militant hard-left should stop pretending that it celebrates diversity and cares about all people. Individuals who make up this movement actually only tolerate and celebrate other people who think and act just like they do. Once you deviate from the party line, you become a worthless human being. And if we've learned anything from the passing of Jerry Falwell, it's apparently a good thing if you die.\n \n Celebrate Diversity.\n \n http://www.lewrockwell.com/barnwell/barnwell80.html\n http://billbarnwell.blogspot.com/2007/05/tolerant-loving-people-who-are.html",

Still, even a spiritual perspective doesn't have to be homophobic. Many Christians support equal rights for gay people, and many gays are still -- though I can't understand why -- Christian. So there you have it. Gay and spiritual are not antagonistic.\n \n I'm a confirmed materialistic naturalist myself, and I suspect that largely owing to religious homophobia, with religion telling gays what manifestly isn't true, a greater proportion of gays probably tend towards being atheistic or agnostic than anyone else.

So it is understandable that you wish to justify immorality and sinful behavior. So far, I haven't posted much on this subject because I wanted to see what the reactions would be. And just as I thought, typical vitriolic hatred towards a man who has done much to make America aware of problems with the culture today.\n\n \n Oh give me a break. There is not much correlation between being religious and being spiritual. THat's the dillusion of the christianists. I don't hold myself hostage to one particular religion. The activists on the gay side are reacting to the suppression from the religious side. If the religious side would just stop.... there would be no reaction to debate. Fair is fair in life. I'm married to a wonderful man here in Germany. The sky hasn't fallen. Two gay men finished raising me after my miserable heterosexual parents failed so miserably to provide a happy, safe and non-violent home. \n \n Fallwell did not by the christian code. His hate for the alleged \"sinner\" was too great. He fabricated stories to get people en mass to rise against a relatively small segment of society. For what? Rather than uniting the world, he worked on dividing the world against us. And we're suppose to talk kindly of him? Am happy he's moved on and facing his judgment.

   "And we all owe you hatemongers a show of gratitude for revealing that you are total reprobates in that anything good and righteous will immediately be perceived by you as bad. And anything evil and wrong will be seen as good in your twisted perspective. So thankyou for exposing the combined darkness of the gay communities hearts on the National stage through commentary and articles throughout this week. \n \n Once again Jerry Falwell has successfully exposed your entire community for the shallow and empty vessels that you are. And he did it without speaking one word against your bankrupt lifestyle. emoticon_xangel \n\n \n Can you please explain to me what is good or righteous and/or good about the dear departed reverend's comments in blue and also be so kind, and possibly courageous enough to answer the questions directed at you. All of which was previously posted - link:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=263551&postcount=93\n \n \nWow, what's it feel like to know another mans heart so completely jito ? And how does it feel to be omniscient to know how many people he harmed in his life ? And how incredibly sanctimonious are you to believe these things of him just because he disagrees with your worldview ? How do you know his beliefs aren't 100% right and yours aren't 100% hellbound ? Just some potential reality to consider oh self righteous omnipotent one.\n\n \n \nFirst of all, Jesus, you are the last one to call anyone else self-righteous or sanctamonious. The halo you paint around yourself is beyond sacherine.\n \n Of course I did not know his heart. But his actions and words are a matter of public record. He indirectly and directly caused plenty of harm and offense. I can't believe you support his swill. Seriously, if below are the representation of your all loving God - he can go to hell - or I can, if heaven be where he resides.\n \n \"If Chief Justice Warren and his associates had known God's word and had desired to do the Lord's will, I am quite confident that the 1954 decision would never have been made,\" Falwell boomed from above his congregation in Lynchburg. \"The facilities should be separate. When God has drawn a line of distinction, we should not attempt to cross that line.\"\n \n On Martin Luther King Jr.: \"I must personally say that I do question the sincerity and nonviolent intentions of some civil rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. James Farmer, and others, who are known to have left-wing associations.\"\n \n On Bishop Desmond Tutu: \"I think he's a phony, period, as far as representing the black people of South Africa.\"\n \n I have a half-white, half-Mexican child. Do you agree with Reverend Fallwell that Civil Rights are wrong and that laws should never been enacted to ensure equality amongst the races? I thought you were Arabic. Do you feel that you have less value than a white man? That my son does? That there is something wrong with him because he is mixed?\n \n \"AIDS is the wrath of a just God against homosexuals.\"\n \n And the other victims? God's wrath on faithful wives whose husband screwed around and brought it home - maybe she wanted to get a job? The babies who are born with it - the anti-Christ in disguise? All the STRAIGHT Africans - what for being black?\n \n On feminists: \"I listen to feminists and all these radical gals. ... These women just need a man in the house. That's all they need. Most of the feminists need a man to tell them what time of day it is and to lead them home. And they blew it and they're mad at all men. Feminists hate men. They're sexist. They hate men; that's their problem.\"\n \n I am an educated, independent woman who is capable, supporting myself and happy. I don't hate men just because I won't play doormat to ones who are insecure. If they can't find their self-esteem without having a neck to step on someone doing their laundry for them - that doesn't make me a radical, it just makes them babies.\n \n Real men aren't threatened by women who are capable and strong.\n \n Fallwell insulted me, my son, my family, my chosen life (to be a single woman). He would have shredded all that and forced me to follow his faith in a heartbeat if given the chance. I have no reason to mourn his passing. I don't care what book he toughted - he was a hateful, ugly, vile, little man. If he wanted to be remembered otherwise he should have curbed his actions and his tongue. To quote your precious bible \"You reap what you sow.\"\n \n Fallwell brings to mind the lyrics of a favorite rock song. And just in case you don't get it - its not about Jesus.\n \n Hey man\n Look at here\n We got Jesus\n He's drinking beer\n He's playing cards\n He's rolling dice\n He's drinking whiskey\n And loving life\n And its the same song he always sings\n He's got it all cuz his dad's the king\n And its the same song he always sings\n \"YOU can't get to heaven when YOU'RE doing that thing.\"\n \n - Hugh Dillon / The Headstones\n \n\n \n If making statements is representative of hate, our lack of sympathy for a man who made insulting many of us his mission is nothing compared to the insults he heaped on millions who did NOTHING to him.

   "I express my condolences for his family, but I can very safely say that I will not feel a bit of sadness (in fact, quite a bit of happiness) over his passing. I can only say that I hope God treats him just as he has treated others throughout his hate-filled life. There is only one place tht he and fellow gay-haters (Archie included), and it happens to be very warm andstarts with an \"H\".\n\n \n I am sure that in Dante's Inferno, this guy would be in that special hole for snake oil salesmen, frauds, and thieves. For that is what he was. Greed and gluttony I thought were among the immortal sins that christianists believe in. What about it Archie?",

   "No problem Lesz, I get hammered all the time. I maintain my sense of humor. And sometimes I admit, I'm wrong. But, this ain't one of em. My comment concerning self concern stems from the many comments, with venom concerning the attitude of straight folks concerning homoism. \n\n \n \"homoism\"? emoticon_confused Oh, you mean \"equal rights for gay people\". Got it. Yes, you are completely wrong on that.\n \n \nThe fact is that it's not really an issue for most straights. They just don't give a hoot.\n\n \n Yes, we realise you don't give a hoot as long as it isn't your neck on the block. That's what activism is all about; to force you to give a hoot even as you defend the status quo.\n \n \nBut, folks like one in particular on this board are so hostile about it, it raises the hair on the neck and makes me wanna tell him to shut up. But, I don't. So, I throw in my 2 cents and wait for the hammer. lol\n\n \n Wow. People are hostile towards those who would negate their human rights? I wonder why that might be? :xbanghead",

   "Quotes from Jerry Falwell:\n \n Aids is not just God's punishment of homosexuals; it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals.\n \n If you are not a born-again Christian, you're a failure as a human being.\n \n Christians, like slaves and soldiers, ask no questions.\n \n The separation of church and state is a myth like global warming.\n \n I hope I live to see the day when, as in the early days of our country, we won't have any public schools.\n \n \n Sen. Sam Brownbeck: Falwell's great words and actions were never be forgotten. Jerry's moral character and principles will forever be remembered deep within my heart.\n \n Rudy Giuliani: We all have great respect for him.\n \n John McCain: Falwell was a man of distinguished accomplishments.\n \n Mike Huckabee: One of Christendom's great leaders.\n \n Mitt Romney: The legacy of his important work wil continue.",
