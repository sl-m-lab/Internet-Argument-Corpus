   "To all of you Democrats that thought the Democrats were going to \"bring back responsible government\", I say \"The joke's on you\". \n \n Democrats link pet causes to troop plan \n By ANDREW TAYLOR, Associated Press Writer \n Fri Mar 9, 5:46 PM ET\n \n WASHINGTON - Democrats seeking votes for their Iraq-withdrawal plan have stuffed the bill it's in with billions of dollars for farms, flu preparedness, New Orleans levees, home heating and other causes.\n \n Some critics say the Democrats are simply being opportunistic - using a must-pass measure for funding U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan to carry items that can't advance as easily on their own.\n \n At the same time, Democratic leaders are trying to increase support for setting deadlines for ending U.S. military combat in Iraq, which they've made part of the larger legislation.\n \n It's plain that Democrats are unwilling to approve the bill's $100 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan without devoting considerable sums of money to the home front.\n \n \"The president wants to make sure we take care of Iraq, but I think we also have to make sure that we don't lose sight of what we have to do here at home,\" said Rep. Rahm Emanuel (news, bio, voting record), D-Ill.\n \n Already, money in the bill not directly related to the war exceeds $20 billion\n ......\n \n \n All told, farmers would get $4.3 billion in disaster aid, aimed chiefly at the drought-stricken Great Plains and California farmers hurt by a hard freeze earlier this year.\n \n The drought disaster aid package has been scaled back, in part to make room for $74 million for a peanut storage program that pays storage and handling fees as farmers market their crop. And Rep. Sam Farr (news, bio, voting record), D-Calif., is pressing for $25 million for spinach farmers who pulled produce from market shelves after last year's E. coli outbreak.\n \n Meanwhile, House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey (news, bio, voting record), D-Wis., isn't waiting on the upcoming farm bill to extend income subsidies aimed at small dairy farms. Obey's 13-month extension would cost $283 million.\n \n Those items and others, including $2.5 billion for homeland security projects such as additional cargo screening at ports and airports, $2.9 billion for levee improvements and other aid for the Gulf Coast, and $735 million to close shortfalls in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, offer virtually every lawmakers a reason to vote for the Iraq funding bill - regardless of their feelings on the war itself.\n \n Democrats insist they aren't being bought off.\n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070309/ap_on_go_co/us_iraq\n \n [/quote]\n \n Now that the Democrats are settling back into their easy chairs, they're busy thinking of new spending programs......just like they did under Reagan when our debt first began to climb. :xcensored :xcensored",
