   "The French government has solved the problem of redefining marriage by creating a legal union between any two eligible persons regardless of gender that allows the couple to have rights equal to those that are legally married.\n \n What objection could the gay community have with such a solution here in the US?\n \n Civil partnerships or PACS in France: how they work from FrenchEntr\u00e9e.com\n \nThe term PACS stands for Pacte Civil de Solidarit\u00e9, which was introduced into French law on 15 November 1999.\n \n Put simply, a PACS is a contract signed by two people of the same sex or opposite sex, who are over 18 years old and want to organise their life together. It's an agreement that cannot be entered into by two people who are part of the same family, who are already married or who are already part of a PACS.\n \n The contract - which can prepared by the parties themselves or by their lawyer - is registered together with all relevant documents at the registered office of the civil court in the area where the couple live.\n \n ..................\n \n \n The couple are free to detail their obligations to each other in the contract. But in any case by law they are obliged to help and assist each other. \n \n The precise level of support is proportional to their income. The couple are jointly responsible for any debts incurred by the other through normal daily living - but not if those expenses are deemed excessive. All other debts remain an individual's personal responsibility. \n \n Unless the couple have decided to hold their assets in common according to the system of 'indivision' - where each item bought after the PACS is signed is deemed to belong jointly to both of the partners - the estates of each partner remain separate. Each partner remains the owner of the assets he or she buys - and responsible for his or her debts. \n \n The main advantages of a PACS are concerned with tax. The 'pacs\u00e9s' as they are known in France benefit from being taxed as a couple - and not as two separate individuals. This can often reduce their overall income tax burden\n \n And since August 2007, the surviving partner of a PACS benefits from the same inheritance tax regime as a surviving spouse in a married couple - which means there are no death duties to pay.\n\n \n Bonus question:\n (Can you spot the grammatical error within the quoted text?)",

   "This has got to be one of the LAMEST things you have ever tried to claim...\n Whether or not the laws were formed \"prior to the homosexual movement\" is irrelevant.\n\n \n Only in your mind is it lame foundit. It gets directly to the reason why certain inequities exist for homosexuals where as they were created specifically for reasons of oppressing blacks originally. Here's what I said again:\n [Archangel] \n You keep comparing the black plight of racism with the homosexual agenda when there is no comparison at all to be made. The reality is that the laws and policies which exist and conflict with the gay lifestyle do so because they were formed prior to the homosexual movement existing, or for moral reasons. None of them were created in order to oppress the homosexual.\n The rules regarding inheritance, tax laws, even hospital visitation and insurance rules were never written in order to oppress or limit the rights of homosexuals. They were written for very practical reasons to either safeguard individuals or companies at the time since the homosexual issue was nonexistent at the time.\n \n \nHOW MANY laws were formed before Martin Luther King Jr's movement?\n It's like you see an egg, and automatically assume the chicken must have crossed the road.\n\n \n I don't even know what your egg/chicken analogy is inferring. As for laws which oppressed blacks? Look at all of the segregation laws such as separate water fountains, white and black churches, restaurants and the like which permeated the South. Are there churches and restaurants where you aren't allowed in by law? I think not.\n \n \nDo you really think whites thought \"There's a black guy. Let's go legally harass him...\" emoticon_frazzled\n They wanted blacks out of their \"white\" schools. They didn't really care if blacks had their own schools.\n They road at the back of the bus so whites wouldn't have to look at them.\n\n \n A black guy, no. But the black community? Most assuredly. The white power brokers wrote laws specifically to keep blacks from being welcomed members of the larger community. They kept them in subservient positions and conditions so they couldn't rise above the station which the white community believed they belonged in. There are no laws which oppress homosexuals in such a way that says we don't care how qualified you are, we wont let you in and we have written laws to insure that agenda is carried out throughout our straight society. We have homosexuals in every single walk of life imaginable today, even those walks where certain inequities are perceived to exist.\n \n \nIt's the same arrogance and false pretense of superiority.\n Whether or not you can make some mewling about \"not meant to oppress\" is ridiculous!\n The laws DO oppress, and THAT is what is important.\n\n \n The validity of my statement is based on \"INTENT\". The point is that the laws you find restrictive were never created to restrict you since your community was never an issue in the writing of those laws. That cannot be said for the racist laws which oppressed the blacks which is why they too are offended by being used as a comparison by the homosexual agenda.\n \n Show me where it is written anywhere that heteros are superior to homosexuals and are to be treated in a superior way according to those laws.\n \n \nTell you what.\n Let's forbid \"Christianity\" for a few years, and tell you that you have an \"equal right\" to religion...\n Just as long as you worship Judaism...\n \n See how long it takes you to figure out how \"equal\" that is...\n\n \n Once again you make an absolutely ridiculous and incoherent comparison as if freedom of religion which is guaranteed to all religious belief systems in America, has anything at all to do with justifying the redefinition of marriage in order to satisfy the desires of a community which makes up approximately 4% of the population. Especially when the members of that group have the exact same rights to marry that the other 96% has. \n \n You would have a valid gripe if the law stated that homosexuals couldn't marry at all, no matter who it was. Even a woman. Also, you often bring up adoption rights. In many states if a boyfriend and girlfriend went into those same adoption agencies as sought an adoption they would also be turned away based on the same rules you complain about. Single men or women also can't adopt from those agencies in those states. What you call discriminatory laws were never designed or written in order to discriminate against homosexuals. They were designed to protect the adoptive babies from being placed with families which were ill prepared to properly care for or raise them.\n \n There is also an upper and lower age limit for adoptive parents, I guess we are also discriminating against seniors also, right? \n \n \n\"special right\"....\n I am eternally amused at how some people can claim that regarding homosexuals, when it's currently THE HETEROSEXUALS who have the \"special right\"... emoticon_emb\n\n \n They are special rights which you are seeking. The reason why it's accepted for heteros is because it has been the norm since the beginning of creation. It isn't based on prejudice or discrimination at all. It is based on preserving and protecting marriage from losing all continuity as an anchor for the nuclear family which must be protected if the family is to be preserved.",

That cannot be said for the racist laws which oppressed the blacks which is why they too are offended by being used as a comparison by the homosexual agenda.\n\n \n Those laws were not considered racist at the time, by those who supported the laws, Archangel. It was just preserving what was considered the natural social order from God. The same with the sexist laws, anti-Semitic laws, homophobic laws.\n \n \nShow me where it is written anywhere that heteros are superior to homosexuals and are to be treated in a superior way according to those laws.\n\n \n It doesn't have to be.\n \n \nOnce again you make an absolutely ridiculous and incoherent comparison as if freedom of religion which is guaranteed to all religious belief systems in America, has anything at all to do with justifying the redefinition of marriage in order to satisfy the desires of a community which makes up approximately 4% of the population.

How else can the law remain relevent? Rights are not a game of numbers either. \n \n \nYou would have a valid gripe if the law stated that homosexuals couldn't marry at all, no matter who it was. Even a woman.\n\n \n Of course the homophobes and heterosexists have no problem with a gay man marrying a woman. It helps to keep us in the closet. Much like Haggard the hypocrite. The right to marry means nothing, if one can't marry of one's choice. \n \n \nAlso, you often bring up adoption rights.

They were designed to protect the adoptive babies from being placed with families which were ill prepared to properly care for or raise them.\n\n \n Huh? What if the gay couple are not single. They are being discriminated against because the same relationship isn't recognized, because of its homosexual nature.\n \n \nThere is also an upper and lower age limit for adoptive parents, I guess we are also discriminating against seniors also, right?\n\n \n There many be reasons for that which is not simply about them having a certain birthday. It's because they may be too old or young, based on the maturity or physical/psychological/emotional faculties needed to raise kids. In the case of gays, it's simple discrimination because they are gay.\n \n \nThey are special rights which you are seeking.\n\n \n No, the same rights heterosexuals have.\n \n \nThe reason why it's accepted for heteros is because it has been the norm since the beginning of creation. It isn't based on prejudice or discrimination at all.\n\n \n What isn't based on prejudice and discrimination Archangel? Would that be the fact that the special referred to \"IT\", is accepted for heterosexuals, but not for gays? Sounds like the heterosexuals have a right the gays don't have, in other words, the heterosexuals can be said to have a special right. Why is the same right considered \"special\" suddenly when gays have it, or are calling for it? Why is it \"special\" for us to have what heterosexuals take for granted? You see gays as walking two steps behind, and the heterosexuals out in front, not shoulder to shoulder. \n \n \nIt is based on preserving and protecting marriage from losing all continuity as an anchor for the nuclear family which must be protected if the family is to be preserved.\n\n \n No, family can take many forms. I love all of my extended family too, equally, not just my nuclear. Divorce is a threat. Equal marriage for couples of the same sex, only changes the sex make-up of the parents. It's only a threat to exclusion of same-sex couples.",

   "You seem to equate \"failure to agree with me\" and \"failure to listen to me\". Just because I do not agree with you does not mean that I did not hear what you said.\n\n False.\n You initially asked: \"What objection could the gay community have with such a solution here in the US?\".\n I answered.\n Your question has been answered.\n \n \n \nThe comparison between racial segregation and the refusal to change the definition of marriage is invalid.\n\n Why is it invalid?\n Cause you say so?\n \n What you don't seem to realize is that racial segregation has a long history too. Separating the races, including in marriage, was a long-established practice.\n Part of the reason for the \"marriage license\" in the first place was to affect \"interracial marriages\", to allow the government some means of impacting them. Something to withhold from them.\n \n \n \nNo. Any male that cannot be prohibited by law from marrying should be free to marry any consenting female that also cannot be prohibited by law from being married.\n\n Again, you fail to realize how MODERN that definition truly is.\n The \"definition\" of marriage has changed over the centuries. It is your CURRENT interpretation that this is what YOU want to stick to.\n But your ANCESTORS probably had different ideals, and a different definition which you have since abandoned.\n \n \n \nIt has nothing to do with race or skin color.\n\n TODAY it does not.\n But from a historical perspective, it was VERY important to people.\n When Loving v Virginia was decided (1967), there was a THREE TO ONE margin AGAINST interracial marriage.\n Today, the margin against gay marriage is (at best) two to one (nation-wide).\n In fact, it wasn't until the late 80's / early 90's that the public's position shifted on interracial marriage. BEFORE that time, more people were AGAINST interracial marriage.\n AFTER that time, more people were FOR interracial marriage.\n \n \n \nIf your argument were valid, we'd have men claiming to have a right to use the LADIES ROOM, saying that their gender should not prohibit them from doing so.\n\n Which demonstrates you don't even understand what \"my argument\" is in the first place.\n I am talking about discrimination against RIGHTS. Marriage IS a right.\n \n Furthermore, the government is allowed to discriminate IF and ONLY IF they have a legitimate state interest for doing so. Segregating the genders for purposes of modesty and privacy is allowable. Especially if EQUAL facilities are created.\n The interests against gay marriage not only invoke a RIGHT (there is no \"right\" for a co-ed bathroom), but they also fail to demonstrate a legitimate state interest.\n \n \n \nIf you are a man, your gender prohibits you from marrying a man, just as it prohibits you from using the ladies room. Segregation on the basis of gender is not illegal or immoral.\n\n This argument was used in \"interracial marriage\" as well.\n They claimed that a black man was prohibited from marrying a white woman, like a white man was prohibited from marrying a black woman.\n \n Furthermore, segregation on the basis of gender IS illegal if it invokes a right, and lacks a legitimate state interest.\n Try having an employer put all the women on the second floor, and all the men on the third floor, and see what happens.\n \n \n \nNo. Today we have laws that say one cannot discriminate because of race. That does not mean that racism has disappeared. Racists are alive and well throughout the world.\n\n You say \"No\", but then your follow-on states nothing that conflicts with my statement.\n It states nothing that I disagree with.\n \n \n \nNo. Religion has nothing to do with this either.\n\n The \"religion\" example is an ANALOGY, demonstrating the fallacy in your argument.\n \n \n \nWhat you cannot seem to grasp is that marriage has been defined for thousands of years as a ceremony that bonds a man to a woman.\n\n And for a long period of time, only white land-owners could vote / have a say in government.\n But then people realized that the racial distinction was irrelevant and prejudicial.\n The gender distinction was irrelevant and prejudicial.\n \n The fact that a prejudice has a history does not justify the prejudice. It does not justify inequality.\n \n \n \nI said nothing of the sort. You don't need to pretend anything...not even do you need to pretend to be a woman if you are a man.\n\n Then you fail to recognize how the original classification in the first post of this thread is distinctly unequal.\n It's unequal like the side-entrance for ___ was unequal.\n It's unequal like \"sit at the back of the bus\" is unequal.\n \n It doesn't matter if the issue is race, or gender, or religion, or sexual orientation. These concepts do not somehow become \"equal\" just because we put a different characteristic into the blank.\n What DOES change is people's OPINIONS on whether or not it is ALLOWABLE. But that is something different from \"unequal\".\n \n \n \nQuite frankly, were I a gay man, I would be proud to let people know that I have a PACS with another man rather than try to mislead people by saying I was \"married\". Married means you have a spouse of opposite gender. Surely, you can come up with a word that means you are in a same-sex union.\n\n Quite frankly, you're not gay.\n Your statement demonstrates you don't get what it means to be gay, or how we think.\n \n Wanting to have some methodology to \"show we're not straight\" is, quite frankly, more of a concern regarding straights trying to ensure others don't think they're gay.\n There is no \"misleading\" people by saying I am married. I AM married.\n \n Do you think that people should have a different word to explain they were \"married\", but not married in a church?\n If John and Mary were betrothed at the justice of the peace, but no religious ceremony was performed, are they \"misleading\" people by saying they are \"married\"?\n \n \n \nAgain, I refer you to the toilets...separate and nearly equal. Men don't get the tampon dispensers and women don't get the urinals.\n\n It is so reassuring to see a straight person think of marriage as a \"toilet\"...\n < end sarcasm <\n \n Marriage is a right.\n Toilets are not a \"right\".\n \n \n \nDespite the fact that there exists a large percentage of gays that are quite vocal about their demands to be recognized as \"equal\", the heterosexual crowd in much larger and not so vocal. I won't attempt to quote percentages, but I am sure that your group is greatly outnumbered by people that do not want to change the definition of marriage just to make you feel good about yourself.\n\n This has nothing to do with \"feeling good about myself\".\n And I am amused when people try to quote statistics on opinions, without fully REALIZING what those statistics mean.\n \n Suppose gay marriage were legal tomorrow. Nation-wide.\n Would ANYBODY's opinions of gays automatically change?\n No.\n \n WHY would gays suddenly \"feel good\" about themselves just cause the government says \"you're married\"?\n \n There are multiple areas in these debates where I think the mentality of the anti-gay side demonstrates a Freudian externalization of their thought process.\n Here, the issue for the anti-gay side is really that they want the government to \"take a side\" on the issue. Ignoring freedom and equality, in favor of allowing the people some method to implement discrimination against gays.\n \n The truth is that gays CAN marry outside the government. It's not illegal for tolerant religions to perform \"marriage ceremonies\" for gays, and for gays to say \"I am married to Mark\".\n What the anti-gay side wants is akin to the same approach that was used for blacks. They want enforced segregation, and some means of being able to differentiate themselves from gays.\n To presume \"better than\" gays, with some presumed government symbology of that thought.\n \n \n \nI personally do not care who or what you shack up with and call your partner as long as it does not diminish what others consider a long established recognition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman. There is no need for you to tear that down just to satisfy your need for approval.\n\n 1) This has nothing to do with \"approval\", except probably in your mind where you want to believe the government has a form of \"disapproval\" in play.\n \n 2) There you go again with that illogical claim of \"tearing down\" marriage.\n Earlier, you claimed gay marriage was an \"attack\" on marriage.\n There is no logic in these claims. There is no logic in a pretense of \"validation\" or \"approval\" if the government recognizes a marriage.\n Brittany Spears was married for a few hours. Does anybody think her marriage was \"valid\" or \"approved\"?\n \n There is no \"attack\" on marriage. Gay marriage has existed in Massachusetts for a few years now, and it is not \"torn down\".\n If you want to concern yourself with something that \"tears down\" marriage, concern yourself with a 50% divorce rate. THAT \"tears down\" marriage.\n The fact that divorce is so rampant, and the opposition to it from \"gay marriage opponents\" is so absent, is a clear demonstrator that the anti-gay side does not really have any concern with \"protecting\" marriage at all.\n \n You want a real issue for \"tearing down\" marriage? Try this...\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/12313-sanctity-marriage-vol-xliii.html#post342871\n But of course, not one \"protect marriage\" proponent speaks up.\n \n It's like stopping the black voter from voting cause he can't read, but then allowing numerous white voters who can't read to go to the polls. Obviously, \"literacy\" is a false concern.\n And with gay marriage, PREJUDICE is the real focus for most ...",

Like saying \"voting is a right\", just because a court case may overturn racial discrimination in voting doesn't mean that the same case (thought processes and precedents) can't be applied to other issues like gender.\n \n With that said, obviously it doesn't automatically mean it does translate to any issue.

It wouldn't make much sense for our nation's constitution to pretend to guarantee us rights, if all it meant was that the state could discriminate based on their whim.\n The whole purpose of the 14th amendment was exemplified in the post-civil war racial discrimination of the state. Without the 14th amendment, the federal government would have had to allow the states to discriminate against blacks, in all their crazy, racist ways.\n \n The 10th amendment reads as follows: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n Since marriage is a right, discriminating against that right without a legitimate state interest (by the 14th amendment) is a power prohibited to the states.",
