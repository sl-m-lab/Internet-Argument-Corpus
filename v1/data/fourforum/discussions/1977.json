   "People take the bible to literal...when they think of creationism, they thing some big, giant bearded dude named God came down from the skies, and moulded mankind from dirt and water...when you think of it, our bodily chemistry is mostly made up iron, 60% water, electricity and many other nutrients, minerales and what not that you can find in the earth...either way, i doubt this is how it came to be...perhaps evolution is how God works? people forget how complex life is in general, and how we got here. Atheists believe life started from nothing. I don't believe this. Science itself is flawed, and is mostly based on theories, hypothesis...check this out \n rense.com/general50/goddidnt.htm\n pretty interesting",

   "Someone who does evil things isn't simply not doing good things, he is specifically doing evil. Evil is not the absence of good.\n\n Define evil.\n \n The concept of evil is very subjective. If something is truly evil, then there must be an absolute concept of evil. But you will never come to agreement with everyone else in the world as to what makes something truly evil or good. What is your standard for determining what is evil?\n \n Regarding the post above... Hmmm...\n \n Have you ever seen the planet Pluto? How about Saturn? Have you ever measured the sun with your own hands? Have you ever walked completely around the earth to show that it was a sphere (roughly)? The point is, there are many things that we accept as true because all known evidence suggests that it is true and no known evidence suggests that it is not true. \n \n Such is the case with evolution. Yes, the process of evolution has been observed and recorded by individuals. Just because YOU (general you) haven't witnessed it personally does not mean that you must accept it on faith alone. You could set up your own experiment or set out to study it for yourself and observe firsthand how it happens. But some people choose to learn from other people's experience and accept the research of others.\n \n \n\"Professor. All previous attempts to explain how the process works have failed. Since no-one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a priest?\"\n\n The first sentence is inaccurate, as is the first part of the second sentence. Therefore the quesion of 'are you not teaching your opinion, sir?' is moot. The theory of evolution has nothing to do with opinion. It matters not whether or not anyone believes in it. Evolution has been observed. There is no known evidence to suggest that evolution does not occur.",

It is a concept made up by humans to label something that we perceive to be 'bad.' There may be agreement by many that X is evil, but that does not mean that whatever X is, that X is absolutely evil. It just means that some humans label X as evil, which they are certainly free to do. But it doesn't mean that all humans will label X as evil. Nor does it mean that X is absolutely evil, separate from interpretation by any human being. Apart from a human being assigning a value to X, X is simply X.",
