   "FALLUJA, Iraq (Reuters) - The U.S. military has rushed more tanks and other armored vehicles to Iraq after requests from commanders in the bloodiest month for American troops since Saddam Hussein was toppled. \n \n http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=4977891&section=news\n \n  It looks like the resistance is building in Falluja. I've heard that there may be militants from other countries fighting there.\n \n Do you think we should press on, hold on or retreat from Iraq?\n \n I say, \"Press on! We knew it wasn't going to be easy when we started.\"",

One of them I know has been involved in attacks against Americans because his 3 daughters were killed during the war (2, 6, and 9) and he is ******. I think if we are going to blame this mess on foreign fighters, we need to do better than the dozen we have captured so far.",

I am only asking this since I have had several people come back home and tell me that this place is a madhouse, disorganized and full of hatred for the \"American Way\". \n Also there seems to be no way out but cowardly retreat if this current military strategy is kept up.\n \n Does anyone else see that? Anyone else smell a Nam?\n\n \n Nam was put together on the 'Domino Effect' spread of dreaded communism in SE Asia. All that stopped us there was China telling us, as they told France in their effort to retain their rubber plantations in a war 80% financed by US military aid, was that China would consider it a direct act of aggression if we occupied N. Vietnam and camped a half-million battle ready troops on a Chinese border. Same as Korea when MacArthur admitted to Truman he couldn't defeat China in a ground war and would have to use nucs to win it (and was relieved of duty for advocating same while considering a run for president).\n \n Iraq has no savior from our dominance other than guerilla warfare, proven unbeatable by any means other than wiping them out to the last man. While most nations merely disagreed with our Vietnam policies, They're beginning to spit on us for our actions in Iraq. We're using Israeli tactics developed over 40 years of attempting to break the Palestinians, which includes disregard of civilian life and structures. We've killed enough women and children to provide adequate guerilla enlistments for revenge purposes for many years. If you consider the extended family culture of Iraq, I can't imagine many Iraqis who now worship our presence in their country. \n \n Biggest difference I can see between Nam and Iraq is the presidential election being at stake and our shaky economy. If we continue to use extreme force in a fruitless attempt to bring Iraq to heel, financial support of our government could well be put at risk as 45% of our treasury issues are purchased by foreign entities. We already have signals of rising interest rates to enhance the attractiveness of those issues, the administration is faced with an economy driven by government and consumer debt, so we can't get the rest of the world too mad at us or rising interest rates would destroy domestic construction and subsequent consumer purchases of homes, our one bright economic star, in an election year. So maybe economics will replace China as a deterrent to our aggressiveness and then yes, lots of similarities between the results of Nam and Iraq. Terrorism will be ongoing as we haven't come to grips with our support of Israel or Mideast special interests, but that's always been an issue separate from the mess in Iraq.",

   "\n \n I say, \"Press on! We knew it wasn't going to be easy when we started.\"\n\n \n You say this like any of us had a say in whether we should have entered into this mess a year ago. It was pushed down our throats by this administration who based their whole premise on intelligence they molded to fit their needs. Now, sure, we're in a heck of a lose/lose quandary: If we pull out we wasted the hundreds of billions we've already spent, If we stay, we'll have to continue pouring money and troops in the region for years to keep stability. I hate to reduce this war to strictly economic terms, but it is the toll on our economy that will cost this country dearly. It reminds me of the old saying, \"Throwing good money after bad...\".",
