   "What Would Bush Have To Do To Lose? \n \n by Terrell E. Arnold, retired Senior Foreign Service Officer of the US Department of State\n \n 1. Americans are not bothered by the fact that in aligning himself with the neoconservatives, Bush has taken sides with political extremists who have little or no interest in the common good of the people of our country.\n \n 2. Americans are not disturbed by the fact that while Bush sat quietly in a classroom in Florida, without expression even after he was told what was happening, terrorists committed the most devastating terrorist attack in history on the United States.\n \n 3. Americans are not puzzled by the fact that Bush team emergency preparedness exercises on 9/11 had the perverse effect of leaving the window open to destruction of the World Trade Centers.\n \n 4. Americans are not confused that Bush used the 9/11 attacks to start a War on Terrorism against Afghanistan, but he almost immediately lost interest in that war in favor of attacking Iraq, a country that had not threatened us in any way.\n \n 5. Americans are comfortable about being given a string of reasons for attacking Iraq, every one of which was false.\n \n 6. Americans do not mind that Bush personally set aside the Geneva Conventions, the international rules of war, and implicitly or tacitly encouraged US interrogators to torture prisoners in Guantanamo, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n \n 7. Americans can live with the idea that on Bush's watch our country is more roundly distrusted and actively hated in more places than at any earlier time in our history.\n \n 8. Americans are delighted by Bush administration catering to their urges to drive large, more powerful SUVs and trucks, and they are happy that, on behalf of the United States--the largest single polluter, Bush has rejected international treaties needed to reduce global warming.\n \n Full list:\n \n http://www.rense.com/general57/lose.htm\n \n \n Related Threads:\n \n Bush, Kerry Worship the Israeli Lobby\n \n Conservatives, Unite Against Bush\n \n Top Ten Reasons to Fire Dubya\n \n \n \n .",

We were all surprised and devastated. I also feel the subsequent military campaign in Afghanistan was an honest and justifiable response to this attack. It wasn't until the invasion of Iraq that I profoundly disagreed with this administration and nothing has happened since to make me re-think my position. I think our government in general dropped the ball prior to 9/11, but I haven't seen anything credible to justify pointing the finger at Bush.",
