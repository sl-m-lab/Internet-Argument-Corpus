Only the most ignorant and stubborn skeptics, with a preconceived agenda which forces them to deny the possibility at all cost will ignore the obvious evidence in favor of denying it at all cost.\n \n If you skeptics at least showed an open mind and revealed a desire to prove or disprove this discovery with objective evidence, you would at least appear intellectually honest. But you start out attacking, scoffing, mocking and rejecting this discovery at the very outset without any interest in determining if it could be a valid discovery of a major historical event in the bible. \n \n You realize though that if this single event is ever to be proven absolutely true and accepted as such by secular science, it would completely destroy your scientific explanations for most all of human history going right back to the geological, biological and evolutionary assumptions you secularists accept as factual, not to mention the farce of abiogenesis and the big bang theory. It all falls apart so you must deny this at all cost which is why we understand your dilemma to reject it out of hand. It's just that you shouldn't make it so obvious if you really hope to maintain even an inkling of credibility as objective scientifically minded secular humanists. NOT!!! emoticon_rolleyes Here's part of the article for posterity so it remains after the link no longer works.\n \n Has Noah's Ark Been Found on Turkish Mountaintop?\n FOXNews.com\n The remains of Noah's Ark have been discovered 13,000 feet up a Turkish mountain -- according to a sensational claim by evangelical explorers.\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/static/managed/img/Scitech/Noah's%20Ark_doomsday_604x341.jpg\n An explorer examines wooden beams inside what some are nearly certain is the remains of Noah's Ark.\n \n A group of Chinese and Turkish evangelical explorers say wooden remains they have discovered on Mount Ararat in eastern Turkey are the remains of Noah's Ark. \n \n The group claims that carbon dating proves the relics are 4,800 years old, meaning they date to around the same time the ark was said to be afloat. Mt. Ararat has long been suspected as the final resting place of the craft by evangelicals and literalists hoping to validate biblical stories. \n \n Yeung Wing-Cheung, from the Noah's Ark Ministries International research team that made the discovery, said: \"It's not 100 percent that it is Noah's Ark, but we think it is 99.9 percent that this is it.\" \n \n There have been several reported discoveries of the remains of Noah's Ark over the years, most notably a find by archaeologist Ron Wyatt in 1987. At the time, the Turkish government officially declared a national park around his find, a boat-shaped object stretched across the mountains of Ararat.\n \n Nevertheless, the evangelical ministry remains convinced that the current find is in fact more likely to be the actual artifact, calling upon Dutch Ark researcher Gerrit Aalten to verify its legitimacy. \n \n \n \n A team of Chinese and Turkish evangelical explorers believe that they have found the remains of the Biblical artifact, Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat.\n \n \"There's a tremendous amount of solid evidence that the structure found on Mount Ararat in Eastern Turkey is the legendary Ark of Noah,\" said Aalten.\n \n Representatives of Noah's Ark Ministries said the structure contained several compartments, some with wooden beams, that they believe were used to house animals.The group of evangelical archaeologists ruled out an established human settlement on the grounds none have ever been found above 11,000 feet in the vicinity, Yeung said.\n \n During the press conference, team member Panda Lee described visiting the site. \"In October 2008, I climbed the mountain with the Turkish team. At an elevation of more than 4,000 meters, I saw a structure built with plank-like timber. Each plank was about 8 inches wide. I could see tenons, proof of ancient construction predating the use of metal nails.\"\n \n We walked about 100 meters to another site. I could see broken wood fragments embedded in a glacier, and some 20 meters long. I surveyed the landscape and found that the wooden structure was permanently covered by ice and volcanic rocks.\"\n \n Local Turkish officials will ask the central government in Ankara to apply for UNESCO World Heritage status so the site can be protected while a major archaeological dig is conducted.\n \n The biblical story says that God decided to flood the Earth after seeing how corrupt it was. He then told Noah to build an ark and fill it with two of every animal species.\n \n After the flood waters receded, the Bible says, the ark came to rest on a mountain. Many believe that Mount Ararat, the highest point in the region, is where the ark and her inhabitants ran aground.",

Other than to say they did it they offer nothing about who, when, where or the results. So far they have offered nothing but some pictures, close ups and of themselves, even though this site is 3 years old.\n \n The problems they face in proving this are A) they previously carbon dated wood from this site and it was determined to be from a later date. B) there is an unbroken archeological record for the area. C) there isn't enough water on the planet to get the Ark that high on the mountain. D) Given all the ground and aerial expeditions (and one with sophisticated mapping capabilities), one should surmise that if the remains of Noah's Ark are indeed on Mount Ararat, they are not in plain view; if the boat is there, it must be buried. There have been 2 attempts that used sub-surface Radar (Ground Penetrating Radar -\n GPR) technology on Mount Ararat to look under the ice. The 1988 Willis expedition and the 1989 Aaron/Garbe/Corbin expedition used GPR. The 1988 Willis expedition successfully surveyed the eastern summit plateau and the saddle area between the two peaks, concluding there were no Ark remains under the ice. The 1989 expedition was not as successful as the preceding year, where a less-capable GPR system was used in temperate (melting) ice cap conditions on the western plateau of Mount Ararat. However, they were able to determine the ice depth on the western plateau\n and scale the size of the Ark.\n \n If the remains of Noah's Ark were in moving ice on Mount Ararat (there is only one legitimate glacier, the Black Glacier, though there are other moving ice flows like the so-called Parrot Glacier), the Ark would have been ground to bits. ArcImaging contends that until the entire mountain has been adequately \"sub-surface\" surveyed using the latest remote sensing technology, some people such as the alleged eyewitnesses contended that the Ararat ice cap contains the remains of Noah's Ark since about 90% of the supposed eyewitnesses claim that the boat was sticking out of the ice even though the explorers over the past 50 years did not see the same boat-like structure.\n \n By the way since when have Christians had so much faith in Carbon Dating?\n \n Noah's Ark found? Not so fast - Cosmic Log - msnbc.com\n \n http://chapmanresearch.org/PDF/Noah%27s%20Ark%20on%20Mt%20Ararat.pdf\n \n To answer other posts in one. This story just came out today offering nothing more than a press release. It is hard to offer a rebuttal under the circumstances.\n \n Global warming is not just rising water and anybody who says the the ice sheets will melt drowning the earth is not accurately describing what is believed to be the result of GW. The devastation comes from the changes in weather patterns. Deserts were not always so and lush farming plains once were. Storms increase in intensity and more often striking farther, places that are more susceptible to the damage having not experienced them as such before.\n \n Who knows it may turn out to be the Ark. Time will tell, the truth has a way of making itself known given the time. Should it turn out to be true Jewish people will be asking \"Yeah, How you like now, huh? Christians on the other hand doesn't help very much. The same argument Christians will use to connect themselves to the Ark could be used to also validate Islam. Even for Judaism it's a stretch to say the Ark has been found therefore everything written in these books is accurate. Granted it isn't much of a stretch, maybe more like a relaxed reach.\n \n As for turning science upside down, how? That is the beauty of science, it finds ways to prove the claims it makes. Finding the Ark if anything should make Christians a little nervous. They can have strong evidence for the existence of God, but that in no way changes the scientific discoveries that show Christian understanding of the world has been wrong for most of it's existence. Science will merely add the God factor to the equation and continue on.",

And the deluge came both from the sky and from the fountains of the deep. These fountains of water from below is something the modern world has never seen and doesn't exist as far as we know today. So for you to say that there WASN'T, not ISN'T as you said, enough water on Earth to get the Ark that high on the mountain is just a ludicrous statement to make from our perspective. Especially since what they found is absolutely that high up on the mountain. \n\n \n Archie it is unclear whether it rained after creation according to the bible. The mist the watered the earth was probably rain, but maybe not. Common sense though says that it would have had to rain. Man was forced to toil in the earth to grow food. Which means it was growing the same as it is now where man must toil in the earth. Plants don't grow without water and people die without water so do animals. Rain is necessary to replenish rivers when it condenses and falls back to the ground and as snow that melts in mountains. \n \n Again it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the amount of water necessary to maintain at heigth of 20 feet above the tallest mountain for 6-12 months just isn't possible. Your talking about 3 - 5 Atlantic Oceans hidden on the planet and the places it could hide are kind of limited. \n \n \n \nThe rest of your post is equally as nonsensical as this statement as far as a rational and common sense argument is concerned which is why nothing else was worth responding to. The only thing you said that I can agree with is that it is too early to make any absolute claims that this is in fact the Ark of Noah's Flood. \n\n \n \n Of course this is my opinion based on the information I looked at, just as your opinion is based on information you find credible. It may turn out I am right, it may turn out you are right or it may remain a mystery. Just as you think it ludicrous to not think in terms of a biblical explanation I think it ridiculous to ignore credible scientific evidence to insist on biblical theory. \n \n \n \n11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\n \n 12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\n \n[/QUOTE]\n \n We also know that a Rainbow is not some mysterious phenomenon from God. It is a naturally occurring product of rain and light.",

I didn't compare one \"verified\" find, with one worldview projection from another verified find, I compared two verified finds with two worldview projections. That's a total of four - let me number them for you.\n \n 1) Wood is found in Eastern Turkey that is carbon dated at 4800 years old.\n 2) A crocodile-like fossil is found in Canada, about 600 miles from the North Pole, carbon dated at 375 million years old.\n 3) Projections are made from the discovery of the wood in Turkey that it could be the remains of Noah's Arc, thereby reinforcing the worldview of Biblical Christianity. \n 4) Projections are made from the discovery of the 375 million year old fossil that it was the first evolutionary step of a water-to-land creature, an ancestor of both monkeys and men, thereby reinforcing the worldview of your great-grandmother, Maddlyn Murray O'hair. \n \n You did a satisfactory job of zeroing in on numbers (2) and (3), but completely missed numbers (1) and (4). In my link showing the position of a creationist group about any relationship between numbers (1) and (3), their statement reads like this;\n \n \nnot knowing all the research methods that were employed, we will withhold judgment until further study. \n\n \n \n A discussion happened on these forums back in 2006. It was largely an atheist love fest about a relationship between numbers (2) and (4). If you'll check it out, you'll find no cautionary withholds of judgements \"until further study\". I'm convinced that you could search the entire internet and never find any atheist scientist interested in Tiktaalik Rosea to ever be cautious about further study before using it to further his/her worldview of atheism. That's the point I was making in post #16, that creationists do seem to be more cautious about separating actual science from personal worldviews than do atheists. (notice I said 'actual' science - not everyone considers proclamations about millions of years ago to be actual science)\n \n \nSo they found a structure, made of wood, on a mountain, and that means that the world was underwater?

You show that this is SOP for you as you never respond to the actual point we're arguing but only focus on any perceived minor error you can drum up in order to ignore what is actually being argued as you accuse us of being the ignorant ones.\n \n Here is the paragraph you are mocking the whole link over, and veritably, he makes a valid argument which is more complete than the mocking criticism you attempt to make based on your condescending arrogance. \n Mosaic life forms, however, are very far from being the intermediate forms required by the theory of evolution. The present-day Platypus that lives in Australia, for instance, is a mosaic creature that possesses mammalian, reptilian and avian features at one and the same time. But nothing about it constitutes any evidence for the theory of evolution. Mosaic life forms are not what evolutionists need to find in order to back up their claims; they need to find &#8220;intermediate forms,&#8221; which would have to be with deficient, only half-formed and not fully functional organs. Yet every one of the organs possessed by mosaic creatures is complete and flawless. They have no semi-developed organs, and there are no fossil series that can be proposed as evidence that they evolved from some other life forms.\n Here is the meat of his argument which very clearly expresses the difficulties evolution has in supporting its claims:\n The theory of evolution hypothesizes that a process based on random mutations, in other words on chance, took place. According to this claim, the millions of living species on Earth must have evolved from a vast number of intermediate forms, all subjected to chance mutations, and as a result had deformed, abnormal structures, and the fossils of these so-called intermediate forms should have been found. To put it another way, the fossil record should be overflowing with the remains of life forms that can only be described as freaks of nature. However, this is known not to be the case. When species emerge, they do so suddenly, with all their distinguishing features fully developed, and with no series of freaks among them. In his 1999 book Fossils and Evolution, Tom Kemp, curator of Zoological Collections at the Oxford University Museum, describes the position as follows:\n \n In virtually all cases a new taxon appears for the first time in the fossil record with most definitive features already present, and practically no known stem-group forms. (Tom Kemp, Fossils and Evolution, Oxford University, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 246)\n \n The general picture concealed by evolutionists\n \n Evolutionists attempt to give the impression that fossils actually support the idea of evolution. Yet the &#8220;missing link&#8221; concept is one that has been invented solely in the light of the needs of the theory of evolution and has no counterpart in the fossil record itself. The lack of fossil links alleged to connect species to one another has been known ever since Darwin&#8217;s time. Excavations by paleontologists since Darwin&#8217;s day have also failed to resolve this situation, which represents such a grave impasse for the theory of evolution and, on the contrary, have further confirmed the absence of any missing links among living groups.\n \n E. R. Leach, author of the book Rethinking Anthropology, wrote this in his article in Nature:\n \n Missing links in the sequence of fossil evidence were a worry to Darwin. He felt sure they would eventually turn up, but they are still missing and seem likely to remain so. (E. R. Leach; Nature, 293: 19, 1981)\n \n A. S. Romer, one of the most eminent paleontologists of his time, said this on the subject:\n \n \"Links\" are missing just where we most fervently desire them [to point to a transition between species] and it is all too probable that many \"links\" will continue to be missing. (A. S. Romer, in Genetics, Paleontology and Evolution, 1963, p. 114)\n \n David B. Kitts, professor of geology and the history of science at the University of Oklahoma admits the absence of the intermediate forms required by the theory of evolution:\n \n Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them. (David B. Kitts, \"Paleontology and Evolutionary Theory,\" Evolution, Vol. 28, September 1974, p. 467)\n \n The picture that emerges from the fossil record is completely compatible with creation. The record reveals that living things appeared suddenly and lived for long periods of time without undergoing any change at all. These facts can clearly be seen in an evaluation of evolution&#8217;s fossil impasse by the American paleontologist R. Wesson in his 1991 book Beyond Natural Selection. Stating that the gaps in the record are real, Wesson goes on to say that the absence of a record of any evolutionary branching is quite phenomenal. Species are usually static for long periods. Species and genera never show evolution into new species or genera but are replaced by another, and change is usually abrupt. (R. Wesson, Beyond Natural Selection, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991, p. 45)\n \n Some 250,000 fossil species have been collected to date, and there is absolutely no trace of intermediate forms in any of them. Evolutionists are behaving irrationally and unscientifically by ignoring this and embarking on campaigns of missing link propaganda.\n \n The Error of Biological Inference from Skeletal Remains\n \n When the bodies of vertebrates are fossilized, they generally leave no remains behind apart from bones. However, bones leave traces of only a very limited part of vertebrate biology, about 1%. When evolutionists begin interpreting the fossil remains of an organism, most of the information about its biology has been lost. Evolutionists, with almost no information concerning the organism&#8217;s soft tissue biology &#8220;fill&#8221; the gap in their knowledge according to the demands of the theory of evolution, which they have adopted as a dogma long beforehand.\n \n The intermediate form claims that evolutionists produce solely by looking at bones is no more than vague conjecture. In his book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, the molecular biologist Michael Denton makes the situation very clear:\n \n Because soft biology of extinct groups can never be known with any certainty then obviously the status of even the most convincing intermediates is bound to be insecure. (Michael Denton, Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, Burnett Books: London, 1985, p. 180)\n \n Even the most convincing appearing intermediate forms for evolutionists can subsequently let them down very badly. One excellent example of this is the Coelacanth phenomenon.\n \n Sensational reports show that evolutionists have learned nothing from the Coelacanth phenomenon\n \n As with the latest fossil Tiktaalik roseae, the Coelacanth is a fish that evolutionists once fondly imagined to be a missing link in the transition from water to land. Evolutionists examined 400-million-year-old fossil Coelacanths, which was once believed to be extinct, and drew a number of evolutionary conclusions from the remains. For example, they maintained that the bony structures in its fins were feet that helped the animal walk across the sea floor, and they also claimed that it possessed primitive lungs. The important point here is this: All these assumptions were made in the absence of any information about the Coelacanth&#8217;s soft tissue biology.\n \n The erroneous nature of producing evolutionary fantasies in the absence of any information about the animal&#8217;s soft tissues emerged following an important discovery in 1938. A living Coelacanth was caught, showing that it was not, as had previously been thought, an extinct life form at all. Furthermore, many more living specimens were caught in subsequent years. Evolutionists immediately set about examining the fish&#8217;s anatomy and way of moving in its natural environment, and saw that the missing link assumptions they had ascribed to it were completely incorrect. The fish, which they had assumed to live in shallow waters and to move by crawling over the seabed, actually lived at depths of around 180 meters, and they also observed that its fins never made contact with the seabed at all. The structure they imagined to be an evolving lung turned out to be a fat-filled swim bladder that had nothing to do with respiration whatsoever.\n \n The realization that the Coelacanth, which had once seemed such a convincing-looking intermediate form for evolutionists, was just an ordinary species of fish clearly shows that the intermediate form claim being made about this latest fossil is also based entirely on uncertainties and speculation, because it, too, is based on imaginative interpretation of soft tissues from the fossilized remains of an extinct life form. In short, the ongoing propaganda through the media is based on nothing more than the exaggeration of scientifically vague information in the light of evolutionist dreams.\n \n Evolutionists&#8217; missing link propaganda actually works against their own claims\n \n Whenever a discovery is depicted as a missing link, the evolutionist media always give the impression that a most extraordinary finding has been made, whereas this actually conflicts with their claims regarding the truth of evolution.\n \n Were the theory of evolution true, then the geological strata would be full of fossil intermediates, and their numbers would be far greater than that of all the species living today or that ever lived in the past. Therefore, the discovery of missing links would be such a routine matter that it would have no news value at all.\n \n Alternatively, if, as evolutionists claim, there were as much evidence for evolution as there is for the force of gravity, then reporting on missing link discoveries would be as nonsensical as reporting on a stone thrown into the air falling back to the ground. In the same way that we would regard a news report along the lines of &#8220;We threw a stone into the air and it actually fell back to Earth&#8221; as utterly insignificant, so we would regard reports reading &#8220;Paleontologists have discovered a new missing link&#8221; as equally insignificant. In short, if evolution were a &#8220;fact,&#8221; there would be no need for any missing link propaganda at all.\n \n The evolutionary series in which Tiktaalik roseae has been placed is based solely on preconception\n \n One can see in some newspapers that the latest fossil has been inserted as an intermediate form between Acanthostega and Eusthenopteron. By doing this, evolutionists are seeking to give the impression that the fossil record supports evolutionary transitions and that the evidence for this is mounting up with every passing day. The fact is though that these series represent no evidence that the organisms in question evolved at all. For example, laying out a row of screwdrivers in order of size does not show that they are all descended from one another.\n \n In fact there is no known evolutionary line of descent from Eusthenopteron to Tiktaalik roseae or from Tiktaalik roseae to Acanthostega. These life forms are separated from one another by morphological gulfs based on profound differences and millions of years of time. Evolutionists reveal only their own prejudices with the series into which they place Tiktaalik roseae. Henry Gee, editor of the journal Nature and also a paleontologist, admits that &#8220;missing links&#8221; and evolutionary series are the work of preconceptions:\n \n New fossil discoveries are fitted into this pre-existing story. We call these new discoveries &#8220;missing links&#8221;, as if the chain of ancestry and descent were a real object for our contemplation, and not what it really is: a completely human invention created after the fact, shaped to accord with human prejudices. . . . Each fossil represents an isolated point, with no knowable connection to any other given fossil, and all float around in an overwhelming sea of gaps.

   "How typically arrogant, deceptive and dishonest of you to focus on marcs error in the dating method used rather than deal with the fact that the complete evolution community claimed that the discovery of Tiktaalik rosae was solid evidence that the fish was a transitional creature which evolved legs from fins based on the skeletal structure of the fossil and moved from water to land. Until of course they were still found to exist when discovered alive and well in the 30s. And this didn't last for just a little while, the massive assumption based on fairy tale conclusions lasted many decades before the so called living fossils were found which is what your specious community still refers to this fish as. You people must use sleight of hand as you focus on the tiniest and most irrelevant error made by the opposition as misdirection to avoid the true and factual meat of their argument. \n \n Harun Yahya - Tiktaalik roseae: Another missing link myth\n\n \n I honestly just don't understand you. Your not a dumb person, you come across as articulate and at times express your concerns competently, but then you latch on to something like this and lose whatever ground you may have made in other posts.\n \n This article is far more speculative in it's assumptions than the Theory of Evolution. I use the full name as a rebuttal to one claim made concerning how scientists view it, a theory. Maybe they are wrong, maybe they are close, but whatever they are it is a more likely scenario than Genesis.\n \n If Genesis is to be believed it must address certain undeniable facts.\n \n 1) The age of the Earth and living things. The Earth and life existed well before Genesis, but it says that the world and life are 6000 - 7000 years old. The claim that time expressed in Genesis is measured not in actual 24hr periods is totally invalidated by Genesis itself.\n 2) Dinosaurs. Why did God make them, destroy them and then never mention them? Did their flesh make them sinful also?\n 3) Mammoths. Were they made before man with the other animals? Fossils say before, but why didn't they make it on the Ark? Had they already died out? How there is no mention of an Ice Age in Genesis? What happened to them?\n 4) Humanoid. Maybe Homosapien wasn't the one that sinned and they did surely die, but that would free us of Original Sin so guess not. Were they animals also? Again how come they didn't make it on the Ark? \n \n You seem not to understand how evolution comes about nor how DNA functions in it. It's only creationists who think the chain is fish to frog to monkey to man. Scientist understand there could be hundreds of variations between one species and and another, some to the point of becoming something entirely distinct from the original.\n \n DNA \"switches\" are turned on and off to cause something to happen or not happen. Much like a computer but much more sophisticated. Different combinations of on or off work to act as an on off for other parts of DNA and so on and so on. The development of various new characteristics doesn't happen overnight nor is it typically poof a frog births a monkey. Nor does it mandate that all frogs will now die because new better frogs exist. 100 years for some animals is a 100 generations thousands of years can represent hundreds and thousands of generations with which to effect change in what by our standards is a relativly short period of time. \n \n It further doesn't require a frog to have useless organs or body parts in mass numbers that actually killed them. That is just dumb. The new functional parts would be formed from existing aspects or a part not forming. The minimum would be the new part had a no impact, not it failed. The animal wouldn't survive and procreate if that were the case.\n \n So for the sake of argument let's say your right and evolution is wrong. Genesis doesn't offer a viable solution. It creates more confusion and is unable to solve more questions than it answers.\n \n Which brings me to my first comment. Why do you insist on pushing something that is unquestionably false under reasonable, credible, objective analysis?",

May I have chapter and verse for that claim from the bible please? I can assure You will not find it in the bible. The age of the Earth was determined by a preacher in the 19th century, I believe based on adding up the ages in the genealogical record in the bible. Of course one must assume that every single generation in that record is accounted for if we are to believe it is accurate. \n \n I happen to personally believe that the whole of Creation dates back to between 10,000 and 25,000 years based on nothing more than my personal beliefs from the physical evidence I have observed. \n \n \n2) Dinosaurs. Why did God make them, destroy them and then never mention them? Did their flesh make them sinful also?\n\n \n What makes you think they aren't mentioned in the bible? That statement is based on your ignorance of Gods word you know. But they aren't called Dinosaurs since that word is a modern term. Here is a link which refers you to the biblical sources and explanations from a modern perspective of how these creatures fit perfectly with what we as modern men know of Dinosaurs today. http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/dinos.shtml\n \n \n3) Mammoths. Were they made before man with the other animals? Fossils say before, but why didn't they make it on the Ark? Had they already died out? \n\n \n Gee pappi, please tell me how you know that Mammoths never made it on the Ark? You have such dogmatic and absolute insights, I can't wait to hear how you know these things for certain.\n \n \n How there is no mention of an Ice Age in Genesis? What happened to them?\n\n \n I don't know that they were worth mentioning since there hasn't been a world wide ice age since the creation of life on Earth. Get it? In 5,000 or 10,000 years from now, and the Earth has shifted on its axis once again, and Antarctica is occupied land while the new poles are frozen, scientists will be scratching their heads and saying gee, 10,000 years ago there was NO LIFE ON EARTH AT ALL except sea life because we find no evidence of mammals at all under this vast portion of the worlds real estate. \n \n So it's like I said above, it's all a matter of interpreting the available observations we make of our past. You think you're right, and I am wrong, but I know that I am right and you are wrong because even though neither of us can produce absolute evidence to prove our beliefs, I have the distinct advantage of having my GOD, the Creator of all that is on my side. As the author of life, my faith in HIM is much more secure than your faith in fallen and sinfully blind humanity who is literally a wisp of wind in time compared to my Lord and my God. \n \n \n You seem not to understand how evolution comes about nor how DNA functions in it. It's only creationists who think the chain is fish to frog to monkey to man. Scientist understand there could be hundreds of variations between one species and and another, some to the point of becoming something entirely distinct from the original.\n\n \n I understand evolution better than you do, and from an objective perspective so I can see its flaws in all of their glory. And as someone who has been following the gospel of evolution for 50 years, I can assure you that your stated chain from fish to man above is precisely how evolution used to be described before you were born, i'm sure. So there is nothing ignorant or dishonest to state that chain of events as what evolutionists themselves have claimed is the process of evolution.",

Of course one must assume that every single generation in that record is accounted for if we are to believe it is accurate. \n \n I happen to personally believe that the whole of Creation dates back to between 10,000 and 25,000 years based on nothing more than my personal beliefs from the physical evidence I have observed. \n \n \n \n What makes you think they aren't mentioned in the bible? That statement is based on your ignorance of Gods word you know. But they aren't called Dinosaurs since that word is a modern term. Here is a link which refers you to the biblical sources and explanations from a modern perspective of how these creatures fit perfectly with what we as modern men know of Dinosaurs today. Dinosaurs and the Bible\n \n \n \n Gee pappi, please tell me how you know that Mammoths never made it on the Ark? You have such dogmatic and absolute insights, I can't wait to hear how you know these things for certain.\n \n \n \n I don't know that they were worth mentioning since there hasn't been a world wide ice age since the creation of life on Earth. Get it? In 5,000 or 10,000 years from now, and the Earth has shifted on its axis once again, and Antarctica is occupied land while the new poles are frozen, scientists will be scratching their heads and saying gee, 10,000 years ago there was NO LIFE ON EARTH AT ALL except sea life because we find no evidence of mammals at all under this vast portion of the worlds real estate. \n \n So it's like I said above, it's all a matter of interpreting the available observations we make of our past. You think you're right, and I am wrong, but I know that I am right and you are wrong because even though neither of us can produce absolute evidence to prove our beliefs, I have the distinct advantage of having my GOD, the Creator of all that is on my side. As the author of life, my faith in HIM is much more secure than your faith in fallen and sinfully blind humanity who is literally a wisp of wind in time compared to my Lord and my God. \n \n \n \n I understand evolution better than you do, and from an objective perspective so I can see its flaws in all of their glory. And as someone who has been following the gospel of evolution for 50 years, I can assure you that your stated chain from fish to man above is precisely how evolution used to be described before you were born, i'm sure. So there is nothing ignorant or dishonest to state that chain of events as what evolutionists themselves have claimed is the process of evolution.\n\n \n You forgot to mention that the Earth is flat and the Sun orbits the Earth and God stopped the Sun at least once and ... yeah!

   "You're right, I'm not dumb and one day you will realize just how insightful I was compared to your shallow world view which is totally illusory.\n\n \n Then stop acting as if you are. \n \n Hey your the one who believes it is desirous to spend a lifetime in misery so you can spend an eternity thanking a God, who deosn't want you, for the previously mentioned miserable lifetime because you think an omnipotent omniscient God wants that. \n \n Yes, that is deep and screams reality.\n \n \nAlso, since my self image has nothing to do with your acceptance of what I believe, I neither gain or lose ground based on how you interpret what I believe.\n\n \n Good thing you are able to feed your own ego, as I don't see anybody else fill that big of a void.\n \n \nProve it beyond any question that the Earth is as old as secularists claim it is. I maintain that our opposing perspectives are based on differing interpretations of the same evidence which we analyze through a spiritual prism rather than your secular evaluation of the available \"observations\" we make as human beings.\n\n \n What is a spiritual prism? Whatever it is you either need to clean it or get it fixed or replaced because it is preventing you from seeing clearly.\n \n If by secular evaluation you mean science and you use that to arrive at the conclusions you do then no they aren't the same. Yours are based on faith with all hypothesis deriving from the Bible as being correct. I am not restricted by the same obligation or need to validate the Bible. Your way is somewhat limiting and that is one reason it isn't used anymore. Another is it is often wrong. \n \n \nReally? The bible says the world and life upon it is 6-7000 years old? May I have chapter and verse for that claim from the bible please? I can assure You will not find it in the bible. The age of the Earth was determined by a preacher in the 19th century, I believe based on adding up the ages in the genealogical record in the bible. Of course one must assume that every single generation in that record is accounted for if we are to believe it is accurate. \n\n \n It would also be the time frame of the 2 most popular ideas for the creation by Christians. It is also the time frame that fits with the two articles you have posted. I know you don't share the same beliefs as your evidence since he believes in Allah and that Jesus isn't dead and wasn't killed to name a few and I don't think you have to agree with every view held by an author you use as evidence, but at least conform to the article. \n \n Also scientists know when humans started writing, farming, domesticating animals and forming cities. So one doesn't have to base the age of genesis on the Bible alone to come to an estimate of when things happened. \n \n \nI happen to personally believe that the whole of Creation dates back to between 10,000 and 25,000 years based on nothing more than my personal beliefs from the physical evidence I have observed. \n \n What makes you think they aren't a modern perspective of how these creatures fit perfectly with what we as modern men know of Dinosaurs today. Dinosaurs and the Bible\n\n \n Really so there are more than 3 possible things that the logically challenged associate with dinosaurs? Sorry no perfect fit. Can you at least pretend to be smarter than a creature made of dirt?\n \n Then you have to explain the existence of everything that can be shown to exist prior to that. There are several radiometric processes that have independently and repeatedly arrived at the same result, that there are many, many things older than 25,000 years ago. Even if you doubled the margin of error you are still not even close to being right.\n \n \nGee pappi, please tell me how you know that Mammoths never made it on the Ark? You have such dogmatic and absolute insights, I can't wait to hear how you know these things for certain.\n\n \n Where are they? Why is there no evidence they existed anytime around or after the Ark? No drawings, no written account, no fossils, no nothing. \n \n Can you prove they were?\n \n \nI don't know that they were worth mentioning since there hasn't been a world wide ice age since the creation of life on Earth. Get it? In 5,000 or 10,000 years from now, and the Earth has shifted on its axis once again, and Antarctica is occupied land while the new poles are frozen, scientists will be scratching their heads and saying gee, 10,000 years ago there was NO LIFE ON EARTH AT ALL except sea life because we find no evidence of mammals at all under this vast portion of the worlds real estate. \n\n \n Well you really thought this one out didn't you. No worldwide ice age necessary. The last one that covered about 1/3 of the planet is sufficient.\n \n Really, so all the bones and fossils and other evidence is really under the water and it's just mass hallucination or the greatest deception ever by liberal anti christian left wing militant homosexual Qbama supporters out to take away the sweet baby Jesus from the believer. Except in order to have happen what you describe would have affiliated all life and hey guess what there is no evidence to support that wild hair you plucked from you know where, but evidence contrary to it does.\n \n \n \nSo it's like I said above, it's all a matter of interpreting the available observations we make of our past. You think you're right, and I am wrong, but I know that I am right and you are wrong because even though neither of us can produce absolute evidence to prove our beliefs, I have the distinct advantage of having my GOD, the Creator of all that is on my side. As the author of life, my faith in HIM is much more secure than your faith in fallen and sinfully blind humanity who is literally a wisp of wind in time compared to my Lord and my God. \n\n \n No it's not. I don't know for sure that I am right in everything, much of it requires a lack of intelligence or faith in God to not accept it and faith in God isn't a guarantee to not accept the age of the Earth. The Pope does why can't you. If it helps you sleep at night take sleeping pills, this spiritual prism of yours isn't helping you any. \n \n Archangel if it wasn't for Jesus your God didn't want to have anything to do with you and based on your behavior I don't see you doing much to change his mind.\n \n \nI understand evolution better than you do, and from an objective perspective so I can see its flaws in all of their glory. And as someone who has been following the gospel of evolution for 50 years, I can assure you that your stated chain from fish to man above is precisely how evolution used to be described before you were born, i'm sure. So there is nothing ignorant or dishonest to state that chain of events as what evolutionists themselves have claimed is the process of evolution.\n\n \n Tsk, Tsk Tsk, In one paragraph defending yourself you contradict yourself and see nothing wrong with manipulating information to support your objective opinion. \n \n Sorry I thought you could do better than this.",

I didn&#8217;t compare one &#8220;verified&#8221; find, with one worldview projection from another verified find, I compared two verified finds with two worldview projections. That&#8217;s a total of four &#8211; let me number them for you.\n \n 1) Wood is found in Eastern Turkey that is carbon dated at 4800 years old..\n\n \n There is no verified find here.

Read on and you&#8217;ll know why.\n \n Fox News reported today about a joint Turkish-Chinese expedition that claims to have found Naoh&#8217;s ark on Mount Ararat. Part of their proof is the picture below, which purports to have been taken inside the ark. Allegedly, the wooden beams carbon-date to 4,800 years old. Would that be cool or what?\n \n \n Now the sad part. I also got an email today from one of Randall Price&#8217;s students. The email contains a message from Dr. Price about this expedition. (Dr. Price, as some of you may recall, has been doing a lot of searching for the ark lately.) Here is an excerpt from his message:\n \n\n I was the archaeologist with the Chinese expedition in the summer of 2008 and was given photos of what they now are reporting to be the inside of the Ark. I and my partners invested $100,000 in this expedition (described below) which they have retained, despite their promise and our requests to return it, since it was not used for the expedition. The information given below is my opinion based on what I have seen and heard (from others who claim to have been eyewitnesses or know the exact details).\n \n To make a long story short: this is all reported to be a fake. The photos were reputed to have been taken off site near the Black Sea, but the film footage the Chinese now have was shot on location on Mt. Ararat. In the late summer of 2008 ten Kurdish workers hired by Parasut, the guide used by the Chinese, are said to have planted large wood beams taken from an old structure in the Black Sea area (where the photos were originally taken) at the Mt. Ararat site. In the winter of 2008 a Chinese climber taken by Parasut&#8217;s men to the site saw the wood, but couldn&#8217;t get inside because of the severe weather conditions. During the summer of 2009 more wood was planted inside a cave at the site. The Chinese team went in the late summer of 2009 (I was there at the time and knew about the hoax) and was shown the cave with the wood and made their film. As I said, I have the photos of the inside of the so-called Ark (that show cobwebs in the corners of rafters &#8211; something just not possible in these conditions) and our Kurdish partner in Dogubabyazit (the village at the foot of Mt. Ararat) has all of the facts about the location, the men who planted the wood, and even the truck that transported it.\n\n In short, Randall was duped. I feel bad about it because I know him. He&#8217;s a good guy with real degrees (so please don&#8217;t equate him with charlatans like Ron Wyatt). Yeah, he should have known better. But at least he&#8217;s being honest here.\n \n",

   "King David and King David's Palace:\n \n \"The recent discovery at Tel Dan of a fragment of a stela containing a reference to the 'House of David' (that is, the dynasty of David) is indeed sensational and deserves all the publicity it has received. The Aramaic inscription, dated to the ninth century (B.C.), was originally part of a victory monument erected at Dan, apparently by an enemy of both the 'King of Israel' (also referred to in the fragment) and the '(King of the) House of David.' The inscription easily establishes the importance of Israel and Judah on the international scene at this time-no doubt to the chagrin of those modern scholars who maintain that nothing in the Bible before the Babylonian exile can lay claim to any historical accuracy ... Nearly two years before the discovery of the Tel Dan fragment, I (Lemaire) concluded that the Mesha stela contains a reference to the 'House of David.' Now the Tel Dan fragment tends to support this conclusion\" (ibid., pp. 31, 32). \n \n King David: Man or Myth?\n \n Mazar relates that, although the location of King David&#8217;s palace was very elusive, the Bible itself played a significant part in her being able to locate it. Ms. Mazar speculated that a previously uncovered and famous stepped-stone structure located below her proposed excavation site was actually part of the Jebusite fortress that King David conquered. Also in the same area and slightly lower than her proposed dig site, Phoenician capitals (the tops of Phoenician-made columns) had been previously unearthed. This too suggested that a monumental building may have stood further up the hill.\n \n Combining these two known archeological finds with the Bible&#8217;s description, she then theorized where David&#8217;s palace would have been built. The Bible indicates in 2 Samuel 5 that when the Philistines came to fight, King David &#8220;went down to the hold,&#8221; or fortress, to meet them. Ms. Mazar said that, after reading this, she wondered, &#8220;down from where? Presumably from where he lived, his palace&#8221; (New York Times, Aug. 5, 2005).\n \n According to Ms. Mazar, the area above the fortress ruins and Phoenician capitals was a logical location for King David&#8217;s palace because it would have placed it outside the original walls of the cramped city of Jerusalem and on the road to Solomon&#8217;s Temple on the Mount.\n \n Within weeks of beginning the dig, Ms. Mazar&#8217;s team was uncovering the remains of many rooms. At first, most were more recent Roman structures, like baths and pools, but then, within the boundaries of the limited excavation area, she found the remains of &#8220;massive older walls underneath the Roman structure, running toward the rim of the Kidron Valley&#8221; (Washington Post, Dec. 2, 2005). The walls, constructed with boulders, are on average 2 yards thick and extend at least 30 yards. Their size gives credence to the importance and grandeur of the structure.\n \n Below the walls, Mazar first found 11th-century b.c. pottery. Then, inside a room above the 11th-century b.c. fill, 10th-century b.c. pottery, dating to the time of King David and free from material from any other period, was found. According to a relative of Ms. Mazar who is also an archeologist, &#8220;The sample was among the finest from that time found in Jerusalem&#8221; (ibid.).\n \n To this point, only a small fraction&#8212;approximately 10 percent of the structure&#8212;has been exposed, but the finds have been remarkable. Ms. Mazar described her discovery, which was potentially David&#8217;s home, as &#8220;not just a house, but a fantastic house&#8221; \n \n King David&rsquo;s Palace Found? | theTrumpet.com by the Philadelphia Church of God",
