You leap up \"Wait, I've got a .44 magunum!\" and you whack them on the back with the gun-but and save their lives.\n \n Or, you're out at sea, the fishing-boat springs a leak \"We're all doomed\" cries the captain, but you recall you're carrying a 12-gauge. You ram it into the hole and plug the leak.\n \n Yes, I can picture where guns save lives.",
