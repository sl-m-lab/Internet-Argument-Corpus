Perhaps doing it this way (allowing those who say they have been celibate for 10 years to donate) reduces the risk to an acceptably low degree. I don't know. You can't make these decisions by simply looking at that one percentage. You have to take into account lots of other things - what is the percentage of seropositivity in the the subset in question, the inherent accuracies of the test, the number of units of blood that would be generated or lost, and oodles of other stuff I know nothing about. \n \n I am saying we should not base these decisions on idealogies either way. \n \n I have seen overly restrictive public health policies that were wildly expensive and didn't help anything.

After all, the Bible clearly condemns gay sex relationships. But as for judging, well...\n \n \"Judge not, and you will not be judged.\" (Matthew 7:1)\n \n Jesus is not saying that we cannot make judgments about ungodly behavior, he is saying that we should not be hypocrites if we do. In Matthew 7:5 he says, \"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brothers eye.\"\n \n God acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge:  \n \n Romans 13:1-4: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.

   "Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade - Telegraph\n \n There are estimated to be 86,500 people with HIV in Britain, with a quarter unaware that they have an infection. About 42% of people infected with HIV in 2009 were homosexual men, according to the Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV charity. \n \n Homosexual men are also at risk of passing on other sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis. \n \n Gay rights campaigners have pushed for the ban to be lifted, saying many homosexual men are in long-term monogamous relationships, practise safe sex or have been celibate for years. \n \n A Government source said: \"A complete ban is unfair and discriminatory but we need to protect public health, so the 10-year rule is what is being considered\n \n Gay rights leaders would rather peoples health be at risk than to act responsibly and recognise they are at a higher risk of HIV than heterosexuals.\n\n This is about the window of non-detectability more than anything else. Blood testing now allows us to determine HIV infection at approximately 10-12 days post-infection through the use of nucleic acid-based testing. We should be asking everyone if they have had sexual contact within the last 30 days, and then screening further from that point. 10 years is a rediculous arbitrary number with no benefit of safety. If we want to be as safe as possible, perhaps it would help to use common sense and logic. Someone who is willing to lie and say that they have not had homosexual contact in the last 10 years would most likely be just as willing under current law to say that they have never had homosexual contact.",

   "Perhaps out of a sadistic desire to infect the general population and thereby destroy the believers before they can be saved?\n\n \n Sure your right. I think the general point is that anyone who shows up at a blood donation center to donate blood is not likely to lie during the screening process. With that in mind, we should attempt to use common sense in the screening process, rather than disregard a safe source of blood and blood products. \n \n The OP opined this:\n \n \nA Government source said: \"A complete ban is unfair and discriminatory but we need to protect public health, so the 10-year rule is what is being considered\n \n Gay rights leaders would rather peoples health be at risk than to act responsibly and recognise they are at a higher risk of HIV than heterosexuals.\n\n So if we agree that people are not likely to lie about their sexual history during the screening process, then there is no reason to exclude homosexuals as potential donors. Further, a ten year ban on all homosexual activity is pointless. We now have the ability to reliably detect HIV at 10-12 days post infection. So if we have a homosexual male who states that he has not engaged in sexual relations or used IV drugs in the last 2 months...why should he not be a legitimate donor? That's what I'm having trouble understanding. How is the decision to move from a lifetime ban to even a ten year ban putting peoples health at risk? Can anyone explain it to me?",

So whatever the numbers happen to be I promise you those 100 or 10 or 1 person would much rather have something besides HIV. \n \n Of course the percentage who have it and donate is small, and after testing even smaller. I agree that with a shortage of willing donors the need is there and a vast majority of gay people are perfectly capable of donating and should be permitted, but it is completly irresponsible to not recognize there is an increased risk by doing so and that there should be safegaurds in place to reduce the possibility to my same question what is an acceptable number of people becoming positive (which could still happen if gay people were not allowed to donate) to lives saved by having the added blood in the supply.",

When I said that you haven't demonstrated that I meant to say that you haven't defined what a very large risk is nor have you presented any evidence to that end. It seems like you not only did not define it but didn't know what it meant.\n \n \nIf you refuse to define it, then obviously you are refusing to answer questions about your position showing its weakness...\n\n You just said that your arguments do not rest of defining a very large risk making any mention of it in regard to you a strawman.\n \n Show me where any of my 'arguments' rely on it.\n \n \nHow can you blame gays for blacks when the majority of black infections are via NON-gay infection means?\n\n That is true, but MSM is the leader by a good margin according to the second link.\n \n According to the same chart MSM is responsible for 62% of all new infections. Perhaps that's how they can 'blame' gays in general.\n \n \nAnd another problem of your assessment is your claim of \"according to my numbers\" is wrong.\n You're quoting a number associated with NEW infections in a given year. It stated \"rate of HIV/AIDS infection\", not totals...\n Instead of trying meaningless technical jabber, DO THE MATH.\n U.S. population 300,000,000\n % blacks 12.6\n Number of blacks: 37,800,000\n Assuming that statistic is total infections =< 32,356.8 infections...\n Which matches up with the NEW infections diagnosed. Not existing.\n\n I see nothing in here that contradicts my post.\n \n \nBut the approach of looking at ACTUAL NUMBER of infections has merit, cause too often people who look at \"HIV\" statistics go off percent of infection (which is why I took the approach I took in my opening post).\n If you look at the ACTUAL PERCENTAGES of infections of the group for BOTH black and gay, it's a small percentage compared to the whole.\n\n Do you have the number? I couldn't find it.\n \n \nSo are blacks more likely to be gay than whites are?\n\n Or at least black men are more likely to infect others than white, given that they are competing in MSM infections while blacks consist of only 12% of the population.\n \n \nThere is a DOUBLE STANDARD regarding fallacious logic applied towards gays, that isn't applied towards other groups.\n NORMAL people would not look at an average black person and think \"HIV\"...\n But with gays and blood donation, a DIFFERENT standard is employed.\n \n Ergo, what what \"I might do\" is not the point here.\n Cause I recognize these standards as absurd and two-faced...\n You're right I wouldn't do that, because I live by MY standards and not these absurd hypocritical standards I am exposing.\n\n So you are saying that the rates of HIV are similarly low in black and gay categories and whatever discrimination one receives should be reflected in the other?\n \n \nLOL\n That word \"why\" there is improperly placed.\n\n Odd lack of LOL and..\n The why is properly placed.\n \n \nYou have presented no evidence that gays have HIV infection that is \"more uniformly distributed\", and actual research on the issue shows it isn't.\n\n speculate - to indulge in conjectural thought.

Pointing out Italy has succesfully done so for a couple of years. Additionally pointing out that HIV while nothing to shrug off is not the only concern of blood banks. Hep B & C, Syphillis and West Nile Virus are as of just as much concern and further pointed out that gays have cornered the market on these diseases on a global scale.\n Because you wanted to make a point having already decided that I didn't fully understand what I was saying.\n\n Honestly?

I don't envy them their position. The reality is that demand forces them to choose to accept blood from people who they know have a greater risk of having tainted blood, not just HIV and not just gays or blacks. I think you cited something like 3 cases in a million which are great stats unless you happen to be one of those three, but the flip side is those three cases made it possible for 999,999,997 people to recieve the blood they needed. My question was what is an acceptable ratio of lives saved to those becoming infected with tainted blood. \n\n Honestly, I think at some point in history such a standard prohibiting gay blood donation would have had a much better argument for justification.\n \n Part of the discussion in that article is how the testing has improved incredibly over time. And as the testing has improved, reducing the statistics, such loosely applied standards (as in prohibiting all gay blood donation) loses their attempt at justification.\n \n It would be interesting to get statistics on how much blood (quantity / number of donations) is rejected.\n After Katrina hit, there were news stories on the blood drives done to help meet the higher medical need.\n Part of the news was how some people were called afterwards to notify them that their blood donation was HIV positive.\n \n This also should be recognized.",

You can call it 'the obfuscation efforts of one ignorant or dishonest homophobe'.\n I think someone would have to grovel at your feet before you would stop attacking their every word. \"Yes but YOU never explicitly AGREED WITH ME so that means your posts using meaningless techno jabber like 'concur' are either a dishonest or ignorant attempt to confuse the issue and move away from the subject!\"\n and your word is negative evidence in my opinion.\n Well since everything I say is either meaningless or irrelevant I can't tell what topic you are talking about. I was talking about the topic of this thread.\n\n This kind of XXXX is just a continuing effort to obfuscate the topic and drag your opposition down to a level that is not discussing the topic.\n \nYes, to commit an informal fallacy one must be arguing. I am laughing at your treatment of hypothetical conjecture like someone might laugh at how seriously a kitten chases a ball of yarn.\n I have concluded from your posts that you are insane. That is not meant to support my imaginary position.\n\n Ignoring whether your assessment is true or false, you have just given evidence of EXACTLY what I just said...\n \n \n \nThen show it.

I didn't ask you to list the problems you think are there, I'm asking you to list some actual SOLUTIONS. I asked you to give some CATEGORIES you would rather the CDC use. Why is this so hard for you?\n \n \nLike it's been pointed out before (but of course you revel in the strawman) it's not your CLAIMED SUPPORT which makes you anti-gay. And while I'm sure you'll feign perpetual contradiction of my assessment, I'm quite comfortable with the number of people who have come to the exact conclusion I have on the issue...\n\n \n Yeah, yeah. LOL!\n It's absolutely amazing to watch you follow the identical patterns of behavior here that you used months ago before you ran away. It's like clock-work. First the typical claims of people avoiding your points when it's you doing most of that, then the ad hominems, then all the upper-case antics, then focusing on the poster you're engaging rather than the topics, then appeals-of-representation (all the \"number of people\" claims). You're at about the usual stage 5 of your pattern of posting behavior, Foundit. Next, you'll calm down a bit and reform your ways and get a little more civil in order to not look quite so unhinged. Then you'll fly off the cuff some more. We've seen it over and over, and the fact you repeat that very same pattern to pretty much any poster you disagree with says it all. :) \n \n \nIt's the fact that you ACTIVELY attack gays at every turn and habitually insist on a path to equality that involves the most aburd and pointless demands instead of admitting simple facts like constitutional mandated equality. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Nah. I just don't abide people who are jerk wad ideologues--those in your political movement, not gays in general.

I asked you to give some CATEGORIES you would rather the CDC use. \n\n The \"gay sex\" category is ridiculously too generalized.\n Pointlessly so.\n And more specifically, \"MSM\" has no inherent risk for HIV transmission.\n In other countries, MSM is dwarfed for HIV transmission by the heterosexual equivalent. MOST infections occurring with the heterosexual conduct.\n \n I've already given you one example which you obviously fail to appreciate.\n Monogamous relationships (gay or straight) are less risky for HIV (barring other factors).\n Such an aspect should be appreciated in the efforts to reduce risk in blood donation.\n \n The boundaries for such a restriction are up for analysis.\n When did the monogamous relationship start? History before that? Protected vs unprotected sexual contact in that history?\n \n Regardless of where we draw the boundaries, the REAL point that the EXISTING standard is unrealistic and overly restrictive.\n \n \n \nYeah, yeah. LOL!\n It's absolutely amazing to watch you ...\n\n I'm going to do the favor of not responding to your distraction ad hominem.\n You can obviously do the same for me!\n emoticon_xagree\n \n The difference being that when the ad hominem is stripped away from your responses, you have ignored many arguments that you have dropped.\n \n \n \nNah.
