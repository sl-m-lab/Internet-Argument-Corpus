   "I was requested to start a new thread in which pro-gay and anti-gay marriage positions could be debated without posters being called \"homophobes\", \"gay bashers\" and \"bigots\" simply because they don't favor gay marriage.\n While I\"ve already stated why I'm against gay marriage in previous threads, I'll reiterate them here for newbies and for simplicity sake\n\n \n Thanks for starting this thread and reiterating your points so that I do not need to search for them. I will see what I can do about responding to them.\n \n \n1. Gay marriage creates a new dependent class of citizen\n\n \n I will argue that gay marriage does not create a new class of citizen, it removes a class of citizen. Currently it is the case that there are two types of couples: those who get the benefits of marriage and those who do not. The idea of gay marriage is to consolidate those two types of citizens into one type of citizen. The idea is to give all types of people the same set of rights, and that would precisely merge two classes of citizens into one.\n \n Whether or not we are merging an independent class of citizens into a dependant one is a question that can be debated, but if we are, then it would make sense to prevent all forms of marriage using the same justification.\n \n \n2. It is an unfunded mandate and therefore, illegal\n\n \n Hey, let's not make assumptions on how gay marriage will come about. I would have no problem with gay marriage arising from state legislatures coming to an agreement that this should be allowed, and that may very well happen. The argument I make in favor of same-sex marriage is simply that it should be legal, not that the courts should legalize it.\n \n That being said, it is questionable whether this could be considered an unfunded mandate because such a ruling does not imply that the government must spend more money, it only implies that the government must distribute its tax breaks and other benefits equally across all citizens. Research has also suggested that the government would save far more money than it loses in medicaid costs due to workplace-provided health insurance.\n \n \n3. It forces additional costs on an employer via healthcare benefits\n\n \n Businesses are not required to give their employees health insurance nor are they required to spend a certain amount of money on health insurance if they choose to do so, but this bill would make certain that if a business does so, it is not able to pick and choose who gets that insurance and who does not.\n \n More importantly, like many of your arguments, if this argument can be used as a reason to disallow same-sex marriage, it can equally be used as an argument to disallow opposite-sex marriage.\n \n \n4. It adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody, property, inheritance, etc.,\n\n \n Many of those battles are already being fought in court, and this sort of cost is likely negligable due to countless factors introduced by marriage. For example, child support services must pay far less when the government no longer has to pay to fund an adopted child.\n \n Again, this argument can be used to disallow opposite-sex marriages.\n \n \n5. It allows more people to lay claim to finite SS and other entitlement benefits\n\n \n Refer to what I said about about the costs of same-sex marriage. Also note that this argument can be used to disallow marriage for opposite-sex couples.\n \n \n6. It establishes a loophole to transfer property without payment of inheritance taxes.\n 7. It establishes a mechanism to bypass the payment of taxes on life insurance payouts.\n\n \n Understand that this same loophole exists in our current system of opposite-sex marriage, and it can thus be used as a reason to deny opposite-sex couples marriage. Isn't a better solution to fix the loopholes and give everyone the same rights?\n \n Okay, you've heard me mention that many of your arguments can be used to deny opposite-sex couples marriage rights as well. Let me explain why this is important. Because our society prides itself on freedom, equality, and happiness, we try to give equal rights to everyone and allow people to be as free as they like so long as they do not harm others. This means that we do not arbitrarily give extra tax breaks and extra rights to random groups of people. Currently, you have listed no reason that opposite-sex couples deserve these rights but same-sex couples do not. That is really the heart of the debate. You aren't debating that same-sex marriage is wrong, you are debating that marriage itself is wrong. What is missing from your argument is what everyone is talking about<b></b>: why do opposite-sex couples deserve the right to be married but same-sex couples do not?\n \n I have no problem with you using your arguments to support banning marriage, but they only make sense in the context of banning marriage for everyone. If that is your intention, then I don't really think that gay rights play a factor here. If not, your argument only follows if you give reasons why one group of people deserves all of these marriage rights, but a different group does not.\n \n Let me know what you think.",

That is in effect, what gays are doing.

While a state ban on gay marriages was reaffirmed in the last general election, the very Republican senator who pushed the ban is constructing new legislation to accommodate gay domestic circumstances. We're not a community property state, which invites litigation if the state recognizes inheritance and other pertinent statutes on a selective basis of marriage, and at that point the issue of civil rights being trampled by selective legislation is a fact.\n \n When religion is removed from this issue, or any other moral issue, bigotry and rationalization seem to vanish. I wouldn't have the personal patience exhibited by gays. Putting the gay movement under a church umbrella and challenging mythology with mythology would seemingly be a quicker solution to their problem of acceptance and one the supreme court would review on the basis of religious freedom without the federal bigamy laws used to trim Mormon beliefs.

I refer you to a recent study prepared by the Congressional Budget Office at the request of Congress:\n \n http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5559&sequence=0\n \n In summary, it states:\n \n \nThe potential effects on the federal budget of recognizing same-sex marriages are numerous. Marriage can affect a person's eligibility for federal benefits such as Social Security. Married couples may incur higher or lower federal tax liabilities than they would as single individuals. In all, the General Accounting Office has counted 1,138 statutory provisions--ranging from the obvious cases just mentioned to the obscure (landowners' eligibility to negotiate a surface-mine lease with the Secretary of Labor)--in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving \"benefits, rights, and privileges.\"(1) In some cases, recognizing same-sex marriages would increase outlays and revenues; in other cases, it would have the opposite effect. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that on net, those impacts would improve the budget's bottom line to a small extent: by less than $1 billion in each of the next 10 years (CBO's usual estimating period). That result assumes that same-sex marriages are legalized in all 50 states and recognized by the federal government.\n\n \n Your argument regarding increased cost to businesses is also incorrect. I refer you to:\n \n http://barbelgin.typepad.com//hrc-businessimpact.pdf\n (Adobe Acrobat Reader required)\n \n If anything, the special dependant class already exists in the form of the heterosexual married couple, funded by the rest of society, married or not. Any \"loopholes\" that exist are now only to the exclusive benefit of heterosexual married couples.\n \n I fail to see where any \"unfunded mandate\" is involved. Could you please explain?",

   "My replies are in bold above.\n\n \n For the sake of space, I'll reply to #'s and not quote the whole text.\n 1. Same sex spouse = new class of dependent\n 2. By adding a new class of dependent, the costs associated need to be funded by Uncle Sam. Without Congress evaluating how it will pay for this new class, it is illegal. http://www.usmayors.org/uscm/us_mayor_newspaper/documents/06_11_01/unfunded_mandates.asp\n 3. This new class of dependent, if made legal, must be given the same benefits as hetero couples. This is an increased cost to employers who have no say in the matter. The only alternative to paying for this increased coverage is to withdraw healthcare from all of its employees and their families and in that instance, gay marriage certainly impacts straights.\n 4. The new dependent class will have \"new\" legal rights (for them as a group)and claims to others' property that don't exist today. For example, a gay couple living together in which one partner owns the house. Today, the other partner has no legal claim to that property, but under marriage laws, would be entitled to at least part of its value. Child custody cases, bankruptsy, inheritance battles that don't exist today because the second party has no legal standing would change overnight as the second party is given a \"new\" legal status.\n 5-7. You can't argue that the costs would be no different than with hetero married couples because we have already established that those costs are already borne by a willing society that sees hetero marriage as an overall benefit worth supporting financially. The same argument can't be made for gay marriage. You haven't convinced John Q. Public that there is a carrot for them.\n \n In closing, I'd like to respond to the claims of fairness. While fairness is a goal that I believe we should embrace, the fact is that there are all sorts of unfair practices that are embraced by our society. AA is a prime ean unfair practice that was instituted to help ONE group at the expense of another. Maybe if gay activists campained for \"fairness\" across the board John Q. Public would have another carrot, or as we refer to them in business, WIIFM (what's in it for me).",

   "Thanks for starting this thread and reiterating your points so that I do not need to search for them. I will see what I can do about responding to them.\n\n No problem. It seemed like a reasonable request by a reasonable person.\n \n\n I will argue that gay marriage does not create a new class of citizen, it removes a class of citizen. Currently it is the case that there are two types of couples: those who get the benefits of marriage and those who do not. The idea of gay marriage is to consolidate those two types of citizens into one type of citizen. The idea is to give all types of people the same set of rights, and that would precisely merge two classes of citizens into one.\n\n In actuality, there are three types of couples: married, gay and heterosexual unmarried. Only the first group get the benefits of marriage. If we broaden the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, wouldn't heterosexual unmarried couples still be discriminated against? And if we did that, then we'd have two new classes of citizens with claims to others' property that they didn't have previously.\n \n\n Whether or not we are merging an independent class of citizens into a dependant one is a question that can be debated, but if we are, then it would make sense to prevent all forms of marriage using the same justification.\n \n\n The point that our society willingly pays for breaks given to heterosexual couples can't be trivialized by saying that it should be all or nothing. Society, as it stands today, is willing to partially subsidize hetero couples and NOT same sex couples. Now, admittedly, those reasons aren't always strictly financial, but I've limited my discussion to those issues.\n \n\n Hey, let's not make assumptions on how gay marriage will come about. I would have no problem with gay marriage arising from state legislatures coming to an agreement that this should be allowed, and that may very well happen. The argument I make in favor of same-sex marriage is simply that it should be legal, not that the courts should legalize it.\n\n I agree that IF gay marriage is made legal it should be done through the legislature and not the courts. We have also recently seen in the Nov elections that many states aren't comfortable with gay marriage yet.\n \n\n That being said, it is questionable whether this could be considered an unfunded mandate because such a ruling does not imply that the government must spend more money, it only implies that the government must distribute its tax breaks and other benefits equally across all citizens. Research has also suggested that the government would save far more money than it loses in medicaid costs due to workplace-provided health insurance.\n\n The unfunded mandate law also extends to businesses. If the total cost of instituting gay marriage costs <$50Million, Congress must take that fact into consideration. A cost increase to businesses, state and federal employers of $50Million is certainly going to be surpassed over the lifetime of the statute.\n \n\n Businesses are not required to give their employees health insurance nor are they required to spend a certain amount of money on health insurance if they choose to do so, but this bill would make certain that if a business does so, it is not able to pick and choose who gets that insurance and who does not.\n\n You've just made my point for me. It would have the net effect of being an unfunded mandate to businesses and they would have to respond by stopping ALL insurance or adding additional coverage for gay couples. What if that business was a religious institution that was morally opposed to gay marriage. They would be forced to support it, regardless of their moral stance. Isn't the so-called separation of church and state really a double-edged sword designed to protect the church FROM government intervention as well?\n \n\n More importantly, like many of your arguments, if this argument can be used as a reason to disallow same-sex marriage, it can equally be used as an argument to disallow opposite-sex marriage.\n\n Agreed except that society has already ruled on whether or not it wants to provide financial incentives to targeted groups, such as minorities and married couples. \n \n\n Many of those battles are already being fought in court, and this sort of cost is likely negligable due to countless factors introduced by marriage. For example, child support services must pay far less when the government no longer has to pay to fund an adopted child.\n\n Court costs will undoubtedly increase as there are property disputes amongst gay partners with new-found rights. It's unavoidable, especially in cases of inheritance. Imagine an elderly gay man dies who had a hetero family prior to a gay marriage and there is a dispute over inheritance. I can foresee many such realistic scenarios.\n \n\n Again, this argument can be used to disallow opposite-sex marriages.\n \n Refer to what I said about about the costs of same-sex marriage. Also note that this argument can be used to disallow marriage for opposite-sex couples.\n \n\n See above comments on society's acceptance to subsidize hetero couples.\n \n\n Understand that this same loophole exists in our current system of opposite-sex marriage, and it can thus be used as a reason to deny opposite-sex couples marriage. Isn't a better solution to fix the loopholes and give everyone the same rights?\n \n Okay, you've heard me mention that many of your arguments can be used to deny opposite-sex couples marriage rights as well. Let me explain why this is important. Because our society prides itself on freedom, equality, and happiness, we try to give equal rights to everyone and allow people to be as free as they like so long as they do not harm others. This means that we do not arbitrarily give extra tax breaks and extra rights to random groups of people. Currently, you have listed no reason that opposite-sex couples deserve these rights but same-sex couples do not. That is really the heart of the debate. You aren't debating that same-sex marriage is wrong, you are debating that marriage itself is wrong. What is missing from your argument is what everyone is talking about<b></b>: why do opposite-sex couples deserve the right to be married but same-sex couples do not?\n\n Fair question. I stated above that society was willing to subsidize hetero marriage because it saw benefits in doing so, but I never enumerated those benefits.\n Society's Benefits from Marriage:\n 1. Financial security for woman and children \n 2. Exclusivity for man/woman with penalties for violations of that exclusivity\n 3. Property succession and dissolution upon divorce/death\n 4. Protection from forced testimony about partner\n 5. Societal stability\n 6. Perceived as a sacrament to religious followers\n 7. Establishes legal guardianship of children\n \n I'm sure that I can think of others, but that should suffice for the time being.\n \n\n I have no problem with you using your arguments to support banning marriage, but they only make sense in the context of banning marriage for everyone. If that is your intention, then I don't really think that gay rights play a factor here. If not, your argument only follows if you give reasons why one group of people deserves all of these marriage rights, but a different group does not.\n \n Let me know what you think.\n\n \n The latter, of course. I'm not anti-marriage. In fact I've been \"institutionalized\" with the same woman for 26 great years so far. I just don't see the benefits to society for promoting gay marriage. All I see are increased chances for abuse of the law, additional costs and a promotion of a lifestyle that I , personally, believe is deviant. (not deviant as in \"sinister\", but in the sense of \"abnormal\") But that's not to say that I'm closed minded and can't be persuaded otherwise. There are other things that I consider deviant, but can tolerate, none-the-less.",

Most heterosexual couples don't file joint returns either. There needs to be a large difference between the two incomes for that to be a good way to file. Other than that the rest of the benefits are at the state level.\n \n How do you respond to that?",

   "In actuality, there are three types of couples: married, gay and heterosexual unmarried. Only the first group get the benefits of marriage. If we broaden the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, wouldn't heterosexual unmarried couples still be discriminated against? And if we did that, then we'd have two new classes of citizens with claims to others' property that they didn't have previously.\n\n \n The term \"classes of citizens\" suggests that each class is treated differently. If we have two \"classes\" which both recieve the same treatment under the law, those classes are really the same class. So by legalizing same-sex marriage, we are not creating any new class, we are allowing more people to enter an already-existing class. It is acceptable to make distinctions about the differences between people in a class, but it is all the same class. That being said, I understand that more people will be moving into a class in which they are granted more benefits under the law. Your statement above does not yet introduce any new ways that allowing more people to join this class is a bad thing.\n \n You did suggest that unmarried heterosexual couples would still be discriminated against, even if we allowed same-sex couples to marry. This is simply not the case. If we allowed same-sex couples to marry, the government would be extending the offer to as many people as possible. It gives everyone the freedom to choose whether or not to accept the benefits it offers. It discriminates against no one. Rights are not something that should be handed out only if the politician in charge approves. They are not something that should be taken away simply because your society doesn't want you to have rights. Even annoying people have rights.\n \n \nThe point that our society willingly pays for breaks given to heterosexual couples can't be trivialized by saying that it should be all or nothing. Society, as it stands today, is willing to partially subsidize hetero couples and NOT same sex couples. Now, admittedly, those reasons aren't always strictly financial, but I've limited my discussion to those issues.\n\n \n Aha, this is the type of argument that your previous post was lacking. Your previous post could not be understood as standing against same-sex marriage without making the distinction that you believe those things are okay, but only if society willingly approves them. Now that I have this information, I am able to formulate a response.\n \n First, I should point out what has already been mentioned: that it is possible society would be paying less money in taxes if same-sex marriage is passed. I do not claim to know the answer, but I'm sure I can look up some solid facts presented by those who know more on this topic than I do and relay the information to you as well as posting a link to it.\n \n However, the reason that I do not know for certain whether society will be paying money or saving it is that I do not believe it matters. I do not believe the laws we pass on how money is spent should be related to the will of the society to pay that money. The reason for this is that we are not actually talking about the will of society, we are talking about the will of the majority. Let me pose this situation: we have a society of ninty percent white and ten percent is black people. The white people vote that the black people must must pay a fee each month. This fee would then be distributed equally into the bank accounts of all of the white people. Basically, the white people vote that the black people must pay them money. Is this justifyable? I think we will both agree that it is not. But couldn't it be said that it is the will of society? I mean, ninty percent of the people voted for it, right? Well, yes, ninty percent of people voted for it, but that doesn't mean it is acceptable for people to pass such a law. It also isn't really the will of everyone in the society, it is the will of the majority, which is abusing their power. The majority is making the minority suffer to benefit itself.\n \n Now, you may be thinking \"that's a totally different situation than same-sex marriage.\" But is it really? The majority and minority don't have to be black and white, they could be Christian and Muslim, German and Italian, or even straight and gay. It doesn't matter what group of people we're talking about; it is absurd to think that the minority should have to benefit the majority, even if the majority of people in a society vote for that to happen. Now if we assume that marriage does cause dependency and does force people to pay for it (whether those people be businesses or individuals), then we must concede that those non-married people are somehow paying or losing out in order to benefit the married people. We are also saying that only the majority, heterosexual couples, are allowed to get married; they are the only ones entitled to this benefit. Tell me, do you really think that homosexual couples agree to a definition of marriage that does not include same-sex relationships? Would you vote to pay for someone else's marriage if they would not return the favor for you? Even if same-sex couples did agree to this, it would be out of compassion, not because it is any more fair than whites forcing blacks to pay them.\n \n So my point above is that simply because society \"agrees\" to something does not mean that is morally correct to obey them. In fact, it may be just as likely to be morally incorrect. This reason is why we have legislators whose job it is to think these things through in the first place. Our federal government was designed not only to balance power across its different branches, but to balance out the power that the majority has to oppress the minority (but that is a different discussion, more of which can be read about in the Federalist Papers).\n \n I should also point out here that even though you make the claim that society has not decided to pay for same-sex marriage, my argument here is not that we should force it upon society against its will but that the individuals in the society should change their viewpoint. People like you and I should be willing to grant marriage to any two people in love, not just a specific kind of two people. In effect, you are arguing that people should think same-sex marriage is wrong because society thinks same-sex marriage is wrong. But people make up the society, so you're really arguing that people should think same-sex marriage is wrong because people think same-sex marriage is wrong. I do not think that I can agree with that chain of logic.\n \n \nThe unfunded mandate law also extends to businesses. If the total cost of instituting gay marriage costs <$50Million, Congress must take that fact into consideration. A cost increase to businesses, state and federal employers of $50Million is certainly going to be surpassed over the lifetime of the statute.\n \n You've just made my point for me. It would have the net effect of being an unfunded mandate to businesses and they would have to respond by stopping ALL insurance or adding additional coverage for gay couples. What if that business was a religious institution that was morally opposed to gay marriage. They would be forced to support it, regardless of their moral stance. Isn't the so-called separation of church and state really a double-edged sword designed to protect the church FROM government intervention as well?\n\n \n I should start by saying that this is not a reason to disapprove of same-sex marriage. Certainly if the legislature passed same-sex marriage, it could not be called an unfunded mandate. Also, is an argument not about why same-sex marriage causes harm or is otherwise unjustiable, it is an argument about why a specific method of legalizing same-sex marriage might be considered illegal. So whether you think this is an unfunded mandate or not, it is really not justification to disagree with same-sex marriage.\n \n That being said, such a ruling would not be an unfunded mandate. As I think examples illustrate points very well, let us assume that some businesses are paying people different amounts of money depending on their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or something equally absurd. The courts get this case and rule that the business must not use race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or whatever the trait may be as a factor in determining salary. This is not really an unfunded mandate; it isn't telling a business that it has to raise the salaries of the oppressed group of people to match everyone else's, it is simply saying that the salaries must be distributed evenly. The business would certainly be justified in lowering everyone's salary, splitting the total salary budget up equally, or partaking in whatever method it chose in order to meet the court's ruling. The same could be said of health care; if the court rules that the sex of the people involved in a marriage cannot be used as a factor in determing whether those people get health care benefits and they allow same-sex marriage, then businesses would not be forced to increase costs, they would be forced to treat each of their employees equally in whatever way they saw fit. The same budget could certainly be dispersed equally in health care benefits.\n \n Another factor to consider is that businesses are not really the subject here, we are only considering allowing more people to engage in marriage. We wouldn't be forcing a business to immediately take action, they would continue their standard pattern of giving people health care benefits based on their marital status. More people would be allowed to get married, and they would thus have more benefits to disperse, but certainly no business policy is changed in any way. As an example, the courts might extend the definition of what is considered \"handicap\". Perhaps they issue a ruling that blind people are now officially added to the \"handicap\" list. The courts aren't forcing businesses to make new accomodations in this case, they are simply telling businesses to keep doing what they've been doing, though more people might be allowed to take part in the existing accomodations.\n \n A final note to consider is that disallowing same-sex couples from getting the same marriage benefits from businesses in effect gives businesses a loophole through which they can hire people without having to give those people benefits. Not the best argument, but you seemed interested in creative loophole concepts.\n \n \nCourt costs will undoubtedly increase as there are property disputes amongst gay partners with new-found rights. It's unavoidable, especially in cases of inheritance. Imagine an elderly gay man dies who had a hetero family prior to a gay marriage and there is a dispute over inheritance. I can foresee many such realistic scenarios.\n\n \n This is addressed in my writings about society possibly saving money and how it wouldn't matter even if they did not in my writings above.\n \n \nFair question. I stated above that society was willing to subsidize hetero marriage because it saw benefits in doing so, but I never enumerated those benefits.\n Society's Benefits from Marriage:\n 1. Financial security for woman and children \n 2. Exclusivity for man/woman with penalties for violations of that exclusivity\n 3. Property succession and dissolution upon divorce/death\n 4. Protection from forced testimony about partner\n 5. Societal stability\n 6. Perceived as a sacrament to religious followers\n 7. Establishes legal guardianship of children\n \n I'm sure that I can think of others, but that should suffice for the time being.\n \n\n \n Excellent, now let me list the benefits of same-sex relationships:\n 1. Financial security for women and children.\n 2. Financial security for men and children.\n 3. No exclusivity for man/woman with no penalties for violations of that exclusivity\n 4. Property succession and dissolution upon divorce/death\n 5. Protection from testimony about partner\n 6. Societal stability\n 7. Periceved as sacrament to religious followers.\n 8. Establishes legal guardianship of children.\n \n And that is just the beginning! Did you know there are over 1,000 benefits granted to married couples? All those could benefit both same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples if we allowed same-sex marriage.\n \n As you can see, the same set of arguments that you use in support of opposite-sex marriage can be used to support same-sex marriage. I think some of them speak for themselves, but if you have more questions on them, let me know. As for the ones that don't, I will go into more detail.\n \n 1 and 2: Just as there are male-male couples, there are female-female couples. Considering that same-sex couples very often have children, it is just as important to make them financially secure and able to raise those children as it is to do so with opposite-sex couples.\n \n 3: This I feel is an important one. I don't see your exclusivity of marriage to be a good thing for any reason whatsoever. First of all, there is absolutely no reason to suggest that same-sex parents would make worse parents than opposite-sex parents. I've heard a few comments like \"the kids will be teased more in school\", but in truth, a kid is just as likely to be teased because his parents are overweight, don't speak English, are too protective, or any of a million other reasons that don't matter. I've heard the same said about the child feeling different, and those same examples can be used to show a child feeling different. In truth, every child has to come to terms with his or her families' differences, but just because a child's family is different from someone else's doesn't make it worse.\n \n Now then, I did write that the lack of exclusivity is a bad thing. Some of the reasons I wrote this are because of equal rights for all couples, freedom to live the way you choose, and granting everyone the same opportunity at happiness. I think you understand that these are very good things, and perhaps you get a good idea of how same-sex marriage promotes these things from what I wrote above. If not, I will go into more detail. But another very important benefit comes from giving same-sex couples the right to marry that may not be so intuitive. These couples have more incentive to have children. It is true that often same-sex couples have their children because of previous relationships, but it is equally common that they get their children through adoption or foster parenting. This is a very good thing. The life of a child in an adoption home or child placement center is a very horrible one. The child lives with no family and the government is forced to pay for all of his or her living expenses. Such a home is no place for a child to grow up, and we have far more children in these homes than people are willing to take in. Allowing same-sex couples to marry would give these children loving, caring families, and that is something that changes the lives of those children for the better in every way possible.\n \n 7: Same-sex couples certainly have religion, and are very often Christian. Marriage is as important religiously to them as it is to anyone else. Now, I know that any sort of religous marriage is already legal and that it is only government recognition of the partnership that is lacking, but as you said, it is religious perception. It is usually just as religiously important to same-sex couples to be married as it is for opposite-sex couples, and no one should be able to tell those people that the government cannot recognize their relationship.\n \n 8: Well, I think I explained this well in point 3.\n \n \nThe latter, of course. I'm not anti-marriage. In fact I've been \"institutionalized\" with the same woman for 26 great years so far. I just don't see the benefits to society for promoting gay marriage. All I see are increased chances for abuse of the law, additional costs and a promotion of a lifestyle that I , personally, believe is deviant. (not deviant as in \"sinister\", but in the sense of \"abnormal\") But that's not to say that I'm closed minded and can't be persuaded otherwise. There are other things that I consider deviant, but can tolerate, none-the-less.\n\n \n Well, it may surprise you that I believe that it is deviant to believe that same-sex marriage is immoral (in the sense that it is abnormal). This is because I believe that it is normal for most people to want to treat others the way they wish to be treated themselves. I believe it is normal for others to work toward the happiness of others, especially when that happiness does not interfere with their own happiness. But it does not follow for me that one can oppose same-sex marriage and follow those rules. It seems to me that people have been told or told themselves that same-sex marriage is bad for so long that they have sort of convinced themselves to deviate from human compassion on this one issue. Well, I suppose what I just said doesn't really mean much of anything, just that someone who want to spend his or her life with the one he or she loves does not qualify as \"deviant\" behavior in my book. It is not something that must be \"tolerated\", it is something that should be enjoyed for the good present in its nature.\n \n You wrote that you do not see the benefits of same-sex marriage. I know I went into the benefits of allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but I also spoke on same-sex marriage promoting equality, freedom, and happiness. Let me expand on that.\n \n Equality seems very simple to explain. Currently those who love someone of the opposite sex and choose to enter a relationship with that person are granted a set of benefits under the law. This same set of benefits could be extended to those who love someone of the same sex, but it is not, and they are still forced to pay any costs in taxes that salary cuts from businesses that might be accrued through these benefits being bestowed upon someone else. This simple fact violates equality, and I think this is clear and easy to understand. What may not be clear is why equality is so imporant. Granting a set of rights to one group of people that another does not have elevate the first group over the second. The more equality is removed, the more one group is elevated over the other and the more that first group is leeching off of the second group. If the first group could provide those same bonuses to the second group without causing any real harm, the first group is obligated to do so. For the powerful to take things for themselves that they could just as easily share with the weak crosses the line of moral evil.\n \n Freedom might be a bit more difficult to understand. Though the government is not granting the same set of benefits that it gives opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples, it is not actually taking any anyone's freedom to behave in the manner they please. Or is it? By benefiting one lifestyle over another, the government is directly promoting that specific lifestyle. Taken to the extreme, the government could just as easily imprision those who don't live the way the government commands and claim that those people have complete freedom, they just don't have the \"benefit\" of walking around that other people get. The lack of these benefits could be considered a fine for not living the way the government intends, or more accurately, the government is promoting one lifestyle over another. To any extent which the government does this, we all lose a bit of freedom to behave in the manner that we want. Of course there are good reasons to restrict freedom, taking into consideration murder and stealing, however those are actions that cause harm to people; they are restricted to protect the rights of others, to stop harm. I do not think that any of the reasons you listed are harms that opposite-sex marriage does not also imply, and I think most of the harms you listed are not really harms at all as explained above. In fact, same-sex marriage brings plenty of benefits (again, as I explained above). This in no way warrants the restriction of freedom.\n \n Finally I come to happiness: this is the end of all governments. Governments exist to make as many of their citizens as happy as possible, or at least give them all as much an opportunity to persue happiness as they can. The ideas of freedom and equality are really only a means to help people achieve happiness, to help the achieve the best standard of living they can, to help them be able to do the things in life they want to do, to help people in any way they can. With same-sex marriage, we have the opportunity to help a set of people without bringing harm to anyone. We have the power to give the same rights that we hold to a group of people different from ourselves. We have an opportunity to help people, and I am forced to conclude that we cannot call ourselves equal, we cannot call ourselves the land of the free, and we cannot call ourselves a morally good society if we do not take that opportunity.",

It just is not extended to all couples.\n\n That's a legitimate point of contention, IMO. I think that the debate should be undertaken as any other policy debate is handled. What are the costs (both monetary and social) and benefits (both monetarial and social) of enacting such a law.\n \n\n I appreciate JP's feeling that this should be a civil debate. I hope that I have come off as civil (or as best as I can being the sarcastic boy that I can be). My problem with many of your arguments is the are Federal argumetns and marriage is a states' issue. How do you account for that?\n\n We've disagreed civily in the past even when our words were misinterpreted. \n As I stated in an earlier post, I believe that gay marriage has to be undertaken from a federal standpoint. The 1996 Defense of Marriage Act defines a marriage as a union between one man and one woman. If a state redefines marriage differently than the federal statute, then it is likely to be challenged in the SCOTUS. \n \n\n Your arguments (and rightfully so) are mostly financial, which I have to say is much more interesting a debate than the normal religious stuff. \n\n Agreed. There's no ground in which to debate gay marriage if you follow a strict Christian interpretation of the Bible. \n \n\n BUT I can't see where the line is drawn between the christian right wanting more couples to marry and gay couples marrying. Both by your arguments would have the same effect, but again you keep talking in federal terms and marriage is a states' issue. \n\n I have to keep backing up to the point that society on a whole accepts the costs associated with hetero marriages because it sees the benefits in them.\n \n\n Although many of the benefits are Federal, likejoint tax returns. Most heterosexual couples don't file joint returns either. There needs to be a large difference between the two incomes for that to be a good way to file. Other than that the rest of the benefits are at the state level.\n\n I believe that most married couples file jointly, but I'll do a little research before stating it's a fact.\n \n\n How do you respond to that?\n\n SS, Medicare and employer paid healthcare bennies aren't state issues, so I don't understand your assertion. \n emoticon_confused",

   "Heh, well we'll see how long they can do it.\n\n I guess I'd have to reluctantly admit that it didn't take long for some....but I'm an eternal optimist and think civility will prevail. Besides, I try not to judge everybody by the acts of a few.\n \n\n It seems that the bulk of your opposition to gay marriage is based on financial reasons. Am I to assume then that if it turned out gay marriage cost nothing more to society financially, and perhaps even helped society in that regard, you'd no longer be opposed to gay marriage?\n\n I prefaced my argument by saying that I wouldn't address the religious argument, only the financial ones.\n \n\n To some extent I agree with you, in that any group could come along who didn't want to have to pay property taxes to transfer property or wanted to claim SS entitlements and simply try to be recognized as a group for which marriage benefits should apply. That is in effect, what gays are doing. In their case they are doing it by changing the standard we use to determine what suffices for a marriage: opposite gender couples.\n\n I agree in some respects and disagree with others. What bothered me in previous debates was the intellectual dishonesty exhibited by most supporters when I would make the assertion that \"it's all about the Benjamins\".\n They said that they supported gay marriage \"on principle\" not fiscal grounds.\n Jaxian was one of the first to admit that economics was a significant part of the issue.",

Correct me if I'm wrong, but single people can get health insurance. You don't need marriage for that.\n\n \n You do, generally, if you want your spouse's employer paying for it.

   "YOu have some good points here, but the problem with this society right now is that Civil Unions are seen as \"not as good\". Why do some get marriage and some get civil unions. There is no other place in the legal system where this sort of separtion of class exists. Why it is unconstitutional. It defies equality.\n\n It isn't unconstitutional because any citizen is free to marry a member of the opposite sex as defined by The Defense of Marriage Act of 1996.\n \n\n Civil unions are like marriage light. Would straights be allowed to have civil unions if they don't want to marry?\n What will people say when the first straight couples sues for a civil union saying they want the same rights as gays.\n\n Ah yes, another slippery slope. The same slippery slope that bigamists can slide down in the future if marriage can be redefined yet one more time. \n \n\n Civil Unions are sorta why have a loaf of bread when everyone else gets the whole bakery?\n\n And that's what happens when something doesn't meet the definition of a bakery.

   "The term \"classes of citizens\" suggests that each class is treated differently. If we have two \"classes\" which both recieve the same treatment under the law, those classes are really the same class. So by legalizing same-sex marriage, we are not creating any new class, we are allowing more people to enter an already-existing class. It is acceptable to make distinctions about the differences between people in a class, but it is all the same class. That being said, I understand that more people will be moving into a class in which they are granted more benefits under the law. Your statement above does not yet introduce any new ways that allowing more people to join this class is a bad thing.\n\n I'm not \"married\" (pun imtended) to the term class. I could just as easily said \"new group\" or new \"category\". The key point was \"new\".\n \n\n You did suggest that unmarried heterosexual couples would still be discriminated against, even if we allowed same-sex couples to marry. This is simply not the case. If we allowed same-sex couples to marry, the government would be extending the offer to as many people as possible. It gives everyone the freedom to choose whether or not to accept the benefits it offers. It discriminates against no one. Rights are not something that should be handed out only if the politician in charge approves. They are not something that should be taken away simply because your society doesn't want you to have rights. Even annoying people have rights.\n\n I didn't go into enough detail with respect to unmarried hetero couples. Right now, most states have \"common law\" marriage statutes in which a partner of the opposite sex can lay claim to a portion of their unmarried partner's property if they've lived together for a defined period of time. Allowing gay marriage without also rewriting common law statutes discriminates against unmarried heteros living together. Without legal gay marriage, gay partners don't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner. Does that explain it better?\n \n\n Aha, this is the type of argument that your previous post was lacking. Your previous post could not be understood as standing against same-sex marriage without making the distinction that you believe those things are okay, but only if society willingly approves them. Now that I have this information, I am able to formulate a response.\n\n Sorry for my lack of clarity in prior posts WRT society's willingness to foot the bill.\n \n\n First, I should point out what has already been mentioned: that it is possible society would be paying less money in taxes if same-sex marriage is passed. I do not claim to know the answer, but I'm sure I can look up some solid facts presented by those who know more on this topic than I do and relay the information to you as well as posting a link to it.\n\n The CBO estimate was ~$1Billion/ year in additional costs for legalizing 600,000 gay marriages.\n \n\n However, the reason that I do not know for certain whether society will be paying money or saving it is that I do not believe it matters. I do not believe the laws we pass on how money is spent should be related to the will of the society to pay that money. The reason for this is that we are not actually talking about the will of society, we are talking about the will of the majority. Let me pose this situation: we have a society of ninty percent white and ten percent is black people. The white people vote that the black people must must pay a fee each month. This fee would then be distributed equally into the bank accounts of all of the white people. Basically, the white people vote that the black people must pay them money. Is this justifyable? I think we will both agree that it is not. But couldn't it be said that it is the will of society? I mean, ninty percent of the people voted for it, right? Well, yes, ninty percent of people voted for it, but that doesn't mean it is acceptable for people to pass such a law. It also isn't really the will of everyone in the society, it is the will of the majority, which is abusing their power. The majority is making the minority suffer to benefit itself.\n Now, you may be thinking \"that's a totally different situation than same-sex marriage.\" But is it really? The majority and minority don't have to be black and white, they could be Christian and Muslim, German and Italian, or even straight and gay. It doesn't matter what group of people we're talking about; it is absurd to think that the minority should have to benefit the majority, even if the majority of people in a society vote for that to happen. Now if we assume that marriage does cause dependency and does force people to pay for it (whether those people be businesses or individuals), then we must concede that those non-married people are somehow paying or losing out in order to benefit the married people. We are also saying that only the majority, heterosexual couples, are allowed to get married; they are the only ones entitled to this benefit. Tell me, do you really think that homosexual couples agree to a definition of marriage that does not include same-sex relationships? Would you vote to pay for someone else's marriage if they would not return the favor for you? Even if same-sex couples did agree to this, it would be out of compassion, not because it is any more fair than whites forcing blacks to pay them.\n\n An interesting scenario. Let me reply with an example of my own. The top 5% of wage earners pay over 30% of all Federal Income Taxes in the US because the majority of US citizens supported higher taxation on the wealthy. Is that not similar to your scenario, except that in your scenario the blacks footed the bill and in mine the wealthy footed the bill? But I digress.\n To get back to your point, there are \"inalienable rights\" and there are social standards. Gay marriage doesn't fall in the category of inalienable rights, IMO, it falls in the area of social standards. Social standards are subject to evolution, adaptation and refinement as determined by society as a whole. These types of laws aren't carved in stone, so to speak, but are semi-fluid and change as social mores change.\n \n\n So my point above is that simply because society \"agrees\" to something does not mean that is morally correct to obey them. In fact, it may be just as likely to be morally incorrect. This reason is why we have legislators whose job it is to think these things through in the first place. Our federal government was designed not only to balance power across its different branches, but to balance out the power that the majority has to oppress the minority (but that is a different discussion, more of which can be read about in the Federalist Papers).\n \n I should also point out here that even though you make the claim that society has not decided to pay for same-sex marriage, my argument here is not that we should force it upon society against its will but that the individuals in the society should change their viewpoint. People like you and I should be willing to grant marriage to any two people in love, not just a specific kind of two people. In effect, you are arguing that people should think same-sex marriage is wrong because society thinks same-sex marriage is wrong. But people make up the society, so you're really arguing that people should think same-sex marriage is wrong because people think same-sex marriage is wrong. I do not think that I can agree with that chain of logic.\n\n \n Right now, the majority of Americans DO believe that gay marriage IS wrong. This has been demonstrated in 19 states that overwhelmingly voted against gay marriage. You have your work cut out for you in trying to convince the majority of Americans that there is a benefit to society in allowing gay marriages.\n \n\n I should start by saying that this is not a reason to disapprove of same-sex marriage. Certainly if the legislature passed same-sex marriage, it could not be called an unfunded mandate.\n\n If the cost of initiating gay marriage is <$50Million, then it is an unfunded mandate by definition and as the CBO calculated, the costs will far exceed $50Million.\n \n\n Also, is an argument not about why same-sex marriage causes harm or is otherwise unjustiable, it is an argument about why a specific method of legalizing same-sex marriage might be considered illegal. So whether you think this is an unfunded mandate or not, it is really not justification to disagree with same-sex marriage.\n\n It is one of several reasons enumerated, not the only one. \n \n\n That being said, such a ruling would not be an unfunded mandate. As I think examples illustrate points very well, let us assume that some businesses are paying people different amounts of money depending on their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or something equally absurd. The courts get this case and rule that the business must not use race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or whatever the trait may be as a factor in determining salary. This is not really an unfunded mandate; it isn't telling a business that it has to raise the salaries of the oppressed group of people to match everyone else's, it is simply saying that the salaries must be distributed evenly. The business would certainly be justified in lowering everyone's salary, splitting the total salary budget up equally, or partaking in whatever method it chose in order to meet the court's ruling. The same could be said of health care; if the court rules that the sex of the people involved in a marriage cannot be used as a factor in determing whether those people get health care benefits and they allow same-sex marriage, then businesses would not be forced to increase costs, they would be forced to treat each of their employees equally in whatever way they saw fit. The same budget could certainly be dispersed equally in health care benefits.\n\n Your arguing apples and oranges. There are laws already on the books, prior to the unfunded mandate statute, that prohibit discrimination in employment.\n Gays partners have no legal status today, so the granting of legal status to them will result in increased expenditures by business.\n \n\n Another factor to consider is that businesses are not really the subject here, we are only considering allowing more people to engage in marriage. We wouldn't be forcing a business to immediately take action, they would continue their standard pattern of giving people health care benefits based on their marital status. More people would be allowed to get married, and they would thus have more benefits to disperse, but certainly no business policy is changed in any way. As an example, the courts might extend the definition of what is considered \"handicap\". Perhaps they issue a ruling that blind people are now officially added to the \"handicap\" list. The courts aren't forcing businesses to make new accomodations in this case, they are simply telling businesses to keep doing what they've been doing, though more people might be allowed to take part in the existing accomodations.\n\n \n Not true. If the government changes the definition of handicapped to include a previously non-covered group, and the net effect is to increase costs <$50Million, it is an unfunded mandate. Back during GW1's presidency, they changed the definition of disabled and incurred increased costs through the ADA to pay drunks and drug addicts benefits. http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/ada/ch4.htm\n The redefining of \"disabled\" did, indeed, cost a sizeable amount of money.\n \n\n A final note to consider is that disallowing same-sex couples from getting the same marriage benefits from businesses in effect gives businesses a loophole through which they can hire people without having to give those people benefits. Not the best argument, but you seemed interested in creative loophole concepts.\n\n \n It's not a loophole if the gay partner has no legal standing. As far as the employer is concerned, the partner is a non-issue. Now, if you could prove that an employer didn't hire you because YOU were gay, that'd be a whole different ballgame.\n \n\n This is addressed in my writings about society possibly saving money and how it wouldn't matter even if they did not in my writings above.\n\n To which I would refer you back to my previous paragraph on mores and inalienable rights.\n \n\n Excellent, now let me list the benefits of same-sex relationships:\n 1. Financial security for women and children. Agreed.\n 2. Financial security for men and children. Agreed.\n 3. No exclusivity for man/woman with no penalties for violations of that exclusivity This isn't a benefit to society, quite the contrary.\n 4. Property succession and dissolution upon divorce/death could be either a benefit or detriment\n 5. Protection from testimony about partner Agreed.\n 6. Societal stability [b] Possibly, but the jury's out[b]\n 7. Periceved as sacrament to religious followers.  not in any religion that I'm familiar with\n 8. Establishes legal guardianship of children. Agreed.\n \n And that is just the beginning! Did you know there are over 1,000 benefits granted to married couples? \n\n Yes, I read the CBO report. :)\n \n\n All those could benefit both same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples if we allowed same-sex marriage.\n\n You assume that the majority want gays to enjoy those same benefits. That's a big assumption.\n \n\n As you can see, the same set of arguments that you use in support of opposite-sex marriage can be used to support same-sex marriage. I think some of them speak for themselves, but if you have more questions on them, let me know. As for the ones that don't, I will go into more detail.\n \n 1 and 2: Just as there are male-male couples, there are female-female couples. Considering that same-sex couples very often have children, it is just as important to make them financially secure and able to raise those children as it is to do so with opposite-sex couples.\n \n 3: This I feel is an important one. I don't see your exclusivity of marriage to be a good thing for any reason whatsoever. First of all, there is absolutely no reason to suggest that same-sex parents would make worse parents than opposite-sex parents. I've heard a few comments like \"the kids will be teased more in school\", but in truth, a kid is just as likely to be teased because his parents are overweight, don't speak English, are too protective, or any of a million other reasons that don't matter. I've heard the same said about the child feeling different, and those same examples can be used to show a child feeling different. In truth, every child has to come to terms with his or her families' differences, but just because a child's family is different from someone else's doesn't make it worse.\n \n Now then, I did write that the lack of exclusivity is a bad thing. Some of the reasons I wrote this are because of equal rights for all couples, freedom to live the way you choose, and granting everyone the same opportunity at happiness. I think you understand that these are very good things, and perhaps you get a good idea of how same-sex marriage promotes these things from what I wrote above. If not, I will go into more detail. But another very important benefit comes from giving same-sex couples the right to marry that may not be so intuitive. These couples have more incentive to have children. It is true that often same-sex couples have their children because of previous relationships, but it is equally common that they get their children through adoption or foster parenting. This is a very good thing. The life of a child in an adoption home or child placement center is a very horrible one. The child lives with no family and the government is forced to pay for all of his or her living expenses. Such a home is no place for a child to grow up, and we have far more children in these homes than people are willing to take in. Allowing same-sex couples to marry would give these children loving, caring families, and that is something that changes the lives of those children for the better in every way possible.\n \n\n By exclusive, I meant monogomous. Surely you aren't going to argue that promiscuity is a benefit to society? ;) \n \n\n 7: Same-sex couples certainly have religion, and are very often Christian. Marriage is as important religiously to them as it is to anyone else. Now, I know that any sort of religous marriage is already legal and that it is only government recognition of the partnership that is lacking, but as you said, it is religious perception. It is usually just as religiously important to same-sex couples to be married as it is for opposite-sex couples, and no one should be able to tell those people that the government cannot recognize their relationship.\n\n I'm not familiar with any religion that promotes gay marriage. Enlighten me.\n \n\n 8: Well, I think I explained this well in point 3.\n\n \n\n Well, it may surprise you that I believe that it is deviant to believe that same-sex marriage is immoral (in the sense that it is abnormal). This is because I believe that it is normal for most people to want to treat others the way they wish to be treated themselves. I believe it is normal for others to work toward the happiness of others, especially when that happiness does not interfere with their own happiness. But it does not follow for me that one can oppose same-sex marriage and follow those rules. It seems to me that people have been told or told themselves that same-sex marriage is bad for so long that they have sort of convinced themselves to deviate from human compassion on this one issue. Well, I suppose what I just said doesn't really mean much of anything, just that someone who want to spend his or her life with the one he or she loves does not qualify as \"deviant\" behavior in my book. It is not something that must be \"tolerated\", it is something that should be enjoyed for the good present in its nature.\n\n Homosexuality is deviant in the sense that it isn't \"the norm\". That doesn't mean that it can't have benefits that outweigh its 'abnormal\" nature. I'm a very strong advocate for kids and I believe that any loving couple is better than a single parent home or similar.\n \n\n You wrote that you do not see the benefits of same-sex marriage. I know I went into the benefits of allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but I also spoke on same-sex marriage promoting equality, freedom, and happiness. Let me expand on that.\n \n Equality seems very simple to explain. Currently those who love someone of the opposite sex and choose to enter a relationship with that person are granted a set of benefits under the law. This same set of benefits could be extended to those who love someone of the same sex, but it is not, and they are still forced to pay any costs in taxes that salary cuts from businesses that might be accrued through these benefits being bestowed upon someone else. This simple fact violates equality, and I think this is clear and easy to understand. What may not be clear is why equality is so imporant. Granting a set of rights to one group of people that another does not have elevate the first group over the second. The more equality is removed, the more one group is elevated over the other and the more that first group is leeching off of the second group. If the first group could provide those same bonuses to the second group without causing any real harm, the first group is obligated to do so. For the powerful to take things for themselves that they could just as easily share with the weak crosses the line of moral evil.\n\n The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice. We, as a society, preach equality in principle, but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives. As I mentioned above, the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality. Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily. For example, I am considered, by my employer, to be an HCI (highly compensated individual). As a result, I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get. Is that fair? I guess as I get older, I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but don't exist in practice.\n \n\n Freedom might be a bit more difficult to understand. Though the government is not granting the same set of benefits that it gives opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples, it is not actually taking any anyone's freedom to behave in the manner they please. Or is it? By benefiting one lifestyle over another, the government is directly promoting that specific lifestyle. Taken to the extreme, the government could just as easily imprision those who don't live the way the government commands and claim that those people have complete freedom, they just don't have the \"benefit\" of walking around that other people get. The lack of these benefits could be considered a fine for not living the way the government intends, or more accurately, the government is promoting one lifestyle over another. To any extent which the government does this, we all lose a bit of freedom to behave in the manner that we want. Of course there are good reasons to restrict freedom, taking into consideration murder and stealing, however those are actions that cause harm to people; they are restricted to protect the rights of others, to stop harm. I do not think that any of the reasons you listed are harms that opposite-sex marriage does not also imply, and I think most of the harms you listed are not really harms at all as explained above. In fact, same-sex marriage brings plenty of benefits (again, as I explained above). This in no way warrants the restriction of freedom.\n\n Interesting. What you call a fine for non-compliance, I call a benefit FOR compliance. There are lots of examples of laws designed to promote social changes. Tax codes that favor married couples is but one example. Another would be IRAs. Uncle Sam rewards people for saving money by deferring taxes on that money. It rewards home owners with deductions for mortgage interest. I don't see rewarding hetero marriage as being any different. The government is promoting hetero marriage.\n \n\n Finally I come to happiness: this is the end of all governments. Governments exist to make as many of their citizens as happy as possible, or at least give them all as much an opportunity to persue happiness as they can. The ideas of freedom and equality are really only a means to help people achieve happiness, to help the achieve the best standard of living they can, to help them be able to do the things in life they want to do, to help people in any way they can. With same-sex marriage, we have the opportunity to help a set of people without bringing harm to anyone. We have the power to give the same rights that we hold to a group of people different from ourselves. We have an opportunity to help people, and I am forced to conclude that we cannot call ourselves equal, we cannot call ourselves the land of the free, and we cannot call ourselves a morally good society if we do not take that opportunity.\n\n \n I'd like to see freedom and equality myself. I'd like to see Uncle Sam get out of the business of social engineering, restricting my personal freedom and enslaving my children and grandchildren with ever-growing debt. maybe gays and Conservatives should join forces and bring about changes that will benefit all of us and make us all happy.",

The government is promoting hetero marriage.\n\n \n We can talk about other forms of inequality too, against other groups of people, such as the poor and the homeless. But it doesn't address the issue of marriage inequality for gays and lesbians. Gay people don't even have the option of getting married so they can enjoy those tax codes.",

   "I'm not \"married\" (pun imtended) to the term class. I could just as easily said \"new group\" or new \"category\". The key point was \"new\".\n\n \n I understand, but it sounded as though you were saying that there is some sort of special treatment going on, and I wanted to clear it up that we are moving people without the special treatment into an already existing category.\n \n \nI didn't go into enough detail with respect to unmarried hetero couples. Right now, most states have \"common law\" marriage statutes in which a partner of the opposite sex can lay claim to a portion of their unmarried partner's property if they've lived together for a defined period of time. Allowing gay marriage without also rewriting common law statutes discriminates against unmarried heteros living together. Without legal gay marriage, gay partners don't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner. Does that explain it better?\n\n \n Well, I disagree that it discriminates against unmarried heterosexual couples; those couples still have the choice to get married to recieve the benefits of marriage or stay unmarried. Same-sex couples do not have that choice currently, and all we are talking about is giving them that choice. Unmarried heterosexual couples are not affected and have the same choice available to them.\n \n Though now that I think about it, you may be saying that the common law statutes are applies to unmarried opposite-sex couples but not to unmarried same-sex couples? Well, in all honesty I think that is very unfair regardless of marriage status. The same common law rules should apply to both heterosexual and homosexual couples. I see no reason why this wouldn't be updated along with marriage.\n \n As for common law statutes being used against same-sex partners, well again, that is an argument against marriage or common law statutes, not against same-sex marriage specifically. It isn't a reason to disallow marriage to same-sex couples but allow it for opposite-sex couples.\n \n \nThe CBO estimate was ~$1Billion/ year in additional costs for legalizing 600,000 gay marriages.\n\n \n Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless. It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment. Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:\n \n http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Center&CONTENTID=16814&TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm\n \n It is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong. I did have a link to an actual study on the topic, but I cannot seem to find it. I'm sure if I scoured the Internet more, I could come up with something.\n \n \nAn interesting scenario. Let me reply with an example of my own. The top 5% of wage earners pay over 30% of all Federal Income Taxes in the US because the majority of US citizens supported higher taxation on the wealthy. Is that not similar to your scenario, except that in your scenario the blacks footed the bill and in mine the wealthy footed the bill? But I digress.\n\n \n I did not say that I agree with a tax incline, and perhaps that is a discussion for a different time. However there is a difference that I should point out. There is a reason for the tax incline: those with little money will suffer a lot more if they have to pay hijgher taxes. Those with high taxes are much more able to give money without losing those things essential to a decent standard of living. Is it equal? Interestingly it could be viewed as an attempt to give everyone a more equal income, however it could also be viewed as an inequality involving one group of people paying lots of taxes and another group paying not as much. I won't debate whether it is the type of equality we want to promote, I'll just assume that a tax incline removes equality. But remember, there is a reason behind that tax incline. The goal of government is to promote happiness as much as possible. In this case, the government could be viewed as sacrificing equality in favor of happiness. But whether that tradeoff is really working or is really a good idea is all up for debate. The point is: there is reasoning behind a tax incline based on income. There is no good reason behind giving marriage benefits to people based on their sex and there are plenty of reasons to do just the opposite. Or at least it is my goal to prove that in these posts.\n \n \nTo get back to your point, there are \"inalienable rights\" and there are social standards. Gay marriage doesn't fall in the category of inalienable rights, IMO, it falls in the area of social standards. Social standards are subject to evolution, adaptation and refinement as determined by society as a whole. These types of laws aren't carved in stone, so to speak, but are semi-fluid and change as social mores change.\n\n \n I don't think every law is carved into stone such that there is one right way to do it that lasts throughout the ages. I do, however, think that there are some actions which are inexcusable at any point in history. One of those actions is taking away or denying benefits to people that you give to yourself without a good reason. I believe that using the law in such a fashion is an example of the majority abusing its power, of mob rule in a sense. It is an example of the powerful group of people elevating themselves over the minority, and whether or not that is acceptable generations from now, I know that it is not morally right today.\n \n \nRight now, the majority of Americans DO believe that gay marriage IS wrong. This has been demonstrated in 19 states that overwhelmingly voted against gay marriage. You have your work cut out for you in trying to convince the majority of Americans that there is a benefit to society in allowing gay marriages.\n\n \n Well, certainly I don't expect to change the minds of millions of Americans, and that is not my goal. My goal is to convince readers of my writing that Americans SHOULD agree with same-sex marriage because it is morally correct to do so.\n \n \nIf the cost of initiating gay marriage is <$50Million, then it is an unfunded mandate by definition and as the CBO calculated, the costs will far exceed $50Million.\n\n \n Yes, but what I meant about the legislature passing it is that the legislature could fund it. If there is funding, it becomes a funded mandate. As I've said in the past, though, whether it is classified as an \"unfunded mandate\" or not does not suggest that same-sex marriage is wrong or right.\n \n \nIt is one of several reasons enumerated, not the only one.\n\n \n You are right, but my argument in that paragraph was intended to show that this particular reason does not suggest same-sex marriage is wrong. I discussed your other reasons in other places in my writing.\n \n \nYour arguing apples and oranges. There are laws already on the books, prior to the unfunded mandate statute, that prohibit discrimination in employment.\n Gays partners have no legal status today, so the granting of legal status to them will result in increased expenditures by business.\n\n \n But there were not always laws on the books that prevented these things. I was presenting a hypothetical situation in which those laws are not already on the books. The situtation was intended to show only that a ruling allowing same-sex marriage would not have to cost companies a dime.\n \n \nNot true. If the government changes the definition of handicapped to include a previously non-covered group, and the net effect is to increase costs <$50Million, it is an unfunded mandate. Back during GW1's presidency, they changed the definition of disabled and incurred increased costs through the ADA to pay drunks and drug addicts benefits. http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/ada/ch4.htm\n The redefining of \"disabled\" did, indeed, cost a sizeable amount of money.\n\n \n Oh, well I'm not saying that companies won't be paying more money in health insurance. My point is that allowing same-sex marriage doesn't really change company policy. The company's policy is currently based on the government's definition of marriage. If the government simply allows more people to choose to classify themselves as married, the company may see more more married couples apply for jobs, and it may see more of its employees decide to become married. As it sees these things happening, it can feel free to change its policies as it sees fit. What I mean is that this ruling would not mandate the businesses to make any payments to facillitate a change; all that would happen is a few more of its employees might begin to classify themselves as married and it might be a bit more likely that the company hires in a married person. There is no mandate sent out to the company, there is no change in company policy, and there is no payment that the company is dishing out. If as more married people show up in the workplace, the company decides to change its health care coverage, that is up to the company, but it is not mandated to make any change.\n \n Now maybe you can still classify this as an unfunded mandate, but I'm not really so sure that it legally qualifies under the circumstances. Regardless, I've been saying that its status as an unfunded mandate is irrelevant in determining whether it is right to agree with same-sex marriage or not; the fact that companies might have to provide all couples with health care equally instead of only giving health care to couples based on the sex of those involved is a change worth making. Quite a few companies already do it, in fact.\n \n \nIt's not a loophole if the gay partner has no legal standing. As far as the employer is concerned, the partner is a non-issue. Now, if you could prove that an employer didn't hire you because YOU were gay, that'd be a whole different ballgame.\n\n \n Well earlier you seemed interested in the idea that a loophole might exist that allowed people to avoid taxes. In this case I was only suggesting that a loophole could exist which allows companies to save money by hiring gay people instead of straight people in order to cut health insurance costs. As I said, it isn't really a strong argument, but maybe an interesting one.\n \n \nNo exclusivity for man/woman with no penalties for violations of that exclusivity This isn't a benefit to society, quite the contrary.\n\n \n I'm not sure I get what you mean. Are you saying that it is detrimental to society if marriage is not exclusively between a male and a female? If so, you'll need some justification for that. Or are you referring to monogamy here? If so, I'll address that in your comment about monogamy below.\n \n \n6. Societal stability Possibly, but the jury's out\n\n \n If the jury is out on this one, yet you believe it is not out for opposite-sex couples, then I am led to believe that you think somehow marriage keeps opposite-sex couples together in a way that applies to negligable amounts of same-sex couples. To assume that virtually no same-sex couples are held together by marriage indicates to me that you imagine some fundamental difference in same-sex couples that prevents marriage from having any affect on keeping any same-sex couples together. That seems a very unfounded and unreasonable claim; certainly marriage would keep some same-sex couples together. Now, if you are trying to say that marriage might work to a lesser degree on same-sex couples, I would probably agree with you, not based on some fundamental problem with homosexuality, but based on the fact that only the most sexually liberal people are willing to admit to homosexuality in a society where many people look down upon it. Still, if you have any observing or taking part in a same-sex relationship, you probably realize that they aren't much different than opposite-sex relationships and that marriage will undoubtedly have a stability effect on some, though maybe more or maybe less same-sex marriages. But this is still a benefit, and thus it still belongs in my list.\n \n \nYou assume that the majority want gays to enjoy those same benefits. That's a big assumption.\n\n \n I assume nothing of the sort. That statement only relies on that fact that if same-sex couples were allowed to marry, the marriage rights of opposite-sex couples would be unaffected and would remain completely intact.\n \n \nBy exclusive, I meant monogomous. Surely you aren't going to argue that promiscuity is a benefit to society? ;)\n\n \n Ah, well that statement does make more sense after rereading what you wrote here. I must first point out that I see no benefits in promoting male/female monogamy over monogamy in general. That could be extended even to say that I don't think promoting specifically male/female monogamy is a good thing because it implies that same-sex monogamy is not a good thing. I do not see any reason to belive that one form of monogamy is better than another.\n \n It primarily sounds like you were trying to say that gays are promiscuous. Well, I think that's a complete myth, and that's all there is to it. As evidence, I can present only my own experiences and give you my word that they are the truth. Due to a variety of organizations and clubs that I am a part of, I am familiar with the dating experiences of no less than twenty-five gays and bisexuals. Of those, the one who has dated the most people has dated only three people in the same year. The average number of dates per year in that group is probably less than one. Not a single one of those people has ever cheated or dated more than one person at the same time as far as I am aware. Looking at my heterosexual friends, I know several who have cheated on their girlfriends, and some even choose to engage in sexual activities with girls they've never met before in rooms with other people in them. It is clear to me which group is more promiscuous, though you have only my word to take on the subject. I don't mean to imply that there are no promiscuous homosexuals nor do I mean to imply that my heterosexual friends are representative of heterosexuals as a whole, but I do mean to imply that based on my experiences, there has got to be very significant numbers of homosexuals who are not promiscuous and to whom a your statement above cannot apply. I suspect I may even be describing the vast majority of homosexuals and bisexuals, but I do not have evidence to show this for certain.\n \n Also, I should say that even if same-sex couples were very promicuous (which again I do not think is true), allowing them to marry would certainly not make them more promiscuous, it would only reduce that promiscuity, and it would thus be acceptable to include reduced promiscuity on my list of benefits of same-sex marriage.\n \n \nI'm not familiar with any religion that promotes gay marriage. Enlighten me.\n\n \n I do not know of any religion that promotes same-sex marriage as something better than opposite-sex marriage, but there are plenty of religions that accept same-sex marriage as equal to opposite-sex marriage. These include: Buddhism, Secular Humanism, Unitarian Universalism, and Liberal Quakers to name a few. There are also countless branches of Christianity that accept it, such as Liberal Christian Protestant. I should also mention that many people do not associate themselves with a specific religion, but they do believe in a higher power and do hold marriage in high esteem. Do not make the mistake of thinking that most gays or bisexuals are atheists. Most are not (though I don't see anything wrong with atheism).\n \n \nHomosexuality is deviant in the sense that it isn't \"the norm\". That doesn't mean that it can't have benefits that outweigh its 'abnormal\" nature. I'm a very strong advocate for kids and I believe that any loving couple is better than a single parent home or similar.\n\n \n You mentioned here that same-sex marriage may have benefits which outweigh its \"abnormal\" nature. I must point out that even if we consider it abnormal, there is no reason to suggest that abnormal is somehow bad. In a free and equal society, abnormal deserves all the rights and privleges thet normal receives. Any benefits that exist in allowing same-sex marriage aren't being weighed down by abnormality.\n \n [QUOTE]The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice. We, as a society, preach equality in principle, but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives. As I mentioned above, the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality. Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily. For example, I am considered, by my employer, to be an HCI (highly compensated individual). As a result, I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get. Is that fair? I guess as I get older, I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but don't exist in practice.[QUOTE]\n \n Well, I won't argue that we will never be truly equal, and I won't argue that equality is the answer to everything, but I will argue that equality is worth striving for and that equality does exist in practice, it is just so ingrained into our mindset that we forget it is there. Compare US law to the laws of Europe before the revolution. In Europe there existed classes of nobles with extra rights under the law as well as kings and royalty with even more rights. As you went higher up in class, you'd get more and more political power. In America, we all have one vote. We all have an equal ability to participate in government. It is true that we use that vote to choose someone to make decisions for us in the government, but our ability to participate in government set a new precedent in equality. Consider even slaves or women's rights. These are cases where equality won out not just in theory but in practice. I will admit that we cannot simply just make everyone equal in every way, but we do our best to give them equal rights and equal represenation. In the case of same-sex marriage, I can think of no reason why we should not extend the same rights that opposite-sex couples have to same-sex couples (and plenty of reasons why we should).\n \n \nInteresting. What you call a fine for non-compliance, I call a benefit FOR compliance. There are lots of examples of laws designed to promote social changes. Tax codes that favor married couples is but one example. Another would be IRAs. Uncle Sam rewards people for saving money by deferring taxes on that money. It rewards home owners with deductions for mortgage interest. I don't see rewarding hetero marriage as being any different. The government is promoting hetero marriage.\n\n \n Well, I do understand that you call it a benefit for compliance, but my argument was that a benefit for compliance is the same thing as a fine for non-compliance and that in reality, the government is simply promoting one lifestyle over another. That is equivalent to destroying freedom. I do understand that the government rewards people for taking certain actions. IRA's are an example, yes, promoting investment in an IRA does destroy freedom in a sense. But there is at least a debatable reason behind the government using taxpayer money to reward IRA investers. The government wants people to have money in their old age so that they will be happier in the long run. But when the government is promoting heterosexual marriage, it isn't because promoting heterosexual marriage over homosexual marriage is a good thing, and it isn't because heterosexual couples deserve more money or more benefits than same-sex couples. It is because the majority is willing to use religious beliefs as a reason to give themselves more benefits under the law, as a reason to hurt others while benefiting themselves, as a reason to promote their own religoius beliefs over someone else's.\n \n \nI'd like to see freedom and equality myself. I'd like to see Uncle Sam get out of the business of social engineering, restricting my personal freedom and enslaving my children and grandchildren with ever-growing debt. maybe gays and Conservatives should join forces and bring about changes that will benefit all of us and make us all happy.\n\n \n Well, many argue that pro gay rights is a conservative. They say that conservatives favor government staying out of people's lives and not dictating the way that people should live. They argue that conservative people are using religion, not conservative principle to stand against gay rights. I don't know if that is true; I do know that whether conservative, liberal, both, or neither, I cannot find a way to call myself a good person if I do not support gay rights.",

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that on net, those impacts would improve the budget's bottom line   to a small extent: by less than $1 billion in each of the next 10 years  (CBO's usual estimating period).

You guys are going backwards.\n\n \n Years ago people just like you said the same things about so many advances...\"IT COULDN\"T BE DONE\" but it has been done and will not be undone..walking on the moon.......women voting......Blacks as legislators.....the end of slavery.......palm pilots......You would be surprised what we as a society are capable of doing. Attempts in mass to pass a state ammendment have little support in the legislature and will not pass both houses as need. It may pass in the house, but it will not pass the senate. And then it needs to go to a vote by the people.\n \n \n And everyone knows you take one step backwards to go two steps foward........\n \n You just need to admit you do not wish gay people happiness, you want them celebant christians back in their closets. You have made that clear in your collective posts. I am sure others here will agree you are no friend of the gay community.",

The job of the courts as listed in the Constitution is specifically to overrule any bill passed by the legislature that violates the rights of the people presented in the Constitution. Should the courts rule that the defense of marriage act is invalid, they would be doing precisely that which they were designed to do.\n \n If there is something I am missing, let me know, but the job of the courts is to judge the laws passed by the legislature to assure that they are not in violation of the Constitution.

I think that is part of the reason that I DO hope to see gay people moving out of a life of perverison. Why is it that you cannot accept that people have concerns about this issue of homosexuality? That doesn't make them a bigot.\n\n \n Well, the definition of homophobia is under question here. Can the term be applied to people who think that homosexuality is somehow immoral and wrong? If so, then you are homophobic because you believe those things. I do believe most gay rights supporters use it in that fashion because they believe that thinking homosexuality is immoral or wrong results from an unfounded fear that homosexuality is wrong. Your definition of homophobia probably means something different, which is the result of the confusion.\n \n \nSure I am. That's why I am for civil rights for everyone and always have been--but homosexuality and gay marriage isn't a civil right. This is a non-related issue.\n\n \n Well, homosexuality is without a doubt a civil right. I'd say marriage also qualifies as a civil right. Now, we don't want to give every civil right to everyone; I mean, murder is also a right, isn't it? But murder takes away the rights of those it hurts. We restrict the right to murder to protect the rights of those who are hurt by murder. I mean, no one supports all civil rights.\n \n When you say that homosexuality is not a civil right, I think you may have misspoken. Homosexuality is both a civil right and it is a legal one. Same-sex marriage is a civil right too, and though you may not realize it, it is legal to have a same-sex marriage, they are just not recognized by the government. The difference same-sex marriages are religious (that is, the same-sex couple's religion recognizes that marriage); the government does not recognize the marriage.\n \n So to be technical, it is not the right to marriage we are talking about, it is a fight over the recognition of marriage. The civil rights part comes about because the benefits provided by marriage and the idea of government-recognized marriage can both be considered civil rights.\n \n \nHey Joe, you are a bigot. (There, I too can say it where it doesn't apply.) If I were a bigot, don't you think I'd be FOR discrimination? I'm not.\n\n \n In a sense, you are for discrimination. By restricting the rights of same-sex couples, you are discriminating against them. By restricting the rights of murderers, you are discriminating against them. It isn't always wrong to discriminate, but you have to do it with a reason. If you have good reason to discriminate against same-sex couples, you aren't a bigot. If you don't, then you are a bigot. So (no offense intended here) technically this whole debate is over whether or not you're a bigot! Strange way of looking at things, isn't it? In truth, both sides are implying that the other is morally wrong, not in general but on this one issue. Though I think you're right in saying that just calling you a bigot isn't accomplishing anything.",

   "This is not true. A bill passed by the legislature cannot overrule the Constitution of the United States. The job of the courts as listed in the Constitution is specifically to overrule any bill passed by the legislature that violates the rights of the people presented in the Constitution. Should the courts rule that the defense of marriage act is invalid, they would be doing precisely that which they were designed to do.\n\n Perhaps I was unclear in my response. The DoMA is the law of the land until it is ruled unconstitutional by SCOTUS. I'm guessing that the law's writers anticipated, or were acting in response to, an attempt to apply the \"full faith and credit clause\" of the 14th to gay marriage as a legal maneuver around the will of the states not wanting gay marriage forced down their throats.\n It may, ultimately, be found unconstitutional. \n \n\n If there is something I am missing, let me know, but the job of the courts is to judge the laws passed by the legislature to assure that they are not in violation of the Constitution. I see no possibility that the Defense of Marriage Act could overrule the 14th Ammendment. That is not to say that a new ammendment could not be passed which overrules the 14th Ammendment, however I feel that it would need to specifically state that the 14th Ammendment does not apply in the situation of marriage or else there would be a contradiction in the Constitution which the courts would have to sort out.\n\n As I stated above, DoMA is the law of the land until it is ruled unconstitutional. SCOTUS has several options if the case is brought to them, not all of which I'm familiar with, but, they can rule that the 14th doesn't apply, that they don't have jurisdiction, that the issue is too volitile for them to rule on (which they've done in the past), that DoMA is unconstitutional, etc.,\n \n\n Regardless of the legal status of same-sex marriage, I hope that the logic I've used in my latest long post has helped you to understand why I think same-sex marriage is morally correct and opposing it is not.\n\n \n I do understand your point better now, but I'm not convinced that it's the morally correct thing to do. Up until now, I've argued the economic impact of gay marriage and not the moral one. I'm reasonably satisfied that the economic costs that I anticipated as a result of legalizing gay marriage probably aren't an issue, but we haven't discussed the moral and health concerns that I have.\n Having conceded that the economical impact would be minimal, maybe we can move on to the non-economic issues next.",

I think each person's individual morals are as unique as the individual themselves and are based on their personal beliefs. Many of these personal beliefs are based on the religious values of the individual (but religion has it's own forum here). What one person may consider immoral, an other individual may not. Examples might include sale / consumption of alcohol and gambling as a simplistic starting point. At various times within the history of the USA, both have been tolerated. At other times they have been made illegal. There was even a constitutional ammendment regarding alcohol which was later repealed.

That is left up to the individual.\n \n I personally believe that each individual is entitled to practice their moral values as long as in doing so, they cause no harm to another.\n \n I think that most people who oppose same-sex marriage do so on the basis of their personal belief in what is or is not moral. I have no objection to anyone believing that homossexuality and / or same-sex marriage is immoral. What I object to is their imposition of their moral standards upon me when no one forces them to do either and it in no way harms them. Yet their imposition of their moral standards upon me DOES do ME harm! I am denied the same legal rights and benefits with the one I love and am personally committed to, that they enjoy.\n \n I would ask: which is more \"moral\"; to accept that others may have moral standards and values different than mine, respect their right to believe as they choose, and act according to their morality as long as they harm no one; or to deny others the right to their moral standards and values even though they do me nor any other individual harm?\n \n \n \"Health\" concerns:\n \n I assume here you are refering to sexually transmitted diseases (STD's). While AIDS is transmitted by means other than sexual contact also, I am willing to include it in this discussion.\n \n May we agree that STD's are spread by individuals having multiple sex partners; becoming infected by one sex partner and passing that infection on to another sex partner? In other words; \"promiscuity\"?\n \n That promiscuity exist in both the gay and straight societies is a fact. I will even admit that promiscuity is more prevelant among gays than in the straight society as a whole. But is that really comparing apples to apples? What if one compared promiscuity among single gay individuals and single heterosexual individuals? I think they might both be higher than in comparson to committed couples of either sexual orientation. I have searched the Internet several times for a comparitive study of promiscuity among single gay to single straights and have been unable to find any. The only study I have been able to find is one conducted in Scandanavia by a doctor of a small (<30) sample of homosexual AIDS patients in committed relationships. Her conclusion was that homosexuals in committed relationships are more likely to be promiscuios than straight people in committed relationships. Having accumulated over 15 hours of college credit in statistics to gain my Bachelors degree, I find her conclusion somewhat flawed. If one assumes that AIDS is spread by promiscuity, then her sample was biased in that it only looked at homosexuals with AIDS in committed relationships, and notat all at any all homosexuals in committed relationships that did not have AIDS. Yet she mistakenly included all gays in committed relationships in her conclusion. She also failed to determine if the AIDS infection occured before or after the individual entered into a committed relationship (It is known that AIDS can remain dormant in a person for years). (As an aside; I was in a committed relationship with a person who was infected with AIDS before we met. He died in 1992. I was tested regularly every six months for 8 years, and remain AIDS free.)\n \n \n Be that as it may, can we agreed that a decrease in promiscuity would lead to a decrease in STD's? Can we agree that promiscuity is less prevelant in committed couples (gay or straight) than in single individuals? If so, then from the issue of better health, would it not behove us to promote committed relationships (ie: marriage; gay or straight)? \n You have gained a measure of my respect.

   "Here are some of the \"moral concerns\" that I've heard expressed. I don't necessarily subscribe to them, but I'm laying them on the table for discussion.\n\n \n Each of these issues has been debated on this forum time after time after time. I will therefore try to be brief.\n \n \n1. Legalizing gay marriage will promote homosexuality, which is an unnatural condition.\n\n \n I can see no basis for this assumption. It may prompt more homosexuals to \"come out of the closet\", but would have no affect whatsoever on the actual number of homosexuals. \n \n As to whether homosexuality is natural or not, I and all homosexual people that I know believe it is natural, for us. This view is shared by the positions of the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychiatric Association to name a few. The only people I know of that view it as \"unnatural\" are heterosexuals, and not all of them. And for those heterosexuals who believe it is unnatural, yes, it is unnatural...... for them. While it has yet to be definitively proven one way or the other, the preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that it IS natural.\n \n \n2. Legalizing gay marriage will corrupt straight children\n\n \n I fail to see how recognition of a loving commitment between two consenting adults would corrupt any child. Where is the connection?\n \n \n3. It will increase the number of pedophiles \n\n \n Again, I fail to see a connection between a loving commitment between two consenting adults and pedophilia. If this logic were true, would not heterosexual marriage also lead to an increased number of pedophiles?\n \n \n4. It is anti-Christian and America is predominantly a Christian society\n\n \n If this were true, then by logical extension, we should not allow any non-Christian marriages; Jewish, Muslim, Buddhists, Hindu............... Also keep in mind that, even if the USA is a predominately Christian society, the government of the USA is supposed to be non-religious. What about the existing Christian denominations that already recognize same-sex marriage? But again, this is not a religious forum.\n \n \n5. It will weaken the institution of marriage\n\n \n I fail to see how recognizing loving commitments between two consenting adults would weaken the institution of marriage. If anything, I believe it would strengthen it. I do, however, understand that some heterosexuals would feel that they would no longer enjoy what they perceive as a special, elite status in society.\n \n \n1. AIDS is spread predominantly through homosexuals and legalizing gay marriage would lead to an increase in homosexuals and therefore AIDS\n\n \n Homosexual contact is no longer the predominate means of AIDS infections. As I discussed in my pervious posting above, recognition of gay marriage should lead to less promiscuity and less AIDS.\n \n \n2. STDs. There is a greater incidence of STDs from gay transmission \n\n \n This may or may not be true. However, as discussed in my previous post, promoting committed relationships should reduce promiscuity and therefore all forms of STD's.\n \n \n3. Lifespan. Gays die at an earlier age than straights, so we should be discouraging homosexuality as we do smoking \n\n \n I honestly have never heard of that one before. I would be interested in knowing the cause, if it is, in fact, true. But I fail to see how an individuals lifespan should be a criteria for marriage. I would also point out that, while smoking may be detrimental to ones health, it is not illegal, and the government spends millions of dollars per year subsidizing tobacco farmers.",

   "There's been very little reference made to children in this entire thread, and it's probably the heart of the matter in forming the anti-gay-marriage opinions of the majority.\n\n \n If you'll look back, quite a few pro-gay posters mention kids frequently. One of the greatest injustices in banning same-sex marriage is that it leaves gay families very vulnerable if one parent gets sick or dies. If that parent is the birth or legal adoptive parent, the survivor often has no legal rights and responsibilities to the children. THAT is anti-family.\n \n \nIf gay marriage is legalized, the adoption process will have to be made perfectly identical for gays and straights. Gay people will seek to adopt as many kids as possible, and will raise them in a way to steer them towards being gay. They will encourage them to act gay in school,\n\n \n Yeah, gay people already have all that experience in how one's parents can determine one's sexual orientation... Geez, what a nitwit idea.\n \n \nDo you have any doubt that there would be more conflict in schools with the legalization of gay adoptions?\n\n \n Do you live in Florida? That's the only state where adoption by gay people is illegal. Not incoincidentally, it also has thousands of kids waiting for homes. THAT is anti-children.",

   "Each of these issues has been debated on this forum time after time after time. I will therefore try to be brief.\n\n Yes, it has, but it usually degrades into a \"micturating contest\" and I don't want to see this thread degrade into watersports. \n \n \n\n I can see no basis for this assumption. It may prompt more homosexuals to \"come out of the closet\", but would have no affect whatsoever on the actual number of homosexuals. \n\n \n So. you don't subscribe to the \"recruitment theory\"? http://www.learntoquestion.com/class/log/archives/000501.html \n \n\n As to whether homosexuality is natural or not, I and all homosexual people that I know believe it is natural, for us. This view is shared by the positions of the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychiatric Association to name a few. The only people I know of that view it as \"unnatural\" are heterosexuals, and not all of them. And for those heterosexuals who believe it is unnatural, yes, it is unnatural...... for them. While it has yet to be definitively proven one way or the other, the preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that it IS natural.\n\n \n I'm not convinced that homosexuality is genetic. While I think that there may be a slight predisposition,I think it's predominantly environmental, which does affect my opinion about gay marriage as you can probably already guess. I would like to hear more about why you think it's not a learned behavior.\n \n\n I fail to see how recognition of a loving commitment between two consenting adults would corrupt any child. Where is the connection?\n\n I'm going to have to plead complete ignorance on this one. Do gay men teach their male kids to be sensitive pantywaistes, NASCAR fans or somewhere in between? I do believe that a stable masculine father figure is important for both young boys and girls. Without parental role models to emulate, I think that kids grow up conflicted about gender roles. For example, in hetero relationships, the father is usually the partner that teaches about risk-taking, independence, work ethics and the need to be tough in certain situations. The mother is usually the one who teaches nurturing, empathy, respect for others and the more \"'refined\" people skills. \n Do gay partners teach the same balance of skills or do their children all turn out to be interior decorators? (OK, bad joke)\n \n \n\n Again, I fail to see a connection between a loving commitment between two consenting adults and pedophilia. If this logic were true, would not heterosexual marriage also lead to an increased number of pedophiles?\n\n I believe that it's a common belief that many homosexuals are pedophiles. I don't happen to subscribe to that belief, but I thought I'd add it to the list for comment.\n More tomorrow......",

   "Thank you for laying out the basis for the next part of the debate. Unlike the economics of gay marriage, the moral repercussions aren't as easily quantified.\n Here are some of the \"moral concerns\" that I've heard expressed. I don't necessarily subscribe to them, but I'm laying them on the table for discussion.\n \n 1. Legalizing gay marriage will promote homosexuality, which is an unnatural condition\n 2. Legalizing gay marriage will corrupt straight children\n 3. It will increase the number of pedophiles\n 4. It is anti-Christian and America is predominantly a Christian society\n 5. It will weaken the institution of marriage\n \n We can start with these and add or subtract as we see fit.\n\n \n I'll keep in mind that you aren't sure about these, and it's good that you brought them up because they deserve to be discussed. I see what I can do:\n \n 1. Regarding how natural homosexuality is, I do not think it important. I will say something on it anyhow, as I like to write on this topic. the most common beliefs of the causes of homosexuality are genetics and upbringing. I don't see any reason to think these things unnatural. Only if you believe homomsexuality is caused by a person willingly choosing to go against his nature could it be called unnatural. Beyond that, there appear to be adequate sexual means for members of the same-sex to engage in, and it seems to be possible to develop the emotional tie of love between members of the same sex. This seems natural enough to me.\n \n Regardless, there isn't really any reason to prohibit unnatural behavior. I'd definitely say that living in buildings, resisting the urge to cause violence, eating canned food, living monogomously, wearing clothing, mass production, telling the truth, posting on these forums, and billions of other things we do every day are unnatural. I wouldn't agree with restricting things that aren't natural, that's certain.\n \n Oh, one more thing: legalizing same-sex marriage doesn't really promote homosexuality. Let me make a comparison: By legalizing the construction of Muslim churches, am I promoting the Muslim religion? Well, no I'm not. I'm simply giving the Muslim religion the same rights that the other religions have. This does not suggest that anyone should become Muslim, it just continues to allow everyone to choose what they please while still enjoying the same rights. The same is true of same-sex marriage.\n \n Banning the construction of Muslim churches, on the other hand, is a government signal that the Muslim religion is not acceptable. Even if the government does not take away the freedom of the people to believe in the Muslim religion, it has taken away some of the benefits provided to people over another religion. It has still limited freedom and it still stands against the Muslim religion. What I mean is, permitting same-sex marriage does not promote homosexuality, it is restricting same-sex marriage that attacks homosexuality, in a sense.\n \n 2. Well, it would be very difficult, I think, to argue that one will become attracted to members of the same-sex simply because he or she is raised by someone who is attracted to the same-sex. But just to prove my point, let's assume that every child raised by a gay person will become gay. This fact in itself is not a harm at all. Only by assuming that homosexuality is somehow bad can we say that children being raised to become homosexual is bad. Now, I admit that many have religious values which claim that homosexuality is a sin, but those people retain the right to raise their children with that value. Those parents have the right to burn the idea that homosexuality is a sin into the minds of their child until that child could not possibly be homosexual. Those parents have the right to corrupt gay children. Or put in a different light, parents always have the right to raise their children as they please. Now, I would argue against that if those children were raised in such a manner that caused them to harm people, but again, we have to assume that homosexuality harms people for that to apply.\n \n Now, being familiar with the mindset and ideals of many homosexuals, I find it likely that the most a same-sex couple will do is keep their children open to the idea that it is okay to be homosexual. This is hardly corruption of a straight child and would change the sexuality of very few children.\n \n 3. Now, I think, or hope, this is one of the points you don't necessarily agree with. Just in case it isn't, let me explain my side of it. There is a very big difference between someone who is attracted to and falls in love with someone of the same sex and someone who is attracted to children of the same sex. Furthermore, there is yet another difference between someone who is attracted to children of the same sex and someone who chooses to molest a child. Those same-sex couples who would be given the right to marry, they are not the same group of people who chooses to molest children any more than you fall into the group of people who choose to molest children of the opposite sex. To suggest that they are somehow related is just as insulting.\n \n If we want to be specific, perhaps we can break down adult sexual attraction into three categories under the law: heterosexuality, homosexuality, and pedophilia. Most people are heterosexual, far less people are homosexual, and the smallest group, pedophiles. In this breakdown, heterosexual and homosexuals describe adults who are attracted to other adults. I place the smallest group, pedophiles, in a single category because right now they are treated as such under the law; this group would include any adults who are attracted to minors. Of course any one person can fall into none, one, or more categories of sexual attraction here. Breaking down pedophila, we really have two groups, those who are attracted to children of the same sex, and those who are attracted to children of the opposite sex. Some, but probably very few, pedophiles are also child molesters.\n \n Looking at it this way, I hope it becomes more apparent that same-sex marriage brings no new rights and no new benefits to someone for being a pedophile. Same-sex marriage does not encourage people do move into the pedophile group; that group still has no sexual or marriage rights under the law. I will further argue that same-sex marriage discourages pedophilia. This is because it encourages people to move into the homosexuality category. That means that anyone who may have been torn between homosexuality and pedophilia will now have incentive to act on their homosexual instincts, not their pedophile instincts (and I do not mean to imply that there are very many of these people; I suspect that the vast majority of child molesters are not attracted to adults, which is why they feel forced to satisfy their sexual urges any way they can).\n \n 4. Anti-Christian is the wrong word to use here. Anti-Christian implies that it attacks Christianity in some way, that it takes rights away from Christians, or that it discourages Christianity. These things are not true. Same-sex marriage attacks Christianity no more than allowing one to build a Muslim church does; in fact, it attacks Christianity far less so. Both are expressions of a different belief system, but a Muslim church opens the doors for the community to come worship a faith that opposes the idea of Christianity. Same-sex marriage, on the other hand, is a private institution between two people, and it welcomes Christianity. I would not be surpised if more than half of homosexuals are Christian, though this may be because I have visited many Christian churches accepting of homosexuals in areas with large populations of homosexual people.\n \n I do understand that allowing same-sex marriage is an activity that most Christians disagree with, but it seems rather arbitrary to take away the rights of same-sex couples for only this reason when we allow so much other religious freedom. For example, eight of the activities which the ten commandments prohibit are completely legal. Look at number 1! \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" Holy ****! It is no secret that the one unforgivable sin in Christianity is believing in another God. It is no secret that the only way to heaven is through Jesus.\n \n But we do not force people to obey the ten commandments, and we do not force people to be Christian. We do not punish people for believing in other religions, and we do not take away the benefits of those who believe something different than we do because our country prides itself on the freedom of religion. That freedom, along with many others was a freedom our forefathers founded this country on. Jefferson himself wanted it noted that he authored the Act for Religious Freedom on his tombstone, and the text of the document stand opposite the text of the Declaration of Independence in the Jefferson Memorial. So we do not take away the rights of those simply because they believe differently, except for one issue: same-sex marriage. I think religious freedom was worth fighting for in Jefferson's days, and it is worth fighting for today, though we may choose words over guns to do our fighting.\n \n 5. As far as I can tell, the institution of marriage will remain completely unchanged for opposite-sex couples and all future opposite-sex couples to come. That institution stands firm and no one is asking to change it or weaken it in any way. But we are asking for a new institution; an add-on to this institution that will allow more people to engage in it. It will stop marriage from being some exclusive club that only the chosen few can get into and will allow marriage to benefit as many families as it can. There is no weakening going on here except by those who wish to restrict or limit marriage.\n \n \nAgain, thank you for setting the framework for further debate. Here are some of the health concerns expressed.\n 1. AIDS is spread predominantly through homosexuals and legalizing gay marriage would lead to an increase in homosexuals and therefore AIDS\n 2. STDs. There is a greater incidence of STDs from gay transmission\n 3. Lifespan. Gays die at an earlier age than straights, so we should be discouraging homosexuality as we do smoking \n I'll have to leave it here for now, but will finish later this evening.\n\n \n Health concerns are an important topic, for both you and homosexual families, I'm sure. Let me address them as best I can:\n \n 1. In many places in the world, such as the United Kingdom and Scotland, AIDS is now more commonly spread through heterosexual activity than homosexual activity. If I remember correctly, homosexual activity in the US accounted for 51% of new AIDS cases in the US in 2003; I've no idea how 2004 fared. There's also plenty of speculation that gays are more likely to be tested for and report cases of HIV infection than heterosexuals due to increased awareness programs targeted at gays in the United States.\n \n Anyhow, there are two primary ways AIDS spreads: unprotected sexual promiscuity and sharing needles during drug use. So to figure out whether the spread of AIDS will increase if same-sex marriage is legalized, we must consider whether promiscuity or drug use will increase. Because homosexual promiscuity is more likely to spread AIDS, I would even give credit to the idea that the spread of AIDS would increase if it could be shown that heterosexual promiscuity might change to homosexual promiscuity should same-sex marriage be legalized. But on the contrary, I intend to show that not only would same-sex marriage not cause more homosexual promiscuity, it would actually decrease the spread of AIDS. Allow me to explain:\n \n First of all, let us examine the possibility that legalizing same-sex marriage could increase the number of homosexuals. I grant you that it might, but what type of people might become homosexual? Do you think that the most sexually promicuous heterosexuals will see same-sex marriage legalized and suddenly say, \"Woah, I'm gay now.\" Of course they will not. Those people who are most sexually promiscuous are likely very certain of their sexuality and legalizing same-sex marriage will not change that. So who might become homosexual? Not the average heterosexual, no doubt. It could only be those people who are uncertain of their sexuality right now; it could only be those people who might suspect themselves of being homosexual today, but deny it because of society's lack of acceptance. It could only be those to whom sex is not imporantant and to whom giving up sex is worthwhile to comply to the implies rules that our current laws suggest. It can only be the non-promiscuous, and legalizing same-sex marriage will not magically change the non-promiscuous into the promiscuous; it cannot make those who practice safe sex suddenly decide not to. The spread of AIDS will not increase.\n \n So how will the spread decrease? Well, the commitment of marriage is a very mental thing. It is one thing for a man to cheat on his girlfriend, but cheating on his wife is completely different. It is one thing for a man to have multiple sex partners while single, but it is completely different to have multiple sex partners after the commitment of marriage has been made. I do not mean to imply that no one has multiple sexual partners after getting married, but I do mean that getting married can have the effect of calming down one's sexual life, of turning a promiscous person into a monogamous person. This sort of commitment could easily turn some promiscuous homosexual men into non-promiscuous ones. Not only that, but the more non-promiscuous gay people there are, the more pressure is put onto promiscuous gay people to meet the standards of other homosexuals.\n \n All-in-all, marriage will not increase promiscuity; it will do just the opposite.\n \n 2. I think the explanation above can apply to STD's in general as well.\n \n 3. This isn't true at all. What IS true is that the average gay person dies at an earlier age than a straight person. When in completely normal mental and physical health, gay people live just as long as anyone else; sexual orientation or having sex with someone of the same sex does not cause one's lifespan to shorten. The reason the average gay person has a shorter lifespan than the average straight person can be attributed to a number of factors. First, violence against gays is more common than violence against heterosexuals. I don't think this is a huge contributer, but it is worth mentioning. Second, AIDS and other STD's are more common among homosexual men. Third, depression, anxiety, heart problems, and other stress-related diseases are more common among homosexuals.\n \n Each one of those issues will become less of a problem should same-sex marriage be legalized. I spoke on AIDS and STD's above. As for violence, the community may be less likely to breed hatred against homosexuals if they do not have inferior rights under the law. Regarding depression and such, well to be honest, it is a tough life being constantly compared to child molesters, being referred to as a sinner, being afraid of what someone might do to you if they knew who you loved, and having to battle for the same rights that your neighbor has. Depression and anxiety will happen, but granting same-sex couples the same rights that the next couple has is the first step toward alleviating that. Allowing same-sex marriage will lengthen lifespans, not shorten them.\n \n Hopefully I've answered your points well enough, but I sort of feel like I've forgotten to say some imporant things which were on my mind when I started this post, so maybe I have not. If not, let me know!",

(separate schools for gays) \n \n Do you have any doubt that there would be more conflict in schools with the legalization of gay adoptions?\n\n \n This post is so strange... I mean no offense Marc, but I hesitate from wondering whether you are being sarcastic in this post or you actually believe it. I think that you do actually believe it, and because of that, I will answer it to the best of my ability.\n \n First, I should say that there has been more reference to children than you have brought up here. My posts are long, but if you have time to read through them, perhaps they would help you understand the reasons that I believe same-sex marriage will help children. For now, let me address the concerns you have raised.\n \n First, you claim that if gay marriage is legalized, then gay people will seek to adopt as many kids as possible. This is a very unique comment indeed; others here have suggested that gays would refrain from adopting and simply leech off the benefits. It appears you are on the other end of the spectrum, but that does not make your concerns any less important. I will say that there is no indication that gays would adopt as many children as possible, nor is there any indication that they would want to. Adopting many children would be a very large burden on money, and I imagine that few people would want to spend that much money on children that are not of their own genetics. Still, I would be very happy if gay couples adopted a lot of children; such a fate would be far better than ending up in an adoption facility until they are eighteen. The importance of loving parents and a loving family should not be underestimated.\n \n Of course I do it is morally to steer that child toward being gay or tell that child to act gay, and I'm certain that if you were familar with the ideals of homosexuals or were friends with any, then you would understand that you are making untrue and unfounded assumptions about how they would raise children. I might just as easily condemn all Christians for raising their children to hate homosexuals and making them scream \"evil\" any time they see the face of a harmless and morally good person. Of course I would never claim such a thing, but if I did, it would be founded upon more evidence than your claims about how homosexuals would raise their children.\n \n In truth, most homosexuals believe that one cannot control his or her sexual orientation and they cannot control who they are. Even the shortest conversations with a homosexual about gay rights should reveal this. Considering this, it seems most likely that a same-sex couple would raise their child to believe that he or she is a good person no matter what his or her sexual orientation may be and no matter how he or she may choose to act. If that same-sex couple tried to force a child to lean one way or another or to act a certain way, those parents would be violating their own set of beliefs; it does not logically follow that they would do such a thing.\n \n The only explanation that makes sense is that you believe that same-sex couples would use children as tools to disrupt schools and cause havoc. You have provided no evidence for why anyone would commit such an evil act. I will give you the benefit of the doubt when I assume that you did not mean offense to the homosexuals and bisexuals who post here, but I can guarantee that your statement was interpreted as more insulting and horrible than you realize by many people in this forum.\n \n As for whether or not I have any doubt that there will be more conflict in schools, I do have total doubt, and your post has not indicated anything different. I think that you may be assuming that homosexuals are somehow bad people who have bad intentions for their children, and this assumption is causing your arguments to invalidate themselves. Please, understand that same-sex couples are not very different than opposite-sex couples, and you need only meet some to reveal this to yourself. I wish I could show you that, but until then you must not base your arguments on the idea that homosexuals have bad intentions; those you are trying to convince already do not believe themselves to be bad people, and assuming that they are will do nothing but insult them.\n \n I hope I have not insulted you, and if I have, I apologize. But I think that this needed to be said, because if people feel they are insulted, they have the tendency to insult back. That would destroy the civility of this thread.",

Should the courts rule that the defense of marriage act is invalid, they would be doing precisely that which they were designed to do.\n \n If there is something I am missing, let me know, but the job of the courts is to judge the laws passed by the legislature to assure that they are not in violation of the Constitution. I see no possibility that the Defense of Marriage Act could overrule the 14th Ammendment. That is not to say that a new ammendment could not be passed which overrules the 14th Ammendment, however I feel that it would need to specifically state that the 14th Ammendment does not apply in the situation of marriage or else there would be a contradiction in the Constitution which the courts would have to sort out.\n \n Regardless of the legal status of same-sex marriage, I hope that the logic I've used in my latest long post has helped you to understand why I think same-sex marriage is morally correct and opposing it is not.\n\n The 14th amendment gurantees everyoen has the same rights.

How would you propose to control this early environment so your kid could be either straight or gay? \n\n \n I'll be real frank with you on this one. If one of my kids was indecisive about his/her sexuality, I would certainly attempt to steer them towards heterosexuality for a variety of reasons. First, while we reallly haven't gotten into it, there is a higher probability of a gay man dying young as a result of his lifestyle. Just as I would encourage my kids not to smoke because it could shorten their life, I'd do the same for them if they were not sure of their sexuality by attempting to steer them away from homosexuality.\n As for whether or not it's possible to switch one's sexual orientation, I believe that it happens all of the time. You may argue that a straight who turns gay later in life is just \"coming out of the closet\" or \"losing the beard\", but I think it's more complex than that.\n \n\n For most, probably somewhere in between.\n\n I find that somewhat reassuring. :) \n \n\n These roles aren't quite so defined today.

(separate schools for gays) \n \n Do you have any doubt that there would be more conflict in schools with the legalization of gay adoptions?\n\n \n This is pure homophobic speculation on your part. Gay adoption is already a reality in many states and unbiased, scientific studies done by professionals have shown no harm to the child involved.\n \n It seems that you subscribe to the homophobic fallacy that gay people are out to recruit children into homosexuality. Nothing could be further from the truth.",

   "\n I hope I have not insulted you, and if I have, I apologize. But I think that this needed to be said, because if people feel they are insulted, they have the tendency to insult back. That would destroy the civility of this thread.\n\n \n Not at all, you are by far the best pro-gay debator here. (and I don't mean that as an insult to anyone else)\n \n Those who advocate gay marriage seem to imply that once it is legalized, the entire subject will go away, that our society will be better because of it. I see it opening the door to constant conflict.\n \n It's human nature to take pride in one's life, to take oportunities to share how one lives with others. The testimonials here and all over the net show that gays are no different. Many of them have the same intent, the same innocence, as when someone describes what they do for a living to someone. I don't believe ALL of them have bad intentions, but I see a desire to further a political agenda. What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers? Increasing adoption would be a big way to do it. Many people, myself included, firmly believe that a good orphanage is a far better place for a child to be raised in than by same sex parents. I know you disagree and nothing we say can change each other's minds, but it's a fact that it will become a bigger issue if gay marriage is legalized, and there will be CONFLICT. \n \n Gay parents would tend to steer adopted children towards homosexuality because of the political agenda, the numbers increasing thing that I described above. Most Christian parents don't have the desire to encourage their children to \"hate\" homosexuals. Little kids don't naturally think about sex at all. Since straight parents have no sexual political agenda, they'd rather their kids not be exposed to it at all. They'd rather their kids thought about other things. That 2+2=4, that d-o-g spells dog, that c-a-t spells cat. Practical learning. \n \n I don't see homosexuals as having bad intentions as much as I see them having political intentions, and I don't see it stopping only with gay marriage. If I were to meet with some same sex couples I'm sure I would find them to be decent people as you describe. But it wouldn't take a very big percentage of those of them who ARE trouble makers, to cause a lot of trouble, and to recruit followers, and create enemies in the straight community. SCHOOLS would be the centers of conflict. I did notice your comments about children in your post #50, however there have been no responses to my post #47.",

   "I'll be real frank with you on this one. If one of my kids was indecisive about his/her sexuality, I would certainly attempt to steer them towards heterosexuality for a variety of reasons. First, while we reallly haven't gotten into it, there is a higher probability of a gay man dying young as a result of his lifestyle.\n\n \n There is no gay lifestyle, there are many lifestyles. There are many healthy gay lifestyles, as well as unhealthy lifestyles that gays have. It hasn't been proven that gay men will die earlier. There are so many variables which will determine one's lifespan and whether or not one has a healthy lifestyle. If you are looking at HIV/AIDS as one variable, then if you have a daughter you would steer her to be a lesbian and not straight. In the community where I have lived my entire life, tranmission of this virus is overwhelmingly heterosexual. You still have not indicated how you would control your child's sexual orientation.\n \n \nJust as I would encourage my kids not to smoke because it could shorten their life, I'd do the same for them if they were not sure of their sexuality by attempting to steer them away from homosexuality.\n\n \n There is no causal link between homosexuality and I'm guessing you mean AIDS, the way there is a causal link between smoking and lung cancer(and other cancers and diseases and shortened lifespan). That's why the medical community does not discourage homosexuality like they discourage smoking. \n \n \nAs for whether or not it's possible to switch one's sexual orientation, I believe that it happens all of the time. You may argue that a straight who turns gay later in life is just \"coming out of the closet\" or \"losing the beard\", but I think it's more complex than that.\n\n \n If you are correct, that doesn't make being gay a bad thing.\n \n \nI think that we're feeling the impact of single parenting in our inner cities. Once an inner city angry male reaches the physical size of his mother, she can no longer control him and the Lord of the Flies mentality takes over. IMO, two gay men are preferrable to that situation, for sure.\n\n \n Better economic opportunities and more social justice could help. It used to be that a family could live well off one parent's income.\n \n \nTruthfully, I don't care what profession my kids go into as long as it makes them happy.\n\n \n I'm glad to hear that.",

If the phenomenon were truly in the spirit of benevolence in general, it would stand to reason that they gays would not have waited until it became associated with gay pride to do so. Can you imagine knowing you were adopted as a form of social protest???\n \n Sort of like the social protest fad gay marriages we saw as soon as Massachusetts made it legal.

While I think that there may be a slight predisposition,I think it's predominantly environmental, which does affect my opinion about gay marriage as you can probably already guess. I would like to hear more about why you think it's not a learned behavior.\n\n \n I have already refered you to the AMA and the two APA's and their positions on this subject. I guess it depends on who one wishes to believe; respected, professional medical and mental health associations or Fred Phelps. As I said before, there is not yet a definative answer, but the preponderance of unbiased, scientific evidence suggests it is inate. \n \n \nI'm going to have to plead complete ignorance on this one. Do gay men teach their male kids to be sensitive pantywaistes, NASCAR fans or somewhere in between? I do believe that a stable masculine father figure is important for both young boys and girls. Without parental role models to emulate, I think that kids grow up conflicted about gender roles. For example, in hetero relationships, the father is usually the partner that teaches about risk-taking, independence, work ethics and the need to be tough in certain situations. The mother is usually the one who teaches nurturing, empathy, respect for others and the more \"'refined\" people skills. \n Do gay partners teach the same balance of skills or do their children all turn out to be interior decorators? (OK, bad joke)\n\n \n Again, if you will read the AMA and the two APA's positions on children raised by gay parents, you will find that the children are not recuited into homosexuality and do quite well socially.\n \n \n \nI believe that it's a common belief that many homosexuals are pedophiles. I don't happen to subscribe to that belief, but I thought I'd add it to the list for comment.\n\n \n It is a common tool of homophobic, radical straights to promote prejudice and hate.

   "We're starting to get into the area of massive missives. I'd like to reply to all of this post, but don't want it to be unreadable due to shear size, so I'll break my reply up into sections.\n \n \nI'll keep in mind that you aren't sure about these, and it's good that you brought them up because they deserve to be discussed. I see what I can do:\n \n 1. Regarding how natural homosexuality is, I do not think it important. I will say something on it anyhow, as I like to write on this topic. the most common beliefs of the causes of homosexuality are genetics and upbringing. I don't see any reason to think these things unnatural. Only if you believe homomsexuality is caused by a person willingly choosing to go against his nature could it be called unnatural. Beyond that, there appear to be adequate sexual means for members of the same-sex to engage in, and it seems to be possible to develop the emotional tie of love between members of the same sex. This seems natural enough to me.\n\n \n I don't mean to offend you with the following analogy, but it illustrates a point. To a pedophile, it is \"natural\" to want to have sex with a young child, but it is unnatural for those of us who aren't pedophiles. So, for a homosexual to say that it's \"natural\" really doesn't carry much weight with a straight person who sees pedophiles and homosexuals both as sexual deviants and, depending on one's bent, may find one or both abominable acts.\n \n \n \n Regardless, there isn't really any reason to prohibit unnatural behavior. I'd definitely say that living in buildings, resisting the urge to cause violence, eating canned food, living monogomously, wearing clothing, mass production, telling the truth, posting on these forums, and billions of other things we do every day are unnatural. I wouldn't agree with restricting things that aren't natural, that's certain.\n\n If I may, I'd like to restate your examples above in their more basic form. It is very natural to seek shelter from the elements. It is natural to fear the reprucussions of initiating violence on another. For example, a domestic housecat won't normally take on a raccoon of similar size for just that reason. It is very natural to eat.The only thing unnatural is the container that the food comes in. Wearing clothes to protect against the environment is also very natural. As for the rest, they can also be broken down in terms of basic natural acts, such as communication. But homosexual sex isn't a natural act. The only time that I've heard of homosexuality occurring in nature was under \"unnatural\" conditions, such as overcrowding.\n \n \n Oh, one more thing: legalizing same-sex marriage doesn't really promote homosexuality. Let me make a comparison: By legalizing the construction of Muslim churches, am I promoting the Muslim religion? Well, no I'm not. I'm simply giving the Muslim religion the same rights that the other religions have. This does not suggest that anyone should become Muslim, it just continues to allow everyone to choose what they please while still enjoying the same rights. The same is true of same-sex marriage.\n\n Funny that you should choose that example. I happen to live in the area with the largest population of Middle Easterners outside of the ME. Dearborn, MI has become the Muslim capital of the US primarily because Muslims are accepted, have mosques, ethnic restaurants, community centers, etc., and draw other Muslims into the community from outside of the area. They also \"recruit\" others to become Muslims by their presence, through interaction with others in the community that aren't MEers, and by encouraging those who have strayed away from Christianity. Remember, it is a Muslim's job to either convert \"infidels\" or dominate them. \n \n \n Banning the construction of Muslim churches, on the other hand, is a government signal that the Muslim religion is not acceptable. Even if the government does not take away the freedom of the people to believe in the Muslim religion, it has taken away some of the benefits provided to people over another religion. It has still limited freedom and it still stands against the Muslim religion. \n\n Agreed. Now, if the government saw the spread of Islamic Fundamentalism as a threat to our society, it would ban the construction of Fundamentalist Islamic mosques and let radical Muslims know that they weren't welcome. By preventing the building of mosques, not allowing the immigration of more radical Muslims into the US and making it tougher for Muslims to gain a foothold in the area, it could be argued that the government was attempting to prevent the spread of something that was found to be a threat to society as a whole, correct?\n \n\n What I mean is, permitting same-sex marriage does not promote homosexuality, it is restricting same-sex marriage that attacks homosexuality, in a sense.\n\n \n OK, now given the above hypothetical situation regarding radical Islam and the government's hypothetical response to it, an argument can be made that preventing gay marriage is akin to stopping the spread of Fundamentalist Islamic radicals. By preventing gay marriage, it is attempting to stop the spread of something that it has determined is detrimental to society as a whole. The battle lies in convincing John Q. Public that gays aren't the moral equivalent of radical Muslims.\n \n I'll respond to #2 in another post and the rest in individual posts as well.\n \n (Please don't take all of my statements above as representative of my personal beliefs. I am playing devil's advocate and don't necessarily buy the arguments presented.)",

   " What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers? Increasing adoption would be a big way to do it. Many people, myself included, firmly believe that a good orphanage is a far better place for a child to be raised in than by same sex parents. I know you disagree and nothing we say can change each other's minds, but it's a fact that it will become a bigger issue if gay marriage is legalized, and there will be CONFLICT.\n\n \n Are you aware that there are plenty of gay parents who are that way BIOLOGICALLY? Do you also suggest removing their parental right simply because you don't approve of who they screw?\n \n Are you actually advocating the REMOVAL of rights based on sexual orientation. What next? Job discrimination? Camps? You are the worst kind of scary. \n \n \nGay parents would tend to steer adopted children towards homosexuality because of the political agenda, the numbers increasing thing that I described above. Most Christian parents don't have the desire to encourage their children to \"hate\" homosexuals. Little kids don't naturally think about sex at all. Since straight parents have no sexual political agenda, they'd rather their kids not be exposed to it at all. They'd rather their kids thought about other things. That 2+2=4, that d-o-g spells dog, that c-a-t spells cat. Practical learning. \n\n \n Don't be speaking for THIS Christian. SEX is perfectly normal - and most kids learn early on that it feels good to touch their privates. They understand the whys just yet - but we are sexual beings. I have never understood this need to protect kids from the knowledge of sex. It perpetuates the idea that it is dirty and wrong. IT'S NOT. Kids SHOULD know about sex, know what it is, what it's for, what are the consequences of it as soon as they ask the questions (and they will and do). Keep it age approriate - but nothing bad will happen just because they know about sex.\n \n \nI don't see homosexuals as having bad intentions as much as I see them having political intentions, and I don't see it stopping only with gay marriage.\n\n \n You don't see them as anything but a stereotype.\n \n \nIf I were to meet with some same sex couples I'm sure I would find them to be decent people as you describe. But it wouldn't take a very big percentage of those of them who ARE trouble makers, to cause a lot of trouble, and to recruit followers, and create enemies in the straight community. SCHOOLS would be the centers of conflict. I did notice your comments about children in your post #50, however there have been no responses to my post #47.\n\n \n And what about those trouble making straight folks? How can I keep my kid clear of you and your brood and the hate you might instill in my son's school? I am sure if you have children they would be the God-fearing Christian sort who dissaprove of fags enough to do God's work by shoving trash into the mouth of my son for defending a gay person he loves.",

   "Not at all, you are by far the best pro-gay debator here. (and I don't mean that as an insult to anyone else)\n\n \n Thank you. There are many excellent debaters on both sides of the issue here, and being considered on the same level as some of those people is encouraging.\n \n \nThose who advocate gay marriage seem to imply that once it is legalized, the entire subject will go away, that our society will be better because of it. I see it opening the door to constant conflict.\n\n \n I think few people would disagree that our society is already in just about as much of a conflict as it could be about this issue. If same-sex marriage is legalized, there will still be conflict, but at least those people who are denied rights currently will have those rights during the conflict. Besides, there will always be conflict in a society where the people have the power to change the laws, but that conflict isn't usually a bad thing.\n \n But beyond the scope of conflict, my argument is actually that this conflict should end, and that it should end in favor of same-sex marriage. I can say with certainty that it will never end while same-sex couples still exist and while they do not have the same rights that everyone else does under the law.\n \n \nIt's human nature to take pride in one's life, to take oportunities to share how one lives with others. The testimonials here and all over the net show that gays are no different. Many of them have the same intent, the same innocence, as when someone describes what they do for a living to someone. I don't believe ALL of them have bad intentions, but I see a desire to further a political agenda. What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers? Increasing adoption would be a big way to do it. Many people, myself included, firmly believe that a good orphanage is a far better place for a child to be raised in than by same sex parents. I know you disagree and nothing we say can change each other's minds, but it's a fact that it will become a bigger issue if gay marriage is legalized, and there will be CONFLICT\n \n Gay parents would tend to steer adopted children towards homosexuality because of the political agenda, the numbers increasing thing that I described above. Most Christian parents don't have the desire to encourage their children to \"hate\" homosexuals. Little kids don't naturally think about sex at all. Since straight parents have no sexual political agenda, they'd rather their kids not be exposed to it at all. They'd rather their kids thought about other things. That 2+2=4, that d-o-g spells dog, that c-a-t spells cat. Practical learning.\n\n \n You did raise the question, \"What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers?\" I must ask that same question of you. If same-sex parents seek to expand their political agenda through children, then there is no reason to believe that opposite-sex couples would not do the same. I ask then, who has more political agendas than the stereotypical Christian? Christians tend to oppose same-sex marriage, oppose abortion, push for religion in schools and politics, support counselling before marriage, and any of a good many other political stances. These are each a political agenda. If it is reasonable to suggest that same-sex parents would impose their single agenda upon their children, it is reasonable to suppose that Christian parents would do the same, only far worse, having more agendas and all. By the same logic, those parents would teach their children about their political agendas instead of practical things, like 2+2=4, and how to spell \"dog\". By the same logic, those parents are creating conflict and should thus not be allowed to adopt.\n \n But Christian parents don't do that, do they? Despite having so many political agendas, they teach their parents practical things after all. They may teach their children that homosexuality is wrong, that abortion is wrong, or one of many other political stances, but that isn't what they think parenting is, and it isn't nearly the most important influence they intend to have on their children.\n \n I will argue that you look at gay rights debate forums and listen to gays speak about gay rights on the news, and you make the assumption that gays are only about one thing. But I could just as easily watch Christians speak about gay rights and listen to them speak on gay rights forums and assume the same about them. The truth is that boths sides are just people with countless aspects to their lives, and both sides want the best for their children.\n \n Furthermore, I wonder precisely what the agenda of same-sex parents would be after same-sex marriage is legalized. Certainly there are a few smaller gay rights issues, and they would have to fight for some time to keep it legal, but with equality, the need for a political agenda fades. There would certainly be far less conflict overall if homosexuals just gave in and accepted defeat immediately, but the same would be true of those who oppose it. In reality neither will ever happen. Remember, the argument I give suggests that homosexuality is morally correct; and it is worth fighting for that which is morally right.\n \n \nI don't see homosexuals as having bad intentions as much as I see them having political intentions, and I don't see it stopping only with gay marriage. If I were to meet with some same sex couples I'm sure I would find them to be decent people as you describe. But it wouldn't take a very big percentage of those of them who ARE trouble makers, to cause a lot of trouble, and to recruit followers, and create enemies in the straight community. SCHOOLS would be the centers of conflict. I did notice your comments about children in your post #50, however there have been no responses to my post #47.\n\n \n I think then that if it can be shown that any children of opposite-sex parents cause a conflict, then opposite-sex parents should lose their rights to raise children as well. Would you truely punish the whole for the actions of a few? It does not matter whether you would; if you claim that same-sex couples should not be allowed to raise their children to believe that homosexuality is morally right, then you must apply the same logic to those who raise their children to think that homosexuality is morally wrong. You would also have to apply that same logic to anyone on any side of a political issue, and soon, no one would have children. There are already incredible amounts of conflict over all sorts of political issues in school, same-sex marriage least of all, and this makes school a breeding ground for developing one's own opinion on the issue.\n \n Should you be worried that gay rights will not stop with same-sex marriage and that gay people will push to give themselves some kind of unequal advantage over straight people, then rest assured that I will stand with you against such inequality when it shows its face. But that is not a good reason to stand against equality now, and I do not see reason to believe that gay rights will go anywhere beyond equal.\n \n As for your comments in post #47, I have seen no civil rights or political issue classes appear in high schools. I have certainly seen those classes all over colleges, but adding classes about homosexuality and gay rights would surely be offered only as an optional replacement for current civil rights classes, not as a replacement for courses on workplace-related skills. Even if they did, considering the discussions we've had so far, I would think a good gay rights class might encourage students to learn and think in ways that they had never considered before. Finally, I've got to wonder what makes you think stopping same-sex marriage will stop these classes. Interestingly, I don't think it will.\n \n I hope you enjoyed my response! Hmm, it appears I must respond to JPSarte too.",

If by \"playing the devil's advocate\", you wish to offend, you have accomplished it. Such statements are blatently inflamitory.\n\n My intent wasn't to inflame, but rather to inform. I'm trying to portray a realistic picture of the viewpoint held by many of those that strongly oppose gay marriage and let you know what would be necessary to overcome some of those beliefs.\n \n\n Some posters, such as \"jyoshu\", will cry that I am being \"oversensative\". To them I ask; How would YOU react to being equated to a pedofile?\n\n I'd be annoyed, just like you, but if you think that I'm presenting an unrealistic impression of the battle that you have, you are grossly underestimating your opposition. My beliefs are typically logically driven, but I hear opinions voiced from other straights that'd curl your hair. As I mentioned before, you have a helluva PR battle to fight and I'm just scratching the surface on opposition viewpoints. For example, the belief that pedophiles are homosexuals and NOT that they can be heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual predators of kids, is widespread amongst straights, for example.\n \n\n You came here arguing the substantial cost of legalizing gay marriage. You were shown to be incorrect, and somewhat graciously condeded the issue.\n\n The economic arguments are easy to refute if you have the facts to do so and the person you're debating accepts that information as fact. You need to change peoples' perceptions as well and that's not an easy task. \n \n\n Then you posted an obviously satirical article about gay people recruiting heterosexuals. Whether you knew it was misinformation or not, I don't know.\n \n\n This is EXACTLY the fear that many straights have; they fear that you'll recruit their kids. I linked the satirical version of the argument because I thought it would be less offensive than the real argument.\n \n\n Now, whether they are your personal beliefs or not, you insult and offend.\n\n To be honest with you, I haven't given the concept of recruitment much thought, personally, but have heard others voice that fear. \n \n\n Did you come here to gain understanding or to inflame? Have you actually read what the AMA and the two APA's say about homosexuality? I seriously doubt it. Instead, you come here posting unfounded opinions that have been shown to be false, satarical articles that you seem to accept as truth, and insulting, inflamitory, prejudicial statements that flame the homophobic fire of hate.\n\n I've read quite a few studies and summaries of studies from authors on both sides of the issue. The one theme that keeps reappearing is that there appear to be both biological and environmental factors that affect one's sexual orientation. Here's a good summary of some of those summaries:\n http://allpsych.com/journal/homosexuality.html\n \n\n I have tried to engage in a civil debate with you and am willing to continue to try to. But I will not be a party to the spreading of insults and misinformation.\n\n I'm trying to state opinions and beliefs that I've either heard or hold, personally. The intent isn't to inflame, outrage or take shots at gays. The purpose is to debate which positions are factual and which aren't. If you're offended by some of my statements, then maybe you shouldn't respond to those that upset you. Let someone who is capable of responding in a dispassionate manner handle that rebuttal. Don't feel obligated to respond to everything that you read as I have selected only those responses that have maintained a modicum of civility to reply to.\n I'm sure that you are aware that there are many stereotypes out there regarding gays, behaviors, goals, etc., that range from accurate to the absurd, but if we don't get them out in the open for comment, how will anyone know which are which? emoticon_confused",

   "I have no problem with the fact that gay rights groups try to distance themselves from pederasty nowadays...\n\n \n \"try to\"? \"nowadays\"? Sounds like chain-yanking time again.\n \n \nbut let's at least be honest about the past.\n\n \n Yes, let's try to do that. There is a long history of what we now see as inappropriate sexual contact between adults and children. In many societies, including our own until recently, child brides were common. Today, this practice is largely frowned upon though it is still legal in far too many states (mostly red ones, I believe).\n \n As for illegal, truly pedophillic organizations, NAMBLA gets a lot of press, but there are far larger man/girl sex organizations (or generally man/child since pedophiles don't make much distinction between boys and girls). They are rarely mentioned. The larger heterosexual community takes no responsibility for \"hetero\" molesters. We'll take no responsibility for \"homo\" ones.\n \n I will take just as much responsibility for NAMBLA and sex between men and boys as you will take for the existence of heterosexual pedophilic organizations and sex between men and girls. Deal?\n \n \nBased on what I know regarding this from such articles and from what I've always heard, gay rights groups in general didn't see their movement as separate from the NAMBLA one early on. This article certainly supports that conclusion. \n\n \n I'm just going to ignore the \"not separate\" jab. You ought to be above that sort of thing... but you're not.\n \n What groups \"in general\" are you talking about? What umbrella gay organizations existed in the 70s and 80s and what were their positions on NAMBLA? Surely you must \"remember\".\n \n The article and all others like it that I have seen rely on one or two appearences of NAMBLA representatives or members at discussion meetings open to the public. MOST of these articles are actually about one particular meeting in NYC. They also rely on the very rare appearances of NAMBLA members at or in a pride parade. To take such instances as evidence of association or alliance would mean that the GOP must take responsibility for white supremacists. They don't. We won't.\n \n What you, and those on the right, conveniently ignore is that the gay rights movement was not and, to a large degree, still is not hierarchical. Especially in the early days, there was no one to \"permit\" or \"forbid\" a particular group from participating. Even in cases where there was strong opposition to someone being in a parade, for example, who was going to stop them? (I seem to recall on case where some in the crowd on the sidelines took their signs and smashed them and ran them out of the parade.)\n \n You folks also forget just how negatively society viewed gay people (largely thanks to your own groups' efforts). To many people, there was NO DIFFERENCE between gay people and other \"perverts\", so it wasn't so outlandish for gay groups to listen to a wide variety of society's outcasts or hidden groups: S&M practitioners, COYOTE, lesbian separatists, etc. Because of our own history, we were willing to consider ideas that the mainstream rejected. We knew there was nothing wrong with us. Forgive us for thinking that some other folks fell into the same class and were just misunderstood.\n \n And before you leap with an \"aha!\", remember that many of those groups are no longer considered \"perverts\" and some others have even been mainstreamed.\n \n As for NAMBLA in particular, are you so naive as to believe that they approached gay groups with the agenda of making sex with toddlers acceptable? No, their arguments to the gay community centered on issues like age of consent laws. At the time, and to this day, many states have biased age of consent laws, with one standard for heterosexual relationships and another for homosexual ones. THAT IS NOT FAIR. \n \n Making age of consent laws orientation-neutral IS a gay rights issue. I see repeated accusations on anti-gay sites and in anti-gay articles that \"gays want to lower the age of consent for man/boy sex to 12!!!!\" with all the (well founded) outrage one might associate with that idea. What they leave out is that in that case the heterosexual age of consent was already 12 and had been for a long, long time. Gay people supported making the laws EQUAL and RAISING both to a more suitable age.\n \n [Personally, I don't think any adults should have sexual relationships with any underage teens*, but if heterosexual men can date 16 year-old girls, then gay men should be able to date 16 year-old boys. (I shudder just to type it). If opposite-sex kids can play doctor with no legal consequences, then same-sex kids should face no legal penalties, either.\n \n * I'd prefer a firm distinction between adult and non-adult with sliding-scale age restrictions for non-adult cases]",

   "I would even go farther than that and note that gay adoptions have risen significantly since the gay pride movement came on the scene, so one can't help but wonder if to some degree many of these adoptions are an attempt at a form of social protest, not entirely for the sake of the child.

Can you imagine knowing you were adopted as a form of social protest???\n\n \n Extraordinary chain yanking. \n \n Does it occur to you that before \"gay pride\", it was illegal in most places for two men to live together \"that way\"? How in the world would they have even been able to adopt a child for \"selfless\" reasons?\n \n \n \nSort of like the social protest fad gay marriages we saw as soon as Massachusetts made it legal.

   "We're starting to get into the area of massive missives. I'd like to reply to all of this post, but don't want it to be unreadable due to shear size, so I'll break my reply up into sections.\n\n \n You're right, and I fear it is partially due to my long-windedness. I will try to write shorter responses to accomodate forum-reading and responding.\n \n \nI don't mean to offend you with the following analogy, but it illustrates a point. To a pedophile, it is \"natural\" to want to have sex with a young child, but it is unnatural for those of us who aren't pedophiles. So, for a homosexual to say that it's \"natural\" really doesn't carry much weight with a straight person who sees pedophiles and homosexuals both as sexual deviants and, depending on one's bent, may find one or both abominable acts.\n\n \n As a matter of fact, I too would make the claim that it is natural to be a pedophile. To be perfectly fair, I believe how natural it is to be a child molester is up for debate, but I specifically made the point later on that natural is not the same as good. I following this, I tried to make the point that natural is not the same as good, nor is there even any correlation between the two. Suggesting that pedophilia is natural furthers my point. I guess what I mean is: I have shown that homosexuality satisfies the definition of the word \"natural\". If that does not satisfy you, then perhaps there is another word you wish to use in place of natural.\n \n \nIf I may, I'd like to restate your examples above in their more basic form. It is very natural to seek shelter from the elements. It is natural to fear the reprucussions of initiating violence on another. For example, a domestic housecat won't normally take on a raccoon of similar size for just that reason. It is very natural to eat.The only thing unnatural is the container that the food comes in. Wearing clothes to protect against the environment is also very natural. As for the rest, they can also be broken down in terms of basic natural acts, such as communication. But homosexual sex isn't a natural act. The only time that I've heard of homosexuality occurring in nature was under \"unnatural\" conditions, such as overcrowding.\n\n \n If we are allowed to break things down into their basic components, then everything can be considered natural. I could just as soon break down homosexuality into its basic components of the desire to love and be loved, as well as factors of lust and call it natural. As for food, you do admit the packaging to be unnaturally wrapped. If we are assuming that which is unnatural is morally wrong, then packaging food certainly must be morally wrong. As for the food inside a can, perhaps it is not simply beans but wheat processed in a factory to become noodles shaped like various letters of the alphabet, then covered in tomato paste and injected with preservatives. And wearing clothes! The only time that I've heard of wearing clothes occurring in nature was under \"unnatural\" conditions, such as humans putting the clothes on a pet.\n \n When you said that homosexuality does only occurs in nature under \"unnatural\" conditions, I assume you meant only across animals, as there is no doubt that humans engage in it under conditions equivalent to that of heterosexuality. And since this reference to animals was implied, I think we should determine what else is unnatural using that same criteria. So is restraint natural? Do you often see animals get angry at each other but just shrug it off, or do they tend to tear each other apart? How about generosity? Do animals give generously to the other animals, or do they horde for themselves and eat the eggs of another animal if given the chance? How about government? Do we often see animals following a set of laws that their elected official has handed down to them? Do we see animals calling the actions of other animals abomination? Do we see animals worshiping God? Yes, it is true; using the same criteria that you have presented to call homosexuality unnatural, I will suggest that worshipping God is also unnatural. Even in \"unnatural\" conditions, I have never seen worshipping a higher power occur in nature. Where is the difference? What makes one morally right and one morally wrong? I issue the proposal that whether or not we classify something as natural has nothing to do with whether that thing is morally right or morally wrong.\n \n \nFunny that you should choose that example. I happen to live in the area with the largest population of Middle Easterners outside of the ME. Dearborn, MI has become the Muslim capital of the US primarily because Muslims are accepted, have mosques, ethnic restaurants, community centers, etc., and draw other Muslims into the community from outside of the area. They also \"recruit\" others to become Muslims by their presence, through interaction with others in the community that aren't MEers, and by encouraging those who have strayed away from Christianity. Remember, it is a Muslim's job to either convert \"infidels\" or dominate them.\n\n \n Well, most importantly, you have suggested that it is not the equal protection under the law that converts people to the Muslim faith, it is the presence of Muslims. Regardless, my only argument in what I wrote was that allowing same-sex marriage does not promote the homosexual lifestyle. To promote implies that it would push that lifestyle above others on the acceptance scale. In reality, it would make that lifestyle equal to all others on the acceptance scale (well, not in the minds of the people but in the law of the government).\n \n I should also mention that I attend school at the University of Michigan - Dearborn. I graduated last year with a degree in Computer Science, and I am taking some post-graduate classes before I return for even more school (Yay!). During my time there, I have befriended, grouped with for school projects, and tutored many Muslims from both the University of Michigan - Dearborn and Henry Ford Community College (which is right next door, for those of you who have never been to Dearborn). None have tried to recruit me to the Muslim faith. Now, perhaps my experience is not representative of Muslims as a whole, perhaps it is; I don't claim to know. I only meant present my experience with Muslims.\n \n \nAgreed. Now, if the government saw the spread of Islamic Fundamentalism as a threat to our society, it would ban the construction of Fundamentalist Islamic mosques and let radical Muslims know that they weren't welcome. By preventing the building of mosques, not allowing the immigration of more radical Muslims into the US and making it tougher for Muslims to gain a foothold in the area, it could be argued that the government was attempting to prevent the spread of something that was found to be a threat to society as a whole, correct?\n \n OK, now given the above hypothetical situation regarding radical Islam and the government's hypothetical response to it, an argument can be made that preventing gay marriage is akin to stopping the spread of Fundamentalist Islamic radicals. By preventing gay marriage, it is attempting to stop the spread of something that it has determined is detrimental to society as a whole.\n\n \n It could certainly be argued that the goverment intended to stop the spread of something that was found to be a threat to society as a whole, but that wouldn't make it right for the government to do so. The government or the society will claim that whatever it wants to ban is a threat to society, but that doesn't mean it actually is a threat to society. What if we weren't talking about Fundamentalist Muslims, we were talking about a religion preaching kindness and generosity. The government would be completely unjustified in taking away their rights under the law. This religion actually would not be a threat to society. This is imperative to understand when considering same-sex marriage. People can deny rights to same-sex couples, claiming that same-sex marriage is a threat to society all they want, but if they don't have any evidence to back that up, then they are still morally evil.\n \n Your statement does not list the ways that same-sex marriage is a threat to society, it simply claims that society is justified in banning that which they see as a threat. I'm claiming that they are absolutely not justified. To turn the tables, what if society saw Christianity as a threat? Would not the society be evil for taking away the rights of kind and generous Christians, then refusing to give back those rights unless the Christians went through generations of debate to prove themselves? Is the society any less evil if they call those Christians sinners and claim to love the Christian but not his actions? Is it the society any less evil if they try to keep Christians out of schools, deny Christians the right to marry, issue religious statements denouncing Christianity, cheer and celebrate when Christian rights are stripped in the nation's Constitution, and tell Christians that if they really wanted to change, they could.\n \n That society is evil, and I will not back down in saying it, just as I will not back down in saying that any society is evil which stands against a harmless belief or a harmless love. It is not up to the minority who is persecuted to prove their own worth. The society is given the power in our government, and it is the moral responsibility of that society to be certain that it does not use its power to strip away the rights and happiness of those minorities who are good and just.\n \n \nThe battle lies in convincing John Q. Public that gays aren't the moral equivalent of radical Muslims.\n\n \n That may be. But if we as a people could truly call ourselves good, it would not be.\n \n \n(Please don't take all of my statements above as representative of my personal beliefs. I am playing devil's advocate and don't necessarily buy the arguments presented.)\n\n \n Understandable. Playing Devil's Advocate helps us better understand an argument. Even if these were your beliefs, I would not hold them against you.\n \n So much for shortening my posts.",

   "Are you aware that there are plenty of gay parents who are that way BIOLOGICALLY? Do you also suggest removing their parental right simply because you don't approve of who they screw?\n \n Are you actually advocating the REMOVAL of rights based on sexual orientation. What next?

Another conclusion you jumped to. \n \n \n \n \nDon't be speaking for THIS Christian. SEX is perfectly normal - and most kids learn early on that it feels good to touch their privates. They understand the whys just yet - but we are sexual beings. I have never understood this need to protect kids from the knowledge of sex. It perpetuates the idea that it is dirty and wrong. IT'S NOT. Kids SHOULD know about sex, know what it is, what it's for, what are the consequences of it as soon as they ask the questions (and they will and do). Keep it age approriate - but nothing bad will happen just because they know about sex. \n\n \n No it perpetuates the idea that it's a PRIVATE thing. Private within a family, subject to the conditions determined by that family. Not something to be flaunted in public.

   "As for illegal, truly pedophillic organizations, NAMBLA gets a lot of press, but there are far larger man/girl sex organizations (or generally man/child since pedophiles don't make much distinction between boys and girls). They are rarely mentioned. The larger heterosexual community takes no responsibility for \"hetero\" molesters. We'll take no responsibility for \"homo\" ones.I will take just as much responsibility for NAMBLA and sex between men and boys as you will take for the existence of heterosexual pedophilic organizations and sex between men and girls. Deal?\n\n \n Well at least you are actually weighing in on something here.\n \n Unfortunately your post so far misses the point. This isn't a contest to see whether straights or gays bear more responsibility on pederasty. The issue you responded to was about the obvious link early on between gay rights (at the time) and pederasty. As the article pointed out, Stonewall was partly carried out by the youths involved in these relationships. Ironcially, as you can see from the article, NAMBLA rose in part from Stonewall as well. So in a sense, the gay rights movement and pederasty are inexplicably linked when it comes to the origins of their organizations. There is simply no way to separate the gay rights movement from the reality that it's origins lie in this. It's a black eye on the movement, but at least in recent years your movement has sought to separate itslf from it in any way possible.\n \n \nThe article and all others like it that I have seen rely on one or two appearences of NAMBLA representatives or members at discussion meetings open to the public. MOST of these articles are actually about one particular meeting in NYC. They also rely on the very rare appearances of NAMBLA members at or in a pride parade.\n\n \n Ok, that's fair enough.\n \n \nYou folks also forget just how negatively society viewed gay people (largely thanks to your own groups' efforts). To many people, there was NO DIFFERENCE between gay people and other \"perverts\", so it wasn't so outlandish for gay groups to listen to a wide variety of society's outcasts or hidden groups: S&M practitioners, COYOTE, lesbian separatists, etc.\n\n \n I would say that in many respects, society still views you all in that way. But aren't you putting the cart before the horse here? Don't you think the reason society viewed gays that way is because of what the article talked about?\n \n \nBecause of our own history, we were willing to consider ideas that the mainstream rejected. We knew there was nothing wrong with us. Forgive us for thinking that some other folks fell into the same class and were just misunderstood.\n\n \n But why didn't you draw the line somewhere? Surely in retrospect you can see that pederasty isn't exactly a benevolent movement to accept.\n \n \nGay people supported making the laws EQUAL and RAISING both to a more suitable age.\n\n \n So you are telling me that your movement pushed to have the age of consent laws raised?",

   "I think few people would disagree that our society is already in just about as much of a conflict as it could be about this issue. If same-sex marriage is legalized, there will still be conflict, but at least those people who are denied rights currently will have those rights during the conflict. Besides, there will always be conflict in a society where the people have the power to change the laws, but that conflict isn't usually a bad thing. \n\n \n When I say conflict, I'm mainly referring to brand new school curriculums that I believe would come about soon after gay marriage was legalized. The actions of school administrators don't always mirror the desires of the voting public.\n \n \nBut beyond the scope of conflict, my argument is actually that this conflict should end, and that it should end in favor of same-sex marriage. I can say with certainty that it will never end while same-sex couples still exist and while they do not have the same rights that everyone else does under the law. \n\n \n I believe one conflict would end, and a much more severe one would take it's place.\n \n \n \nYou did raise the question, \"What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers?\" I must ask that same question of you. If same-sex parents seek to expand their political agenda through children, then there is no reason to believe that opposite-sex couples would not do the same. I ask then, who has more political agendas than the stereotypical Christian? Christians tend to oppose same-sex marriage, oppose abortion, push for religion in schools and politics, support counselling before marriage, and any of a good many other political stances. \n\n \n No same sex marriage, no abortion, religion in schools and politics, - all commonplace and not controversial only a few decades ago. I don't believe majorities seek to increase their numbers, unless of course, they feel THREATENED.\n \n \n These are each a political agenda. If it is reasonable to suggest that same-sex parents would impose their single agenda upon their children, it is reasonable to suppose that Christian parents would do the same, only far worse, having more agendas and all. By the same logic, those parents would teach their children about their political agendas instead of practical things, like 2+2=4, and how to spell \"dog\". By the same logic, those parents are creating conflict and should thus not be allowed to adopt. \n\n \n You and I may have different definitions of the word \"agenda\". If something has been proven to work, I don't see a desire to keep it, to protect it from those who would destry it, as the same aggressive \"agenda\" that gay marriage is.\n \n \nBut Christian parents don't do that, do they? Despite having so many political agendas, they teach their parents practical things after all. They may teach their children that homosexuality is wrong, that abortion is wrong, or one of many other political stances, but that isn't what they think parenting is, and it isn't nearly the most important influence they intend to have on their children. \n\n \n emoticon_confused \n \n \nI will argue that you look at gay rights debate forums and listen to gays speak about gay rights on the news, and you make the assumption that gays are only about one thing. But I could just as easily watch Christians speak about gay rights and listen to them speak on gay rights forums and assume the same about them. The truth is that boths sides are just people with countless aspects to their lives, and both sides want the best for their children. \n\n \n IMO many, if not most of the pro gay posters on this forum have chips on their shoulders. I see a vengefulness that I don't see on other forums at this site.\n \n \nFurthermore, I wonder precisely what the agenda of same-sex parents would be after same-sex marriage is legalized. Certainly there are a few smaller gay rights issues, and they would have to fight for some time to keep it legal, but with equality, the need for a political agenda fades. There would certainly be far less conflict overall if homosexuals just gave in and accepted defeat immediately, but the same would be true of those who oppose it. In reality neither will ever happen. Remember, the argument I give suggests that homosexuality is morally correct; and it is worth fighting for that which is morally right. \n\n \n With the vengefulness that I refered to above, I believe the continuing agenda would be legal claims of discrimination in schools and workplaces. Remedies would mainly consist of accommodations and separations that would cost STRAIGHT taxpayers plenty of money. Now I know that makes me a homophobe. Homophobe means having an \"irrational fear\". It's recently being morphed into an offensive term to be used against anyone who opposes special rights for gays. If we check U.S. history, or world history, we see that a fear of incrementalism in politics is not irrational, it's very real. When FDR was starting social security, he claimed that it would be a voluntary program. Today's anti smoking hysteria started a few decades ago with \"no smoking on airline flights of 2 hours or less.\" A whole book could be filled with documentation of how incrementalism has caused governments and dictatorships to grow in the last 100 years.\n \n \n \n \nI think then that if it can be shown that any children of opposite-sex parents cause a conflict, then opposite-sex parents should lose their rights to raise children as well. Would you truely punish the whole for the actions of a few? It does not matter whether you would; if you claim that same-sex couples should not be allowed to raise their children to believe that homosexuality is morally right, then you must apply the same logic to those who raise their children to think that homosexuality is morally wrong. You would also have to apply that same logic to anyone on any side of a political issue, and soon, no one would have children. There are already incredible amounts of conflict over all sorts of political issues in school, same-sex marriage least of all, and this makes school a breeding ground for developing one's own opinion on the issue.\n\n \n Parents who teach their children that homosexuality is wrong are less likely to encourage their children to make it a public issue, and therefore far less likely to cause a conflict.\n \n \n \nShould you be worried that gay rights will not stop with same-sex marriage and that gay people will push to give themselves some kind of unequal advantage over straight people, then rest assured that I will stand with you against such inequality when it shows its face. \n\n \n BY THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE. Political mistakes are often impossible to reverse.\n \n \nBut that is not a good reason to stand against equality now, and I do not see reason to believe that gay rights will go anywhere beyond equal.\n \n As for your comments in post #47, I have seen no civil rights or political issue classes appear in high schools. I have certainly seen those classes all over colleges, but adding classes about homosexuality and gay rights would surely be offered only as an optional replacement for current civil rights classes, not as a replacement for courses on workplace-related skills. Even if they did, considering the discussions we've had so far, I would think a good gay rights class might encourage students to learn and think in ways that they had never considered before. Finally, I've got to wonder what makes you think stopping same-sex marriage will stop these classes. Interestingly, I don't think it will.\n\n \n I was referring almost completely to elementary schools - sorry I didn't make that more clear.\n \n \nI hope you enjoyed my response! Hmm, it appears I must respond to JPSarte too.\n\n \n I appreciate your civility!! :)",

Some people in some gay groups sought to have age of consent laws equalized. I suspect a very large majority of gay people believe that should happen. In the particular case that I mentioned, and that anti-gay folks like to flog so much, the gay people involved in the fight to equalize the age of consent law in question also supported the same position as those opposed to equalizing them: both sides wanted to raise the 12yo limit. \n \n So, yes, \"my movement\" pushed to have the age of consent law (singular, as it was just one case) raised.",

You asked \"Why would gay rights replace other education?\"\n I've asked my kids school just that question prior to them engaging in \"gay awareness month\", an activity sponsored by the NEA. here's a sampling right from the 1996 NEA list of resolutions:\n \n\n B-6. Diversity. The National Education Association believes that our diverse society enriches all individuals. Similarities and differences among races, ethnicity, color, national origin, language, geographic location, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, physical ability, size, and marital, parental, or economic status form the fabric of our society. The Association also believes that education should increase tolerance and foster an appreciation of the various qualities that pertain to people as individuals or members of a group. The Association further believes in the importance of programs and observances that accurately portray and recognize the roles, contributions, cultures, and history of these diverse groups and individuals.\n \n B-7. Racism, Sexism, and Sexual Orientation Discrimination. The National Education Association believes in the equality of all individuals. Discrimination and stereotyping based on such factors as race, gender, physical disabilities, ethnicity, and sexual orientation must be eliminated. The Association believes that plans, activities, and programs for education employees, students, parents, and the community should be developed to identify and eliminate discrimination and stereotyping in all educational settings. Such plans, activities, and programs must --\n \n 1. Increase acceptance of and sensitivity to individuals and groups in a diverse society composed of such groups as American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian and Pacific Islanders, Blacks, Hispanics, women, gays and lesbians, and people with disabilities.\n \n 2. Eliminate discrimination and stereotyping in the curriculum, textbooks, resource and instructional materials, activities, etc.\n \n 3. Foster the use of nondiscriminatory, nonracist, nonsexist and nonstereotypical language, resources, practices, and activities.\n \n 4. Eliminate institutional discrimination.\n \n 5. Integrate an accurate portrayal of the roles and contributions of all groups throughout history across the curriculum.\n \n 6. Identify how prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination have limited the roles and contributions of individuals and groups.\n \n 7. Eliminate subtle practices that favor the education of one student over another on the basis or race, ethnicity, gender, physical disabilities, or sexual orientation. \n \n The Association encourages its affiliates to develop and implement training programs on these matters. \n\n \n Now, tell me, if the NEA pushes for training programs to teach these concepts, where does the time come from? You guessed it: reading writing and arithmetic. I don't believe that it's the schools job to teach ethics, morals, behavior modification, etc., to MY kids. That's MY responsibility. That is also why many straights see homosexuality as a threat to them. It's would-be PC do-gooders that try to usurp the parental responsibilities. :xcensored \n And this applies to more than just teaching about gay awareness. We have the dumbest kids with the highest self-esteem in the world as a result of all of this touchy-feely BS social indoctrination. emoticon_mad",

   "Continuing to reply to Jaxian's missive: \n \n..... \n 2. Well, it would be very difficult, I think, to argue that one will become attracted to members of the same-sex simply because he or she is raised by someone who is attracted to the same-sex. But just to prove my point, let's assume that every child raised by a gay person will become gay. This fact in itself is not a harm at all. Only by assuming that homosexuality is somehow bad can we say that children being raised to become homosexual is bad. Now, I admit that many have religious values which claim that homosexuality is a sin, but those people retain the right to raise their children with that value. Those parents have the right to burn the idea that homosexuality is a sin into the minds of their child until that child could not possibly be homosexual. Those parents have the right to corrupt gay children. Or put in a different light, parents always have the right to raise their children as they please. Now, I would argue against that if those children were raised in such a manner that caused them to harm people, but again, we have to assume that homosexuality harms people for that to apply.\n\n Given the fact that the homosexual lifestyle has much higher risks of acquiring STDs and HIV, I would argue that encouraging homosexuality is similar to encouraging your child to smoke. Both have REAL health consequences that can lead to diseases that otherwise would be less likely to be contracted and once contracted, shorten one's life. As a parent who is very protective of his kids, if I had a gay son, I would: a. attempt to steer them away from homosexuality, b. promote abstinance, c. teach safe sex or d. pray that the kid doesn't become promiscuous.....in that order. I believe that a parent's primary function is to keep their children safe. Now if this is the point in the debate that we get into health statistics, fine. I've seen all of the CDC reports and most of the other credible studies on health statistics and I can say with some confidence that their certainly is an increased health risk in engaging in homosexual relationships. If you don't agree with these studies, either with the conclusions, methodology used, subject numbers, etc., we can take that up as a separate portion of this thread. \n \n\n Now, being familiar with the mindset and ideals of many homosexuals, I find it likely that the most a same-sex couple will do is keep their children open to the idea that it is okay to be homosexual. This is hardly corruption of a straight child and would change the sexuality of very few children.\n\n \n Do you have any data to back up your statement? the reason I ask is because I've never seen any studies done comparing the % of straight kids raised by homosexual couples and the % of homosexual kids raised by homosexuals. It would be an interesting study to see, especially since it is one of the major fears amongst straights. I think it goes back to the idea of \"recruitment\".",

It's not like we are talking about Boston and Kansas City here.\n \n \nSure there is. Rely on the true historical record.\n\n \n Very well then, if you feel the Wikipedia article was so far off-base, tell me an accurate and independent (unbiased) source and I'll be glad to check it out.\n \n \nIt strikes me that you have a black eye of your own to repair.

I'm sure there are lots of people with whom I would care, but at this point you aren't one of them. So far you've mostly just come in here and complained and tried to stir people up, ignoring the requests of a poster who spcefically asked people such as yourself to please be civil in the discussion. As JPSarte pointed out earlier, if you intentionally hit a bee's nest hard enough, don't expect not to get stung. So it's ironic you would bring up 'credibility' with anyone given your posting history here so far.\n \n \nThe reason society viewed and views gays that way is because of religious indoctrination and lies intentionally spread by hypocrits and bigots.\n\n \n I think that gay people themselves bear some of that responsibility. They know the way society views their actions in many cases. In a sense they embody counter-culturalism. Since \"gay-pride\" is now very much an enterprise that is being carried out right in the face of mainstream American culture, it shouldn't surprise anyone that culture would resist it. \n \n \nWhy didn't WHO draw the line? There is no gay organization that controls us.\n\n \n If the bulk of gay rights people at the time had put their foot down early on regarding the pederasty issues among 'the faithful', this wouldn't be a skeleton in the closet today for your movement. You didn't need a controlling organization or leader. I think we need to consider the possibility that gay rights couldn't afford to do that early on, or it might alienate too many members.\n \n \n So, yes, \"my movement\" pushed to have the age of consent law (singular, as it was just one case) raised.\n\n \n Ok, I'll concede that based on your word.",

   "3. Now, I think, or hope, this is one of the points you don't necessarily agree with. Just in case it isn't, let me explain my side of it. There is a very big difference between someone who is attracted to and falls in love with someone of the same sex and someone who is attracted to children of the same sex. Furthermore, there is yet another difference between someone who is attracted to children of the same sex and someone who chooses to molest a child. Those same-sex couples who would be given the right to marry, they are not the same group of people who chooses to molest children any more than you fall into the group of people who choose to molest children of the opposite sex. To suggest that they are somehow related is just as insulting.\n \n If we want to be specific, perhaps we can break down adult sexual attraction into three categories under the law: heterosexuality, homosexuality, and pedophilia. Most people are heterosexual, far less people are homosexual, and the smallest group, pedophiles. In this breakdown, heterosexual and homosexuals describe adults who are attracted to other adults. I place the smallest group, pedophiles, in a single category because right now they are treated as such under the law; this group would include any adults who are attracted to minors. Of course any one person can fall into none, one, or more categories of sexual attraction here. Breaking down pedophila, we really have two groups, those who are attracted to children of the same sex, and those who are attracted to children of the opposite sex. Some, but probably very few, pedophiles are also child molesters.\n \n Looking at it this way, I hope it becomes more apparent that same-sex marriage brings no new rights and no new benefits to someone for being a pedophile. Same-sex marriage does not encourage people do move into the pedophile group; that group still has no sexual or marriage rights under the law. I will further argue that same-sex marriage discourages pedophilia. This is because it encourages people to move into the homosexuality category. That means that anyone who may have been torn between homosexuality and pedophilia will now have incentive to act on their homosexual instincts, not their pedophile instincts (and I do not mean to imply that there are very many of these people; I suspect that the vast majority of child molesters are not attracted to adults, which is why they feel forced to satisfy their sexual urges any way they can).\n\n \n I've already replied on pedophilia. I know that pedophiles are just as likely to be heterosexual as homosexual. I brought it up because many straights don't know that the two are unrelated and almost Pavlovian start to talk about pedophiles whenever homosexuality is mentioned. And organizations, such as NAMBLA, as has been previously mentioned, don't help dispell the myth that pedophiles are homosexuals, exclusively.",

It would be an interesting study to see, especially since it is one of the major fears amongst straights. I think it goes back to the idea of \"recruitment\".\n\n \n \nOriginally Posted by JPSartre12\n Do gay men teach their male kids to be sensitive pantywaistes, NASCAR fans or somewhere in between? I do believe that a stable masculine father figure is important for both young boys and girls. Without parental role models to emulate, I think that kids grow up conflicted about gender roles. For example, in hetero relationships, the father is usually the partner that teaches about risk-taking, independence, work ethics and the need to be tough in certain situations. The mother is usually the one who teaches nurturing, empathy, respect for others and the more \"'refined\" people skills. \n Do gay partners teach the same balance of skills or do their children all turn out to be interior decorators? (OK, bad joke)\n\n \n For your edification:\n \n American Psychiatric Association\n \n Gay Parenting\n \n http://www.apa.org/pi/parent.html\n \n \nSexual Identity \n Three aspects of sexual identity are considered in the research: gender identity concerns a person's self-identification as male or female; gender-role behavior concerns the extent to which a person's activities, occupations, and the like are regarded by the culture as masculine, feminine, or both; sexual orientation refers to a person's choice of sexual partners--i.e., heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual (Money & Earhardt, 1972; Stein, 1993). To examine the possibility that children in the custody of lesbian mothers or gay fathers experience disruptions of sexual identity, research relevant to each of these three major areas of concern is summarized below. \n Gender identity. In studies of children ranging in age from 5 to 14, results of projective testing and related interview procedures have revealed normal development of gender identity among children of lesbian mothers  (Green, 1978; Green, Mandel, Hotvedt, Gray, & Smith, 1986; Kirkpatrick, Smith, & Roy, 1981). More direct assessment techniques to assess gender identity have been used by Golombok, Spencer, and Rutter (1983) with the same result; all children in this study reported that they were happy with their gender, and that they had no wish to be a member of the opposite sex. There was no evidence in any of the studies of gender identity difficulties among children of lesbian mothers. No data have been reported in this area for children of gay fathers.  Gender-Role Behavior. A number of studies have examined gender-role behavior among the offspring of lesbian mothers (Golombok et al., 1983; Gottman, 1990; Green, 1978; Hoeffer, 1981; Kirkpatrick et al., 1981; Patterson, 1994a). These studies reported that such behavior among children of lesbian mothers fell within typical limits for conventional sex roles. For instance, Kirkpatrick and her colleagues (1981) found no differences between children of lesbian versus heterosexual mothers in toy preferences, activities, interests, or occupational choices. \n Rees (1979) administered the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) to 24 adolescents, half of whom had divorced lesbian and half of whom had divorced heterosexual mothers. The BSRI yields scores on masculinity and femininity as independent factors and an androgyny score from the ratio of masculinity to femininity. Children of lesbian and heterosexual mothers did not differ on masculinity or on androgyny, but children of lesbian mothers reported greater psychological femininity than did those of heterosexual mothers. This result would seem to run counter to expectations based on stereotypes of lesbians as lacking in femininity, both in their own demeanor and in their likely influences on children. \n Sex role behavior of children was also assessed by Green and his colleagues (1986). In interviews with the children, no differences between 56 children of lesbian and 48 children of heterosexual mothers were found with respect to favorite television programs, favorite television characters, or favorite games or toys. There was some indication in interviews with children themselves that the offspring of lesbian mothers had less sex-typed preferences for activities at school and in their neighborhoods than did children of heterosexual mothers. Consistent with this result, lesbian mothers were also more likely than heterosexual mothers to report that their daughters often participated in rough-and-tumble play or occasionally played with \"masculine\" toys such as trucks or guns; however, they reported no differences in these areas for sons. Lesbian mothers were no more or less likely than heterosexual mothers to report that their children often played with \"feminine\" toys such as dolls. In both family types, however, children's sex-role behavior was seen as falling within normal limits. \n In summary, the research suggests that children of lesbian mothers develop patterns of gender-role behavior that are much like those of other children. \n No data are available as yet in this area for children of gay fathers. \n Sexual Orientation. A number of investigators have also studied a third component of sexual identity: sexual orientation (Bailey, Bobrow, Wolfe, & Mikach, 1995; Bozett, 1980, 1982, 1987, 1989; Gottman, 1990; Golombok et al., 1983; Green, 1978; Huggins, 1989; Miller, 1979; Paul, 1986; Rees, 1979). In all studies, the great majority of offspring of both gay fathers and lesbian mothers described themselves as heterosexual. Taken together, the data do not suggest elevated rates of homosexuality among the offspring of lesbian or gay parents. For instance, Huggins (1989) interviewed 36 teenagers, half of whom were offspring of lesbian mothers and half of heterosexual mothers. No children of lesbian mothers identified themselves as lesbian or gay, but one child of a heterosexual mother did; this difference was not statistically significant. In a recent study, Bailey and his colleagues (1995) studied adult sons of gay fathers and found more than 90% of the sons to be heterosexual. Because the heterosexual and nonheterosexual sons did not differ in \n the length of time they had resided with their fathers, the effects of the exposure to the fathers' sexual orientation on the sons' sexual orientation must have been either very small or nonexistent. \n\n \n Note: This is NOT from \"The Onion\".",

There is no causal relationship, as there is between smoking and diseases, like I explained before. Risky sex practices of any sexual orientation increases your risk of disease.

   "I'm not convinced that homosexuality is genetic. While I think that there may be a slight predisposition,I think it's predominantly environmental, which does affect my opinion about gay marriage as you can probably already guess. I would like to hear more about why you think it's not a learned behavior.\n\n \n \n America Psychological Association\n \n http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html\n \n \nWhat Is Sexual Orientation?\n Sexual Orientation is an enduring emotional, romantic, sexual or affectional attraction to another person. It is easily distinguished from other components of sexuality including biological sex, gender identity (the psychological sense of being male or female) and the social gender role (adherence to cultural norms for feminine and masculine behavior).\n Sexual orientation exists along a continuum that ranges from exclusive homosexuality to exclusive heterosexuality and includes various forms of bisexuality. Bisexual persons can experience sexual, emotional and affectional attraction to both their own sex and the opposite sex. Persons with a homosexual orientation are sometimes referred to as gay (both men and women) or as lesbian (women only). \n Sexual orientation is different from sexual behavior because it refers to feelings and self-concept. Persons may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors. \n \n What Causes a Person To Have a Particular Sexual Orientation?  \n There are numerous theories about the origins of a person's sexual orientation; most scientists today agree that sexual orientation is most likely the result of a complex interaction of environmental, cognitive and biological factors. In most people, sexual orientation is shaped at an early age. There is also considerable recent evidence to suggest that biology, including genetic or inborn hormonal factors, play a significant role   in a person's sexuality. In summary, it is important to recognize that there are probably many reasons for a person's sexual orientation and the reasons may be different for different people. \n \n Is Sexual Orientation a Choice?  No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight.  Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed. \n \n Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation?  No. Even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, sometimes pressured by the influence of family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality  is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable. \n However, not all gay, lesbian, and bisexual people who seek assistance from a mental health professional want to change their sexual orientation. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may seek psychological help with the coming out process or for strategies to deal with prejudice, but most go into therapy for the same reasons and life issues that bring straight people to mental health professionals. \n \n What About So-Called \"Conversion Therapies\"?  \n Some therapists who undertake so-called  conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Close scrutiny of these reports however show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of the claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective which condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented. For example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported overtime as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.\n The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients. In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any social bias. \n \n Is Homosexuality a Mental Illness or Emotional Problem? \n No. Psychologists, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals agree that homosexuality is not an illness, mental disorder or an emotional problem. Over 35 years of objective, well-designed scientific research has shown that homosexuality, in and itself,is not associated with mental disorders or emotional or social problems.  Homosexuality was once thought to be a mental illness because mental health professionals and society had biased information. In the past the studies of gay, lesbian and bisexual people involved only those in therapy, thus biasing the resulting conclusions. When researchers examined data about these people who were not in therapy, the idea that homosexuality was a mental illness was quickly found to be untrue. \n In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association confirmed the importance of the new, better designed research and removed homosexuality from the official manual that lists mental and emotional disorders. Two years later, the American Psychological Association passed a resolution supporting the removal. For more than 25 years, both associations have urged all mental health professionals to help dispel the stigma of mental illness that some people still associate with homosexual orientation. \n \n Can Lesbians, Gay Men, and Bisexuals Be Good Parents?  \n Yes. Studies comparing groups of children raised by homosexual and by heterosexual parents find no developmental differences between the two groups of children in four critical areas: their intelligence, psychological adjustment, social adjustment, and popularity with friends. It is also important to realize that a parent's sexual orientation does not dictate his or her children's.  \n Another myth about homosexuality is the mistaken belief that gay men have more of a tendency than heterosexual men to sexually molest children. There is no evidence to suggest that homosexuals are more likely than heterosexuals to molest children. \n\n \n Note: This is NOT from \"The Onion\".",

In addition, between 18% and 28% of gay couples and 8% and 21% of lesbian couples have lived together 10 years or more. Factors that predict relationship satisfaction, commitment, and stability are remarkably similar for both same-sex cohabiting couples and heterosexual married couples.\n \n Do gay and lesbian adults make fit parents?  \n Gay and lesbian parents are as likely as heterosexual parents to provide healthy and supportive environments for their children. Lesbian and heterosexual women do not differ markedly either in their overall mental health or in their approaches to child rearing. Nor do lesbians' romantic and sexual relationships with other women detract from their ability to care for their children. Recent evidence suggests that gay and lesbian couples with children tend to divide child care and household responsibilities evenly and to report satisfaction with their relationship. \n \n Does parental sexual orientation affect children's development?\n \n Studies of various aspects of child development reveal few differences  among children of lesbian mothers and heterosexual parents in such areas as personality, self-concept, behavior, and sexual identity. (Only limited data are available on these dimensions for children of gay fathers.) Evidence also suggests that children of lesbian and gay parents have normal social relationships with peers and adults. Fears about children of lesbian or gay parents being sexually abused by adults, ostracized by peers, or isolated in single-sex lesbian or gay communities have received no scientific support. \n\n \n Note: This is NOT from \"The Onion\"",

   "You do, generally, if you want your spouse's employer paying for it. And the cost of private health insurance isn't trivial. It can be several thousands/year for young people and $10 thousand/year for older couples.\n\n So you are arguing against marriage benefits.\n If we didn't have any financial benefits to marriage, think of all the money\n that will be saved.\n \n \nI'm not \"married\" (pun imtended) to the term class. I could just as easily said \"new group\" or new \"category\". The key point was \"new\".\n\n What's new about the category \"married\"?\n \n \n \nI didn't go into enough detail with respect to unmarried hetero couples. Right now, most states have \"common law\" marriage statutes in which a partner of the opposite sex can lay claim to a portion of their unmarried partner's property if they've lived together for a defined period of time. Allowing gay marriage without also rewriting common law statutes discriminates against unmarried heteros living together. Without legal gay marriage, gay partners don't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner. Does that explain it better?\n\n This is an argument against commonlaw \"marriage\" not aginst gay marriage.\n \n \nIt's not a loophole if the gay partner has no legal standing. As far as the employer is concerned, the partner is a non-issue. Now, if you could prove that an employer didn't hire you because YOU were gay, that'd be a whole different ballgame.\n\n But if an employer were morally opposed to hiring gay people and the law says that he has to, this is an unfunded mandate!\n \n \nI'm not familiar with any religion that promotes gay marriage. Enlighten me.\nThe Unitarian Universalist Church.\n http://www.uua.org/news/2004/freedomtomarry/\n And the others mentioned.\n \n \nAlso some would say they view it to be a 'separate but equal' catagory, though I don't have a problem with that. It IS separate--gay couples are not straight couples.\n\n You've got no problem with Jim Crow laws? Nice.\n It IS seperate. Black people are not white people.\n \n \nHomosexuality is a bane. It is more akin to moving back into the times of slavery than moving out of it. You need to stop sugarcoating it and portraying it as something so benign. Allowing homosexual marriage is a step backwards for this country, not a step forwards like civil rights in the 60s. I was FOR civil rights in the 60s. I was always against things like segregation, but this issue is just you expecting America to give a stamp of approval on perversion in the form of marriage, by broadening what constitutes a marriage.\n\n But you said you were FOR seperate but equal.\n \n \nIf gay marriage is legalized, the adoption process will have to be made perfectly identical for gays and straights. Gay people will seek to adopt as many kids as possible, and will raise them in a way to steer them towards being gay. They will encourage them to act gay in school, and scream discrimination when straight parents and straight children take exception to it. It will be debatable if the straights have grounds to take exception to it, but there is no question that they will. It will create plenty of conflict, and further gays desire for special rights. (separate schools for gays) \n \n Do you have any doubt that there would be more conflict in schools with the legalization of gay adoptions?\n\n In a lot of states, including mine, it's totally legal for gay married couples to adopt children. I don't think there is much difference in the law between gay/straight people adopting. \n \n This is one of those things that does not affect you.\n Its already going on and you don't even know about it.\n If gay marriage were always legal, you wouldn't be upset by the thought\n because it would never even affect your life one bit.",

None of those numbers in those groups are high enough, and the facts don't show, a causal relationship. In those groups, and in all groups, any individual's level of risk will be a combination of different variables. It's not as simple as telling a man to never have sex with a man, or a poor person to never have sex. What if one is a member of one group considered \"high risk\", but also a member of another group which is not considered high risk?

   "Given the fact that the homosexual lifestyle has much higher risks of acquiring STDs and HIV, I would argue that encouraging homosexuality is similar to encouraging your child to smoke. Both have REAL health consequences that can lead to diseases that otherwise would be less likely to be contracted and once contracted, shorten one's life. \n\n \n Your smoking analogy is off base. I suppose if one must go analogy hunting, the most appropriate would be handedness. Not only do most gay people think it's a closer fit, but it also matches your concerns about health and safety. Left-handed people are at higher risk for accidents because so much of the world is made for right-handed folks. I suppose you could try to force your child to use the \"wrong\" hand with some success, but you should remember that extreme methods, including the demonization of left-handedness have been shown to cause permanent psychological damage.\n \n In any case, if you really would stick with your approach of \"encouraging\" sexuality, I assume you would encourage lesbianism in your female children, as that is a far healthier lifestyle than heterosexuality for women.\n \n \nAs a parent who is very protective of his kids, if I had a gay son, I would: a. attempt to steer them away from homosexuality, b. promote abstinance, c. teach safe sex or d. pray that the kid doesn't become promiscuous.....in that order. \n\n \n In that order, all you would do is raise a needlessly pained child.

   "Very well then, if you feel the Wikipedia article was so far off-base, tell me an accurate and independent (unbiased) source and I'll be glad to check it out.\n\n \n There are dozens, if not hundreds, of books about the history of the homosexual movement. Just looking at a list of their titles on Amazon.com or the Library of Congress should quickly dispell the silly idea that it \"shares origins\" with NAMBLA. Hint: keep an eye out for: 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, along with 1800's, turn-of-the-century, etc.\n \n \nAs JPSarte pointed out earlier, if you intentionally hit a bee's nest hard enough, don't expect not to get stung. So it's ironic you would bring up 'credibility' with anyone given your posting history here so far.\n\n \n It works both ways, you know. Yank a bee's chain enough times, and it might get mad, too (to mix metaphors).\n \n As for my intemperate posts, their tone might cause people to reject them or ignore them, but no one has questioned the veracity of anything I've said.\n \n \nI think that gay people themselves bear some of that responsibility. They know the way society views their actions in many cases. In a sense they embody counter-culturalism. Since \"gay-pride\" is now very much an enterprise that is being carried out right in the face of mainstream American culture, it shouldn't surprise anyone that culture would resist it. \n\n \n Yeah, there's nothing quite so wild and crazy, so \"out there\", as getting hitched!\n \n \nIf the bulk of gay rights people at the time had put their foot down early on regarding the pederasty issues among 'the faithful', this wouldn't be a skeleton in the closet today for your movement. You didn't need a controlling organization or leader. I think we need to consider the possibility that gay rights couldn't afford to do that early on, or it might alienate too many members.\n\n \n You continue with this fantasy that NAMBLA participation was more than a blip in the gay movement. How would a national, dispersed movement \"put its foot down\" against a group that reared its head, I don't know, a dozen times over the course of a couple decades?\n \n \nOk, I'll concede that based on your word.\n\n \n Don't concede based \"on my word\". Concede because the source you cited is obviously subject to distortion and because logic itself dictates that a movement that has been around for over one hundred years can't possibly \"share origins\" with something that happened in the 1970s.",

   "As you requested, data has been provided to back up the statement. We would now be interested in seeing the data to back up your statements.\n\n \n Since you asked:\n \n\n HIV Incidence Among Young Men Who Have Sex With Men --- Seven U.S. Cities, 1994--2000\n \n Twenty years after the first report on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United States, studies of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and sexual behaviors suggest a resurgent HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) (1,2). However, few recent studies have measured HIV incidence in this population (3--7). To determine HIV incidence among young MSM, CDC analyzed data from the Young Men's Survey (YMS), a study that found a high prevalence of HIV and associated risks among MSM aged 15--22 years sampled in seven U.S. cities (8). This report confirms high HIV incidence among these young men. \n \n\n \n \n\n In the 34 areas with confidential HIV reporting, data show that substantial numbers of MSM still are being infected, especially young men. In 2000, 59% of reported HIV infections among adolescent males aged 13-19 and 53% of cases among men aged 20-24 were attributed to male-to-male sexual contact.\n http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/facts/msm.htm\n \n\n \n If you do the math, you see that 59% of HIV infections in adolescent males are attributable to engaging in homosexual relationships. If you consider that the population of gay males is <5% of the total male population in a given age group, that means that the <95% of heterosexual males 13-19 account for ~41% of the HIV infections. That equates to a rate of acquiring HIV by MSM that is over 20 times higher than that of heterosexual adolescent males (including intravenous drug users, even). \n For comparison, \n \n\n Compared to nonsmokers, men who smoke are about 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer and women who smoke are about 13 times more likely\n http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/sgr/sgr_2004/Factsheets/2.htm \n\n The risk of a young homosexual contracting HIV is on par with the risk of acquiring lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. Wouldn't you try to steer your son away from any behavior that increased his risk of acquiring a deadly disease by that much? Any responsible parent would, IMO.\n \n More food for thought.\n \n\n Prevention efforts for young gay and bisexual men must be sustained. Targeted, sustained prevention efforts are urgently needed for young MSM as they come of age and initiate high-risk sexual behavior. Ongoing studies show that both HIV prevalence and risk behaviors remain high among young MSM. In a sample of young MSM ages 15-22 in seven urban areas, researchers found that, overall, 7% were infected with HIV, with higher prevalence among young African American (14%) and Hispanic (7%) men than among young white men (3%).\n http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/facts/youth.htm\n \n\n \n \n \n\n CDC is committed to providing the scientific community and the public with accurate and objective information about HIV infection and AIDS. It is vital that clear information on HIV infection and AIDS be readily available to help prevent further transmission of the virus and to allay fears and prejudices caused by misinformation. For a complete description of CDC's HIV/AIDS prevention programs, see \"CDC's Role in HIV and AIDS Prevention.\" \n\n \n Since I believe that the CDC's statisics are credible, naturally you can understand my claim that homosexual behavior is a health risk, especially for young males.",

Don't you want the teachers to help stop THE OTHER KIDS from messing with yours?\n\n I want teachers teaching my kids what they're paid to do, not playing junior psychiatrist. If there is a discipline issue, then call the principle and throw the little SOB out of school.\n \n\n The Catholic grade and high schools I went to had very firm policies on drugs and bullying. Neither were allowed. They didn't strike me as \"liberal\".\n\n Having a strict policy isn't equivalent to spending weeks of class time teaching about the ills of bad behavior. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n That's why we spend less on them than we used to, right?\n\n That's a myth.\n\n \n Increasing Spending\n \n You've heard the expression, \"you get what you pay for?\" The fact that better products and services usually cost more than inferior ones has conditioned us to assume that the same pattern holds true for anything, including education. Increasing our expenditures on public schooling has thus been seen as a promising way to improve its quality since the birth of the institution some 150 years ago. Though it's difficult to trace spending patterns that far back, we do have more recent statistics. What those figures show is that we now spend roughly five times more per pupil per year than we did in 1950, in real, inflation-adjusted dollars.4\n \n Many factors have contributed to this rise. Children now spend more days in school per year, schools offer a wider variety of programs, school buildings are larger and more expensive, there are many more teachers, administrators and non-teaching staff per student than there once were, salaries have grown, and, in recent decades, the number of students classified as learning disabled (and hence eligible for special services) has skyrocketed.5\n \n Yet, this tremendous growth in the apparatus of public schooling, and the corresponding dramatic rise in its cost, has not ended a history of stagnation and decline in academic achievement during the last three quarters of a century. Yes, a motivated researcher can find five- or 15-year spans during which scores on a particular test went up or stayed the same. But when the most reliable measures of student achievement trends are taken together, they point at best to stagnation, and at worst to a steady deterioration of scholastic achievement over the past 70 years. The most alarming evidence of a decline has been in the most important skill of all: reading.6 This finding is sadly consistent with the already cited International Adult Literacy Survey, in which nearly one in four Americans ages 16 to 25 scored at or below the Survey's lowest level of literacy.7\n \n The accuracy of this picture is corroborated by numerous other research findings and examples at the state and district levels. Over the years, many studies have compared how well students in higher-spending public schools performed compared to their peers in lower-spending schools. The overall conclusion has been that higher spending is not significantly associated with higher achievement.8 Even researchers initially skeptical of this conclusion have found it to be true: Higher public school spending generally does not help children learn more.9\n \n Indeed, some of the most troubled, lowest performing districts in the country are also among those spending the most money. Baltimore, Hartford and Washington, D.C., for example, all spend upwards of $9,000 per pupil annually (the national average is about $7,000), yet are plagued by poor test scores and decaying facilities. Between the late 1980s and the late 1990s, Kansas City, Missouri became the highest spending district in the country, adding well over $1 billion to its existing budget in obedience to a court ordered reform plan. Despite this unprecedented infusion of funds, overall student achievement did not improve, and the judge responsible for the order eventually rescinded it, acknowledging its failure.\n http://www.educationreport.org/article.asp?ID=4451\n \n\n \n You certainly aren't going to get a pass from me when you make such easily refutable claims WRT education. It's a topic that I'm VERY familiar with. Ten years ago, I was the anti-Christ because I ran for our school board on a platform of, heaven forbid \"teacher accountability\". You'd have thought that I had murdered a nun by the reaction I got from the local NEA. emoticon_rolleyes",

I'm not very fond of touchy-feely, \"esteem\" classes, either. I think values are taught best when they are integrated into the whole school experience. In how teachers allow kids to behave and how they behave themselves all the way to examining issues related to those values. That means civics lessons and discussions of discrimination etc. when covering history, literature, and other similar subjects. \n \n Schools SHOULD teach values and ethics. They shouldn't teach them as though they were somehow separate from real life. They're not.\n \n \nThat(reduced school funding)'s a myth.\n\n \n I didn't express myself very well -- posting too fast, plus it's not really the topic for this forum. But what I mean is that today's educational experience in far too many urban schools pales in comparison to that of a couple decades ago. We may SPEND more actual money, but we offer so much less in terms of curriculum and extra-curricular activities like music and art and support costs like school nurses and free lunches, etc. Much of the reason for the large increase in actual dollars is the huge increase in payroll, most of it compensating for the fact that teachers were always woefully underpaid even when teaching was a noble profession. Nowadays we're competing for talent with corporations and have to pay much more than we once did for teachers. Administrative salaries have risen even more dramatically (with little return in my opinion).\n \n The real test of whether \"we're spending enough\" is not just to compare the four- or five-times average spent you mentioned, but to also compare what we're offering in many urban school districts versus what we're spending in many suburban districts. \n \n We may be paying more money, but we're offering a far stingier education. And it shows.\n \n \nYou certainly aren't going to get a pass from me when you make such easily refutable claims WRT education.\n\n \n Fair enough. I'll post more clearly and we'll see if still feel the need to refute me. My main \"solution\" to the educational crisis is far smaller schools and far fewer exclusively administrative positions, by the way. Is that a bad idea?\n \n \nTen years ago, I was the anti-Christ because I ran for our school board on a platform of, heaven forbid \"teacher accountability\". You'd have thought that I had murdered a nun by the reaction I got from the local NEA. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Well, I can't know the details, of course, but \"teacher accountability\" is too often code for reducing teaching to rote memorization.

   "Another day, another post. Let's see what's on the platter today:\n \n \nWhen I say conflict, I'm mainly referring to brand new school curriculums that I believe would come about soon after gay marriage was legalized. The actions of school administrators don't always mirror the desires of the voting public.\n\n \n Nor should they, unless there is evidence that the voting public knows its head from its heels about education.\n \n First of all, I see absolutely and completely no evidence that allowing same-sex marriage will change school cirriculums. I don't mean to imply that none exists, but certainly you have provided none. It seems only logical to assume that same-sex marriage, being completely unrelated to our education system, would not affect the schedule of classes available. JPSartre did provide some evidence that the schedule may change, but he has not related any of his evidence to same-sex marriage. I'll deal with more with what he wrote when I finish responding to your post.\n \n Anyhow, second of all, I see no evidence that any such school class change would be very large, let alone cause a conflict. I do have evidence this claim, and that evidence is former classes revolving around civil rights. There have been plenty of classes added to colleges and perhaps even high schools which revolve around women's rights and African Americans. Although some angry parents might have done some shouting, conflict over these courses has been absolutely negligable. Even if all the shouting in the world had been done, a conflict of words is hardly justification for stripping people's freedom.\n \n Third of all, I see no evidence that these new classes would do anything significant to any student's schedule. I went to the University of Michigan - Dearborn: one of the more liberal colleges in this nation. As an Engineering student, I took absolutely zero courses on Anthropology, Sociology, Civil Rights, or anything along those lines. The only time I would be forced to take one of those classes is if I were a CASL major (College of Arts, Sciences, and Literature. It encompasses majors like Math, Science, English, Music, etc). If I were such a major, I would be required to take a single \"diversity course\". This course could be Anthropology, Sociology, Music History, Art History, certain Psychology or Behavioral Science Course, or yes, a course on Women's Rights, Sexual Orientation, etc. Beyond that those courses on civil rights are miniscule in number compared to Anthropology, Sociology, etc, and they are usually only offered one semester out of the year. Consider further that I wanted to take a civil rights class as a Computer Science major, but I did not because it would not count toward my major. Consider even further that I am going back to school for a Mathematics degree, but I still can't take a civil rights course because it is faster and cheaper for me to satisfy my diversity requirement by taking Anthropology, as it also counts toward a different requirement in my major. Based on both my past experiences and my reasoning, I must conclude that your argument about same-sex marriage causing an increase in civil rights classes is nonsense.\n \n Do these courses exist in colleges? Absolutely? Are we polluting the minds of our children with useless knowledge? Even if it could be argued that the knowledge is useless, the answer must still be: certainly not based on what I wrote above.\n \n \nI believe one conflict would end, and a much more severe one would take it's place.\n\n \n I understand that you believe this, but there is no reason behind that belief. There is no reason to believe that a new conflict would begin, and there is no evidence has been shown to suggest that this conflict could somehow be severe enough to warrant taking away the rights of good people.\n \n \nNo same sex marriage, no abortion, religion in schools and politics, - all commonplace and not controversial only a few decades ago. I don't believe majorities seek to increase their numbers, unless of course, they feel THREATENED.\n\n \n But they do seek to increase their numbers. The problem is that majorities feel threatened any time a new minority seeking equal rights arises. Majorities are prone to rejecting anyone who is different than they are. Majorities feel threatened by people who ask only to be treated as equals. It happens in every society from Sumer to America. Majorities tend to abuse their power as much as anyone else, and in America, the majority has all of the power.\n \n \nYou and I may have different definitions of the word \"agenda\". If something has been proven to work, I don't see a desire to keep it, to protect it from those who would destry it, as the same aggressive \"agenda\" that gay marriage is.\n\n \n Hitler had a pretty darn strong economy while he was burning the Jewish people in ovens. Kings and Queens created vast empires while tyrannizing their people and conquering through war. America was doing fantastic while it held slaves.\n \n Which of those people had reason to change their ways? In most of those cases, the majority of people were living just fine. Keep on killing the minority, what does the majority care? It's proven to work. Just because an immoral and evil action takes place in a successful society does not mean that immoral and evil action should continue, nor does it mean that it is part of that society's success.\n \n As for the definition of \"agenda\", I am using the English definition of the word agenda. I can use the English definition of the word \"aggressive\" to say that same-sex couples are aggressors to no other person; they seek only to grant themselves the same rights that others have. Are not the aggressors the ones who try to take things from others or stop others from doing what they have done themselves? Regardless, you may continue to use the word \"agenda\", but both sides have political goals. The distinction is that one side wishes to change the law to give themselves the same rights that others have. The other side wishes to stop them from changing that law.\n \n \nemoticon_confused\n\n \n Hmm, I'm not sure where I lost you, but let me try to explain this paragraph again. You had written that same-sex couples have a political agenda, which they would teach to their children in order to make enemies in the straight community. I called this perposterous, then followed with the paragraph that confused you. In that paragraph, I said that Christians also have political agendas, but they don't raise their children to infiltrate the enemy community. There is no evidence to suggest that same-sex couples would do the same (of course, I talk as though same-sex couples and Christians are different, even though most same-sex couples are likely Christian).\n \n \nIMO many, if not most of the pro gay posters on this forum have chips on their shoulders. I see a vengefulness that I don't see on other forums at this site.\n\n \n I would wager that they would say the same about you without blinking. The reason for this is that people who post against same-sex marriage are insulting in unparalleled manners, they just don't realize it. It is what I tried to point out to you with my first response to your post. Each sentence written by an opponent of same-sex marriage feels like a slap in the face, a punch in the gut, and being spit on, all at the same time if you are a gay person. To know that someone who has never even met you believes that you honestly believes you are a bad parent is awful. To know that someone who has never met you believes you to be at a high risk for a disease spread by promiscuity is horrible; that implicitly calls every gay person promiscuous. To know that someone who has never met you would force you to recognize his marriage and his love, then would refuse to recognize yours is a worse pain than I can describe. But opponents of same-sex marriage tend to take their insulting comments for granted. They tend to think nothing of saying \"Allowing you to marry would cause debates in schools!\" Who cares? It's the love between two people we're talking about here. Yes, it's health care and tax benefits and whatever other things come with marriage, but no man can oppose same-sex marriage without implicitly declaring that his love is better than a same-sex couple's love or somehow more worthly of recognition. It is the ultimate insult made worse by the fact that the opponent of same-sex marriage truthfully believes this. It is a horrible punishment for a crime not committed, or at least it is in the eyes of every supporter of gay rights.\n \n But opponents of same-sex marriage usually don't see things from that point of view. They don't see that they've just called every gay person a promiscuous sinner whose love doesn't deserved to be recognized like their own love. They don't understand why their opponents get angry and frustrated. But don't take this the wrong way! It is understandable not to realize what one is saying, just as I'm certain those who react as though they have chips on their shoulders don't realize what they are saying. And it's impossible to make your argument against same-sex marriage without saying what you believe. But when what you believe is as insulting at this, you have to expect your opponents to react poorly. But you still have to listen to their arguments and understand that if you knew this person as a friend, not as someone who is denying them rights, then that person would be just as kind and generous as anyone else you might know.\n \n \nWith the vengefulness that I refered to above, I believe the continuing agenda would be legal claims of discrimination in schools and workplaces. Remedies would mainly consist of accommodations and separations that would cost STRAIGHT taxpayers plenty of money. Now I know that makes me a homophobe. Homophobe means having an \"irrational fear\". It's recently being morphed into an offensive term to be used against anyone who opposes special rights for gays. If we check U.S. history, or world history, we see that a fear of incrementalism in politics is not irrational, it's very real. When FDR was starting social security, he claimed that it would be a voluntary program. Today's anti smoking hysteria started a few decades ago with \"no smoking on airline flights of 2 hours or less.\" A whole book could be filled with documentation of how incrementalism has caused governments and dictatorships to grow in the last 100 years.\n\n \n Fear incrementalism as you see fit, but do not use that fear as an excuse to deny equal rights. Do not use your fear of evil tomorrow as an excuse to do evil today. As I have stated; if the day comes where gay rights move beyond equality, then you have my promise that I will stand by your side and fight for the equality of heterosexuals. But today I stand by the side of the group who is in the right, and I will not leave that group's side while they are morally right.\n \n Considering the homosexuals which I am friends with today, I do believe your fear of incrementalism is unjustified and false, but it is no excuse to do that which is wrong.\n \n \nParents who teach their children that homosexuality is wrong are less likely to encourage their children to make it a public issue, and therefore far less likely to cause a conflict.\n\n \n Are you so certain about that? Do you not hear just as many people, if not more, claiming that homosexuality is wrong? Do you not hear just as many people, if not more, claiming that abortion is wrong? I think that you are judging parents who oppose homosexuality by considering those peolpe you know, but you are only judging homosexuals and gay rights supporters by those you have spoken to in a situation where gay rights is the topic of conversation. Recently, when gay Christian parents tried to enroll their straight child into a Christian school, it was not the gay parents nor their child who made a big deal about the sexual orientation of those parents; it was the parents who oppose homosexuality who did it.\n \n \nBY THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE. Political mistakes are often impossible to reverse.\n\n \n Considering my stance on same-sex marriage, I understand all too well the results of political mistakes. But you fear that which may never happen, and you fear that which is insignifcant. A few people claiming discrimination is nothing compared to the marriage rights to millions. I ask only that you support what is morally right, and work toward preventing that which is morally wrong if it shows itself.\n \n \nI was referring almost completely to elementary schools - sorry I didn't make that more clear.\n\n \n Elementary schools? As I've written above, I'm confused about why you could think this. Does this happen historically? Are our children in school today, engaging in civil rights conflicts? I don't see why you think this.\n \n You write later that same-sex marriage is a big experiment, an irreversable one. The opponents of instituting the Constitution that we use today said the same thing, and they were right. Large-scale popular government had never been done before, and they weren't just risking a little debate in schools, they were risking their freedom. But that Constitution is now the longest standing Constitution in the world, and we are the longest-standing popular goverment in the world. Our Constitution was based on the right principles, and it was worth the experiment. Same-sex marriage is based on the right principles too. I'll take that risk any day.\n \n \nI appreciate your civility!! :)\n\n \n I appreciate yours in turn. I'm sorry if the things I wrote about opponents of same-sex marriage being insulting seemed a lack of civility, I am only trying to show how deeply those words can scar people.\n \n As for JPSartre:\n \nNow, tell me, if the NEA pushes for training programs to teach these concepts, where does the time come from? You guessed it: reading writing and arithmetic. I don't believe that it's the schools job to teach ethics, morals, behavior modification, etc., to MY kids. That's MY responsibility. That is also why many straights see homosexuality as a threat to them. It's would-be PC do-gooders that try to usurp the parental responsibilities. \n And this applies to more than just teaching about gay awareness. We have the dumbest kids with the highest self-esteem in the world as a result of all of this touchy-feely BS social indoctrination.\n\n \n In 1996, I was a Freshman in high school. In 2000, I was taking the standardized tests you spoke of which labeled our children as stupid compared to nations such as Japan and Sweden. Do I write as though I am among the dumbest people in the world? Do you suspect that I did not score well on those standardized tests? I do not pretend to know the age of anyone else who posts here, so perhaps some of you are able to answer this from experience: was the material on those standardized tests not taught in school?\n \n I can say from experience that our schools do teach all of the Math, English, Science, and History that anyone could possibly need to succeed on those standardized tests. The difference is not that the information wasn't taught, the difference is that 75% of the students in my classes didn't do their homework. Parents don't make sure their children are doing their schoolwork, and the work ethic does not exist among children in America as it does among children in other nations. School for some children is just passing notes in class and making fun of the kid with the glasses who sits up front taking notes. Some high school students get through by copying and convincing the teacher to make that test a take-home one. I've heard excuses such as \"summer vacation is too long\" or \"our teachers move too slowly\" or \"the school board needs replacing.\" I must admit that blaming homosexuals or civil rights movements is a new one to me. But none of those excuses address the problem that children simply don't feel motivated to learn or study.\n \n More importantly, I think that what JPSartre has posted almost illustrates my point for me: schools have been pushing for anti-discrimination measures since 1996. What, precisely, do any of us think we can change by banning same-sex marriage? Banning same-sex marriage won't stop school boards from putting up whatever classes they want; it will only take away rights from good people.\n \n I don't have any specific post to quote about health effects of same-sex marriage, but I have not seen my points regarding that addressed by anyone. My points were that smoking is directly harmful. We can try to make it less harmful by discouraging it (not that I agree with doing that, but there is at least a reason for it). Same-sex marriage is not directly harmful, and neither is homosexuality. It is promiscuity and irresponsible sex that are the problem here. If you want to discourage those things, go right ahead. And unlike discouraging smoking, if we discourage same-sex marriage, we are only encouraging promiscuity and irresponsible sex. When we see the true problems behind the spread of AIDs and other diseases, we realize that we aren't discouraging them by banning same-sex marriage at all; we're encouraging them. We're doing completely the opposite of what we intended to do. Legalizing same-sex marriage is one of the best and most direct routes of discouraging promiscuity among homosexuals.\n \n I think I will close by reminding everyone that the vast majority of homosexuals live a long and STD-free life. We have the opportunity to make that number even higher.",

If you consider that the population of gay males is <5% of the total male population in a given age group, that means that the <95% of heterosexual males 13-19 account for ~41% of the HIV infections. That equates to a rate of acquiring HIV by MSM that is over 20 times higher than that of heterosexual adolescent males (including intravenous drug users, even). \n For comparison, \n \n The risk of a young homosexual contracting HIV is on par with the risk of acquiring lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. Wouldn't you try to steer your son away from any behavior that increased his risk of acquiring a deadly disease by that much? Any responsible parent would, IMO.\n \n More food for thought.\n \n \n \n \n \n Since I believe that the CDC's statisics are credible, naturally you can understand my claim that homosexual behavior is a health risk, especially for young males.\n\n \n You are attempting to deflect from the issues I provided documentation for.

They dealt with the myth you propogate about homosexual promiscuity. They dealt with the myth you propogate about all gay men being effinimate and all lesbians being \"butch\".\n \n Instead of responding to the documentation I DID give you, you take off on completely different issues.

I believe that you are attempting to deflect the issue, however. If you dig a bit deeper, you find that women contracting HIV are doing so predominantly by having sex with bisexual men, having sex with heterosexual junkies with HIV and sharing needles with HIV infected people. It can't be argued that it's a mainstream \"straight\" disease by any stretch of the imagination. \n \n \n\n Lack of Recognition of Partners' Risk\n \n Some women may be unaware of their male partners' risk for HIV infection (such as unprotected sex with multiple partners, sex with men, or injection drug use) [8]. Men who engage in sex both with men and women can acquire HIV from a male partner and can then transmit the virus to female partners. In a recent study of HIV-infected people (5,156 men and 3,139 women), 34% of African American men who have sex with men (MSM), 26% of Hispanic MSM, and 13% of white MSM reported having had sex with women. However, their female partners may not know of their bisexual activity: only 14% of white women, 6% of African American women, and 6% of Hispanic women in this study acknowledged having a bisexual partner [9]. In a recent CDC survey, 65% of the men who have ever had sex with men also had sex with women [10].\n Substance Abuse\n \n An estimated 1 in 5 new HIV diagnoses for women is related to injection drug use [2]. Sharing injection equipment contaminated with HIV is not the only risk associated with substance use. Women who smoke or snort crack cocaine or other noninjection drugs may also be at high risk for sexual transmission of HIV if they sell or trade sex for drugs [16]. Also, both casual and chronic substance users are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors, such as unprotected sex, when they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol [17].\n \n http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/facts/women.htm\n \n\n emoticon_rolleyes",

You are looking for a scapegoat so relations between men and women won't be held responsible for the diseases they spread from that activity.\n It's similar to Mary getting a disease from a parnter John, and John and Mary blaming the person and the activity which gave him the disease, saying that he Mary and their activity isn't really to blame, just because they contracted the disease from John and Mary's activity.

The strain in Africa is more easily spread through heterosexual sex and more easily spread from women to men. Bisexuality plays a very minor role in the spread of AIDS in Africa (many of these countries are very homophobic). The main human aspects of the problem are poverty-induced prostitution, a highly mobile and infected population of truck drivers, a general refusal on the part of men to use condoms, and the general lack of power among women to demand that they do.

   "I cannot help but feel that my posts on the subjects of STDs have not been addressed and this debate is being steered into a conversation over who has the best statistics. Statistics mean nothing when interpreted incorrectly.\n \n As I have said, homosexuality is not the cause of AIDS. Irresponsible promiscuity and drug use are the causes. This is very straightforward and apparent to everyone who posts here. Male-male sex has no chance of causing AIDS if neither one of the males involved has AIDS. So looking at the rate of AIDS in homosexuals does not indicate that homosexuality makes one more prone to AIDS, it indicates that more homosexuals have made the concious decision to act in a promiscuous manner.\n \n So targetting homosexuality is not targetting the real cause of AIDS here. If we are to battle AIDS, then we must fight against promiscuity and needle-sharing. If we simply make the claim that stopping people from becoming homosexual will reduce AIDS, then we are fighting the wrong problem because there is no indication that discouraging homosexuality will discourage promiscuity or drug use, and is in fact arbitrary. Furthermore, disallowing same-sex marriage, while discouraging homosexuality, only encourages promiscuity. Disallowing this marriage will have unquestionably and undeniably the opposite effect that any opponents of AIDS intend it to have especially when considering that only a miniscule portion of the population would determine whether they are attracted to the same sex based on whether or not they could marry someone of the same sex. But marriage has an enormous effect on encouraging monogamy, and disallowing it only puts homosexuals at risk.\n \n Consider that I could might make the claim that people who enjoy living in cities are at unimaginably more likely to contract AIDS than those who live in rural areas. Does this indicate that we must discourage people from living in urban areas? Does this justify us in taking the right to marry away from everyone who lives in cities? I believe not one person here could agree with that, and the truth is, living in cities keeps you almost completely protected from AIDS provided you are not promicuous or a needle-sharer. If you live responsibly in the city, you won't get AIDS; living in cities is simply not the cause of AIDS. Though a few people in cities might choose to be promiscuous, is it appropriate to take away the right of all people in that city to marry because of those few people? Do you think that would solve the problem or hurt it in the long run?\n \n What if I were to mention that people who listen to music are much more likely to go deaf from listening to loud music? Would this indicate that we should discourage listening to music? Or does logic dictate that it is not music which is the problem at all, it is listening to loud music that is the real problem. What if I were to declare that forest fires caused by campers who forget to put their fires out could be stopped completely if we just discouraged everyone from going camping? Am I justified in doing that, or does it logically only make sense to stop people from keeping their fires going after they go to sleep?\n \n I hope this has made my point clear: it makes no sense to attack a group of people that are more likely to get AIDS and claim that you are attacking the problem. That is not attacking the problem, that is simply an excuse to punish an entire group of people for the actions of a few.

Each of my examples, from city-dwellers to campers, represents a group at a higher risk of some bad thing happening. My point was that though the risk factors may be higher for those groups of people, it is not membership in that group which is the cause of the harm, and it is perfectly simple to be a member of those groups without putting yourself at risk.\n \n \nWhat would make even more sense would be to target that group not with slander but with an open educational campaign and societal support.

   "Nor should they, unless there is evidence that the voting public knows its head from its heels about education. \n\n \n Now THIS is one of the best examples I have of why you are mistaking the reasons why gay marriage is opposed. It's the voting public's children that are being educated, and the voting publics money that is footing the bill. To suggest that elites know better than the general public about education reeks of liberalism. Liberalism and gay marriage go hand in hand. THAT is the main reason gay marriage is opposed, far more than all \"slaps in the face\" - \"punches in the gut\" - \"being spit on\", ways that you falsely take it. \n \n Check out www.glaad.org sometime. A while back they were hatefully pointing fingers at Mel Gibson for something in one of his movies. Currently they are encouraging everyone to bombard Creators Syndicate to get Thomas Sowell's columns removed from as many sources as possible. Sowell writes about 75 or so columns every year. I'd guess maybe 3 or 4 of them have to do with his (very mainstream) views of gay marriage. Glad wants EVERYTHING of his removed. Is it because of his gay marriage views, or because of his comservative views??\n \n \n \n \nElementary schools? As I've written above, I'm confused about why you could think this. Does this happen historically? Are our children in school today, engaging in civil rights conflicts? I don't see why you think this. \n\n \n It does happen historically. I was an elementary student in the 60's, and had a job as an adult that gave me a close-up of elementary education in the 80's, in the same district. I saw more liberalism, and less basic education. Gay rights is a tool of liberalism.\n \n You and others here use pretty strong wording in describing \"rights\" and lack thereof. You called the lack of gay marriage an \"evil and immoral action\". There are at least a few million American adults who are straight as can be, yet aren't married and have no relationship with another person. (I'm one of them) Can you name me a right that I have that gay people don't?? I don't think it's a case of gay people not having rights, it's that married heterosexuals have a few special rights. Since the traditional family has long been considered a integral part of our society, I have no problem with them having a few special rights.\n \n Does glaad?

   "Thanks for responding to my posts. Let's see here...\n \n \nNow THIS is one of the best examples I have of why you are mistaking the reasons why gay marriage is opposed. It's the voting public's children that are being educated, and the voting publics money that is footing the bill. To suggest that elites know better than the general public about education reeks of liberalism. Liberalism and gay marriage go hand in hand. THAT is the main reason gay marriage is opposed, far more than all \"slaps in the face\" - \"punches in the gut\" - \"being spit on\", ways that you falsely take it.\n\n \n It seems to me that you are using my explanation on how offensive anti-same-sex marriage arguments to mean something they did not, so I am afraid I was not clear on what I meant. I did not say any of those things in an attempt to justify same-sex marriage or to show that opposing it is wrong. I also did not mean to imply that opponents of same-sex marriage are intentionally hostile. I said those things only in an attempt to justify the hostility you described in members of the forum who support same-sex marriage. From what you wrote above, it sounds to me that you believed I thought you wanted to offend opponents of same-sex couples. That is certainly not what I think.\n \n Next, you mentioned my comment that school administrators not always listening to the general public being a good thing. I should point out that the comment was barely related to same-sex marriage and that I wrote paragraphs of other comments explaining why same-sex marriage would not affect our schools. Addressing this one comment does not address the heart of my argument.\n \n Still, since you chose this sentence to pull out, allow me to explain why it is a bad idea for the public administrator to listen to everything the public demands. The public, first of all, is very uninformed about how to educate children, and they are very influenced by the media. They tend to hear some vague piece of information, and instead of researching it themselves, demand that something be unreasonably changed. The truth is, no one can be informed about everything, and the mass of the public isn't informed at all except on that which sends them into an outrage. Furthermore, parents tend to be interested more in what benefits their own children more than in what benefits the most children overall. Considering all of this, it is best to leave these decisions in the hands of someone who is an expert on the subject matter and who has a vested interest in making sure his school is successful, not in certain children succeeding over others or certain children getting good grades.\n \n As for things being liberal, well I'm not certain this is a liberal viewpoint, though it may be. I get my reasoning from the Federalist Papers, which I think provide much insight into these sorts of situations. So I do think it a Federalist viewpoint. Though you say \"liberal\" as though that is all you need say in order to show that something is bad. \"Liberal\" and \"conservative\" are just different viewpoints, each one requiring reasoning and evidence to prove themselves correct. Do not make the mistake of immitating radio show hosts in this respect; if you believe something is bad, you must have a reason for that belief, not just term \"liberal\" or \"conservative\".\n \n Beyond this, same-sex marriage is a conservative value by nature, as conservatives tend to value keeping the government out of people's lifestyle and their decisions. Conservatives tend to hate it when the government interferes with people living their lives. On the other hand, it is also a liberal issue. Liberals tend to believe that the overall happiness of the people can be sometimes be increased through government interference. Republicans and those who identify themselves as conservatives today tend to disagree with same-sex marriage not based on conservative principle but on moral or religious principle. In my arguments, I intend to prove that banning same-sex marriage is harmful and morally wrong, and that although you are entitled to your religous beliefs on the subject, you are not entitled to take away the rights of those who hold different beliefs.\n \n \nCheck out www.glaad.org sometime. A while back they were hatefully pointing fingers at Mel Gibson for something in one of his movies. Currently they are encouraging everyone to bombard Creators Syndicate to get Thomas Sowell's columns removed from as many sources as possible. Sowell writes about 75 or so columns every year. I'd guess maybe 3 or 4 of them have to do with his (very mainstream) views of gay marriage. Glad wants EVERYTHING of his removed. Is it because of his gay marriage views, or because of his comservative views??\n\n \n I'm guessing that truly GLAAD was angry at something he wrote about same-sex marriage but that they probably would not have targetted someone very liberal. But what is the point here? Do you disagree with same-sex marriage because most gay rights groups support liberals?\n \n As for hatefully pointing fingers, certainly it could just as easily be said that most opponents of same-sex marriage hatefully point fingers at gay people. It's not an evil thing to do, it is the way people try to win civil rights battles.\n \n \nIt does happen historically. I was an elementary student in the 60's, and had a job as an adult that gave me a close-up of elementary education in the 80's, in the same district. I saw more liberalism, and less basic education. Gay rights is a tool of liberalism.\n\n \n A tool? Surely you cannot call the rights of millions of people a tool, and surely you do not suspect that liberalism has some great intent to take over the world. Society itself has become more liberal over time, and that in itself is the only liberalism that has entered our elementary schools. Perhaps Gay rights is not a tool by which liberalism attempts to force itself upon others, and preventing it is a tool by which conservatism attempts to prevent society from becoming more liberal. People who have grown up knowing only one certain set of values watch society move away from that set of values and do what they can to stop that movement, even if it means stopping equality. I haven't decided that what I've just said is accurate for certain, but the more I speak with people, the more true that seems to become.\n \n \nYou and others here use pretty strong wording in describing \"rights\" and lack thereof. You called the lack of gay marriage an \"evil and immoral action\". There are at least a few million American adults who are straight as can be, yet aren't married and have no relationship with another person. (I'm one of them) Can you name me a right that I have that gay people don't?? I don't think it's a case of gay people not having rights, it's that married heterosexuals have a few special rights. Since the traditional family has long been considered a integral part of our society, I have no problem with them having a few special rights.\n\n \n In some off-sense, I could say that you have the right to marry the person you love while a gay person does not. Though to explain it more thouroughly, you do not have a right that any gay person does not have. By legalizing same-sex marriage, I am indeed suggesting that we give everyone the right to marry someone of the same sex, not just gay people. However it is also true that this situation is not equal or free. The lack of freedom is present in that people do not have the right to marry the person of their choosing. The lack of equality is clear not because you have some right that a gay person does not, but because the right to marry is designed so that only heterosexuals will use it. When I say that gays do not have equal rights, I do not mean they do not have as many rights but that our civil rights do not provide equality to everyone, though they certainly could be extended to do so. When I say that it is wrong to take away the rights of gays, I take it for granted that everyone understands that we are taking away this right from everyone, but that this right we are taking away would only be used by gays and they are therefore only the ones losing anything.\n \n Slavery was long part of our society until it was abolished. What is long part of our society is not necessarily good or just, and we should not give special privleges to things just because they have been in our legal books the longest. We should strive to continaully evaluate ourselves as people, and where we can increase equality, freedom, and happines, we should strive to do so. Everyone deserves special rights.\n \n \nDoes glaad? Is their agenda positive, or negative?\n\n \n Well, GLAAD's agenda is equality for gay people, and I consider that a very positive agenda. But whether their campaign uses positive or negative tactics, I do not know. I get lots of mail from GLAAD asking me to donate money, and that mail is generally positive. \"Make a difference!\" You know what I mean; you'd have to expect that sort of stuff. I haven't paid much attention to their political tactics. Does it really matter?\n \n \nHow is exploring the possibility that a group's promiscuity has led to increased HIV infections in that group a case of \"attacking\" them? \n \n In my opinion it IS one way of attacking the problem, but we cannot be expected to just ignore the one place where the problem has been most prevalent by far. And I also don't think this is a case of 'trying to take your rights away.'\n\n \n Oh, well I think none of us have any doubt that promiscuity among gay men has led to the spread of AIDS. That isn't attacking them. It is stripping them of the right to marry that attacks them. What I mean is that I think people are looking at the problem that more gay people have AIDS than straight people, and they say, \"Well, we should deny the rights of gay people to discourage being gay. That way less people will get AIDS.\" My argument is that this is discouraging the wrong thing, and because people are targetting the wrong thing, they are actually increasing the cases of AIDS by denying gay rights instead of decreasing them.\n \n Well, hopefully that clears things up!",

   "You make some valid points. Let me address the essence of them and not the particulars so that my reply isn't too windy.\n You claim that allowing gay marriage would decrease gay promiscuity and encourage monogomy. I ask, where is the proof? Heterosexual marriage is legal yet over 70% of children born in Detroit, for example, are illegitimate. If marriage isn't very effective in encouraging monogomy amongst heteros, why would we expect it to change gay behavior? And, amongst heteros couples who don't believe in marriage, they don't need \"a piece of paper\" to keep them monogomous. \n It seems to me that gays promoting gay marriage as a means of increasing relationship stability and thereby reducing promiscuity and HIV are engaging in nothing more than wishful thinking. If it doesn't work for straights, why would it work for gays? Convince me otherwise, please.\n\n \n Well, I have to admit that I have no statistics which show that marriage increases monogamy, just as there are not really any statistics which show that it decreases monogamy. There are simply no statistics which describe the same society with and without marriage. I could show statistics which prove that married couples are less promiscuous than unmarried people. That statistic could mean that marriage lowers promiscuity, but it could also very well mean that it is only the non-promiscuous people who get married. But there is a lot of good theory about why marriage might lower promiscuity, and in the end, same-sex marriage is an well-reasoned attack on promiscuity which may or may not work.\n \n Allow me to explain. Marriage itself is a commitment to love, cherish, and dedicate yourself to one person for the rest of your life. It means this just as much to gay people as it does to straight people; we all live in the same society. When you get married, something changes, not something physical but something moral. Suddenly it is not okay to do things that you might do otherwise. Cheating on your boyfriend is a bad thing, heck a lot of boyfriends and girlfriends have open relationships. But cheating on your husband? That is absolutely taboo. Marriage places a new level of moral restriction placed upon you, and although not everyone obeys it, marriage means monogamy in the minds of everyone. It isn't easy to break one's moral convictions. Furthermore, couples are less likely to break up over a dispute if they are married. Being married again sort of signals that this relationship is something more permanent, and that just because you're upset with your boyfriend doesn't mean you can run off and sleep with someone else.\n \n I will admit this is a completely mental thing and I will admit that many same-sex couples do get religiously married or become \"life partners\". But many don't. Without marriage, many same-sex couples are intend on calling themselves boyfriends or girlfriends for their entire lives. By instituting marriage, we are giving couples a sort of natural progression of a relationship that they are supposed to go through. Once they're ready to never be with anyone else, they register that marriage with the government.\n \n You're right, this places no physical restrictions on anyone, but that is one of the great parts about this. We can place this sort of mental restriction on every gay who wants to get married without actually restricting freedom, equality or happiness. We're actually giving them what they want. Even if the most promiscuous gays did not get married, it only takes one night of a non-promiscuous gay getting frustrated and cheating for AIDS to spread. If we can prevent that, we've done something.\n \n So this allowing same-sex marriage is an attack on promiscuity, by offering legal recognition and benefits to couples who vow to be monogamous. It may not work, but there is good reason behind it that suggests that it will.\n \n But let us not forget the more fundamental point that same-sex marriage does not encourage promiscuity; it does just the opposite. Irresponsible promiscuity is one of the real causes of AIDS, and if our society wants to discourage promiscuity, it is only accomplishing the opposite by keeping same-sex marriage illegal. But we have the opportunity to discourage promiscuity without even taking away the freedom or equality of anyone (increasing freedom and equality in fact). That is a rare opportunity indeed, and I see no reason not to take it.",

   "You're not keeping up. Check post #s 47, 110, 116,121,138.......\n\n \n Well, thanks for the index.\n \n #47\n \nMaking gay marriage legal would create new curriculums to help students learn about, and make decisions about this new \"freedom\" that they will have. More social engeering means less time for practical learning. Considering what the numbers clearly show us about how our children currently compare with other countries in the practical learning department, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.\n\n I never once learned ANYTHING about marriage in public schools.\n Not the laws surrounding it, nothing.\n No cirriculum that I ever had would have been changed.\n \n It's not \"social engineering\" to recognize 2 people's marriage legally.\n Maybe you could call it \"legal engineering\" or just \"the law.'\n \n #110\n \nThere's been very little reference made to children in this entire thread, and it's probably the heart of the matter in forming the anti-gay-marriage opinions of the majority.\n \n If gay marriage is legalized, the adoption process will have to be made perfectly identical for gays and straights. Gay people will seek to adopt as many kids as possible, and will raise them in a way to steer them towards being gay. They will encourage them to act gay in school, and scream discrimination when straight parents and straight children take exception to it. It will be debatable if the straights have grounds to take exception to it, but there is no question that they will. It will create plenty of conflict, and further gays desire for special rights. (separate schools for gays) \n \n Do you have any doubt that there would be more conflict in schools with the legalization of gay adoptions?\n\n Gay people will seek to adopt as many kids as possible,\n What's wrong with that? If they can afford it, then thank god they can take some starving kids out of orphanages (in Russia or China) or state-run foster care. The reason there are so many kids to adopt is because someone didn't want them or couldn't care for them. Thank god someone will. This has nothing to do with public schools except that some dirt poor kid may get to actually attend one.\n \n raise them in a way to steer them towards being gay\n Where in the hell do you get that?\n I can't speak for any gay people, but surely they know more than anyone that people have to \"follow their heart\" when it comes to who they love. I can't imagine a gay couple \"steering\" their kids to be gay. This has nothing to do with public schools.\n \n They will encourage them to act gay in school\n Sorry dude, you have no idea what you are talking about.\n maybe if you at least met a few gay people with kids, you would clue in.\n \n (separate schools for gays) \n http://www.cnn.com/2003/EDUCATION/07/28/gay.school.ap/\n Too late! buhahaha! \n (imagine the prom!)\n \n #116\n (too long)\n \n #121\n (almost too long)\n \nNot at all, you are by far the best pro-gay debator here. (and I don't mean that as an insult to anyone else)\n \n Those who advocate gay marriage seem to imply that once it is legalized, the entire subject will go away, that our society will be better because of it. I see it opening the door to constant conflict.\n\n Nothing to do with public schools.\n \n \nIt's human nature to take pride in one's life, to take oportunities to share how one lives with others. The testimonials here and all over the net show that gays are no different. Many of them have the same intent, the same innocence, as when someone describes what they do for a living to someone. I don't believe ALL of them have bad intentions, but I see a desire to further a political agenda. What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers? Increasing adoption would be a big way to do it. Many people, myself included, firmly believe that a good orphanage is a far better place for a child to be raised in than by same sex parents. I know you disagree and nothing we say can change each other's minds, but it's a fact that it will become a bigger issue if gay marriage is legalized, and there will be CONFLICT. \n\n There wouldn't be any conflict if you just shut up and let gays be legally married.\n Nothing to do with public schools.\n You need to visit an orphanage in China or Russia.\n Most of these kids are malnourished and can't speak.\n \n \nGay parents would tend to steer adopted children towards homosexuality because of the political agenda, the numbers increasing thing that I described above. Most Christian parents don't have the desire to encourage their children to \"hate\" homosexuals. Little kids don't naturally think about sex at all. Since straight parents have no sexual political agenda, they'd rather their kids not be exposed to it at all. They'd rather their kids thought about other things. That 2+2=4, that d-o-g spells dog, that c-a-t spells cat. Practical learning. \n\n And that being gay is un-natural and an abomination in the eyes of god!\n You know practical larnin.\n \nI don't see homosexuals as having bad intentions as much as I see them having political intentions, and I don't see it stopping only with gay marriage. If I were to meet with some same sex couples I'm sure I would find them to be decent people as you describe. But it wouldn't take a very big percentage of those of them who ARE trouble makers, to cause a lot of trouble, and to recruit followers, and create enemies in the straight community. SCHOOLS would be the centers of conflict. I did notice your comments about children in your post #50, however there have been no responses to my post #47.\n\n Please eleborate what other political intentions these gay people have.\n Would it be the same kind of political agenda that black people had 40 years ago?\n Some of those blacks were total trouble-makers.\n \n Where do you get that schools would be the center of conflict?\n Is there a conflict going on right now involving gay marriage rights?\n Are public schools the focus of this conflict? No?\n \n Why do you think there would be even MORE conflict if gay folk got what these marriage rights?\n \n #138 I agree with so...",

However, I am again willing give you the benefit of doubt, which seems to be more than you are willing to give gay people\n \n \nFrom the start, I have tried to present arguments that straights have against gay marriage. Some were stereotypical beliefs, some were based on nothing more than a lack of knowledge and some were based on factual assertions. Maybe it would have been easier if I had listed which views I held personally, That included the myths, the stereotypes, the preconceptions as well as the misconceptions \n\n \n It would be very helpful to know which views you do hold personally and why you hold them. Have you seriously ask yourself on what basis you hold them?\n \n If I may, I would like to illustrate my point. I would like to present some arguments along the lines that you have presented. I most certainly do not subscribe to any of them, but I, as you have, ask you to disprove them:\n \n 1. Masturbation causes blindness.\n \n 2. Masturbation is anti-Christian, and we are a predominately Christian society.\n \n 3. Scientific studies have shown that childhood sexual abuse is predominately perpetrated by male family members, therefore, male family members should not be allowed any contact with children.\n \n 4. Heterosexual married couples produce more left handed offspring than homosexual couples. These left handed individual will rise up and demand accommodations in public areas and the workplace, creating an undue fiscal strain on taxpayers and businesses.\n \n 5. The incidence of sickle cell anemia is highest among the black race, therefore, black people should not be allowed to have children.\n \n 6. The majority of drunken driving accidents and the resulting deaths, injuries, and property damages are caused by male drivers, therefore males should not be allowed to drive.\n \n 7. The incidence of violence against women is more predominate among heterosexual couples, therefore heterosexual couples should be banned.\n \n 8. Being a Roman Catholic increases the risk of a child being sexually abused, therefore, the practice of the Roman Catholic religion should be banned.\n \n 9. Insurance industry studies have shown that males have a shorter life span than females, therefore all males should be barred for obtaining life insurance.\n \n 10. Southern people are rednecks.\n \n 11. White, Christian males are bigots.\n \n Absurd? Definitely. Stereotypical? Some definitely are. Inflamitory? Mythical? Misinformation? Lack of knowledge? I can even provide documentation, facts, and logical premises to support many of these arguments. Does that make them any less absurd? I don't think so. Are they any more absurd than some of the statements you have presented? I think not.\n \n \nI don't know, but the purpose of the thread was to debate gay marriage.\n\n \n Then lets stick to gay marriage. What does the incidence rate of HIV have to do with it? What does the number of pedophiles have to do with it? Where is your documentation? Where are your facts that show such a link? Yet you expect us to disprove such fallacies.\n \n \nIt is this \"in your face\" attitude\n\n \n You don't consider statements such as \"It will increase the number of pedifiles\" as being \"in your face\"? You don't consider posting a second hand link to a satarical article from \"The Onion\", and only later when it was pointed out to you, claiming it was in jest, to be \"in your face\"? Hypothetically (to use one of your favorite terms), let's suppose I did understand what you claim to be your intent. How many other anti-gays do you suppose assumed it to be fact? \n \n \nEven if [someone] could factually disprove all of someone's assertions, if he doesn't like you or your methods, you aren't going to get his buy in. \n \n \n You, yourself, have most certainly proven that point \n \n \n Now, do YOU get it?\n \n \n Has any gay person ever intentionally attempted to harm you or someone you care about? The following is but one example of what has actually happened to me. This is not fiction, this is fact.\n \n I don't condiser myself a what many straight people consider a stereotypical gay person. I am not flamboyiant. I dress in \"Dockers\" and \"Polo\" shirts. I do not bring up the subject of my sexual identity, but will not deny it if ask that specific question. I am a degreed engineer.\n \n One time, a group from a particular customer paid a plant visit to my company's facility to check on the progress of a project I (Manager of Manufacturing Engineering) and junior product engineer from our company were working on for them. They were accompanied by one of our company's sales engineers. Lunchtime came and I was tied up in the middle of debugging an injection molding process. The junior engineer (straight, male \"supposedly\" Christian) and the sales engineer (straight, male, Christian, who I did not know very well at all at that time) took the customers to lunch. During lunch, the junior engineer began a triade against me personally, including that I was a \"fairy\", a f@g, a \"homo\", ect., etc., etc.. Needless to say, the customer and the sales engineer were incensed, but not quite the way the junior engineer intended it. The sales engineer reported the incident to the plant manager. The customer's director of purchasing called the president of my company and demanded that the junior engineer be taken off the project or the customer would pull the product. Needless to say, my plant manager got a call from our company president. The junior engineer was given the choice of either formal, public apologizes to the customer, the sales engineer, and me, or submit his resignation. Being the \"good Christian\" he was, he resigned.",

   "Why only two consenting adults? Why not three? or four? or eight? It seems to me that you don't want to discriminate against gays, but do want to discriminate against polygamists. Don't the parties involved in polygamy also have the same right to self-determination?\n\n \n \nActually, legalized gay marriage is a relatively new phenomenon (as my gay buddies have told me in this thread), so the jury's still out.\n\n \n \nUnder the current definition of marriage, it is neither unjust nor inequitable. Anybody who is above the age of consent is free to marry a member of the opposite sex. What you're really argunig for is the redefining of what \"marriage\" is. That's a legitimate function for society to undertake, should it choose to do so. Social mores change with time, maybe it's time to rethink the definition of marriage to include same sex marriage.\n\n \n Wrapped up in those three snippets is the heart of the argument. First of all, same-sex marriage is new in the modern era. It has been legal in earlier times in this culture (insofar as we are the continuation of Western civilization) and in other cultures. To some extent the reason it comes and goes is because the position of women vis-a-vis women changes over history. When men and women are seen more as equals before the law, same-sex marriage rises as a reasonable alternative for those who are attracted to members of their same sex. When culture sees women as subordinate to men, same-sex marriage seems really weird and appears to be a really bad fit for the relationship between two men or two women. Similarly, the idea of one man \"owning\" many women doesn't seem so strange if men are superior to women, but if they're equal, it's quite a shocking idea.\n \n Now, our society has only recently shifted from a mild version of female subjugation (many women might rightly quibble with my use of the term \"mild\") to one of, at least theoretical, equality. Of course, we've also thrown in the concept of \"romance\" to really make things confusing.\n \n With government now viewing a couple as two equal citizens, rather than a dominant man and a subservient woman, the legal logic behind the ban on same-sex marriage no longer exists. That leaves the state with only the arguments based on reasonable and rational societal goals. Those are now seen as rather flimsy.\n \n The reason society can allow same-sex marriage and disallow polygamy is that ALL citizens would be treated equally. ALL citizens could marry one other citizen. NONE could marry more than one. That's one test. The other is whether the restriction on ALL is rational and reasonable. The reason polygamy was banned before Utah could enter the Union was based on the unreasonable and undesireable effects of polygamy on society: the subjugation and exploitation of women and the dangers inherent in a having a large number of unmarried men (left over because some men would take many wives). \n \n [Personally, I think society really needs to grapple with the idea of polygamy. I don't want to encourage the kind of polygamy that exists largely due to the subjugation of women, but respect for self-determination for those few who choose polyamory (whether hetero, homo, or bi) and respect for the religious traditions of many folk around the world both beg for some sort of solution in a modern, global context, though probably a highly regulated one.]\n \n Bans on incestuous marriages also have rational and reasonable bases (plural of basis, nothing to do with baseball). In many states, cousins can marry. In some, they can't. In some, only sterile cousins can marry.\n \n \nBut, I can guarantee you that if gay marriage is forced on society without its approval, an amendment banning it is almost a guarantee. And a new Constitutional amendment banning same sex marriages would be bulletproof. The SOCUS would be unable to rule it unconstitutional because it would represent the newest Constitutional law, so whether or not it violated the previous 5th or 14th would become moot. An analogy would be Prohibition and the subsequent repeal of it.\n\n \n The saddest thing about this whole issue is that the folks pushing the amendment are fully and totally aware that what they are doing is exactly the same as what the prohibitionists did. They are seeking power and dominance not by reason but by inflaming ignorance and hysteria. \n \n Crappy way to lead a nation, if you ask me.",

You're only trying to confuse the issue and you know it. Polygamy is a different subject. If you want to discuss it, take it to the Civil Rights forum. \n\n \n I wasn't attacking her at all. I was asking her to apply her same logic to another situation that would require the redefining of marriage. Her argument was that \"No one has the right to tell two consenting adults whether or not they can engagein a contractual union. Period. I don't give two shits whether or not someone finds it offensive, immoral, wrong, unnatural, or whatever. It's a peron's right to self-determination. He may choose as he see's fit whom he can marry if that individual is of concentual age.\"\n \n If she truly believes that no one has the right to interfere in the contractual rights of consenting adults, why do you have to stop at two consenting adults. See, that's one of the flaws that I see in redefining marriage. It opens the floodgates for marriage to be redefined by any group with enough political clout to do so. If same sex \"marriage\" and not civil unions are allowed, then precedence will have been set for redefining marriage.\n \n\n ...And she has stated it.

Wouldn't advocates of gay marraige have to challenge the current definition of marriage which excludes same-sex marriage?\n\n \n You could go that route.....if you really wanted it to fail. Marriage is one of those things that falls into the category of social mores. Social mores are best changed through evolution, not revolution. For example, I don't see marriage laws as excluding same-sex partners. I see it as specifying opposite sex partners are required for a union to be a marriage. There IS a difference. \n I can guarantee that if gay marriage is forced on the public, a constitutional amendment defining marriage as one man, one woman will quickly follow and there aren't enough blue states to stop it from becoming so.

   "[QUOTE=wsm2506]You may well be right. I most certainly do not understand your motivation for many of the statements you have made in this forum, unless they are based on an irrational prejudice against gay people. However, I am again willing give you the benefit of doubt, which seems to be more than you are willing to give gay people\n \n \n \n It would be very helpful to know which views you do hold personally and why you hold them. Have you seriously ask yourself on what basis you hold them?\n \n If I may, I would like to illustrate my point. I would like to present some arguments along the lines that you have presented. I most certainly do not subscribe to any of them, but I, as you have, ask you to disprove them:\n \n 1. Masturbation causes blindness. I quit when I needed glasses, so you can't go by me. ;)\n \n 2. Masturbation is anti-Christian, and we are a predominately Christian society.  I guess I'm going to Hell, then. \n \n 3. Scientific studies have shown that childhood sexual abuse is predominately perpetrated by male family members, therefore, male family members should not be allowed any contact with children. Unless you're a relative of Michael jackson's, I'd say the probability is extremely low. I'm willing to live with those odds. \n \n 4. Heterosexual married couples produce more left handed offspring than homosexual couples. These left handed individual will rise up and demand accommodations in public areas and the workplace, creating an undue fiscal strain on taxpayers and businesses.Since the union of homosexuals produces zero offspring, we'd have a hard time maintaining SS bennies if there wasn't new blood to pay into the system\n \n 5. The incidence of sickle cell anemia is highest among the black race, therefore, black people should not be allowed to have children.We know enough about sickel cell anemia's spread to guard against a widespread increase. But, if it was highly contagious, you can bet we'd quarantine carriers. \n \n 6. The majority of drunken driving accidents and the resulting deaths, injuries, and property damages are caused by male drivers, therefore males should not be allowed to drive. Again, the statistics say that the risk is low, much lower than the chances of young SMS's acquiring HIV, I might add. \n \n 7. The incidence of violence against women is more predominate among heterosexual couples, therefore heterosexual couples should be banned. Again, low, acceptable risk.\n \n 8. Being a Roman Catholic increases the risk of a child being sexually abused, therefore, the practice of the Roman Catholic religion should be banned.again, low acceptable risk level\n \n 9. Insurance industry studies have shown that males have a shorter life span than females, therefore all males should be barred for obtaining life insurance.They aren't barred, but they do pay a penalty for being male.\n \n 10. Southern people are rednecks. Only those who spend too much time in the sun, unprotected.\n \n 11. White, Christian males are bigots. Only those who spend too much time in the sun, unprotected.\n \n\n Absurd? Definitely. Stereotypical? Some definitely are. Inflamitory? Mythical? Misinformation? Lack of knowledge? I can even provide documentation, facts, and logical premises to support many of these arguments. Does that make them any less absurd? I don't think so. Are they any more absurd than some of the statements you have presented? I think not.\n\n The difference between my statements and yours is that the majority of Americans aren't being asked to change who can drive, wank, or anything other than redefine marriage.\n You could have chosen to ignore what I wrote, just as I chose to give some silly responses to you. I didn't jump in your face, call you names, etc., I maintained my civility in spite of your attempt to goad me.\n \n\n Then lets stick to gay marriage. What does the incidence rate of HIV have to do with it?  It is widely believed by straights that homosexuals \"recruit\" straight kids, so, following the argument logically, it would also be assumed that endorsing gay marriage would lead to an increase in homosexuality and therefore, the spread of HIV. That's the argument that I was attempting to convey. \n What does the number of pedophiles have to do with it? Many straights immediately think \"pedophile\" when the word homosexual is used. It's almost Pavlovian amongst some ill-informed straights.\n Where is your documentation?  We're talking perceptions here, not necessarily facts. I was throwing all of them out there for comment so that we could see which were real and which weren't. \n Where are your facts that show such a link? see above\n Yet you expect us to disprove such fallacies.\n\n Not necessarily. I expected you to comment dispassionately on their veracity or lack thereof, though. \n \n\n You don't consider statements such as \"It will increase the number of pedifiles\" as being \"in your face\"? You don't consider posting a second hand link to a satarical article from \"The Onion\", and only later when it was pointed out to you, claiming it was in jest, to be \"in your face\"? Hypothetically (to use one of your favorite terms), let's suppose I did understand what you claim to be your intent. How many other anti-gays do you suppose assumed it to be fact? \n\n Anyone who has been following the thread from its inception should have known that the intent was to debate the pros and cons of gay marriage. I started Post #1 with MY fiscal concerns. They were addressed and my fiscal concerns were found to be unfounded.\n We, next, moved on to health and moral concerns (see post #97)\n In post 99, I wrote:\n \n\n Thank you for laying out the basis for the next part of the debate. Unlike the economics of gay marriage, the moral repercussions aren't as easily quantified.\n Here are some of the \"moral concerns\" that I've heard expressed. I don't necessarily subscribe to them, but I'm laying them on the table for discussion.\n \n 1. Legalizing gay marriage will promote homosexuality, which is an unnatural condition\n 2. Legalizing gay marriage will corrupt straight children\n 3. It will increase the number of pedophiles\n 4. It is anti-Christian and America is predominantly a Christian society\n 5. It will weaken the institution of marriage\n \n We can start with these and add or subtract as we see fit. \n \n And later in the post\n \n Again, thank you for setting the framework for further debate. Here are some of the health concerns expressed.\n 1. AIDS is spread predominantly through homosexuals and legalizing gay marriage would lead to an increase in homosexuals and therefore AIDS\n 2. STDs. There is a greater incidence of STDs from gay transmission\n 3. Lifespan. Gays die at an earlier age than straights, so we should be discouraging homosexuality as we do smoking\n I'll have to leave it here for now, but will finish later this evening.\n \n\n Now, where exacting, in the above post, am I making \"in your face\" statements? There was no hostility in my posts then or now. I was simply putting down arguments that straights have expressed for not wanting gay marriage in an attempt to generate a dialogue. I even reitterated my desire to not have the debate degrade into hostility by stating that I woul;dn't reply to uncivil responses.\n \n\n You, yourself, have most certainly proven that point \n Now, do YOU get it?\n\n I understand the problem beter than you, evidently. I KNOW that you have to address straights' misconceptions, paranoia and fears while maintaining a non-threatening demeanor. So far, I've seen very little chance of that occurring if we can't even do so amongst reasonable open-minded, logical people. This isn't meant to be taken as confrontational, but if I was debating you in person on whether or not gays should be allowed to marry, you wouldn't be able to convince me that they should. Jaxian, on the other hand might. The reason isn't that his arguments are any more fctual than yours, it's because of his demeanor. It's honest, non-confrontational and conciliatory, when necessary. He allows room for people to admit that they were wrong without fear of being beaten over the head with the fact, he acknowledges when negative facts are presented and doesn't attempt to cloud the argument or deflect it and he does so in a credible, non-threatening way. Many times, the winner of an informal debate isn't the one with the best facts; it's the one with the most convincing argument and a convincing argument is more than just facts. The debater has to appear credible, likable and reasonable. \n \n\n Has any gay person ever intentionally attempted to harm you or someone you care about? The following is but one example of what has actually happened to me. This is not fiction, this is fact.\n \n I don't condiser myself a what many straight people consider a stereotypical gay person. I am not flamboyiant. I dress in \"Dockers\" and \"Polo\" shirts. I do not bring up the subject of my sexual identity, but will not deny it if ask that specific question. I am a degreed engineer.\n \n One time, a group from a particular customer paid a plant visit to my company's facility to check on the progress of a project I (Manager of Manufacturing Engineering) and junior product engineer from our company were working on for them. They were accompanied by one of our company's sales engineers. Lunchtime came and I was tied up in the middle of debugging an injection molding process. The junior engineer (straight, male \"supposedly\" Christian) and the sales engineer (straight, male, Christian, who I did not know very well at all at that time) took the customers to lunch. During lunch, the junior engineer began a triade against me personally, including that I was a \"fairy\", a f@g, a \"homo\", ect., etc., etc.. Needless to say, the customer and the sales engineer were incensed, but not quite the way the junior engineer intended it. The sales engineer reported the incident to the plant manager. The customer's director of purchasing called the president of my company and demanded that the junior engineer be taken off the project or the customer would pull the product. Needless to say, my plant manager got a call from our company president. The junior engineer was given the choice of either formal, public apologizes to the customer, the sales engineer, and me, or submit his resignation. Being the \"good Christian\" he was, he resigned.\n\n \n First, I'd like to thank you for sharing that story. I'm sure it was a very uncomfortble incident for all involved. And I think that your customer demonstrated what many claim doesn't exist, ethics in business. \n Second, I'd like to say that the junior engineer was no Christian. Just because many Christians don't think that homosexuality is moral, it isn't an excuse for them to act un-Christian towards anyone. Jesus taught us to love everyone as we love ourselves.\n \n Third, you asked me what I believed and said that maybe if you knew my personal beliefs, it would help. OK, here goes.\n 1. I believe that the push for gay marriage is \"all about the Benjamins\" but, not in the way that I first thought. My initial concern was the creation of more dependents that would be added to Federal outlays. The CBO analysis convinced me otherwise.\n 2. Someone told me that a $30 marriage license would have saved them $thousands in legal fees to give his partner equivalent legal standing to a married partner. That's a significant financial burden, IMO.\n 3. Marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman.\n 4. I am in favor of civil unions for gays, not marriage because of my religious belief above.\n 5. I don't believe that gays are any more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexuals.\n 6. I still believe that there are increased health risks for males associated with practicing homosexuality over males practicing heterosexuality.\n 7. I'm not fully convinced that homosexuality isn't at least partially nurture and not 100% nature and therefore, I'm not 100% convinced that some recruitment or convincing doesn't take place.\n 8. I think that allowing gay civil unions may help reduce the spread of HIV by providing a legal stabilizing institution.\n 9. I'm not sure how to reconcile increased employer costs as a result of new legislation that would mandate them to pay for healthcare of same sex spouses. Perhaps the effect wouldn't be significant and my concern is unfounded.\n 10. I'm not a homophobe, gay basher or bigot, but I am a little ignorant about committed gay relationships. This thread has given me much food for thought in that respect.",

   "While I believe that you were in tune to what I was attempting to do, I saw enough hostility amongst others to know that they either didn't or couldn't maintain civility over the long haul. It is this \"in your face\" attitude that causes straight people to harden their position, not soften it. Even if you could factually disprove all of someone's assertions, if he doesn't like you or your methods, you aren't going to get his buy in. That's just human nature.\n\n \n I do agree that it is difficult to convince someone that they are wrong if they feel that you are very hostile, though I understand why people are very hostile here.

Still, I am very opinionated, and I love to debate.\n \n \nlol, so if we make gay relationships illegal we would have no problem? ;) When sodomy was illegal, did that solve the problem?\n\n \n Woah now, wait just a second.

They are consenting adults whos love is the same as yours. Philosophically, all of the arguments for equal rights and social acceptance do apply.\n\n \n I actually agree with this; most arguments used to support same-sex marriage can be used to support polygamy as well. The difference is that there are argument which can be used against polygamy which do not apply to same-sex marriage. The primary argument against polygamy is that it is unequal and unrealistic. Applying marriage across ten people would in theory allow one person to spread his benefits of marriage across nine others instead of just one. For example, nine other people in a family could get that one man's health insurance instead of just one in a current-day marriage. Not only would this give polygamy benefits over other marriages, but it would be rather unrealistic to give that many people health benefits just because only one person has them. So it is unequal and impractical. Now we could in theory implement a form of polygamy where each member is allowed to give his or her benefits to only one other person, but how is that different from what we have today? Currently polygamous people can marry one other person and give that person benefits; technically their marriage is already recognized under the law.\n \n So creating polygamous marriage is a bad idea; we don't need it and it would create inequality. You may not like my reasoning on the subject, but if you do not, you had better have some reasoning of your own to back up your dislike of polygamy. If one does not have a reason to disallow polygamy, then he is not justified in disallowing it. So tell us that reason. If it also applies to same-sex marriage, then we can discuss its validity. But simply saying \"if we can allow same-sex marriage, we can allow polygamy\" is not enough because you have not given any reason that polygamy should not be allowed. When you give that reason, we can discuss whether it actually applies to same-sex marriage or not. I gave a reason to disallow polygamy which does not apply to same-sex marriage.\n \n \nNot quite a slippery slope. What argument (besides practical problems which can always be gotten around) would you use to deny polygamous rights? Incestous relationships between consenting adults? At what point does good and acceptable become creepy and weird? Brother and sister? Father and son?\n\n \n Well, I discussed polygamy above. But how about incest? Well in my opinion incest too often results in children who are mentally disabled and is an abuse of the natural bonds of love created by the closeness between families. Again, this reason to disallow incestuous marriage does not apply to same-sex marriage. If you do not like my reasoning, again you simply must have a reason to dislike incest. The only reason you specified is that it is \"creepy and weird\". I think we can both agree that creepy and weird is a matter of opinion and is not any reason to take away the rights of others. So why do you dislike incest? Think about it, and think about whether those reasons apply to same-sex marriage. If they do, posts them here, and again, we will discuss their validity.\n \n \nThe argument for straight marriage over gay marriage is based in religion usually, so there is no slippery slope there. Anything besides man and woman is simply not allowed. You cannot use that justification.\n\n \n Sure I can. The argument in favor of same-sex marriage is based on religion often as well; whole bunches of people hold religious beliefs which state that marriage is between any two people who are not related by family.\n \n Furthermore, there is a very dangerous slippery slope to be run down by disallowing same-sex marriage. If the battle against same-sex marriage wins, we are setting a precedent that the government is allowed to disallow the rights of minorities any time it wants. With the denial of same-sex marriage, what other rights are soon to follow? Will we lose the right to cheat on our spouses? Maybe that one isn't so bad. Maybe you'd vote in favor of removing that right. If so, then you should see my point. What about divorcing our spouses; might we soon lose that right? What about having children out of wedlock? What about practicing a religion that the government has not approved? What about speaking out against the government? What about eating unhealthy food? At what point does restricting freedom end? Such a slippery slope is a far more dangerous one to walk down than the \"what if people allow polygamy!\" one. Everyone is in the minority on some issue, and everyone is in danger of losing their rights if same-sex marriage is not legalized.",

   "\n Still, since you chose this sentence to pull out, allow me to explain why it is a bad idea for the public administrator to listen to everything the public demands. The public, first of all, is very uninformed about how to educate children, and they are very influenced by the media. They tend to hear some vague piece of information, and instead of researching it themselves, demand that something be unreasonably changed. The truth is, no one can be informed about everything, and the mass of the public isn't informed at all except on that which sends them into an outrage. Furthermore, parents tend to be interested more in what benefits their own children more than in what benefits the most children overall. Considering all of this, it is best to leave these decisions in the hands of someone who is an expert on the subject matter and who has a vested interest in making sure his school is successful, not in certain children succeeding over others or certain children getting good grades. \n\n \n I disagree. The public consists of a very large number of people. They may be somewhat uninformed as individuals, but collectively a large group knows more about PUBLIC decision making than a FEW \"experts\". The same way that the public should be allowed to make the decision of whether or not we should allow gay marriage. Gays should, and are, allowed to make decisions about who they'll live with, spend time with, work with, etc. etc. That's an INDIVIDUAL decision - not up to the public, OR an expert. \n \n \nAs for things being liberal, well I'm not certain this is a liberal viewpoint, though it may be. I get my reasoning from the Federalist Papers, which I think provide much insight into these sorts of situations. So I do think it a Federalist viewpoint. Though you say \"liberal\" as though that is all you need say in order to show that something is bad. \"Liberal\" and \"conservative\" are just different viewpoints, each one requiring reasoning and evidence to prove themselves correct. Do not make the mistake of immitating radio show hosts in this respect; if you believe something is bad, you must have a reason for that belief, not just term \"liberal\" or \"conservative\".\n\n \n I try not to be a name caller. Distinguishing between liberals and conservatives isn't name calling IMO. It's one of many reasons talk radio is popular. One of the strategies of today's liberals is play \"moderate\". You'll see those who claim to be a social liberal, but a fiscal conservative. That's not really possible - to be a social liberal requires money, and they'll try to cover it up in a debate. It's important to distinguish between the two labels. Though we may not like it, having political opinions requires taking sides. Picking and choosing, favoring one sides befefits without that same sides subsequent costs is common today.\n \n \n \n \n \nBeyond this, same-sex marriage is a conservative value by nature, as conservatives tend to value keeping the government out of people's lifestyle and their decisions. Conservatives tend to hate it when the government interferes with people living their lives. On the other hand, it is also a liberal issue. Liberals tend to believe that the overall happiness of the people can be sometimes be increased through government interference. Republicans and those who identify themselves as conservatives today tend to disagree with same-sex marriage not based on conservative principle but on moral or religious principle. In my arguments, I intend to prove that banning same-sex marriage is harmful and morally wrong, and that although you are entitled to your religous beliefs on the subject, you are not entitled to take away the rights of those who hold different beliefs.\n\n \n See above about the difference between a ~public~ decision, and a ~private~ decision.\n \n \n \nI'm guessing that truly GLAAD was angry at something he wrote about same-sex marriage but that they probably would not have targetted someone very liberal. But what is the point here? Do you disagree with same-sex marriage because most gay rights groups support liberals? \n\n \n Mainly, yes.\n \n \n \nAs for hatefully pointing fingers, certainly it could just as easily be said that most opponents of same-sex marriage hatefully point fingers at gay people. It's not an evil thing to do, it is the way people try to win civil rights battles. \n\n \n I hope you are seeing from several of us here, (those of us against gay marriage) have reasons for being against it that have nothing to do with a personal dislike of gay people.\n \n \n \nA tool? Surely you cannot call the rights of millions of people a tool, and surely you do not suspect that liberalism has some great intent to take over the world. Society itself has become more liberal over time, and that in itself is the only liberalism that has entered our elementary schools. Perhaps Gay rights is not a tool by which liberalism attempts to force itself upon others, and preventing it is a tool by which conservatism attempts to prevent society from becoming more liberal. People who have grown up knowing only one certain set of values watch society move away from that set of values and do what they can to stop that movement, even if it means stopping equality. I haven't decided that what I've just said is accurate for certain, but the more I speak with people, the more true that seems to become. \n\n \n Right. Society has indeed become more liberal over time. Legalizing gay marriage will be an additional liberal victory.\n \n \n \n \nIn some off-sense, I could say that you have the right to marry the person you love while a gay person does not. Though to explain it more thouroughly, you do not have a right that any gay person does not have. By legalizing same-sex marriage, I am indeed suggesting that we give everyone the right to marry someone of the same sex, not just gay people. However it is also true that this situation is not equal or free. The lack of freedom is present in that people do not have the right to marry the person of their choosing. The lack of equality is clear not because you have some right that a gay person does not, but because the right to marry is designed so that only heterosexuals will use it. When I say that gays do not have equal rights, I do not mean they do not have as many rights but that our civil rights do not provide equality to everyone, though they certainly could be extended to do so. When I say that it is wrong to take away the rights of gays, I take it for granted that everyone understands that we are taking away this right from everyone, but that this right we are taking away would only be used by gays and they are therefore only the ones losing anything. \n\n \n As things are now, gays AND single, companionless people share the burden equally in providing the tax benefits etc. that married couples enjoy. If gay people are newly included in these benefits, then single companionless people will be burdened far more than they are now.\n \n \nSlavery was long part of our society until it was abolished. What is long part of our society is not necessarily good or just, and we should not give special privleges to things just because they have been in our legal books the longest. We should strive to continaully evaluate ourselves as people, and where we can increase equality, freedom, and happines, we should strive to do so. Everyone deserves special rights.\n\n \n If everyone has something, it's not very special. :) \n \n \n \n \nWell, GLAAD's agenda is equality for gay people, and I consider that a very positive agenda. But whether their campaign uses positive or negative tactics, I do not know. I get lots of mail from GLAAD asking me to donate money, and that mail is generally positive. \"Make a difference!\" You know what I mean; you'd have to expect that sort of stuff. I haven't paid much attention to their political tactics. Does it really matter? \n\n \n Their website looks pretty negative and liberal to me. In the spread of liberalism, I think it matters a LOT.\n \n \n \n \n Oh, well I think none of us have any doubt that promiscuity among gay men has led to the spread of AIDS. That isn't attacking them. It is stripping them of the right to marry that attacks them. What I mean is that I think people are looking at the problem that more gay people have AIDS than straight people, and they say, \"Well, we should deny the rights of gay people to discourage being gay. That way less people will get AIDS.\" My argument is that this is discouraging the wrong thing, and because people are targetting the wrong thing, they are actually increasing the cases of AIDS by denying gay rights instead of decreasing them.\n \n Well, hopefully that clears things up!\n\n \n Stripping them of the right to marry? They never had the right. There is a difference between taking something away, and not allowing it in the first place.",

   "I didn't say that at all. I just said there were different issues involved, beause polygamous activity is indeed illegal.\n\n \n I'm misunderstanding. The issues are different because polygamous activity is illegal? Do you mean to say that if homosexual activity was illegal you would not argue for it?\n \n \n\n But different issues.\n\n \n It is different, no denying that. Why do the arguments for homosexual love not justify polygamous love?\n \n \n\n The argument of consenting adults who love can be applied to any relationship between adults which does not involve rape.\n\n \n Agreed, including polygamous and incestuous relationships.\n \n \n\n Please explain your second sentence further. How do these arguments apply specifically to gays and polygamists?\n\n \n You made my point already. Any argument for an alternative union apply to other sorts of alternative unions.\n \n \n\n Ah, yes, here we go again. I'm very surprised you didn't mention sex with a human and a sheep.\n\n \n I would include that but a sheep cannot give consent. I would argue that it doesn't matter since animals should not have rights as humans do, but that requires more arguments than I'm willing to put forth at the moment.\n \n \n\n I am not arguing for or against polygamous rights nor for or against any of the other rights you mention. Can we please stay on the topic of gay rights? Do you have a logical argument against THAT?\n\n \n No, nor would I attempt to. I have no problem with gay rights or gay marriage, I have a problem with the inherent hypocrisy I see when gay activists argue that \"the love is the same\" and \"we're people and we just want to love each other\" and then blast other alternative marriage. What others do in the bedroom is none of your or my business, and who I marry is none of your business either. It doesn't affect you :)\n \n \n\n It depends on which religion. Gay marriages often take place in a religious institution too. How do you know there is no slippery slope with straight religious marriages, but \"not quite\" a slippery slope involving gay marriage? What is \"not quite\" a slippery slope?\n\n \n Because religion (for the sake of argument, say Catholics) bans any marriage besides between a man and a woman. There can be no slippery slope because there is no argument, only dogmatic laws. An argument can apply to different situations whether or not they are the authors intent, dogmatic law only applies to what the priests apply it to. The \"not quite\" was a bit of sarcasm.\n \n This is not a \"slippery slope\", this is a logical step.

   "Woah now, wait just a second. Polygamous activity is certainly not illegal. Banning polygamous activity would be a harsh limitation on freedom, this is certain.\n\n \n Agreed. If your going to allow one sort of alternative marriage, I cannot see how you can justify banning other sorts (besides practical issues, and practical issues should not, philosophically if not practically, interfere with civil rights).\n \n \n\n I actually agree with this; most arguments used to support same-sex marriage can be used to support polygamy as well. The difference is that there are argument which can be used against polygamy which do not apply to same-sex marriage. The primary argument against polygamy is that it is unequal and unrealistic. Applying marriage across ten people would in theory allow one person to spread his benefits of marriage across nine others instead of just one. For example, nine other people in a family could get that one man's health insurance instead of just one in a current-day marriage. Not only would this give polygamy benefits over other marriages, but it would be rather unrealistic to give that many people health benefits just because only one person has them. So it is unequal and impractical. Now we could in theory implement a form of polygamy where each member is allowed to give his or her benefits to only one other person, but how is that different from what we have today? Currently polygamous people can marry one other person and give that person benefits; technically their marriage is already recognized under the law.\n\n \n Agreed, there are practical problems associated with polygamy. However, that does not negate that their relationship should be recognized in some manner. Perhaps the answer is the change marriage entirely, I don't know.\n \n \n\n So creating polygamous marriage is a bad idea; we don't need it and it would create inequality.\n\n \n Do we \"need\" homosexual marriage? There are those who wish to have polygamous marriage.\n \n \n\n You may not like my reasoning on the subject, but if you do not, you had better have some reasoning of your own to back up your dislike of polygamy.\n\n \n I don't dislike polygamy.\n \n \n\n If one does not have a reason to disallow polygamy, then he is not justified in disallowing it. So tell us that reason.\n\n \n I am arguing that polygamy should be allowed, under the same reasoning that gay marriage is allowed.\n \n \n\n If it also applies to same-sex marriage, then we can discuss its validity. But simply saying \"if we can allow same-sex marriage, we can allow polygamy\" is not enough because you have not given any reason that polygamy should not be allowed. When you give that reason, we can discuss whether it actually applies to same-sex marriage or not. I gave a reason to disallow polygamy which does not apply to same-sex marriage.\n\n \n Practical problems are not a good justification to ban civil liberties, especially when the argument for gay marriage is not that it's \"easy\" but that it's \"right\". Whether or not polygamy is \"easy\" makes little difference in terms of if it's \"right\".\n \n \n\n Well, I discussed polygamy above. But how about incest? Well in my opinion incest too often results in children who are mentally disabled and is an abuse of the natural bonds of love created by the closeness between families.\n\n \n Abuse is something that is fought against anyway.\n \n Children are not a pre-requisite of marriage. Homosexuals cannot have children at all, so the state of the children should not bar incestuous relationships. Also, we do not ban marriage between couples who may (even if it's a good chance) have disabled or mentally challenged children, incestuous or no. \"Abuse of the natural bonds of love created by the closeness between families\"? That sounds suspiciously like a moral argument against a certain relationship. What if I were to argue that homosexual relationships were an abuse of the natural bonds of love between opposite sexes?\n \n \n\n Again, this reason to disallow incestuous marriage does not apply to same-sex marriage. If you do not like my reasoning, again you simply must have a reason to dislike incest.\n\n \n I don't dislike incest. I don't participate myself, but I see no reason why incestuous relationships should be demonized by those who are supposedly open-minded about relationships. They love each other, who are you to keep them apart? Regardless of whether or not they have children, or if those children are retarded, they have the right to love each other.\n \n \n\n The only reason you specified is that it is \"creepy and weird\". I think we can both agree that creepy and weird is a matter of opinion and is not any reason to take away the rights of others.\n\n \n Exactly! So, why is incest and polygamy wrong? Only because of the practical problems with implementing polygamy and what might happen with the children in incest? Are those valid reasons for not giving them civil liberties?\n \n \n\n So why do you dislike incest? Think about it, and think about whether those reasons apply to same-sex marriage. If they do, posts them here, and again, we will discuss their validity.\n\n \n I have no problem with incestuous relationships or polygamous relationships. It appears that you do.\n \n \n \nSure I can. The argument in favor of same-sex marriage is based on religion often as well; whole bunches of people hold religious beliefs which state that marriage is between any two people who are not related by family.\n\n \n However, much of the opposition to homosexual marriage is based in religion is it not?\n \n \n\n Furthermore, there is a very dangerous slippery slope to be run down by disallowing same-sex marriage. If the battle against same-sex marriage wins, we are setting a precedent that the government is allowed to disallow the rights of minorities any time it wants. With the denial of same-sex marriage, what other rights are soon to follow?\n\n \n Agreed. I don't believe the gov't should be in our personal lives any more than absolutely necessary.\n \n \n\n Will we lose the right to cheat on our spouses? Maybe that one isn't so bad. Maybe you'd vote in favor of removing that right. If so, then you should see my point.\n\n \n You misunderstand my stance. You believe I am arguing for polygamy and incest as a rhetorical device against homosexual marriage. I am not. I am sincerely arguing for polygamy and incestuous relationships based on the same arguments that you are using.\n \n I realize that I am a lot more liberal in personal matters than many liberals, but I do not think the gov't should be involved in our personal lives.\n \n \n\n What about divorcing our spouses; might we soon lose that right?\n\n \n Unfortunately, there are situations where you do not have the right to divorce. There was a case recently where a woman was not allowed to divorce because she was pregnant.\n \n \n\n What about having children out of wedlock? What about practicing a religion that the government has not approved? What about speaking out against the government? What about eating unhealthy food? At what point does restricting freedom end? Such a slippery slope is a far more dangerous one to walk down than the \"what if people allow polygamy!\" one. Everyone is in the minority on some issue, and everyone is in danger of losing their rights if same-sex marriage is not legalized.\n\n \n I don't believe that particular slippery slope. Certainly it would restrict freedom, and be a step toward fascism. But \"everyone will lose all their rights if this isn't legal!\" is a textbook slippery slope fallacy.",

You, however, are for one sort of alternative relationship but seem to blast any other sort. That is hypocrisy.\n \n \n\n OK. Suppose a religion ( for the sake of argument, say the Metropliotian Community Church, a Christian denomination) DOES recognize same sex marriage?\n\n \n So what? If they do that is their business. My only point was that there is no slippery slope with a religion defining marriage between a man and a woman because a religious argument does not need to be rational or logical as your argument does. A rational and logical argument can apply to things you don't necessarily agree to, while dogmatic laws do not. God says exactly what he means, if he meant something different he would have said so.",

   "I do agree that it is difficult to convince someone that they are wrong if they feel that you are very hostile, though I understand why people are very hostile here. As I've said, this topic strikes very close to home for a lot of people here.\n\n \n That goes both ways. What you're attempting to do is undo fundamental Christian beliefs held by the majority of Americans. No small task, I might add.\n \n\n I would love to discuss other issues, though I am not nearly as strong an arguer in those cases. It is my opinion that gay rights is the only issue under debate right now in which there is one side that is clearly correct. All other issues have valid points on both sides of the argument and it is a matter of determining which side has the best points. Still, I am very opinionated, and I love to debate.\n\n To me, gay marriage isn't a cut and dry issue. While the US isn't a theocracy, our laws and social mores are religion-influenced and that can't be easily dismissed, IMO.\n \n\n Woah now, wait just a second. Polygamous activity is certainly not illegal. Banning polygamous activity would be a harsh limitation on freedom, this is certain.\n I actually agree with this; most arguments used to support same-sex marriage can be used to support polygamy as well. The difference is that there are argument which can be used against polygamy which do not apply to same-sex marriage. The primary argument against polygamy is that it is unequal and unrealistic. Applying marriage across ten people would in theory allow one person to spread his benefits of marriage across nine others instead of just one. For example, nine other people in a family could get that one man's health insurance instead of just one in a current-day marriage. Not only would this give polygamy benefits over other marriages, but it would be rather unrealistic to give that many people health benefits just because only one person has them. So it is unequal and impractical. Now we could in theory implement a form of polygamy where each member is allowed to give his or her benefits to only one other person, but how is that different from what we have today? Currently polygamous people can marry one other person and give that person benefits; technically their marriage is already recognized under the law.\n\n \n Interesting that you would argue against polygamy on the grounds that I used to argue against gay marriage. :) \n \n\n So creating polygamous marriage is a bad idea; we don't need it and it would create inequality. You may not like my reasoning on the subject, but if you do not, you had better have some reasoning of your own to back up your dislike of polygamy. If one does not have a reason to disallow polygamy, then he is not justified in disallowing it. So tell us that reason. If it also applies to same-sex marriage, then we can discuss its validity. But simply saying \"if we can allow same-sex marriage, we can allow polygamy\" is not enough because you have not given any reason that polygamy should not be allowed. When you give that reason, we can discuss whether it actually applies to same-sex marriage or not. I gave a reason to disallow polygamy which does not apply to same-sex marriage.\n\n I believe that the argument for polygamy would be analogous to the argument used by gays, that is you are discriminating against a \"group\" \n \n\n Well, I discussed polygamy above. But how about incest? Well in my opinion incest too often results in children who are mentally disabled and is an abuse of the natural bonds of love created by the closeness between families. Again, this reason to disallow incestuous marriage does not apply to same-sex marriage. If you do not like my reasoning, again you simply must have a reason to dislike incest. The only reason you specified is that it is \"creepy and weird\". I think we can both agree that creepy and weird is a matter of opinion and is not any reason to take away the rights of others. So why do you dislike incest? Think about it, and think about whether those reasons apply to same-sex marriage. If they do, posts them here, and again, we will discuss their validity.\n\n Again, I believe that the same argument used by gays can be used to argue in favor of incest.\n \n\n Sure I can. The argument in favor of same-sex marriage is based on religion often as well; whole bunches of people hold religious beliefs which state that marriage is between any two people who are not related by family.\n\n And it is those people that you want ignored when it comes to their religious beliefs against homosexuality. You can't use religious beliefs as an argument against incest and then turn around and say that they aren't also valid reasons against gay marriage. Either you accept that the religious beliefs hold for all or they hold for none. No a la catre choosing. ;)\n \n\n Furthermore, there is a very dangerous slippery slope to be run down by disallowing same-sex marriage. If the battle against same-sex marriage wins, we are setting a precedent that the government is allowed to disallow the rights of minorities any time it wants.\n\n I still don't see it as disallowing the rights of a minority. Everyone has the right to marry a member of the opposite sex. Nobody is discriminated against due to race, religion. sex, etc. \n \n\n With the denial of same-sex marriage, what other rights are soon to follow? Will we lose the right to cheat on our spouses? Maybe that one isn't so bad. Maybe you'd vote in favor of removing that right. If so, then you should see my point.\n\n IIRC, many states still have laws against adultery, so that one won't work. ;)\n \n\n What about divorcing our spouses; might we soon lose that right? \n\n Prior to no-fault divorce, there had to be a reason for a couple to get divorced. That wasn't so far-fetched.\n \n\n What about having children out of wedlock? \n\n That was once a no-no, too.\n \n\n What about practicing a religion that the government has not approved? What about speaking out against the government? \n\n 1st Amendment guarantees against that. There is no applicable statute for gay marriage.\n \n\n What about eating unhealthy food? At what point does restricting freedom end? \n\n Good question. I've been asking that one since the first gun control law in 1968. If you can find an answer to that one, you're a damn good fortuneteller.\n \n\n Such a slippery slope is a far more dangerous one to walk down than the \"what if people allow polygamy!\" one. Everyone is in the minority on some issue, and everyone is in danger of losing their rights if same-sex marriage is not legalized.\n\n \n We're already sliding down the slippery slope, IMO. It's just a question of how steep do we want the slope.",

   "Wrapped up in those three snippets is the heart of the argument. First of all, same-sex marriage is new in the modern era. It has been legal in earlier times in this culture (insofar as we are the continuation of Western civilization) and in other cultures. To some extent the reason it comes and goes is because the position of women vis-a-vis women changes over history. When men and women are seen more as equals before the law, same-sex marriage rises as a reasonable alternative for those who are attracted to members of their same sex. When culture sees women as subordinate to men, same-sex marriage seems really weird and appears to be a really bad fit for the relationship between two men or two women. Similarly, the idea of one man \"owning\" many women doesn't seem so strange if men are superior to women, but if they're equal, it's quite a shocking idea.\n \n Now, our society has only recently shifted from a mild version of female subjugation (many women might rightly quibble with my use of the term \"mild\") to one of, at least theoretical, equality. Of course, we've also thrown in the concept of \"romance\" to really make things confusing.\n\n \n I'd like to see some references for same-sex marriage being generally practiced and not just \"tolerated\". Everything I find seems to indicate that male/female unions are the natural state from antiquity to the present.\n \n \n\n \"The researches of several recent writers, notably those of Starcke and Westermarck, confirming in part and further developing the earlier conclusions of Darwin and Spencer, have established a probability that marriage or pairing between one man and one woman, though the union be often transitory and the rule frequently violated, is the typical form of sexual union from the infancy of the human race\" (History of Matrimonial Institutions, I, pp. 90, 91).\n \n\n and \n \n\n To the modern Western mind it is surprising how common same-sex unions and even marriages have been in other times and other cultures. While there has been plenty of anxiety about these unions as well, they have at least been tolerated in most societies-except in Western society since the thirteenth century.\n http://www.simonsays.com/titles/0684824043/sameex1a.html\n \n\n \n \n\n With government now viewing a couple as two equal citizens, rather than a dominant man and a subservient woman, the legal logic behind the ban on same-sex marriage no longer exists. That leaves the state with only the arguments based on reasonable and rational societal goals. Those are now seen as rather flimsy.\n\n I disagree. The legal system still has many laws that favor a woman over a man, especially in child custody law, but extending into other areas, such as real estate. For example, in Michigan, a married man cannot buy a house without his wife's consent, but it is legal for the wife to buy a house without the husband's consent. I found out that one the hard way when my wife and I were relocating from PA 20 years ago. I had to fly her out here, last minute, to sign papers before I could close on a house.\n \n\n The reason society can allow same-sex marriage and disallow polygamy is that ALL citizens would be treated equally. ALL citizens could marry one other citizen. NONE could marry more than one. That's one test.\n\n Here's where your logic is flawed. You assert that it is legal to define marriage arbitrarily as \"two parties\", but illegal to define it as 3 or more. This is no different that our current situation. The law currently defines marriage as one man, one woman. It is argued by you and others, that this is discriminatory against same sex partners. Polygamists would argue that the number 2 is just as arbitrary as saying that only one man and one woman constitutes marriage and use your same argument. All citizens would be treated equally. All citizens could marry X other citizens. \n [quote]\n The other is whether the restriction on ALL is rational and reasonable. The reason polygamy was banned before Utah could enter the Union was based on the unreasonable and undesireable effects of polygamy on society: the subjugation and exploitation of women and the dangers inherent in a having a large number of unmarried men (left over because some men would take many wives). \n \n [Personally, I think society really needs to grapple with the idea of polygamy. I don't want to encourage the kind of polygamy that exists largely due to the subjugation of women, but respect for self-determination for those few who choose polyamory (whether hetero, homo, or bi) and respect for the religious traditions of many folk around the world both beg for some sort of solution in a modern, global context, though probably a highly regulated one.]\n \n\n Bans on incestuous marriages also have rational and reasonable bases (plural of basis, nothing to do with baseball). In many states, cousins can marry. In some, they can't. In some, only sterile cousins can marry.\n\n Rational and reasonable as in religious or morally? You do know that the fear of getetic abnormalities from mating within one's family has been largely disproven, don't you?\n \n\n The saddest thing about this whole issue is that the folks pushing the amendment are fully and totally aware that what they are doing is exactly the same as what the prohibitionists did. They are seeking power and dominance not by reason but by inflaming ignorance and hysteria. \n \n Crappy way to lead a nation, if you ask me.\n\n \n That's the danger of ticking off the majority in a \"democratic\" society. (I put democratic in quotes because we are a Cnstitutionally-limited Republic...on paper) emoticon_rolleyes",

   "That goes both ways. What you're attempting to do is undo fundamental Christian beliefs held by the majority of Americans. No small task, I might add.\n\n \n I am not attempting to undo fundamental Christian beliefs, I am attempting to give people equality under the law regardless of their beliefs. As I have argued in my previous posts, I do believe that if anyone is trying to undo their opponents beliefs, it is the opponents of same-sex marriage attempting to undo the beliefs of the supporters by illegalizing the practice of a certain belief. If you imply that I am offending people by stating that it is immoral to oppose same-sex marriage, well that may be, and I do not doubt it to be the case. However, it is necessary for my argument to say such things, just as it is necessary for your argument to offend gay people. In what I said there, I was not saying that offending gay people is a reason we should allow same-sex marriage, I was saying that it is understandable why people seem hostile to you.\n \n \nTo me, gay marriage isn't a cut and dry issue. While the US isn't a theocracy, our laws and social mores are religion-influenced and that can't be easily dismissed, IMO.\n\n \n I did not mean to imply that the issue is cut and dry for you, only that it is cut and dry for me. Whether some of our laws are based on religion, our Constitution is not, and most who founded our country believed in a freedom of religion unseen in past countries. Regardless, the religious beliefs of the majority are not and will never be an excuse to put something morally evil into our laws. From our debates in previous posts, I have not seen any benefit of banning same-sex marriage at all, yet I have seen countless benefits. Banning something that would help people and harm no one is evil, as far as I am concerned.\n \n \nInteresting that you would argue against polygamy on the grounds that I used to argue against gay marriage. :)\n\n \n Hmm, well perhaps I didn't explain myself very well. The argument I intended to present could only be used to support same-sex marriage, not argue against it. Let me re-explain myself: If we legalize same-sex marriage, everyone will have an equal right to bestow their marriage benefits on one other person that they fall in love with. If we legalize polygamy, those in polygamous relationships will be able to bestow their marriage benefits on an unlimited number of people while those in monogamous relationships will only be allowed to bestow those benefits on a single person. That is the inequality I spoke of. Carrying that logic to the same-sex marriage debate, it could easily be said that those in opposite-sex relationships are able to bestow marriage benefits on one person they fall in love with, while those in same-sex relationships are able to bestow marriage benefits upon no one. My logic is intended to reveal an inequality that can only be rectified by allowing same-sex marriage and disallowing polygamous marriage.\n \n \nI believe that the argument for polygamy would be analogous to the argument used by gays, that is you are discriminating against a \"group\"\n\n \n As I have stated above, polygamous relationships are already recognized and are already equal under the law to those of monogamous couples. Their marriage is recognized, and they can bestow their marriage benefits upon one other person. Equality is not discrimination.\n \n \nAgain, I believe that the same argument used by gays can be used to argue in favor of incest.\n\n \n So do I. As with same-sex marriage, I believe that many of the arguments used to support gay rights can be used to support incestual marriage. However, as I stated regarding polygamy, there are reasons for banning incestual marriage that do not exist for same-sex marriage. I explain those.\n \n \nAnd it is those people that you want ignored when it comes to their religious beliefs against homosexuality. You can't use religious beliefs as an argument against incest and then turn around and say that they aren't also valid reasons against gay marriage. Either you accept that the religious beliefs hold for all or they hold for none. No a la catre choosing. ;)\n\n \n I can do so because freedom of religion is a value worth holding. As a nation, we do not take away the rights from one religion because of the beliefs of another. We do not strip the right of one religion to build churches because it is not the majority just as we do not strip the right of one religion to marry because they are not the majority. We especially do not do so when allowing equality in religion would not hurt our nation; it would help it.\n \n \nI still don't see it as disallowing the rights of a minority. Everyone has the right to marry a member of the opposite sex. Nobody is discriminated against due to race, religion. sex, etc.\n\n \n You wouldn't agree that people are being discriminated against based on sexual orientation? As I have said in the past: I am not arguing for a new right that only affects homosexuals, I am arguing to give everyone the right to marry people of the same-sex. I call this \"rights of the minority\" because as we all know, it is only those whose sexual orientation is in the minority who would take advantage of this new right.\n \n \nIIRC, many states still have laws against adultery, so that one won't work. ;)\n\n \n It will work; that should be all the more evidence of the slippery slope we're headed toward. States are ready to take away the rights of people; the federal government is ready to take away those rights. They've already done so. If they can take away the right to adultry, then they will. If the government can take away any right, it will. All we need to do is give them a reason, give them a sign that the people aren't going to rise up if the government takes away their freedom, and suddenly our freedom will be gone. Or at least that slippery slope is a far more likely and more dangerous one than the polygamy and incest one.\n \n \nPrior to no-fault divorce, there had to be a reason for a couple to get divorced. That wasn't so far-fetched.\n\n \n You're right, it wasn't. But each step we take toward restricting freedom makes the next step toward it seem less far fetched. Is it really the government's business why you got divorced any more than it is the government's business why you believe in your religion, why you chose the job you did, why you eat the food you do, or why you do anything else? Your life is your own, not the government's to control. Each step we take away from that is a step away from freedom.\n \n \nThat was once a no-no, too.\n\n \n You're absolutely right. Hrm, my point isn't getting across. I specifically used examples that don't seem far-fetched so that you would understand how the government might use their momentum to actually restrict more freedoms. Then I implied that if they are going to restrict those freedoms, how far might they go? Restricting freedom is a bad place to be.\n \n \n1st Amendment guarantees against that. There is no applicable statute for gay marriage.\n\n \n How about the Ammendment that guarantees equal protection under the law? But regardless of that, does it really matter whether there is an Ammendment? Does that make it any less wrong? Does that make it any less likely that the government will try to overrule the Ammendment? Think about religious freedom and gun control. Also, think of all the freedoms that aren't protected by the Constitution that you might lose.\n \n \nGood question. I've been asking that one since the first gun control law in 1968. If you can find an answer to that one, you're a damn good fortuneteller.\n\n \n If you're a gun-rights advocate, then maybe you know where I'm coming from. The government will restrict your right to guns just as readily as it will restrict your right to anything if you give it the chance. The majority will vote against gun-owners in Michigan, if you give them the chance. That doesn't make it right.\n \n \nWe're already sliding down the slippery slope, IMO. It's just a question of how steep do we want the slope.\n\n \n Despite all I've said, I don't really think we'll end up heading down a slippery slope no matter which side wins out. But I do think that if a slippery slope does begin, it will begin by restricting same-sex marriage and it will continue by restricting more of our freedoms. I don't think we're in a slippery slope yet. What slope are you referring to?",

   "I disagree. The public consists of a very large number of people. They may be somewhat uninformed as individuals, but collectively a large group knows more about PUBLIC decision making than a FEW \"experts\". The same way that the public should be allowed to make the decision of whether or not we should allow gay marriage. Gays should, and are, allowed to make decisions about who they'll live with, spend time with, work with, etc. etc. That's an INDIVIDUAL decision - not up to the public, OR an expert. \n\n \n But if gays are allowed to make the decision of who they spend time with, work with, live with, etc; why can they not make the decision about who they marry? Why is it up to the public at large to determine that? Why can they not raise their children as they see fit? Why does the public at large get involved? Why can they not take and give a good home to a child from adoption? Why must the public interject its opinion? The entire issue we are discussing involves the public interjecting its opinion of marriage upon every individual couple. It is tyranny of the majority in every sense.\n \n Regardless, I do not believe there is any indication that the public knows anything about educating a child. The public could not put together a list of good courses for children to take; they simply aren't informed enough about school classes. Most probably couldn't even name more classes than those their child is immediately taking. Yet we're going to leave all of the decisions about how the school is run up to the 51% of public opinion that was aroused by some story in the news? In that case, might we not get rid of the school board alltogether?\n \n \nI try not to be a name caller. Distinguishing between liberals and conservatives isn't name calling IMO. It's one of many reasons talk radio is popular. One of the strategies of today's liberals is play \"moderate\". You'll see those who claim to be a social liberal, but a fiscal conservative. That's not really possible - to be a social liberal requires money, and they'll try to cover it up in a debate. It's important to distinguish between the two labels. Though we may not like it, having political opinions requires taking sides. Picking and choosing, favoring one sides befefits without that same sides subsequent costs is common today.\n\n \n But as we have seen, supporting same-sex marriage saves money. Allowing abortion wouldn't require money, banning guns wouldn't require money (though it would hurt businesses), allowing stem-cell research wouldn't cost money, keeping religion out of schools and public buildings would save money... The only really socially liberal thing I can think of that might cost money is enforcing environmental regulations.\n \n Anyhow, I guess all I meant when I spoke about same-sex marriage and liberalism is that same-sex marriage is based in both liberal and conservative principles; though even if it were not, simply claiming something is \"liberal\" isn't enough explanation for why you disagree with it.\n \n \nSee above about the difference between a ~public~ decision, and a ~private~ decision.\n\n \n Yes, but there is no reason to suggest that marriage is any of the public's business. For example, if the public didn't want any brunettes marrying blondes, should the public be allowed to take away that right? What business is it of the public to take away that right? This is a private decision in every way I can think of, which aligns it perfectly with conservatism.\n \n \nMainly, yes.\n\n \n Well that's not a good reason! Taking away rights from an entire group of people because a lot of them are liberal is not justice; it is tyranny. It is an admission that you are taking away rights with someone simply because they have a different political viewpoint. It what dictators do to the people who disagree with them.\n \n \nI hope you are seeing from several of us here, (those of us against gay marriage) have reasons for being against it that have nothing to do with a personal dislike of gay people.\n\n \n Well, it was you who claimed that gay people were hatefully pointing fingers; I was only saying that it would be no more valid for me to claim that opponents of same-sex marriage are hatefully pointing fingers.\n \n \nRight. Society has indeed become more liberal over time. Legalizing gay marriage will be an additional liberal victory.\n\n \n Well, I would argue that it would be a victory for everyone, but as I've said, even if it could be shown that this is not a conservative value, simply being a victory for liberals does not indicate that it is a bad thing. In previous posts, I've shown harm coming to many people through banning same-sex marriage, while benefit coming to many through allowing it. Liberal or not, it is right.\n \n \nAs things are now, gays AND single, companionless people share the burden equally in providing the tax benefits etc. that married couples enjoy. If gay people are newly included in these benefits, then single companionless people will be burdened far more than they are now.\n\n \n Not at all; those people are perfectly entitled to get married to anyone they wish, should they choose to do so. The important part is that they are free to marry any person of their choosing, not a set of government-mandated people. As for tax burdens, well I don't recall mentioning that. The point of marriage is to reduce the tax burden on married couples, if I'm not mistaken. It is acceptable to argue that married couples should not recieve this additional tax relief because that puts the burden on unmarried people, but that is a different topic. All I'm arguing is that whatever rights we give to opposite-sex couples, we should give to same-sex couples as well.\n \n \nIf everyone has something, it's not very special. :)\n\n \n Well, if we restrict some people from having what we have, then what we have may be special, but we're still bad people.\n \n \nTheir website looks pretty negative and liberal to me. In the spread of liberalism, I think it matters a LOT.\n\n \n Well, take a look at the website of a real gay rights group, then: http://www.hrc.org/\n \n Regardless, I fail to see how a gay rights group delivering a negative message against that which they see as wrong is a bad thing. You're doing it right now, I'm doing it right now... That's the way debating works.\n \n \nStripping them of the right to marry? They never had the right. There is a difference between taking something away, and not allowing it in the first place.\n\n \n Is there a big difference? I don't really see it. In a sense, we are still stripping people of the right to marry, we've just always been doing it. We are still just as wrong; well, more wrong since we've been doing it for a longer period of time.",

   "Agreed. If your going to allow one sort of alternative marriage, I cannot see how you can justify banning other sorts (besides practical issues, and practical issues should not, philosophically if not practically, interfere with civil rights).\n \n Agreed, there are practical problems associated with polygamy. However, that does not negate that their relationship should be recognized in some manner. Perhaps the answer is the change marriage entirely, I don't know.\n\n \n Well, I feel that polygamy is recognized well enough... I think it is very clear that polygamous marriage is not practical.\n \n \nDo we \"need\" homosexual marriage? There are those who wish to have polygamous marriage.\n\n \n If by \"need\" you mean need to live, then of course not. If you mean, do we need it to call ourselves morally just and good, then yes we do.\n \n \nI don't dislike polygamy.\n \n I am arguing that polygamy should be allowed, under the same reasoning that gay marriage is allowed.\n\n \n I see; then perhaps I misread your post.\n \n \nPractical problems are not a good justification to ban civil liberties, especially when the argument for gay marriage is not that it's \"easy\" but that it's \"right\". Whether or not polygamy is \"easy\" makes little difference in terms of if it's \"right\".\n\n \n Of course I would not fight to ban the right to engage in a polygamous relationship, and I feel that those relationships currently have the rights they need. They get the same marriage, the same benefits, etc. Though they may not have some blanket legal term that gives them no benefits and covers their situation, I again think that is impractical, unnecessary paperwork for the government.\n \n \nAbuse is something that is fought against anyway.\n \n Children are not a pre-requisite of marriage. Homosexuals cannot have children at all, so the state of the children should not bar incestuous relationships. Also, we do not ban marriage between couples who may (even if it's a good chance) have disabled or mentally challenged children, incestuous or no. \"Abuse of the natural bonds of love created by the closeness between families\"? That sounds suspiciously like a moral argument against a certain relationship. What if I were to argue that homosexual relationships were an abuse of the natural bonds of love between opposite sexes?\n\n \n Well, I didn't mean physical abuse, as you read later. The abuse of natural bonds of love created by closeness in families is absolutely a moral argument. Just like my argument supporting same-sex marriage. I don't recall saying that moral arguments are wrong, though I did distinguish between religious beliefs and that which actually causes harm. Anyhow, this abuse of natural bonds thing is an argument designed toward the beliefs of those who oppose same-sex marriage. I meant that situation to be a more pleasant way to state that a father might raise his daughter to believe that she should marry him, and such a situation would be a manipulation of love and would certainly be morally wrong, but that argument isn't the strongest and might not only apply to incest. \n \n A stronger reason, and I think the reason most people oppose incest, is the tendency of incestual relationships to produce retarded children and children more prone to certain diseases. This is a situation that can actually be considered harmful, and it brings up a whole new debate over whether it is morally just to conceive a child who is at a greater risk of disease and mental retardation.\n \n \nI don't dislike incest. I don't participate myself, but I see no reason why incestuous relationships should be demonized by those who are supposedly open-minded about relationships. They love each other, who are you to keep them apart? Regardless of whether or not they have children, or if those children are retarded, they have the right to love each other.\n\n \n I don't mean to demonize those relationships, though I do mean to say that they are part of something which could be considered harmful, while same-sex couples are not. I meant only to distinguish the two debates, not demonize people who are causing harm to no one.\n \n \nExactly! So, why is incest and polygamy wrong? Only because of the practical problems with implementing polygamy and what might happen with the children in incest? Are those valid reasons for not giving them civil liberties?\n\n \n I discussed those reasons, and those reasons were not \"it's creepy and weird\". I also did not say that those things are morally wrong, I said that it may be a bad idea to give those people civil rights, but I intended to distinguish them from same-sex marriage. It seems to me that you are implying that allowing same-sex marriage absolutely must mean that polygamy and incest must be allowed. That isn't true. There are unanswered issues with both of those. I'm not talking about taking away their civil liberties, I'm talking about giving them as many civil liberties as is practical and which prevents harm.\n \n \nI have no problem with incestuous relationships or polygamous relationships. It appears that you do.\n\n \n Polygamy is a personal choice; it is not mine. Incest may cause harm, and I oppose it only insomuch as it can be shown to cause harm. I am not an expert on the debates over polygamy and incest, but I believe I have listed sufficient evidence to suggest that it is absolutely not acceptable to claim that these things must be legalized simply because same-sex marriage is legalized. There is plenty of debate and discussion to be done on these issues.\n \n \nHowever, much of the opposition to homosexual marriage is based in religion is it not?\n\n \n Yes, but what does this have to do with anything? I was simply stating that I can use religion as justification for allowing same-sex marriage more than he can use it as justification for disallowing it.\n \n \nAgreed. I don't believe the gov't should be in our personal lives any more than absolutely necessary.\n\n \n Well... Good!\n \n \nI don't believe that particular slippery slope. Certainly it would restrict freedom, and be a step toward fascism. But \"everyone will lose all their rights if this isn't legal!\" is a textbook slippery slope fallacy.\n\n \n You're right! I did not mean to make a case that a slippery slope will occur, I meant to make a case that it is more likely that a slippery slope will occur if same-sex marriage is kept illegal than if it is made legal. Furthermore, the slippery slope that occurs if it is kept illegal is far more dangerous. In truth, I doubt a slippery slope will happen in either case.\n \n Anyhow! If you wish to continue the debate that we should legalize incestual and polygamous marriage, let's put that in a seperate thread; this one is intended to be about same-sex marriage, though incest and polygamy are certainly interesting topics as well.\n \n Umm, also! You quoted wsm2506 a bunch of times but used my name instead of his, which makes it seem like I said a bunch of things that I did not actually say. I was hoping you could modify your post to account for this. I have bolded this just to make sure it isn't missed, not because it is a main point or because I'm angry or something.",

   "I'm misunderstanding. The issues are different because polygamous activity is illegal? Do you mean to say that if homosexual activity was illegal you would not argue for it?\n\n \n It would be more difficult to argue for gay marriage, without first taking care of the issue of legality of gay relationships.\n \n \nIt is different, no denying that. Why do the arguments for homosexual love not justify polygamous love?\n\n \n Why do arguments for heterosexual love not justify polygamous love?\n \n \nAgreed, including polygamous and incestuous relationships.\n\n \n And heterosexual relationships? If not, why not? \n \n \nYou made my point already. Any argument for an alternative union apply to other sorts of alternative unions.\n\n \n How do you define \"alternative union\"? Could the same arguments not apply to heterosexual unions? Are you not using the fallacy of being too broad?\n \n \nBecause religion (for the sake of argument, say Catholics) bans any marriage besides between a man and a woman. There can be no slippery slope because there is no argument, only dogmatic laws. An argument can apply to different situations whether or not they are the authors intent, dogmatic law only applies to what the priests apply it to. The \"not quite\" was a bit of sarcasm.\n \n This is not a \"slippery slope\", this is a logical step. If you wish to argue for gay rights, realize that other things you may not agree with become a lot more possible.\n\n \n There are religions which have it as their dogmatic law to marry gay and straight couples, but not brothers and sisters, or polygamous relationships. Do all non-religious marriages make other things more possible? It doesn't follow that other things become more possible if we allow gay marriage, or that other things become less possible if we don't allow gay marriage.",

Additionally, H.R. 2426 would amend the Internal Revenue Code by exempting domestic partner benefits from federal income taxes. \n \n CBO estimates that enacting the bill would increase direct spending by $137 million over the 2004-2008 period and by $242 million over the next 10 years. Discretionary spending under the bill would increase by $525 million over the 2004-2008 period and by about $1.3 billion over the next 10 years, assuming appropriation of the necessary funds. The bill would also affect federal revenues; those effects would have to be estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). \n \n H.R. 2426, as introduced, would extend benefits to domestic partners of active federal employees and of current and prospective retirees. At the request of the sponsor, this estimate excludes the costs of extending such benefits to domestic partners ofcurrentlyretired federal employees.

   "I am not attempting to undo fundamental Christian beliefs, I am attempting to give people equality under the law regardless of their beliefs. As I have argued in my previous posts, I do believe that if anyone is trying to undo their opponents beliefs, it is the opponents of same-sex marriage attempting to undo the beliefs of the supporters by illegalizing the practice of a certain belief. If you imply that I am offending people by stating that it is immoral to oppose same-sex marriage, well that may be, and I do not doubt it to be the case. However, it is necessary for my argument to say such things, just as it is necessary for your argument to offend gay people. In what I said there, I was not saying that offending gay people is a reason we should allow same-sex marriage, I was saying that it is understandable why people seem hostile to you.\n\n \n I was using the collective \"you\", certainly not \"you\" personally.\n \n\n I did not mean to imply that the issue is cut and dry for you, only that it is cut and dry for me. Whether some of our laws are based on religion, our Constitution is not, and most who founded our country believed in a freedom of religion unseen in past countries. Regardless, the religious beliefs of the majority are not and will never be an excuse to put something morally evil into our laws. From our debates in previous posts, I have not seen any benefit of banning same-sex marriage at all, yet I have seen countless benefits. Banning something that would help people and harm no one is evil, as far as I am concerned.\n\n All of our Constitution is based religious-based morality and principles. It came with the times and authors. As for putting something \"morally evil\" into our laws, many would argue that allowing gay marriage would do just that. i guess it just depends on which side of the issue you're on.\n \n\n Hmm, well perhaps I didn't explain myself very well. The argument I intended to present could only be used to support same-sex marriage, not argue against it. Let me re-explain myself: If we legalize same-sex marriage, everyone will have an equal right to bestow their marriage benefits on one other person that they fall in love with. If we legalize polygamy, those in polygamous relationships will be able to bestow their marriage benefits on an unlimited number of people while those in monogamous relationships will only be allowed to bestow those benefits on a single person. That is the inequality I spoke of. Carrying that logic to the same-sex marriage debate, it could easily be said that those in opposite-sex relationships are able to bestow marriage benefits on one person they fall in love with, while those in same-sex relationships are able to bestow marriage benefits upon no one. My logic is intended to reveal an inequality that can only be rectified by allowing same-sex marriage and disallowing polygamous marriage.\n\n But if those in monogomous relationships also have the opportunity to \"bestow their marriage benefits\" to more than one partner, where is the inequity? It is no different than arguing in favor of same sex OR opposite sex marriage. As long as we offer the option to all, where's the inequity? It doesn't mean that everyone has to take advantage of that benefit for it to be equitable. \n \n\n As I have stated above, polygamous relationships are already recognized and are already equal under the law to those of monogamous couples. Their marriage is recognized, and they can bestow their marriage benefits upon one other person. Equality is not discrimination.\n\n Where in the US is polygamy legal? I'm not aware of any state. Even Utah banned polygamy.\n \n\n So do I. As with same-sex marriage, I believe that many of the arguments used to support gay rights can be used to support incestual marriage. However, as I stated regarding polygamy, there are reasons for banning incestual marriage that do not exist for same-sex marriage. I explain those.\n\n What non-morality-based argument is there for banning incest? I'm not aware of any. \n \n\n I can do so because freedom of religion is a value worth holding. As a nation, we do not take away the rights from one religion because of the beliefs of another. We do not strip the right of one religion to build churches because it is not the majority just as we do not strip the right of one religion to marry because they are not the majority. We especially do not do so when allowing equality in religion would not hurt our nation; it would help it.\n\n But what if a practice goes against the beliefs of most religions? Do they have to conform to a new \"immoral\" law? What means to redress their grievances exists?\n \n\n You wouldn't agree that people are being discriminated against based on sexual orientation? As I have said in the past: I am not arguing for a new right that only affects homosexuals, I am arguing to give everyone the right to marry people of the same-sex. I call this \"rights of the minority\" because as we all know, it is only those whose sexual orientation is in the minority who would take advantage of this new right.\n\n No, I wouldn't agree that they were being discriminated against based on their sexual orientation. They are being excluded from marriage based on their sex, not their sexual orientation. Gays can marry members of the opposite sex, so they aren't being discriminated against based on their orientation.\n \n\n It will work; that should be all the more evidence of the slippery slope we're headed toward. States are ready to take away the rights of people; the federal government is ready to take away those rights. They've already done so. If they can take away the right to adultry, then they will. If the government can take away any right, it will. All we need to do is give them a reason, give them a sign that the people aren't going to rise up if the government takes away their freedom, and suddenly our freedom will be gone. Or at least that slippery slope is a far more likely and more dangerous one than the polygamy and incest one.\n\n There's no taking away of anybody's rights. You never had the right to marry someone of the same sex in the first place.\n \n\n You're right, it wasn't. But each step we take toward restricting freedom makes the next step toward it seem less far fetched. Is it really the government's business why you got divorced any more than it is the government's business why you believe in your religion, why you chose the job you did, why you eat the food you do, or why you do anything else? Your life is your own, not the government's to control. Each step we take away from that is a step away from freedom.\n\n As many gays point out, marriage is a contractual agreement between partners. If I enter into a lifelong business contract with you, I have to have a reason to void that contract, don't I? So why is it unreasonable to expect that a marriage contract is at least as legally binding as a business agreement?....\n \n More tomorrow....",

   "I'd like to see some references for same-sex marriage being generally practiced and not just \"tolerated\". Everything I find seems to indicate that male/female unions are the natural state from antiquity to the present.\n\n \n Male/female is the \"natural\" state for heterosexuals. \n \n Why do you hide behind \"natural\" when all you mean is most common?\n \n It's a childish argument. \n \n \nI disagree. The legal system still has many laws that favor a woman over a man, especially in child custody law, but extending into other areas, such as real estate. For example, in Michigan, a married man cannot buy a house without his wife's consent, but it is legal for the wife to buy a house without the husband's consent. I found out that one the hard way when my wife and I were relocating from PA 20 years ago. I had to fly her out here, last minute, to sign papers before I could close on a house.\n\n \n Pointing to anachronisms in the law does not invalidate the general principle that U.S. law views men and women as equals.\n \n \nHere's where your logic is flawed. You assert that it is legal to define marriage arbitrarily as \"two parties\", but illegal to define it as 3 or more.\n\n \n No, I said that limiting it to two individuals would treat all citizens fairly. Limiting it to 3 would also treat all citizens equally, but that's not likely to come about.\n \n \nThis is no different that our current situation. The law currently defines marriage as one man, one woman. It is argued by you and others, that this is discriminatory against same sex partners. \n\n \n The differences are two: one, the SCOTUS has already acknowledged that the marriage available must be meaningful to the particpants. Also, under current law, CitizenA can marry CitizenB but not CitizenC. CitizenB can marry CitizenC. That is discrimination between supposedly equal citizens.\n \n I'm not really sure why we even have this argument. In every case except one, when this issue has been brought before a state Supreme Court, the discriminatory situation has been ruled to be unconstitutional. The current occupant of the WH and the Congressional leadership all agree that under an unamended Constitution, same-sex marriage will be declard constitutional at some point. YOU may not see the argument as valid, but those whose opinion counts have all but conceded the point.\n \n \nPolygamists would argue that the number 2 is just as arbitrary as saying that only one man and one woman constitutes marriage and use your same argument. \n\n \n They might use some quite convincing arguments, but they wouldn't be making the point I am.\n \n \nAll citizens would be treated equally. All citizens could marry X other citizens. \n\n \n A perfectly reasonable proposal, but not the same as the discussion of same-sex marriage.\n \n \nRational and reasonable as in religious or morally?\n\n \n Neither, I prefer my laws to be reality-based.\n \n \nYou do know that the fear of getetic abnormalities from mating within one's family has been largely disproven, don't you?\n\n \n Disproven? Diminished in likelihood, but not \"disproven\". \n \n \nThat's the danger of ticking off the majority in a \"democratic\" society. (I put democratic in quotes because we are a Cnstitutionally-limited Republic...on paper) emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Actually, it's the danger of ticking off a largely misinformed majority seriously misled and manipulated by an XXX of a president. Face it, anyone who voted for him based on this issue was used.",

As for putting something \"morally evil\" into our laws, many would argue that allowing gay marriage would do just that. i guess it just depends on which side of the issue you're on.\n\n \n See, but this isn't really true. If you looked at the morals presented in the Bible, you'd see a set of morals based on duty to one's family, superiors, and nation. You'd see a spelled-out list of rules that you must follow. The Constitution is not based on duty and reliance upon others, it is based on individualism, making as much money as you can, and living freely. The Bible says nothing about free speech, the right to bear arms, freedom of religion, trials of your peers, etc. I don't know that even one moral held in esteem by the Bible made it into the Constitution or even the Bill of Rights.\n \n \nBut if those in monogomous relationships also have the opportunity to \"bestow their marriage benefits\" to more than one partner, where is the inequity? It is no different than arguing in favor of same sex OR opposite sex marriage. As long as we offer the option to all, where's the inequity? It doesn't mean that everyone has to take advantage of that benefit for it to be equitable.\n\n \n The inequity is visible only when you consider that the goal of marriage is to give these benefits across families. This sort of relationship would give one family the ability to choose from the best of many health care programs, for example, while another family would only be able to choose from the best of two. That sort of inequality wouldn't even be a huge deal, if not for the impracticality of the whole situation. The fact that it is impractical to offer the benefits of marriage across many people is really far more important than the inequality, since the inequality would only be helping some families while hurting no others.\n \n Furthermore, why are you arguing this? Are you actually in support of allowing polygamous marriage? If not, why are you not?\n \n \nWhere in the US is polygamy legal? I'm not aware of any state. Even Utah banned polygamy.\n\n \n Well, polygamous marriage is not recognized anywhere, however I don't believe you can be thrown in jail for having a polygamous relationship or polygamous family anywhere. If I'm wrong about that, you just let me know.\n \n \nWhat non-morality-based argument is there for banning incest? I'm not aware of any.\n\n \n I must be too tired... I don't really understand what you're asking here. Aren't all of these arguments moral?\n \n \nBut what if a practice goes against the beliefs of most religions? Do they have to conform to a new \"immoral\" law? What means to redress their grievances exists?\n\n \n No means to redress their grievenances exists. If most religions believe that we must cause harm to those who are different, those religions simply have to give in and accept laws that do not cause harm. It is unacceptable for anyone of those religions to say, \"Well, most of us don't want this minority group to have the same rights we do. If you're going to give them the same rights I have, you'd better give us something in return.\"\n \n Anyhow, remember that I'm trying to convince you that the majority SHOULD accept same-sex marriage, even though they might not do so right now.\n \n \nNo, I wouldn't agree that they were being discriminated against based on their sexual orientation. They are being excluded from marriage based on their sex, not their sexual orientation. Gays can marry members of the opposite sex, so they aren't being discriminated against based on their orientation.\n\n \n Oh, I don't know about that... I'd say that the laws we are banning specifically target people of a certain sexual orientation, not people of a certain sex. Is it not true that homosexual and bisexual people are the ones who are unable to participate in marriage because same-sex marriage is disallowed? I'd say this has everything to do with sexual orientation, even though it is technically the sex of the two individuals involved that determines whether or not they can get married.\n \n \nThere's no taking away of anybody's rights. You never had the right to marry someone of the same sex in the first place.\n\n \n Argh; arguments like this are frustrating, I must admit. Would it have been more acceptable if I said \"keeping from\" instead of taking away? Nitpicking my choice of words does not invalidate my argument in this case, and you are already the second person to have pointed this out.\n \n \nAs many gays point out, marriage is a contractual agreement between partners. If I enter into a lifelong business contract with you, I have to have a reason to void that contract, don't I? So why is it unreasonable to expect that a marriage contract is at least as legally binding as a business agreement?....\n\n \n The debate is simply over whether this contractual agreement includes a divorce clause or not. If the contractual agreement says, \"I pledge my life, unless we decide to get divorced,\" then it is exactly as legally binding as a business contract. Our government could decide that if you don't enter into a legal agreement that includes no divorce, then you don't get marriage benefits. That's not something I think should happen.\n \n \nMore tomorrow....\n\n \n Excellent. I feel like I'm just typing away randomly today because there have been a lot of posts I wanted to respond to. Hopefully tomorrow will be slower.",

   "I'd like to see some references for same-sex marriage being generally practiced and not just \"tolerated\". Everything I find seems to indicate that male/female unions are the natural state from antiquity to the present.\n\n \n I think you are right about this, and I think gay pride people want very much to portray their movement as natural, because they know that the stigma of it being 'unnatural' is not helpful to their movement. \n \n - Gay relationships are downright rare, compared to straight ones. Probably 3%, although gay pride people always go with the higher percentages up to about 7% tops. I've heard some percentages at 1-2%. \n \n - Gay unions cannot, by natural biology, concieve children as a couple. Trying to get away from this reality by calling it 'irrelevant' or bringing up red herrings such as hetero couples who can't conceive due to problems doesn't change reality. Even if straight couples can't bear children because of problems, gay couples' bodies are physically unable to do so with each other as a couple at all to begin with.\n \n I think a much better tactic than denying the reality that gay unions are not society's natural way would be to simply go with the fact that it's not natural and still argue these so-called 'rights' regardless. It looks pretty silly to call a duck an elephant over and over, when it waddles and quacks.",

Nor do lesbians' romantic and sexual relationships with other women detract from their ability to care for their children. Recent evidence suggests that gay and lesbian couples with children tend to divide child care and household responsibilities evenly and to report satisfaction with their relationship. \n \n Does parental sexual orientation affect children's development?\n \n Studies of various aspects of child development reveal few differences  among children of lesbian mothers and heterosexual parents in such areas as personality, self-concept, behavior, and sexual identity. (Only limited data are available on these dimensions for children of gay fathers.) Evidence also suggests that children of lesbian and gay parents have normal social relationships with peers and adults. Fears about children of lesbian or gay parents being sexually abused by adults, ostracized by peers, or isolated in single-sex lesbian or gay communities have received no scientific support. \n\n \n It unfortunate that anyone would make such a statement as: \"I will never change my point of view\"",

Over 35 years of objective, well-designed scientific research has shown that homosexuality, in and itself,is not associated with mental disorders or emotional or social problems. Homosexuality was once thought to be a mental illness because mental health professionals and society had biased information. In the past the studies of gay, lesbian and bisexual people involved only those in therapy, thus biasing the resulting conclusions. When researchers examined data about these people who were not in therapy, the idea that homosexuality was a mental illness was quickly found to be untrue. \n In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association confirmed the importance of the new, better designed research and removed homosexuality from the official manual that lists mental and emotional disorders. Two years later, the American Psychological Association passed a resolution supporting the removal. For more than 25 years, both associations have urged all mental health professionals to help dispel the stigma of mental illness that some people still associate with homosexual orientation.\n\n \n A search of both APA sites for \"sexual perversion\" yeilded no results.",

   "But if gays are allowed to make the decision of who they spend time with, work with, live with, etc; why can they not make the decision about who they marry? Why is it up to the public at large to determine that? Why can they not raise their children as they see fit? Why does the public at large get involved? Why can they not take and give a good home to a child from adoption? Why must the public interject its opinion? The entire issue we are discussing involves the public interjecting its opinion of marriage upon every individual couple. It is tyranny of the majority in every sense. \n\n \n Because much of the public attends CHURCH, a place where a lot of marrying takes place. After gay marriage is legalized, churches will be in the spotlight. \"Are YOU going to allow gay marriages in YOUR church, Baptists?? What about YOU, Catholics?\" \"Now that you admit that you've been WRONG about us all these years, what are you going to do to appease us?\"\n \n Moveon.org is just a strong as ever, probably growing, and they were formed because of Bill Clinton's sex controversy - a thing of the past. Do you really think hrc.org or glaad will meekly disappear if gay marriage is legalized? They'll find more to do.\n \n \nRegardless, I do not believe there is any indication that the public knows anything about educating a child. The public could not put together a list of good courses for children to take; they simply aren't informed enough about school classes. Most probably couldn't even name more classes than those their child is immediately taking. Yet we're going to leave all of the decisions about how the school is run up to the 51% of public opinion that was aroused by some story in the news? In that case, might we not get rid of the school board alltogether?\n\n \n Home-schooled children often outperform their public schooled counterparts on tests. My nephew is an example.\n \n \n \nBut as we have seen, supporting same-sex marriage saves money. \n\n \n I haven't seen it. Maybe with perfect planning and co-operation it could - if gay rights groups won't march on with their agenda. Not much chance of that.\n \nAllowing abortion wouldn't require money, \n\n \n It would if it was publically funded, a liberal goal.\n \n \nbanning guns wouldn't require money (though it would hurt businesses), allowing stem-cell research wouldn't cost money, keeping religion out of schools and public buildings would save money... The only really socially liberal thing I can think of that might cost money is enforcing environmental regulations. \n\n \n So much of today's social programs do too, but all this is another debate.\n \n \nAnyhow, I guess all I meant when I spoke about same-sex marriage and liberalism is that same-sex marriage is based in both liberal and conservative principles; though even if it were not, simply claiming something is \"liberal\" isn't enough explanation for why you disagree with it. \n\n \n It is a political issue. Republicans generally oppose it - Democrat's generally favor it.\n \n \n \n \nYes, but there is no reason to suggest that marriage is any of the public's business. For example, if the public didn't want any brunettes marrying blondes, should the public be allowed to take away that right? What business is it of the public to take away that right? This is a private decision in every way I can think of, which aligns it perfectly with conservatism. \n\n \n In addition to the church thing I described above, there is also the issue of what people want their very young children exposed too, whenever they go out in public. I know my saying that really sets some gay people off, but it's not really me saying it. I don't much care since I don't have children. But I know that's the way a lot of people who have children feel.\n \n \n \n \nWell that's not a good reason! Taking away rights from an entire group of people because a lot of them are liberal is not justice; it is tyranny. It is an admission that you are taking away rights with someone simply because they have a different political viewpoint. It what dictators do to the people who disagree with them. \n\n \n There you go with that \"taking away\" phrase again. You can't take away something that never existed.\n \n \n \n \nWell, it was you who claimed that gay people were hatefully pointing fingers; I was only saying that it would be no more valid for me to claim that opponents of same-sex marriage are hatefully pointing fingers. \n\n \n It wouldn't be too hard for anyone to go through this thread alone and count up the clear personal insults, and determine which side insults more. I'm not going to bother to take the time, but I think I know which side would win the personal insults, by about 5 to 1. You're the exception though - if you weren't here I wouldn't be involved in this thread. \n \n \n \n \nWell, I would argue that it would be a victory for everyone, but as I've said, even if it could be shown that this is not a conservative value, simply being a victory for liberals does not indicate that it is a bad thing. In previous posts, I've shown harm coming to many people through banning same-sex marriage, while benefit coming to many through allowing it. Liberal or not, it is right.\n \n \n \n Not at all; those people are perfectly entitled to get married to anyone they wish, should they choose to do so. The important part is that they are free to marry any person of their choosing, not a set of government-mandated people. As for tax burdens, well I don't recall mentioning that. The point of marriage is to reduce the tax burden on married couples, if I'm not mistaken. It is acceptable to argue that married couples should not recieve this additional tax relief because that puts the burden on unmarried people, but that is a different topic. All I'm arguing is that whatever rights we give to opposite-sex couples, we should give to same-sex couples as well.\n \n \n \n Well, if we restrict some people from having what we have, then what we have may be special, but we're still bad people.\n \n \n \n Well, take a look at the website of a real gay rights group, then: http://www.hrc.org/\n \n Regardless, I fail to see how a gay rights group delivering a negative message against that which they see as wrong is a bad thing. You're doing it right now, I'm doing it right now... That's the way debating works. \n\n \n It's a bad thing to me when they attack not only those who oppose gay marriage, but the entire Republican party. The Democratic party hasn't won enough major elections lately to be very comfortable. They're working on some complicated strategies behind closed doors these days. Gay marriage is very political.\n \n \n \n \nIs there a big difference? I don't really see it. In a sense, we are still stripping people of the right to marry, we've just always been doing it. We are still just as wrong; well, more wrong since we've been doing it for a longer period of time.\n\n \n There is a difference. If we seek to take something away, we have experience in how that something affected society in the past, and should have to clearly show why society would be better off without it. Redefining marriage would be a blind experiment. VERY difficult to clearly show how society would react to it - be better off WITH it. And more difficult to reverse if it turns out to be a bad decision.\n \n With today's war on terror, and the global economy what it is, I think it's a bad time for social experiments.",

Remember that banning same-sex marriage won't make those groups go away either. It is best to give equal rights to people and oppose them when they go to far.

I do doubt that the majority of society is intelligent. Try educating a child doing only what the majority of society thinks is best. It'll go in completely opposite directions, its opinions will change with the wind, and its conclusions will be meaningless. I do believe that a well-informed individual is often much more capable of making good decisions; home-education is a fine example of this.\n \n \nI haven't seen it. Maybe with perfect planning and co-operation it could - if gay rights groups won't march on with their agenda. Not much chance of that.\n\n \n Well, government studies which suggested that same-sex marriage would save one billion dollars in taxpayer money each year. I don't know what more evidence you need than that. Furthermore, I don't see how gay rights groups continuing with their agenda will cause any more financial burden than anti-gay rights groups continuing with their own agenda.\n \n \nIt would if it was publically funded, a liberal goal.\n\n \n I'd disagree. I doubt many liberals support publically-funded abortion. You may meet some extreme person who does, but you are just as likely to meet an extreme conservative who supports an equal number of absurd things. Generalizing such a position across liberalism is misrepresentative.\n \n \nSo much of today's social programs do too, but all this is another debate.\n\n \n Agreed about it being another debate, however I think what you are referring to social programs is not what people mean when they call themselves \"socially liberal\". You'll see what I mean below.\n \n \nIt is a political issue. Republicans generally oppose it - Democrat's generally favor it.\n\n \n True, but Republicans are a party while \"conservative\" is a political belief system. Lots of people consider themselves conservative but not Republican.\n \n \nIn addition to the church thing I described above, there is also the issue of what people want their very young children exposed too, whenever they go out in public. I know my saying that really sets some gay people off, but it's not really me saying it. I don't much care since I don't have children. But I know that's the way a lot of people who have children feel.\n\n \n Well, if you get angry about gay people forcing their views upon churches, then that's great. But that isn't happening here. You are advocating society forcing its views upon the individual. If the church situation happens, feel free to oppose it. But that isn't what is happening, and that isn't what the debate is. You are in support of society forcing its views of who one should marry upon the individual. Don't do exactly what it is that you hate so much; don't allow people to force their views upon others.\n \n As for what their children are exposed to, I can understand that, except that allowing same-sex marriage doesn't really expose children to anything. Of course I could use the same argument against opposite-sex marriage, except that opposite-sex marriage really doesn't expose children to anything. Without marriage, there will still be public kissing and holding hands by gay people, just as the same will be true of straight people. We are speaking only about legal recognition and the benefits that come with it.\n \n \nThere you go with that \"taking away\" phrase again. You can't take away something that never existed.\n\n \n I don't know, I think you can. I think if someone reaches for something that he does not yet have, and you keep him from getting it, you are bascially taking that thing away from him. But if it pleases you, replace \"taking away\" with \"keeping away\" or whatever other phrase you believe is more correct. I don't really care; my argument is exactly the same. Nitpicking my word choice does not affect that in this situation.\n \n \nIt wouldn't be too hard for anyone to go through this thread alone and count up the clear personal insults, and determine which side insults more. I'm not going to bother to take the time, but I think I know which side would win the personal insults, by about 5 to 1. You're the exception though - if you weren't here I wouldn't be involved in this thread.\n\n \n I'm not so sure about that, because as I've said before, every argument against same-sex marriage is taken as a person insult by a gay person, and reasonably so. It all depends on your point of view. Beyond that, I'm not certain how representative these forums are in the first place. I am an extremely strong advocate of same-sex marriage, for example. Have I delivered any insults? I hope not, and I will readily apologize for any that I have.\n \n \nIt's a bad thing to me when they attack not only those who oppose gay marriage, but the entire Republican party. The Democratic party hasn't won enough major elections lately to be very comfortable. They're working on some complicated strategies behind closed doors these days. Gay marriage is very political.\n\n \n I wouldn't worry much about the comfort level of the Democratic party, but I would worry about throwing stones in glass houses. Do not conservative radio show hosts who attack the entire Democratic party each time they come across a single issue they disagree with? How many other conservatives do this, do you think? Even you have made some general statements about what \"liberals\" want and what they believe in. You said that liberals want the government to pay for abortion, which is not very representative, for example. I'm sure I've done the same thing at times. We are all guilty of this; we just don't tend to notice it when someone we agree with is saying it.\n \n \nThere is a difference. If we seek to take something away, we have experience in how that something affected society in the past, and should have to clearly show why society would be better off without it. Redefining marriage would be a blind experiment. VERY difficult to clearly show how society would react to it - be better off WITH it. And more difficult to reverse if it turns out to be a bad decision.\n\n \n I do believe that if we are to remove something, we must show how society would be better off without it, and I believe the same holds true today. I believe that long ago we removed something without offering that evidence, and I believe that it's time to come clean and admit that we removed something inappropriately.\n \n You're right, same-sex marriage has not had a true test anywhere yet, but if we are never going to give it that test, then we are doomed to refuse equality and happiness to people any time we've never tried it in the past. It is our responsibility as a society to try to achieve equality, freedom, and happiness for everyone, and we must not pass up the opportunity to do so simply because it has not been tried before.\n \n Also, we aren't exactly going in blindly here. I've offered many benefits to both gays and society that same-sex marriage will bring with it, and any drawbacks to it seem improbable and avoidable. We are going into this never having tried it before but having strong theory backing up our decision.\n \n \nWith today's war on terror, and the global economy what it is, I think it's a bad time for social experiments.\n\n \n It may be best to try these things in a great economy, but I'd rather implement them as soon as possible so that as few people are not denied these rights as possible. But besides that, I would not argue with pushing off the date of legalizing same-sex marriage provided that it is agreed that it is morally correct to do so as soon as we reenter prosperous times.",

Don't you think?\n\n \n Well, now that you put it like that, I do agree that it isn't reasonable. Knowing what the arguments against same-sex marriage are, it is only reasonable to expect those coming in. However, I think I can still see where they are coming from. When one is finds him or herself in a position of inequality, when one is homosexual or bisexual, it is difficult to avoid these sorts of arguments, and it is difficult to not feel insulted by them. \n \n Coming to these forums is seeking out these arguments, in a sense. But I don't think they a lot of gay and bisexual people come to these forums with the intention of speaking with civility until the debate is resolved, they come out of the feeling that they have to defend themselves. They see these forums and realize what people are saying there. They realize that some person is talking about taking away their rights, and they join out of a sort of self defense. Then they see people saying the same things that they've found so insulting all of their lives, and they act out of a hope that showing such disgust toward an idea through personal insults will help people understand just how outrageous they find it.\n \n I realize this doesn't make it okay to act without civility, and I realize that it probably isn't convincing anyone, but I think it is something that most people would do, if put in the same situation. Even in general, perhaps the more important something is to someone, the more frustrated he or she gets when people disagree.\n \n \nGood point, and in fact you have been the most civil person here that I've seen, perhaps on both sides of the issue.

   "Will the same not happen if the opposite side wins? The decision to recognize same-sex marriage is that of the church. The decision on who an individual should be allowed to marry must be that of the individual. Simply because some people might ask churches to change their ways does not change an individual decision into one that anyone in society can shove themselves into. \n\n \n The opposite side isn't seeking a \"win\". They are merely trying to keep things as they are.\n \n \n \n \nBut do you think the same couldn't be said about those groups that oppose same-sex marriage? It certainly could. Remember that banning same-sex marriage won't make those groups go away either. It is best to give equal rights to people and oppose them when they go to far. It is wrong to oppose equality assuming that people will go too far if they are given it. \n\n \n I don't see groups who oppose same sex marriage as having an agenda to take away any freedoms that gay people currently have. If there are, they would be a small minority, and I'd oppose them. \n \n \n \n \nI don't doubt that many individuals are intelligent and informed on education, in fact that is exactly what I was arguing. I do doubt that the majority of society is intelligent. Try educating a child doing only what the majority of society thinks is best. It'll go in completely opposite directions, its opinions will change with the wind, and its conclusions will be meaningless. I do believe that a well-informed individual is often much more capable of making good decisions; home-education is a fine example of this. \n\n \n Some decisions concerning freedoms are made by the public, and some are made by the individual - they are not up for a public vote. Determining which is which is always debatable. The constitution is interpreted in different ways by different people, concerning individual liberty.\n \n \n \n \nWell, government studies which suggested that same-sex marriage would save one billion dollars in taxpayer money each year. I don't know what more evidence you need than that. Furthermore, I don't see how gay rights groups continuing with their agenda will cause any more financial burden than anti-gay rights groups continuing with their own agenda. \n\n \n I can see gay rights groups seeking reparations, IF our society admits that we have \"wronged\" them for several past decades. They would have a far better case than blacks who seek reparations for slavery. I'm not saying \"gay reparations\" would make more sense than \"slavery reparations\", I'm saying that a new LAW, concerning recent years rather than a whole 150+ years ago, would have better legal standing.\n \n What financial burden could anti-gay groups impose on us if we LEAVE THINGS ALONE??\n \n \n \n \nI'd disagree. I doubt many liberals support publically-funded abortion. You may meet some extreme person who does, but you are just as likely to meet an extreme conservative who supports an equal number of absurd things. Generalizing such a position across liberalism is misrepresentative. \n\n \n They don't say it too loudly since they've tested the waters and see that it doesn't have enough support YET, but todays liberals (today's Democrat party) really does support government health care. Combine that with their solid \"pro-choice\" stance, and there's no question that publically funded abortion is in their dreams.\n \n \n \n \nAgreed about it being another debate, however I think what you are referring to social programs is not what people mean when they call themselves \"socially liberal\". You'll see what I mean below. \n\n \n It may not be what they mean, but it's what they support - whether they realize it or not.\n \n \n \n \nTrue, but Republicans are a party while \"conservative\" is a political belief system. Lots of people consider themselves conservative but not Republican. \n\n \n They sure do \"consider\" themselves conservatives, but they're wrong. :) \n \n \n \n \nWell, if you get angry about gay people forcing their views upon churches, then that's great. But that isn't happening here. You are advocating society forcing its views upon the individual. If the church situation happens, feel free to oppose it. But that isn't what is happening, and that isn't what the debate is. You are in support of society forcing its views of who one should marry upon the individual. Don't do exactly what it is that you hate so much; don't allow people to force their views upon others.\n \n As for what their children are exposed to, I can understand that, except that allowing same-sex marriage doesn't really expose children to anything. Of course I could use the same argument against opposite-sex marriage, except that opposite-sex marriage really doesn't expose children to anything. Without marriage, there will still be public kissing and holding hands by gay people, just as the same will be true of straight people. We are speaking only about legal recognition and the benefits that come with it. \n\n \n We have to agree to disagree if a new gay marriage law is a personal right, or if it is a public decision. I think it's a public decision because the public has a right to use their knowledge of history and human nature to determine if it may negatively affect our society.\n \n \n \n \nI don't know, I think you can. I think if someone reaches for something that he does not yet have, and you keep him from getting it, you are bascially taking that thing away from him. But if it pleases you, replace \"taking away\" with \"keeping away\" or whatever other phrase you believe is more correct. I don't really care; my argument is exactly the same. Nitpicking my word choice does not affect that in this situation. \n\n \n As I said to the other poster, you make yourself sound more oppressed by making it seem like you are having something taken away, rather than not being granted something new, which is what the gay marriage controversy is.\n \n \n \n \nI'm not so sure about that, because as I've said before, every argument against same-sex marriage is taken as a person insult by a gay person, and reasonably so. It all depends on your point of view. Beyond that, I'm not certain how representative these forums are in the first place. I am an extremely strong advocate of same-sex marriage, for example. Have I delivered any insults? I hope not, and I will readily apologize for any that I have. \n\n \n I don't think it's reasonalbe for them to take it personally. Did an earlier generation or two take it so personally? They seemed to accept it. What's different about today's generation?\n \n You have nothing to apologize to me for. \n \n \n \n \nI wouldn't worry much about the comfort level of the Democratic party, but I would worry about throwing stones in glass houses.

We are all guilty of this; we just don't tend to notice it when someone we agree with is saying it. \n\n \n I'm worried about what the Democratic party is up too - they're desperate. I'm afraid their strategies concern something besides moving closer to conservative principles. Liberal talk radio just entered my area in a big way. Private enterprise, or DNC funded? Just a little attacking going on there too. But I'm listening - I'm impressed - they've done their homework.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nI do believe that if we are to remove something, we must show how society would be better off without it, and I believe the same holds true today. I believe that long ago we removed something without offering that evidence, and I believe that it's time to come clean and admit that we removed something inappropriately.\n \n You're right, same-sex marriage has not had a true test anywhere yet, but if we are never going to give it that test, then we are doomed to refuse equality and happiness to people any time we've never tried it in the past.

   "The opposite side isn't seeking a \"win\". They are merely trying to keep things as they are.\n\n \n Well, I would argue that they are seeking a win. One side is arguing to change the laws, the other is arguing to keep them the same. As long laws are not changed, the side seeking to stop change wins. If a clause preventing this change is added to the Constitution, in effect, the side preventing change has moved a big way toward victory. But it is a fight, a debate. Each side seeks to win.\n \n \nI don't see groups who oppose same sex marriage as having an agenda to take away any freedoms that gay people currently have. If there are, they would be a small minority, and I'd oppose them. \n\n \n Well, I don't see gay rights groups as having the agenda that you describe; I haven't seen much indication that they intend to move past equality. I have certainly seen many groups which oppose same-sex marriage speak out against other freedoms, though; sex between same-sex couples was banned by the legislature in Texas, for example, but the Supreme Court struck down a ban on sodomy. I wouldn't be surprised to see groups opposed to same-sex marriage come down on as many gay rights as they can. Beyond that, they often speak out on against freedoms on issues unrelated to gay rights.\n \n \nSome decisions concerning freedoms are made by the public, and some are made by the individual - they are not up for a public vote. Determining which is which is always debatable. The constitution is interpreted in different ways by different people, concerning individual liberty.\n\n \n I'm not so sure about that; I'd say that decisions concerning freedoms that could be harmful to society should be decided by officials elected by the public, not by a majority vote. Those people are able to more clearly evaluate harms caused to the minority as compared to overall harm. However in order for it to even come to that, it must be shown that there is some harm caused by the action in question. If an individual's actions and decisions cause no one harm, then the decision over whether or not to do them should be left up to the individual, not up to society. That is why I call this a restriction on freedom, and I do not believe that there has been much evidence illustrating any harm caused by same-sex marriage.\n \n \nI can see gay rights groups seeking reparations, IF our society admits that we have \"wronged\" them for several past decades. They would have a far better case than blacks who seek reparations for slavery. I'm not saying \"gay reparations\" would make more sense than \"slavery reparations\", I'm saying that a new LAW, concerning recent years rather than a whole 150+ years ago, would have better legal standing.\n\n \n Well whether our society admits that or not, it does not make sense to respond to inequality with inequality. There should be no reparations, and I think our society will see to it that there are none. If you have a problem with reparations, I urge you to speak out against reparations. But don't speak out against marriage if you have a problem with reparations. Don't use fear of what may never happen as a reason to deny others the same rights that you have.\n \n \nWhat financial burden could anti-gay groups impose on us if we LEAVE THINGS ALONE??\n\n \n Well, that depends on how you define \"us\". If you are referring to the population as a whole, then the financial burdens are put on the same-sex couples who are trying to start a family, though those burdens are not present for opposite-sex couples. Beyond that, if allowing same-sex marriage to pass saves taxpayers 1 billion dollars each year, then opposing same-sex marriage is effectively costing taxpayers 1 billion dollars each year.\n \n \nThey don't say it too loudly since they've tested the waters and see that it doesn't have enough support YET, but todays liberals (today's Democrat party) really does support government health care. Combine that with their solid \"pro-choice\" stance, and there's no question that publically funded abortion is in their dreams.\n\n \n I believe that you are taking the stance held by a few people and making the claim that it isn't just a few people who believe these things, it is all Democrats. You are generalizing the extremes across the entire politcal ideal. Furthermore, I think it would have to be only the most rare and most extreme percentage of Democrats who support government-funded health care that also believe abortion should be covered. I do not know where you get these ideas from, but I hope you will tell me. Are you certain you are not mistakening generalizing the views held by a few extreme people across an entire political party? Wouldn't the party platform give you a better idea of their political stance?\n \n \nIt may not be what they mean, but it's what they support - whether they realize it or not.\n\n \n Sorry; you wrote this in response to that socially liberal thing. I wrote that I would explain below, but I don't think I ever actually did! So here goes: People who claim to be socially liberal generally are pro-choice, supportive of gay rights, in support of environmental protections, in opposition to war, and supportive of stem-cell research. They are not generally referring to \"social programs\" such as welfare, government health care, etc. Those are more fiscal issues.\n \n \nThey sure do \"consider\" themselves conservatives, but they're wrong. :) \n\n \n Heh, well I think they consider themselves \"Reagan-conservatives\" in that they support limited government spending and limited government interference in people's lives. Republicans today are \"neo-conservatives\" aren't they? Anyhow, it doesn't even matter; I think I was just trying to point out that the lines between liberalism and conservatism may not be as clear as Democrat vs. Republican, and though many people may hold conservative values enough to vote for a Republican, they might not hold all the same views.\n \n \nWe have to agree to disagree if a new gay marriage law is a personal right, or if it is a public decision. I think it's a public decision because the public has a right to use their knowledge of history and human nature to determine if it may negatively affect our society.\n\n \n Well, as I said, I believe that the government should not interfere with people's lives unless it is doing so because it is preventing some harm. I don't think we've seen any reason to believe that same-sex marriage would cause harm, so I don't think that the government has any place giving marriage benefits to opposite-couples but not to same-sex couples. That's rewarding people for living a government-approved lifestyle; that is not the government's place.\n \n \nAs I said to the other poster, you make yourself sound more oppressed by making it seem like you are having something taken away, rather than not being granted something new, which is what the gay marriage controversy is.\n\n \n That may be, but it was not my intent. I used the words \"taking away\" because I subscribe to the Lockian-ideology that the people have the right to do anything they want when there is not government, but they institute government to take away some rights in the interest of protecting many other rights. Dzeron touched that subject briefly. I did not mean to make people seem more oppressed than they are, and changing my wording on the issue does not change my arguments.\n \n Also, you used the term \"yourself\". Though this isn't too relevant, I have deliberately kept my sexual orientation out of these debates, because I feel that if I say I am straight, anyone could easily claim that I do not know the true intentions of gays. If I say that I am gay, anyone could easily claim that I am supporting gay rights only out of self-interest. So I have made neither statement.\n \n \nI don't think it's reasonalbe for them to take it personally. Did an earlier generation or two take it so personally? They seemed to accept it. What's different about today's generation?\n\n \n Though their voices may not have carried; I'm willing to bet that an earlier generation did take it very personally. Today's generation has more support and people who will listen. I should also mention that I think there is just as high a percentage of civil gay rights supporters as there are civil gay rights opposers, but forums and debate groups tend to draw those who feel the need to defend themselves more than those who do not wish to insult.\n \n \nYou have nothing to apologize to me for.\n\n \n I am glad to hear that; you have also done extremely well in keeping this discussion civil, and I thank you for that.\n \n \nI'm worried about what the Democratic party is up too - they're desperate. I'm afraid their strategies concern something besides moving closer to conservative principles. Liberal talk radio just entered my area in a big way. Private enterprise, or DNC funded? Just a little attacking going on there too. But I'm listening - I'm impressed - they've done their homework.\n\n \n Well, I'm just curious on this (I cannot use it to claim your arguments invalid): I've mentioned conservative talk radio a few times; are you a listener to Rush or Sean Hannity? I can't really see any evidence that the Democratic party is desperate about anything, but I know I've heard those two radio hosts bringing up some obscure examples of single Democrats saying something absurd, then using that as evidence to call the Democratic party \"desperate\". I see no evidence that the party is doing anything different than it has always done, nor anything really different from the Republican party when we had a Democrat president. So, well, maybe I should have asked: is this idea that the Democrats are desperate rooted in radio show listening, or elsewhere? Why would you say they are desperate?\n \n As for liberal talk radio, I've only listened to it a few times, but what I've heard hasn't been much better than conservative talk radio. Their arguments were often weak compared to the stronger arguments around, they made unjust attacks on conservatives, and they generalized views of a single conservative across the entire party. But they pull you in by talking to opponents who don't know the argument very well or by presenting some absurd fact as the belief of the opposite party. Of course, I believe conservative talk radio has the same problems.\n \n Well, maybe I shouldn't be generalizing the subject; this has only been my experience with it.\n \n Anyhow, I'd have to guess liberal radio is funded by advertisements, because it isn't using the same arguments that the party would use; it's using extreme arguments designed to perpetuate listeners. I suppose it would make sense for the DNC to want to respond to conservative, but I don't really think either side responds to the real arguments delivered by their opponents.\n \n \nIt's about time for us to agree to disagree, but I've enjoyed it. You're a good debater - hope you'll stay around!\n\n \n Well, I cannot say that I will agree to disagree. Please understand where I'm coming from; it is my opinion that your viewpoint is harming a lot of people, and in my opinion, this debate is one of the most important debates our society will be faced with in my lifetime. So should I see the opportunity to present my side of the argument to you, I will probably take it; it would be unfair of me to agree to disagree if I plan on responding to arguments you might deliver in the future.\n \n Still, it can be tedious to have to type out these long responses, and I understand that no one wants to keep going back and forth forever. So I've got no problem if we close up our little back and forth discussion that we're having right now.\n \n As for me being a good debater, well thanks! You're pretty good yourself. I'll probably stick around; I've still got plenty of people to debate here if you decide to finish this one up.",

   "Several people here have argued (some without disclosing their reasoning behind their argument) that same-sex marriage is not a right, that such a right has never existed, and and therefore is not being taken away or denied.\n \n I would argue that it IS a right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution (including the ammendments there-to) and has ALWAYS been there. It is a \"basic civil right\" that is being excluded to a class of citizens.\n \n I refer you to the thread \"Constitutional Debate on Gay Marriage\"; Posts #24, #25, and #26 for the reasoning behind my argument.\n \n As a summary, any right not specifically barred or limited by the Constitution is granted to the people. The Constitution, as it stands now, does not mention marriage at all. \n\n \n I just looked at your post #24 from the other thread that you referred to. When you quote the \"granted to the people\" statement of the 10th amendment, you seem to imply that they meant ~granted to the individual~.

   "\n I'm not so sure about that; I'd say that decisions concerning freedoms that could be harmful to society should be decided by officials elected by the public, not by a majority vote. Those people are able to more clearly evaluate harms caused to the minority as compared to overall harm. However in order for it to even come to that, it must be shown that there is some harm caused by the action in question. If an individual's actions and decisions cause no one harm, then the decision over whether or not to do them should be left up to the individual, not up to society. That is why I call this a restriction on freedom, and I do not believe that there has been much evidence illustrating any harm caused by same-sex marriage. \n\n \n Just about anything can be determined by anybody to be harmful to society, whether it's something children can see, or environmental harm done on private property, or so many other things in between. It's all politics, and constitutional interpretation.\n \n \n \n \nWell whether our society admits that or not, it does not make sense to respond to inequality with inequality. There should be no reparations, and I think our society will see to it that there are none. If you have a problem with reparations, I urge you to speak out against reparations. But don't speak out against marriage if you have a problem with reparations. Don't use fear of what may never happen as a reason to deny others the same rights that you have. \n\n \n I'm speaking out against reparations, by not supporting SETTING THE TABLE for someone to seek them. Our legal system currently (wrongly) allows a lot of time and money to be wasted seeking them.\n \n \n \n \nWell, that depends on how you define \"us\". If you are referring to the population as a whole, then the financial burdens are put on the same-sex couples who are trying to start a family, though those burdens are not present for opposite-sex couples. Beyond that, if allowing same-sex marriage to pass saves taxpayers 1 billion dollars each year, then opposing same-sex marriage is effectively costing taxpayers 1 billion dollars each year. \n\n \n I was referring to the population as a whole. I don't believe the 1 billion dollar figure was arrived at by a non biased study.\n \n \n \n \nI believe that you are taking the stance held by a few people and making the claim that it isn't just a few people who believe these things, it is all Democrats. You are generalizing the extremes across the entire politcal ideal. Furthermore, I think it would have to be only the most rare and most extreme percentage of Democrats who support government-funded health care that also believe abortion should be covered. I do not know where you get these ideas from, but I hope you will tell me. Are you certain you are not mistakening generalizing the views held by a few extreme people across an entire political party? Wouldn't the party platform give you a better idea of their political stance? \n\n \n I get these ideas from Democrat LEADERSHIP. Terry McCaulliff (spelling?) Hillary Clinton (she called for the elimination of the Electorial College) John Kerry (\"health care is a RIGHT\") Countless \"Democrat strategists\" debating on television. They are authorized by Democrat leadership. I do know of a couple Democrats past & present who aren't so extreme left. John F. Kennedy would be one from the past - Zell Miller would be one from the present.\n \n \n \n \nSorry; you wrote this in response to that socially liberal thing. I wrote that I would explain below, but I don't think I ever actually did! So here goes: People who claim to be socially liberal generally are pro-choice, supportive of gay rights, in support of environmental protections, in opposition to war, and supportive of stem-cell research. They are not generally referring to \"social programs\" such as welfare, government health care, etc. Those are more fiscal issues.\n \n \n \n Heh, well I think they consider themselves \"Reagan-conservatives\" in that they support limited government spending and limited government interference in people's lives. Republicans today are \"neo-conservatives\" aren't they? Anyhow, it doesn't even matter; I think I was just trying to point out that the lines between liberalism and conservatism may not be as clear as Democrat vs. Republican, and though many people may hold conservative values enough to vote for a Republican, they might not hold all the same views. \n\n \n They often want it both ways. They want to support a benefit of one side, yet not support the cost. Or they support the cost if they feel it doesn't cost THEMSELVES. \n \n \n \n \n \nAlso, you used the term \"yourself\". Though this isn't too relevant, I have deliberately kept my sexual orientation out of these debates, because I feel that if I say I am straight, anyone could easily claim that I do not know the true intentions of gays. If I say that I am gay, anyone could easily claim that I am supporting gay rights only out of self-interest. So I have made neither statement. \n\n \n I wasn't attempting to label you, I was just used the word \"yourself\" in making the argument. I'm not concerned which you are, and I know that you're not necessarily gay. I support smokers rights, but I don't smoke.\n \n \n \n \nThough their voices may not have carried; I'm willing to bet that an earlier generation did take it very personally. Today's generation has more support and people who will listen. I should also mention that I think there is just as high a percentage of civil gay rights supporters as there are civil gay rights opposers, but forums and debate groups tend to draw those who feel the need to defend themselves more than those who do not wish to insult. \n\n \n I don't think earlier generations had gay marriage on their minds at all. If they took anything personally, it was that others didn't approve and accept them. I'd bet it's the same with gay marriage seekers today. You can't tell people how to feel. Getting gay marriage legalized isn't going to change how those who oppose it feel about it. In some ways, gays will become more oppressed if gay marriage is made legal. \n \n \n \n \nI am glad to hear that; you have also done extremely well in keeping this discussion civil, and I thank you for that.\n \n \n \n Well, I'm just curious on this (I cannot use it to claim your arguments invalid): I've mentioned conservative talk radio a few times; are you a listener to Rush or Sean Hannity? I can't really see any evidence that the Democratic party is desperate about anything, but I know I've heard those two radio hosts bringing up some obscure examples of single Democrats saying something absurd, then using that as evidence to call the Democratic party \"desperate\". I see no evidence that the party is doing anything different than it has always done, nor anything really different from the Republican party when we had a Democrat president. So, well, maybe I should have asked: is this idea that the Democrats are desperate rooted in radio show listening, or elsewhere? Why would you say they are desperate?\n\n \n They don't have control of the House, Senate, or Presidency, and they've been losing governorships. They are about to replace their DNC leader. They have not been successful lately, and they seek success. They aren't going to do it by admitting they've been wrong, or too extreme. \n \n Yes, I listen to Limbaugh and Hannity, off and on. I listen while working, and miss a lot of it. \n \n \n As for liberal talk radio, I've only listened to it a few times, but what I've heard hasn't been much better than conservative talk radio. Their arguments were often weak compared to the stronger arguments around, they made unjust attacks on conservatives, and they generalized views of a single conservative across the entire party. But they pull you in by talking to opponents who don't know the argument very well or by presenting some absurd fact as the belief of the opposite party. Of course, I believe conservative talk radio has the same problems.\n \n Well, maybe I shouldn't be generalizing the subject; this has only been my experience with it.\n \n Anyhow, I'd have to guess liberal radio is funded by advertisements, because it isn't using the same arguments that the party would use; it's using extreme arguments designed to perpetuate listeners. I suppose it would make sense for the DNC to want to respond to conservative, but I don't really think either side responds to the real arguments delivered by their opponents.\n \n \n \n Well, I cannot say that I will agree to disagree. Please understand where I'm coming from; it is my opinion that your viewpoint is harming a lot of people, and in my opinion, this debate is one of the most important debates our society will be faced with in my lifetime. So should I see the opportunity to present my side of the argument to you, I will probably take it; it would be unfair of me to agree to disagree if I plan on responding to arguments you might deliver in the future.\n \n Still, it can be tedious to have to type out these long responses, and I understand that no one wants to keep going back and forth forever. So I've got no problem if we close up our little back and forth discussion that we're having right now. \n\n \n The reason I said it may be time to agree to disagree is because we're getting to the point where we're saying the same things over and over. I think your viewpoint is harmful, mainly because it has too many unforseen consequences. \n \n \nAs for me being a good debater, well thanks! You're pretty good yourself. I'll probably stick around; I've still got plenty of people to debate here if you decide to finish this one up.\n\n \n I'll be here - good Lord willing and the computer don't break! emoticon_xclown",

   "Well, as usual, I still have more to say. I will try to keep my responses shorter, however.\n \n \nJust about anything can be determined by anybody to be harmful to society, whether it's something children can see, or environmental harm done on private property, or so many other things in between. It's all politics, and constitutional interpretation.\n\n \n That may be, but reasoning can show that some things are clearly more harmful than others.\n \n \nI'm speaking out against reparations, by not supporting SETTING THE TABLE for someone to seek them. Our legal system currently (wrongly) allows a lot of time and money to be wasted seeking them.\n\n \n I understand, but the same logic could have been used to justify continuing slavery. The answer to reparations is not to never grant equality, it is to oppose inequality in the form of reparations when they arise. Our legal system grants people a chance to fight for their rights when they believe they have been treated unfairly. That is not a bad thing, even though this means that sometimes people can fight for rights they do not deserve.\n \n \nI was referring to the population as a whole. I don't believe the 1 billion dollar figure was arrived at by a non biased study.\n\n \n Still, I urge you to take a look at the reasoning of the study and see how it arrives that its conclusion.

They want to support a benefit of one side, yet not support the cost. Or they support the cost if they feel it doesn't cost THEMSELVES.\n\n \n Interesting; I have not seen this in people who claim that, though I don't doubt that plenty, most even, do just as you describe. It is natural for people to act in their own interest, and many people of all political beliefs do that.\n \n \nI don't think earlier generations had gay marriage on their minds at all.

In some ways, gays will become more oppressed if gay marriage is made legal.\n\n \n I think if they thought that same-sex marriage could be made legal, they would have fought just as hard for it. As for being more oppressed, well isn't a group of people oppressed when their rights are taken away? Granting more equality shouldn't make them more oppressed.\n \n \nThey don't have control of the House, Senate, or Presidency, and they've been losing governorships. They are about to replace their DNC leader. They have not been successful lately, and they seek success. They aren't going to do it by admitting they've been wrong, or too extreme.\n\n \n Well, they don't believe they've been wrong or too extreme, and neither do I. Getting 49% of the vote against an incumbent president is very impressive. Many of the congressional seats they lost were caused by redistricting. Beyond that, moving away from the opinion held by the majority of the public does not make one wrong, and it is not a reason to change good beliefs into bad ones. I've heard people claim that gay rights played a factor in the loss of the presidential election, and though I don't know whether or not that is true, I can say that I would sooner not be elected president than take a stance that gays do not deserve the same rights that others have. I'd imagine most democrats feel the same way on the issues that are important to them.\n \n \nThe reason I said it may be time to agree to disagree is because we're getting to the point where we're saying the same things over and over. I think your viewpoint is harmful, mainly because it has too many unforseen consequences.\n\n \n Though I see what you mean about unforseen consequences, I don't think those consequences will be very significant, and it is difficult to argue against the possibility of things that we don't yet know of happening. But remember that unforseen consequences are just as likely to be good as bad, even more so when good theory supports granting more families the benefits of marriage, and I think that it does.\n \n \nI'll be here - good Lord willing and the computer don't break! emoticon_xclown\n\n \n Well, maybe I just opened the door for another post from you, but if you feel that what you say will only be repetative, that is fine too.\n \n Are there any other topics you post on in these forums, by the way?",

Loving V VA\n 4. Others?\n\n \n To start with the basics, I think I should explain that a right is not something that the government grants to you. If it were, then the government could never be \"restricting rights\" because if the government does not grant you a particular right, then it does not exist to restrict.\n \n Rights are the actions that people are able to take; the government freely and willingly restricts the right to murder, for example, and it does so in order to protect other rights.\n \n So when people say that the government is restricting the rights of same-sex couples, they do not need to offer \"evidence that these rights exist\"; of course they exist. The debate is over whether or not it is morally right or wrong to ban same-sex marriage.\n \n Regarding the Bill of Rights, it is my understanding that the 9th and 10th Ammendment are in contrast and are the result of the dispute between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists. The Federalists wanted most governmental power to rest in the hands of the Federal government, and they wanted to keep that government very limited. The Anti-Federalists believed good government has to be local, and they wanted the states to have a lot of power. The Constitution did not really say what powers the states have, and the Bill of Rights delegates \"all other powers to the states\" (9th Ammendment) but also claims that the Bill of Rights isn't a list of the ONLY rights that government cannot take away, and it should not be confused to mean that the government can take away any rights of the peolpe that it wants. At the time, this sort of brought up the question of what rights state governments are actually allowed to take away (the Federal government technically has no power to take away rights any rights unlisted in the Constitution, though it does so freely because the people support it, and it is the people who hold the power in our nation, not the Constitution).\n \n I don't believe the 10th Ammendment could really apply to protecting same-sex marriage.\n \n Now the 14th Ammendment says many things, but the most important is that no person shall be denied equal treatment under the law. Perhaps this view is not held by everyone, but it seems very clear to me that allowing marriage between opposite-sex couples, but disallowing it for same-sex couples who are in the same financial situation with the same family responsibilites is exactly the definition of unequal treatment under the law.\n \n Joebrummer is also correct that many states have taken away the rights of same-sex couples to enter into legal agreements that resemble marriage, even though they may have had those rights in the past. How strictly this will be enforced is up for debate; I don't know those legal cases well enough to know which rights have been restricted. I do know that in Michigan, some government employers are no longer providing health insurance to same-sex couples because of a recent state constitutional ammendment. I think they have stated that they would return to granting those benefits if a court rules that they can legally do so, but they will not do unless it does. The most prominant example of this is Jennifer Granholm's staff, as it consists of many gay employees. It is also likely that the court will rule that no employers, government or not, are allowed to continue providing health care insurance to the partners of gay and lesbian employees.",

   "Here is an interesting commentary on the usage of \"the people\" within the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Although this article is mostly related to the right to keep and bear arms, I see no reason the usage of \"the people\" should not also apply to same-sex marriage.\n \n \n http://www.virginiainstitute.org/publications/primer_on_const.php\n \n \n \nTHE OPERATIVE CLAUSE\n Before examining the prefatory language, let us look more closely at the operative clause. It is worth emphasizing at the outset that this language is no more ambiguous or unclear than other provisions of the Bill of Rights. It states with unmistakable clarity that \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" This language is parallel to that used in the First and Fourth Amendments: \n \n Congress shall make no law... abridging... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.4 \n The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.5 \n \n All three amendments were framed together, and the First and Fourth Amendment rights have always been treated as individual rather than governmental rights. The framers of the Bill of Rights were apparently confident, and with good reason, that nobody would ever interpret the First Amendment to create a right that could only be exercised by lobbyists working for the state governments. And they were similarly confident that the Fourth Amendment would not be limited to protecting state bureaucrats from unreasonable searches and seizures. The utter strangeness of the states' right theory of the Second Amendment is immediately apparent when one tries to imagine why the framers of the Bill of Rights would have used an identical phrase-\"the right of the people\"-to describe two rights indubitably belonging to individual citizens and one right belonging solely to state governments or at most to certain employees of the state governments. \n \n This sense of strangeness is reinforced when one reads the final provision of the Bill of Rights, which provides: \n The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.6 \n \n This provision makes it unmistakably clear that the framers of the Bill of Rights knew very well that there is a meaningful distinction between \"the states\" and \"the people.\" Interpreting the word \"people\" in the Second Amendment to refer to the state governments requires one to assume that the framers of the text were unbelievably sloppy or whimsical in their use of language. If one is going to make assumptions like that, one might just as well go all the way and assume that the Second Amendment uses the word \"arms\" to mean the upper limbs of the human body.\n",

   "There is no Constitutional basis for the argument that marriage is \"one man / one woman\". It simply is not there! If there is, let them show it.\n\n \n The idea that marriage could mean anything BUT the union of one man and one woman wasn't considered until relatively recently, so it's not surprising that it wasn't specifically spelled out in the Constitution. But, that being said, Congress has addressed the definition of marriage since as have many states. \n \n \n\n Congress of the United States\n House of Representatives\n \n SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS\n \n DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT\n AS INTRODUCED ON MAY 7, 1996\n \n BY REPS. BOB BARR (GA), STEVE LARGENT (OK), JIM SENSENBRENNER (WI), SUE \n MYRICK (NC), ED BRYANT (TN), BILL EMERSON (MO), HAROLD VOLKMER (MO), IKE \n SKELTON (MO)\n \n The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) does two things. First, it provides \n that no State shall be required to give effect to a law of any other \n State with respect to a same-sex \"marriage.\" Second, it defines the \n words \"marriage\" and \"spouse\" for purposes of Federal law.\n ...\n The second substantive section of the bill amends the U.S. Code to make \n explicit what has been understood under federal law for over 200 years; \n that a marriage is the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and \n wife, and a spouse is a husband or wife of the opposite sex. The DOMA \n definition of marriage is derived most immediately from a Washington \n state case from 1974, Singer v. Hara, which is included in the 1990 \n edition of Black's Law Dictionary. More than a century ago, the U.S. \n Supreme Court spoke of the \"union for life of one man and one woman in \n the holy estate of matrimony.\" Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15, 45 \n (1985).\n \n DOMA is not meant to affect the definition of \"spouse\" (which under the \n Social Security law, for example, runs to dozens of lines). It ensures \n that whatever definition of \"spouse\" may be used in Federal law, the \n word refers only to a person of the opposite sex.\n ------\n \n 104th CONGRESS 2D SESSION\n \n H.R. 3396\n \n\n \n \n\n Same-sex marriages are not currently legal in any state. However, in April 2000, Vermont approved landmark legislation to recognize \"civil unions\" between same-sex couples, granting them virtually all the benefits, protections and responsibilities that married couples have under Vermont law. The Vermont legislation came out of a December 1999 state Supreme Court ruling in Baker v. Vermont that said same-sex couples are entitled, under the state constitution's \"Common Benefits Clause,\" to the same benefits and protections as married opposite-sex couples. The court ruled that the Vermont Legislature must decide how to provide these benefits and protections, either by legalizing marriage for same-sex couples or by establishing an alternative system.\n \n The Vermont Legislature chose to preserve marriage as the \"legally recognized union of one man and one woman,\" but at the same time create a parallel system for same-sex couples that goes beyond existing \"domestic partnership\" and \"reciprocal beneficiaries\" laws that exist in California and Hawaii and in many localities in the U.S. today. Additional news and information about the Vermont law is available at the Vermont Legislature's website.\n \n Thirty-six states have enacted legislation prohibiting same-sex marriages or the recognition of same-sex marriages formed in another jurisdiction. States have traditionally recognized marriages solemnized in other states, even those that go against the marriage laws of that particular state. Under the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. Constitution, states are generally required to recognize and honor the public laws of other states, unless those laws are contrary to a strong public policy of that state. But in 1996, Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage Act, which bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and allows states to do the same.\n \n However, gay rights groups are questioning the constitutionality of DOMA and state prohibitions on same-sex marriage. Couples from other states who are granted a civil union in Vermont may file legal challenges to press for recognition of their relationship in their home state.\n \n A 1993 Hawaii Supreme Court decision set off the movement in many states to prohibit the recognition of same-sex marriages regardless of where they were formed. In the Hawaii case, three same-gender couples filed suit against the state of Hawaii, citing as unconstitutional the state's marriage law prohibiting same gender couples from obtaining marriage licenses. The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that the marriage law denies same-gender couples equal protection rights in violation of the Hawaii Constitution, and placed the burden on the state to show that the law against same-sex marriages was justified.\n \n The Hawaii Legislature in 1994 amended the state's marriage law to provide that only marriages between a man and a woman are valid. And in November 1998, Hawaii citizens voted to give the state legislature the power to decide the same-sex marriage issue. In December 1999, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that the 1998 amendment ratified by the voters of Hawaii rendered the plaintiff's argument moot, with the result that same-sex marriage remains illegal in Hawaii.\n http://usmarriagelaws.com/search/alternative_lifestyles/same_sex_marriage/index.shtml\n",

Hardwick. I do not myself believe in rigid adherence to stare decisis in constitutional cases; but I do believe that we should be consistent rather than manipulative in invoking the doctrine. Today's opinions in support of reversal do not bother to distinguish--or indeed, even bother to mention--the paean to stare decisis coauthored by three Members of today's majority in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. There, when stare decisis meant preservation of judicially invented abortion rights, the widespread criticism of Roe was strong reason to reaffirm it:\n \n \" Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe[,] ... its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry... . [T]o overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason ... would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question.\" 505 U.

No matter how many times the ditto-heads on the right say it, it remains a fact that the state supreme courts that have recognized the right of same-sex to marry have been dominated by moderate and conservative, Republican-appointed judges. Of course, they're part of the fading breed of conservatives... the ones who believe in individual rights and freedom.\n\n The activist liberal judges that I was referring to don't sit on te Supreme Courts. They are the ones illegally marrying same sex couples in Oregon, for example.\n http://24.104.4.225/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/353vxunf.asp\n \n As far as state suprme courts recognizing the rights of gays to marry, they have been as rare as hen's teeth in comparison to those ruling to the contrary or not addressing the issue at all. emoticon_rolleyes",

There are many other examples.\n\n \n All of these issues are separate ones that had (and still do have) to be argued on their own merits.\n \n - Women's right to vote wan't a morality issue, like homosexual marriage. IN fact, they couldn't vote. But you have always been able to participate in a gay marriage. You just didn't get benefits for it. \n \n - Black civil rights wasn't either in the sense that no one thought the activity of blacks was particularly immoral--same as above\n \n - Interracial marriage was considered a morality issue, so this could be an analogy--nevertheless it didn't seek to change the fundamental aspect of marriage: that it is between a man and woman\n \n - Roe v. Wade: This is still so controversial that a lot of people believe the court was wrong on this one and that it's not consititutional at all, given that it legalizes a form of harm through the act of abortion. The specifics of this issue are so different from that of gay marriage, the analogy really doesn't hold water.\n \n The problem with your tactic here is that it is an example of assuming that just because the courts ruled on favor on these other issues, they should automatically rule in favor of the one you are seeking. But the courts could just as easily (and probably have at times) stike down arguements with the same basis as yours: a polygamist could just as easily take the same approach. Each case has to be argued on it's own merits, not because other cases happened to end up the same way. Now I do understand that you were making the point that the founding fathers never may not have envisioned such things as gay marriage. But you, nor anyone else here, really have any idea what they throught about issues such as these. The phrase \"they are rolling over in their graves\" may apply, for all we know. \n \n One thing is certain: you don't automatically get to have gay marriage put in the same catagory as women's and blacks' right to vote, interracial marriage, etc. It's not automaticaly a \"civil right\" just because you say it is.

I wonder what benefits existed very early on from the early American govt. in the 1780s for married couples.\n\n \n There were none. As I said, the founders did not give the government the right to grant marriage benefits. However, this does not mean that they did not set up a Constitution which would attempt to protect freedom and equality when those things find themselves at risk.\n \n \nIf they really felt that way, they would have set up a system that considered black people free and women able to vote immediately. I think sometimes people put the founding fathers on way too high of a pedastal.\n\n \n Well, I sort of agree with this... The truth is that there is not one single view held by the founders; some agreed with slavery. But those who are most famous: Jefferson, Madison, Franklin, Washington, Hamilton, and others; these people are the ones who really won out in the Constitutional battle, and these are the people who are usually referred to when we say \"Founders\". All of these people opposed slavery, even Jefferson, who held slaves. The only one of these people that I know of who suggested that women should have the right to vote is Franklin. Now, I don't mean to claim that these people knew all of the answers to bring us toward equality and freedom, but I do mean to say that they intended to prevent the government from taking away these things wherever it did not absolutely need to do so, and they designed the Constitution so that when these battles did spring up, the Constitution would support freedom and equality.\n \n In Jefferson's writings, he explained that he lived in a society full of slavery where slavery is taught to be moral and acceptable. He stated that only a prodigy, a person capable of learning outside of society's teachings, could be understand that slavery is immoral after being raised in the society he lived in. Even he did not completely admit that blacks were equals, despite agreeing with the immorality of slavery. What I mean is that our founders realized that they were not capable of understanding equality and freedom in every situation, but they did know that if they designed a Constitution that would protect those things, then at least freedom and equality would be better realized some day.\n \n Of course our Constitution has changed (sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse), and not all of the founders supported the same things (though pretty much all of them preached the values of freedom and equality). So as I meant to say in the first paragraph of my last post, the Constitution should not be obeyed if it lists something immoral.\n \n EDIT: Oh, I forgot to mention: it may be worthwhile to understand the intentions of our founders because it appears that they have done a very good job in creating a Constitution. The United States has the longest-standing Constitution ever, and it is the longest-standing democracy ever. They did this not having statistics or factual evidence to support them. They did it based completely on theory. By understanding that theory, by understanding why our founders made the Constitution the way the did and on the principles on which they founded it, we can better understand why our Constitution has done so well, and we can better understand whether a proposed change to our Constitution will strengthen or weaken it. If it is not clear by now, I believe that an ammendment granting equality based on sexual orientation would greatly strengthen our Constitution while an Ammendment opposing that equality would do the opposite.",

   "I agree that the Constitution shouldn't be used as a tool to manipulate laws in ways that they were never intended. Our forefathers never intended the Constitution to be used to support gay marriage. The concept was foreign to them and foreign to us up until this generation. That being said, I see no reason to redefine marriage as anything but one man, one woman. I would consider entertaining the concept of same sex civil unions with equal rights and protections, but calling it marriage would still be a show-stopper to me.\n\n \n \n Have you ever really taken a good hard look at the English language? If so, you would have noticed that we have SEVERAL words which have multiple meanings/definitions (if you will). A word having more than one definition does not belittle any other definitions of that same word, does it? NO! \n \n This rule would then hold true for the word: MARRIAGE. \n \n Actually, that word ALREADY has SEVERAL definitions. \n \n We are NOT changing any one definition by including another.\n \n So, the ENTIRE argument that by allowing same-sex couples to marry would in anyway \"Change\" the definition is disinformation at work once again. \n \n \n If we allow same-sex couples to legally marry, does it in anyway water down any other marriage between opposite-sex couples? NO.\n Unless we're talking about adultery, in that a member of an opposite gender couple leaves his/her legal spouce to enter into one with someone of the same gender, but that's a completely different subject all together. \n My marrying my same gender partner of eight years has absolutely ZERO effect on the marriage between my brother and his wife, or my parents. NONE, ZIP, ZERO, NADA! \n Since I am not marrying my sister-in-law nor my mother, my marrying my partner CAN NOT have any affect on their relationships whatsoever, unless for some unforseen reason they allow it to do so, by way of creating stressors between them. Which again, is NOT my fault or that of any other same-gender couple. \n \n Hell, I pay into the tax base, medicare, social security, local property taxes which go to my son's school district as well as police, fire and other municipal agencies. I pay into benefits of which I any currently barred from simply because I'm not legally wed to my partner. Not out of conscience choise either...no, insted it's out of LEGAL DESCRIMINATION TOWARDS COUPLES OF THE SAME GENDER WHO OPENLY WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN ENTERING INTO THE LEGAL CONTRACT OF MARRIAGE!",

The difference is that one is discriminatory for a good reason while the other is discriminatory for no good reason, or at least I believe there is no good reason to discriminate against same-sex couples. Whether that reason exists is the heart of the debate.\n \n As for the reasoning that makes it okay to discriminate against younger people, the idea is that everyone will be old some day, and old people are often unable to continue working and being productive. In order to better the lives of people who are too old to be working, social security was implemented to ensure that we would all have a steady flow of cash to keep us afloat in our old age. Since younger people do not need this help and we need people to work in order to have a productive society, this benefit only makes sense in the hands of the elderly.\n \n In the case of same-sex marriage, I have to assume that we are not giving benefits to people based on their religious beliefs regarding what constitutes a marriage. The reasons for granting marriage benefits, as I see them, are to encourage the family structure, which provides emotional support to its members. Furthermore, the benefits granted by marriage help one member of a family care for others who become ill or fall on hard times. Beyond that, the benefits ease the financial burden of parenting and raising children. Since all of these things can apply to same-sex couples, it logically does not make sense to not grant these rights to same-sex couples. Allowing same-sex marriage encourages more people to adopt, giving loving homes to children in need, grants benefits to good people, encourages the emotional support provided by a family for same-sex couples, and gives same-sex couples a set of benefits that will let them care for each other if one should fall ill or on hard times. The same reasons which we implement opposite-sex marriage apply for same-sex marriage. Since I see no harm caused by same-sex marriage and no reason to deny it, save promoting one man's preferred lifestyle over another's, I will make the claim that banning same-sex marriage is a bane to freedom and equality in every sense.",

Whether that reason exists is the heart of the debate.\n\n \n Well, I don't mean for this to become a social security discussion, but I think your arguments for saying the the one case of discrimination is any better than the other is weak. There are plenty of people out there who don't make it to 62 (and some may even know they won't), so the argument that 'we're all going to get SS sooner or later' doesn't really hold up. And the argument that younger people don't need help is not compelling either--many certainly probably do need financial help--just like many gay couples can claim to need to the benefits of marriage.\n \n The point here is that the govt. has numerous programs in which they discriminate, and anyone could argue that they such discrimination for any of those programs is bad. Social security, pell grants, disability payments, marriage benefits, etc. are all forms of benefits the govt. gives out and none of them were around when the constitution was drafted. To say that gay marriage is an example of inequality or denial of rights is to claim that about any of these examples, because they are all examples of benefits given based on criteria. Your claim that you should get marriage benefits is no different than a healthy person claiming it's unfair for his neighbor to get disability payments or no different than a younger person saying social security is unfair. Both could be cases where there is indeed a need there despite not meeting the criteria.\n \n \nIn the case of same-sex marriage, I have to assume that we are not giving benefits to people based on their religious beliefs regarding what constitutes a marriage. \n\n \n I think the real issue here is that you are trying to cash in on a form of govt. benefits for which you don't meet the criteria.

You are confusing ethical convention with justification. Conventional Ethical Relativism isn't justification for anything. It fails logically to explain/justify anything. Just because the majority wants it or says it does not mean it's warrented. There must be objective reasoning provided for said belief to be justified, not just will of the masses.\n \n Whether or not it's legal in A B C D does not mean it ought to be lega or illegal. There are many \"illegal\" sexual acts that hurt no one and are victumliess crimes (masturbation in your own home), for example, is a finable offense in some countries. Do you think that this is justified soley because the government says so? If you do, you are very shallow morally.\n \n You are committing the is/ought fallacy. Any normative statement must be backed up by at least 1 or 2 normative premises. Stating that they HAVE a right or the majority wants it are not normative premises, and you can never go from those premises to a normative conclusion. It's also non sequitor--it doesn't follow.\n \n 2. Pedo is illegal in many nations, as it should be, but it's not the fact that the majority doesn't like it that makes it justified to be illegal. It's the ethically objective reasoning which goes behind the law. Pedophillia hurts and exploits people and affects people who are below a certain level of rational behavior which ethically warrents decision-making. You cannot compare Pedophillic behavior to homosexual marriage. It's a false analogy based on illogical is/ought premises.\n \n \n \n Anthropologically speaking? Anthropologically speaking, the vast majority of marriages throughout history have been heterosexual. While some ancient societies tolerated same-sex unions, it was hardly mainstream in any culture.\n\n \n Strawman relpy. No one said the majority of world or cultural marriages are homosexual. You are making that up in an effort to knock something down no one argued.\n \n The real issue is as follows, which you twisted: Anthropologically speaking, there's no rational reason to assume that the social definition recently slapped onto marriage is correct or ought to be honoured. Do you believe things are right by virture of a sovereign nation's culture supporting them? Whether or not it's part of a culture or law does not make it justified.\n \n Try not to do that in the future. Nothing above states that the vast majority are homosexual, it merely, and correctly states that, according to mainstream anthropology, marriage definitions aren't universal and there's no objective reason to hold one version over another. THe real issue at hand is the concept of human equality of treatment and objective ethics. YOu cannot say \"my version of marriage is justified beause my government says so.\" \n \n A.That's not logically valid as an argument.\n B. Myriad cultures around the world do have various homosexual marriage varients, and they all get the same treatment as heterosexual marriages, and neither of these treatments have adversly effected the population or destroyed society. It didn't in the past, it won't now, and it won't in the future. Since there is no 'ONE' objective definition of marriage, it's not destroying anything. The definition of marriage given by \"Americans\" isn't a valid one. It's a product of invalid convention. \n \n \n \n It's not incumbent upon me to prove that my beliefs are rational or justifiable, but if you need a moral perspective, read Genesis.\n\n \n 1.

   " You forgot to add the cavaet \"In YOUR opinion.\" To many, morality and spirituality go hand-in-hand.\n\n \n Use the Razor, which easily shaves away the entire justification for Religious Ethis. Once you do this, you kill the source, and the rest of it dies. Since God is a superfluous entity, any and all beliefs which come from GOd no longer are required to actually come from GOd, therefore they aren't the absolute divine system people think they are.\n \n This is largely a valid opinion. Why do you ask? Because metaphysics is worthless and academically unjustified. Morality and Ethics can be based on objective logical reasoning in lieu of metaphysical mysticism.\n \n Again, you are assuming that because many people belief something to be true, it implies it is true, when you mentioned that morality and spirituality go hand-in-hand. This isn't the case. Appeal to popularity and numbers have no bearing on the validity of the system under question.\n \n \n How does one logically justify a faith-based belief?\n\n \n That's the crux of the issue. YOu cannot justify faith. Faith is useless. If you have faith in something you are recognizing and admitting that your belief is subjective and has no objective, empirical, or rational basis. Faith is the antithesis to objective justification. \n \n This is the distinct difference between Objective Ethics and Religious and Relativistic Ethics. Objective Ethics uses reason and empirical evidence and observation, whilst faith uses an unfalsifiable \"innate\" origin or metaphysical realm from which the values are gathered. These systems are easily culled.\n \n This is a problem. People appeal to \"faith,\" as did St. Thomas Aquinace, when they have nothing else. It's like man A commenting: Mountains are really the spawn of Satan. HOw do you this? Metaphysical Faith, being the answer. It's unnecessary and impossible to gauge, since someone can always come up with some unfalsifiable ideology to explain the phenomenon.\n \n \n \n I haven't equivocated on anything. The MAJORITY of Americans don't care if the concept of \"gay marriage\" is MAINSTREAM or not. When it comes to making social policy, one needs to be concerned with the majority.\n \n On a side note, you really have an annoying debating style.\n\n \n 1. The majority of americans opinions or their lack of care really has no bearing on whether or not the belief is warrented. This is a fact.\n \n Social policy in the United States is based on duality; Protection of Minority from Majority and the protection of Majority from Minority outline in the Federalist Papers #10. Yes, the United STates does have some democratic qualities, but the Argument from Democracy has no bearing still on the correctness or wrongness of an Maxim.\n \n You are correct in that you have to \"consider\" popularity when making social policy, but only insomuch that the belief is justified. It's wrong to implement policies based on irrational, unethical opinions. It's merely sophistry: placating the masses of undereducated people who really don't have the expertise needed to run government policy through clever political rhetoric and oration.\n \n Your argument stems from the Anthropological Argument of Ethics, but that's not really a valid ethical argument. Differences among cultures and the variations argument don't = right or wrong. \n \n Why is gay marriage wrong in the United States? Because people say so? That's a conventional answer, not an objective answer. An objective answer would be, if provable: 1. Marriage harms children (which there's on evidence\"\n 2. Marriage is a religious institution universally (which it isn't, according to 99.9% of anthropological studies.\n 3. Gay marriage leads to the destruction of society (which it hasn't and never does, and is a simplistic-simple minded reason) No society collapses because of personal sexual relationships between conscenting adults..\n 3. Marriage has the purpose of only producing children (which it doesn't).\n \n \n On a side note, you really have an annoying debating style.\n\n \n Good. Others have an annoying way of not providing information for their opinions. They expect others to prove their cases for them and they tend to ignore the rules of logic.",

There must be objective reasoning provided for said belief to be justified, not just will of the masses.\n\n \n If there are enough people with the will for something, it's not going to matter whether there is justification yea or nay.

I would argue that in every case, the law was changed because of the will of the people--slavery didn't even have a chance to end until enough people were against it in this country. Segregation didn't become illegal until enough people in this country were against it for the legal fight against it to prevail. If too many people were against it, segregation would not have even been opposed enough to be overturned (and for centuries it wasn't). \n \n So the will of the masses is always what ultimately turns to tide in most cases.

You are saying it's ok to have a system of laws with NO justification behind it other than the will of the mases. That's inane. That's what your argument logically leads to. It's bad.

The will of the masses, sadly, is what makes the world go around, not rational justification, untill it happens to you. However, there's no argument to support making a law and it being right just because someone says so. Laws with no justfication are, well, unjustified. Lets look at what unjustified means:\n \n adj : lacking justification or authorization; \"unreasonable searches and seizures\"; \"desire for undue private profit\"; \"unwarranted limitations of personal freedom\"\n \n I guess you also find no problem with the masses supporting a law that allowed the government to illegally search the home of a group of people they didn't like: say jews, for instance, and confiscate any material they found to be \"impure christian values.\" Of course, that's where your \"will of the masses,\" justification = irrelevant, leads.\n \n A law, whether or not the people want it, must be justified through logic and objective reasoning or it has  no basis . It's as good as saying: murder is legal becauses the masses say so (hypothetically). So you are basically saying you like living in a nation that feels free to legislate unjustified laws. You find it fantastic to have discrimination because the majority says so? You would find it nice to live in a country that tries to ban you from getting married? Please.

   " You completely missed the point.\n \n What I'm saying is that while it may be desirable (by me to in some ways) for laws to have to be justified, ultimately society decides it's laws. There's no way around that. It may seem fine and dandy for a few to be able to run something through the courts against the will of the general public, but the reality is that it's rarely ever happened that way. Why? Because our govt. is set up to be a govt. by the people and for the people. We elect our lawmakers based on what we want them to do for us. I'm saying that in reality, it just doesn't happen the way you say.\n\n \n I get what you mean, that no matter if it's justified or not, people will do what they want. This is because people in general are stupid in the world. I mean, come on. 50% of the population believes in a literal translation of the bible. That takes zero objective thinking. 40% of the population believes in ghosts, goblins, and magical transcendentalism, which, according to Neurotheology describes religious \"awakenings\" as brain dysfunction.\n \n WHen you have a majority of people who can't think logically or rationally, you get laws that reflect that. In my opinion, and it's justified, any law ought to be struck down if it doesn't match up with some objective reason to have it (redundancy, uselessness, frivolous law, injurious to others).\n \n Well, in reality it does happen some what. They are mislabeld \"activist\" judges, when they, in reality, are acting on the merit of a law and the basis of moral justification, rather than just \"gimmie what I want cause I outnumber you.\"\n \n \n \n I think you are failing to give \"the masses\" the credit they deserve by implying it is bad to let us govern ourselves. Without the enough of the masses changing their views, segregation would still be in place today.\n\n \n Without the masses, segregation wouldn't have been there in the first place, and neither would have slavery before it. The masses got it and then they finally got rid of it only when it was no longer economically effective and it caused too many problems. They didn't do the right thing, they did it out of convenience and agitation.\n \n 1. I really doubt I am failing to give the masses that much credit. Millions are in poverty and have little education and over 50 million people are fundamentalists (no brain at all), and then you have the seriously old, the feeble young, and then finally the people who are apathetic and don't give a hoot about politics (For example, in a recent poll, the majority of young males don't give a rat's XXX about the first amendment and they can't even recite whatt it is when given a multiple choice test on it). This is pathetic. These are the XXXXXX who are going to be future voters and legislators. The people who don't \"care.\"\n \n \n \n\n It would still be illegal for women to vote. \n\n \n Don't forget why they couldn't vote in the first place.\n \n \n\n And to require a justification for laws outside of the will of masses is to pull the rug out from under democracy. \n\n \n And? Democracy isn't some sacred cow government, and the United STates isn't a Democracy anyway. It's a Federal Democratic Republic. It's not a government structure in which the masses rule. It's a balance between minoirty and majority. Secondly\n \n \n\n Who decides what that \"justification\" is? A monarch? Or are you advocating a \"legistocracy,\" where the courts basically take the place of determining what our laws are rather than the people?\n\n \n 1. No. A monarchy isn't good, because the power of making laws isn't based on how powerful someone is or how many people there are. The reason a law ought to be passed is based competely on it's merit and logic. I fyou can't come up with any logical reasons for having the law, there's no reason to have the law, is there?\n \n If you can't explain logically how this law operates and why, it's mere nonsense.\n \n 2. And yes. The number of people involved in making laws doesn't matter. Opinions should be overruled by objective evidence and sound reasoning. The people don't belong making laws. Educated, objective thinkers do. Democracy isn't a good system, but the way politics and education works nowadays, everyone is indoctrinated in political ideology insomuch that they don't actually care about how the system  should  run or could run.\n \n Think of the system as a type of logical positivism/ SM.\n \n 3. No one person decides; the system decides. The people come up with laws through legislators, and then yo have people who analyse them and weed out the BS and explain it to the public, because the public is generally stupid. You have myriad councils of professionally trained ethicists and logicians who work in concert with men who use the Scientific Method (very objective thinkers). These people take an analysis of the laws and match them up against Objective Ethical systems and logical reasoning. The end product is a system of checks against legal stupidity and doubletalk.\n \n Do you know how many logical fallacies are used in Political lawmaking and debate? Bush and Kerry used at least 5-6 throughout the debates, and few, if any people, pick up on them. THey just keep chugging down the BS like it's free candy. Politicians throw red herrings at each other all the time, they focus on little more than Ad Hominems on top of total bifurcation of issues. It's not a good system, and that's why there are so many problems. People of the masses are usually too stupid to understand the basic concepts being discussed or WHY these debates aren't real debates at all in the first place.\n \n Kerry tauts the \"working class,\" when he couldn't give a flying **** about the working class. Bush is for the common man, yet he has nothing in common with the common man. They focus things like SS and HC, but know nothing about them and most often just spew propaganda which the masses latch onto. They then hit up on origin and ad hominems, not facts and logic. THey distort the facts and initiate strawmans, and then throw in some red herrings.\n \n Lawmakers don't give a **** about reality or the people, they make laws that are illogical based on illogical ideologies.\n \n Half the people I know voted for Democrats because they are the colour blue. No one knew any of the issues, and when confronted, most people can't make sense of them, because it's all BS anyway. \n \n If you have logic behind the laws, you would know whether or not y ou ought to enact such a law. Perhaps if Socialists, for example, took a look at the facts, or if conservatives took a look at the facts, and looked at it ethicaly and analytically, you wouldn't have the conflicts that arise from making ill conceived laws. Having logicians instead of moronic masses making laws through elected officials would fix a lot of problems.\n \n However, these people would be bound by constitutionality, so as not to make any malicious, yet logical laws.\n \n \n\n So yes, I certainly do think it's ok to have a system of laws set in place by the will of the masses. That's what democracy is all about.\n\n \n I don't think it's a good system. The masses cannot be trusted, no matter how much I feel sorry for them. Leadership talent is few, and educated people are getting more and more rare. THe protections placed in the constitution seem not to work against mass stupidity in legislation and the people.\n \n \n Heterosexual marriage isn't relatively recent unless you think in terms of geological epochs. The Bible speaks of marriage as the union of one man/one woman in Genesis. And Genesis wasn't written recently.\n \n\n \n Homosexual marriage and relations aren't recent either. It goes in cycles and was/is found in many cultures and does no objective harm to anyone. Who cares what the Bible says? It's an ancient book of fallacies, mutiple authors, and archaic, bloodythirsty rules. Why treat it with anything other than a literary note? It's not like it's a book of facts, in general.\n \n \n\n I doubt that I'll have to. As long as gay activists keep pushing for an all or nothing in your face resolution, the majority of Americans will push back. Light the fuse and \"boom\", new Constitutional amendment.\n\n \n Sure wish those gay activists pushed as hard as the idiotic Fundies on the Right.There should be no debate, because the opposing side has no logic behind their arguments, and since there's no logic, there concusions don't follow from their premises, and most of their premises are untrue anyway. It really ends there. The majority of americans should use the brains, not their jaws.",

   "Oh yes you have. If your memory fails you, I can repost your statements.\n\n Don't bother, here's what I posted.\n \n\n Thank you for laying out the basis for the next part of the debate. Unlike the economics of gay marriage, the moral repercussions aren't as easily quantified.\n Here are some of the \"moral concerns\" that I've heard expressed. I don't necessarily subscribe to them, but I'm laying them on the table for discussion.\n \n 1. Legalizing gay marriage will promote homosexuality, which is an unnatural condition\n 2. Legalizing gay marriage will corrupt straight children\n 3. It will increase the number of pedophiles\n 4. It is anti-Christian and America is predominantly a Christian society\n 5. It will weaken the institution of marriage\n \n We can start with these and add or subtract as we see fit.\n\n and in \n http://4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=86158&postcount=158\n \n\n I've already replied on pedophilia. I know that pedophiles are just as likely to be heterosexual as homosexual. I brought it up because many straights don't know that the two are unrelated and almost Pavlovian start to talk about pedophiles whenever homosexuality is mentioned. And organizations, such as NAMBLA, as has been previously mentioned, don't help dispell the myth that pedophiles are homosexuals, exclusively.\n\n Does that help you. My memory on this one is backed up by fact. emoticon_rolleyes",

Slavery was subtley placed into the constitution by the framers of the constitution in the various provisions, especially the 3/5ths compromise and state representation.\n \n In the judicial act in the case of Dredd Scott, the Supreme court validated the interpretation of the Consitution and stated that africans were property + had no rights. \n \n The majority of the people also supported slavery, even the people who had no slaves. They did this because they felt it was better to be above a slave than equal to a former one. They also supported slavery because it gave them an illusion of a better life.\n \n The majority  did  support slavery, and as an institution, it was deeply rooted in the ideology and constitution set up by the founding fathers.

That I see as a problem. \n \n \n \n Worldwide, yes.

   " \n Yet because enough of the masses realized it was wrong, the law changed.\n\n \n Oh no no no! That's not historically accurate. The reason why slavery was outlawed had  little  to do with rational ethical justifications. The reason slavery was outlawed was due to  punishement  and political advantage. Moral suasion only got a minority of the people.\n \n Another major factor in the outlawing of slavery was not a majority support or care for slaves, rather economics and political dangers of it.
