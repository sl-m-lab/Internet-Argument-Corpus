   "Hey Pietro, I see in other threads that you have encountered Brady, but as you are a little new to him and his ways let me offer this by way of explanation of his past behavior....\n \n Brady and I go back a long way. I have caught him lying here on more than one occasion-although he may not have even been aware at first that his posts were lies-he only posts what he has read online from others without considering the truthfulness of it. In any event, I have shown him on more than one occasion that his posts contain lies-and he has never disputed this. Instead, he just runs away. Here are a couple of examples:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/13437-new-york-citys-undercover-investigation-gun-shows-5.html#post374724\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/13264-closing-terrorist-loophole-4.html#post369793\n \n He talks a big game but he will never stand his ground on anything he says. In fact, every time I catch him in a lie or even challenge him on anything at all he just strikes his tent and runs off only to reappear in another thread pretending that nothing happened.\n \n I have made numerous offers calling him out to debate the issues he raises, and he runs away every time. Here are a couple of examples:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/14099-mass-shooting-dc-2.html#post396813\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/13919-gun-nut-should-not-share-holiday-martin-luther-king-5.html#post392289\n \n I don't make these offers with any expectation that they will be accepted. I just make them to show how he talks a big game but runs off like a coward every time he is challenged. For example, \"time to kick some gun nut butt\" was a favorite tag line saying of his once upon a time-but every time I called him out on it the only use he made of his feet in response was in headlong flight.\n \n Watch what happens now....I promise you he will run away from this again.\n \n \nYou can run but you cant hide.\n\n \n Well come on then, Brady. Man up on your big talk and acknowledge at least one of the offers I have made to debate you on any issue of gun control you choose.\n \n If you have forgotten all of them then let me re-state the offer:\n \n Brady, I again offer to debate you here on any gun control related issue you choose. \n \n If you are finally ready to actually have a debate with me, then post your willingness to do so here or start a new thread calling me out to debate you. \n \n And the response is....\n \n ---\n \n \"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world. Among the free peoples who govern themselves there is but a small field of usefulness open for the men of cloistered life who shrink from contact with their fellows. Still less room is there for those who deride of slight what is done by those who actually bear the brunt of the day; nor yet for those others who always profess that they would like to take action, if only the conditions of life were not exactly what they actually are. The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be a cynic, or fop, or voluptuary. There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder. Well for these men if they succeed; well also, though not so well, if they fail, given only that they have nobly ventured, and have put forth all their heart and strength. It is war-worn Hotspur, spent with hard fighting, he of the many errors and valiant end, over whose memory we love to linger, not over the memory of the young lord who \"but for the vile guns would have been a valiant soldier.\"\" Theodore Roosevelt \"Citizenship in a Republic,\" Speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, France April 23, 1910.",
