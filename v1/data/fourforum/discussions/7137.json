   "You said you might 'drop them a line or two'. You may be reasonable, but from my experience of publicised addresses like this, the best we can hope for is hate mail, and the worst outright violence. It reminds me of when the Daily Mirror published the addresses of 'sex criminals' (presented as child rapists, but actually anyone on the sex offenders register, which includes two underagers together etc.). This was for the purpose of 'protecting your children, but in practice encouraged hate and violence. It didn't help that the information was inaccurate, or that some of the vigilantes heard someone was a paediatrician and went to throw bricks at their house. \n \n Saying someone is ignorant of how public records work doesn't justify harassment or faciliating harassment.\n \n I support gay marriage, but it really isn't fair to say that all opponents are heartless control freaks. As on many issues, someone can be wrong or out of date without being evil.\n\n \n \n That is the point if they are opposed to some one getting married then they are busybodies who want to control that persons life. If they weren't intrerested in cotrol they would mind thier own business. I don't go about pokeing my nose into someone elses marriage, that is until now.

Since bad laws are not unconsitutional...a judge can't decide to strike one down because of it...although they sadly have been doing this the last 40-50 years or so. The anti-federalist papers warned about this and the federalist papers said it wouldn't happen :xbanghead \n\n \n A judge cannot strike down a law on it's own. However, if a law is challenged, a judge can strike down a law based on whether there is justification for the law.\n \n \nHow is denying someone a job because of their gender equal treatment? If you think that is equal treatment then so is disallowing gay marriage because a gay person is still allowed to marry but the choices are just restricted.\n\n \n \n Did'nt say it was equal treatment. There is no law mandating that strippers be female. If a man is willing to challenge the law then so be it. However, a man can get a job in a (female) strip club, but he won't be a stripper.\n \n \nreasoned logic is not a requirement for any law. We can have dumb laws if we want.\n\n \n That's true.\n \n Still have to be constitutional, however.\n \n \n I already know. They felt that equal protection didn't cover this...all but O'Connor.
