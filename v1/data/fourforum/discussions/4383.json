   "To me the debate between evolutionism/creationism and which should be taught to our children seems to be a battleground for those that want to control the thoughts and lifestyles of the masses.\n\n Only on one side. There is a high likelihood that children will profess the religion of their parents and believe it to be the \"trooth.\" It is also highly likely that the religion professed will be that of the culture around them. In the U.S. that religion is probably one of the hundreds of Christian sects, all of which claim a unique knowledge to absolute truth. Religion is always based on indoctrination in dogma. The conflict arose when scientific inquiry first began to arrive at conclusions that went counter to some religious sect. Thus Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake, and Galileo was forced to recant his assertion that the earth did indeed move and was not the center of the universe.\n \n It isn't science that attempts to control thoughts, but religion. Science is a process of questioning. Science encourages discent when it is based on evidence and experimentation.\n \n I think maybe taco doesn't live in the U.S. The idea that religious supernaturalism should be taught along side naturalistic science in our schools is prohibited by our Constitution. Supernaturalists who profess such situations have little respect for the traditions and the highest laws of our government. They instead try to introduce their religion into government and reject the foundations of our country by incorrectly claiming that it is somehow based in the supernaturalism of fundamentalist Christianity.\n \nIt seems to be that this topic envokes great passion from people on both sides of the argument. I am not exactly sure why that is but my suspesion is that these people think the world would be better off if others believed as they believe.\n\n Not correct. I don't care who wants to believe that the mythology of bronze age nomadic herdsmen is absolute historical fact. It affects me in no way if someone wishes to profess that the curious combination of Sumerian and Babylonian mythology is somehow without contradictions. Read the story of Noah or the story of Johah and make the ridiculous assertion that these stories are true - it doesn't bother me. You may do so in your home, in your church, and even in public - stand on the corner downtown and wave your holy book over your head and provess the good news to all passers. As long as I am free to pass, you may do so.\n \n However, when I send my children to my tax supported schools and they are taught your religion where I expectedd they would learn about science and the scientific method, then I am upset. The Constitution forbids the government from endorsing or supporting religion. It isn't a matter of being fair. If it were \"fair\" then I should have the right to have my religion taught in place of science too, along side the hundreds of Christian sects, Islam, Buddahism and so forth. But it isn't a matter of fair. It is a matter of the teaching of science, and religion isn't science.\n \nThe desire to have others think as they do has always been a mystery to me. I could care less if people disagree with me, but I always try to be respectful of other's points of view and try to learn from them and understand where there coming from.\n\n Then why are you professing that supernaturalism should be taught in science classes? It seems that you do care and would prefer that your religion be imposed on others.\n \nIn fact many times I have learned from others by keeping an open mind.\n\n That's not apparent. You are demonstrating a closed mind while claiming the opposite.\n \nThat being said, wouldn't an easy solution to this problem of what to teach our children be solved by teaching them both sides (creationism/evolution) when they are at an more advanced aged and able to understand the complexities of the matter (evolution and creationism or any other legitimate theories for that matter). An expert from both sides of the argument could teach their respective theory, after hearing this students could come to an educated decision of their own free will.\n\n Silly idea. Do it in your country if you can (are you from Iran or Afghanistan?). Unless you are willing to teach all religions and all of the mythology of creation of all cultural traditions that are held by the citizens of this country, then you are demonstrating your closed mind. You are trying to control the minds of children by imposing your religion.\n \n Besides, it takes more than a year of study in which teens are presented contradictory ideas in a class called \"science\" for them to learn enough to make such a decision. There wouldn't be much to the presentation of \"creation science,\" but even a boiled down version of all of the various creation stories that would need to be presented would be quite time consuming. Of course, we would have to present the views of all of the hundreds of Christian sects and how they are the same and how they are different. The way it is now, there isn't enough time to present the science so that students actually gain a complete grasp. I spent several years in the study of biology. The detailed concepts of evolution aren't even presented until upper division, and even taking a class on evolution may require courses in botany, zoology, ecology, and genetics - certainly a course in general biology and one in genetics as a bare minimum.\n \nAs a responsible adult (which all of our children will hopefully grow up to be) I do this all the time with one decision or another.\n\n But you seem to have failed to grasp what science is and how it works. Before you can make the decision, you would need to actually understand why religion isn't science. It doesn't seem that you do.\n \nWhile we may not always agree with what others decide, I think that we should respect the decisions of others while living our own lives in the way we see fit.\n\n Certainly. What does that have to do with the teaching of your religion to my children against their wills, in tax supported schools? How is teaching your religion to my children indicative of respect for my decision to reject supernaturalism as truth?\n \nThe bottom line is that we should be free to believe as we believe while others should be afforded that same right. Thank you.\n\n And how have I deprived you of your right to teach your religion to your children in your home and in your church. How does an objection against the imposition of your religion by force of the government deprive you of your rights. I can certainly see how the imposition of your religion would deprive me of my right to the free exercise of my own religion, but why do you feel that you have a right to impose your religion on me?",

   "I don't think there is a need to teach creationism in the classroom. I just think evolution shouldn't be taught as an absolute truth and that could be other possibilities for life.\n\n Many (In my experience, most) creationists want to introduce \"creation science\" into biology classes. Thankfully, the courts haven't been fooled and \"creation science\" has been found not to be science but religion. Now there is the new creationism, called \"Intelligent Design Theory.\" In this form of creationism the creationists pretend that they are discussing some scientific basis for concluding that the universe and everything in it is designed by some unspecified designer. Actually, in private statements (not meant for the consumption of school boards or courts) the proponents admit that the designer they have in mind is their God. But so far the IDers haven't been able to show that they actually do any science.\n \n As for evolution being taught as absolute truth, it isn't. It is presented as being true, and that is simply because we observe evolution to occur. Evolution is defined as changes to the genetic makeup of populations over time. We see such changes all the time. There is no doubt that evolution happens. In fact, most creationists realized several years ago that there are way too many different kinds of animals that getting 2 of each onto a big wooden box and setting them afloat for a year or so would be impossible. So the answer is to reduce the millions of species to a few thousand \"kinds\" and pretend that they will fit into the box and survive there. Then creationists propose evolution to get the millions of species from the few thousand pairs. But that would be evolution at rates that make the heads of evolutionary biologists spin. Creationist call this \"variation in kind,\" and they pretend that a single pair of any \"kind\" could carry enough genetic diversity to yield the great variety we see in almost all species today.\n \n While there are other \"possibilities\" for life, as you put it, which ones should be taught in science classes? Should we teach that aliens from another world planted life on our planet? Should we claim that the necessary materials fell to earth in a meteor? Maybe we should teach the creation mythology of the Dakota, Cheyenne, of Apache, or even of the Australian aborigine. Or maybe we should teach only the possibilities for which we have some sort of evidence, possibilities based on reality.",

   "By writing my argument I apparently came off as some religious zealot. This could not be further from the truth.\n\n Oops. Well, you see, the argument that we should present \"all sides\" and let the students decide is typically a creationist argument. It is an appeal to \"fairness.\" Since the creationists have their own \"theory\" of origins, it would be \"fair\" to present it too. But \"creation science\" was soundly rejected as science many years ago. Still, creationists use the argument. Some even claim that it is a violation of their 1st Amendment rights to freedom of religion. They would have us believe that not teaching their specific form of Christianity in public schools means that their right to the free exercise of their religion is being denied. It is the same argument that is used when the courts require that 10 Commandment displays be removed from government buildings.\n \nWhat I wrote was based on personal experience. I went to school (a public school which taught fact and theory with scientific basis) and I went to church that taught their version of creationism. Being a reasonably intelligent person I came to the conclusion that the theory of evolution with it's scientific basis and evidence in the fossil record provided the most logical explanation as to how we came to be. I believe that creationism is most likely the folklore of ancient times, before we had science to help explain the world around us.\n\n Then I am puzzled why you would say the creationism should be presented and the students should be allowed to decide. I guess we should also present the flat earth theory and let them decide that too. Based on simple observation, a flat earth isn't unreasonable.\n \nAll of the things you wrote with regard to separation of church and state I could not agree with more. My writing was more a reaction to the fact that I see this separation dissolving all around me, in many cases it just is not a reality where I live. There is currently a movement in my state to teach a new version of creationism (I forget exactly what the new terminology is that they are using.)\n\n That would be \"intelligent design,\" or ID. Are you in Ohio? Efforts to introduce religion in science classes have been going on since the early 1960s. First there were efforts to ban the teaching of evolution. The courts decided that the most current theories of science should be taught in science class. Next creationists invented \"creation science\" in which the tried to make their religion sound scientific and by twisting the interpretation of observations, show that evolution is wrong. The courts found that \"creation science\" is religion.\n \nBasically I feel that these radical religious people are working tirelessly to have their way taught in our schools and right now I don't know that much can be done to stop them (this is what I meant by mind control). I don't want to see your tax dollars or mine being spent to force feed a particular ideology to children, but it sure seems like that is what a lot of people in power are intent on doing and it looks like it's going to happen.\n\n Hopefully the courts won't be fooled by the latest form of creationism.\n \nWith regard to me respecting the beliefs of others all I basically meant was you don't force creationism on me and I won't force evolution on you(or attempt to control your way of thinking). Perhaps I am naive, but I just believe that the majority of intelligent people, if given the oppurtunity, can tell the difference between scientific theory/fact with real physically evidence as a basis as opposed to a folktale passed down for thousands of years and maintained by an instituition with a rich history of corruption.\n\n Sadly, you may be wrong. There are a lot of people who think that the Bible is 100% historically correct. Even the President, when asked if he thought that evolution should be taught in the schools said that, \"the jury is still out.\" All that crack and grass fried his brain.\n \nIn closing, whatever people chose to believe that is their right and others should respect it whatever it may be. Thank you.\n\n Exactly. I don't want my religion forced on others in the school. I will practice my religion in my home and in church. (I don't stand on the corner waving a Bible over my head shouting at passers-by, but I don't see why others shouldn't be able to do it without interference. I just think that science should be taught in science classes.",

It's important that people not cling too closely to cherished beliefs simply because they're accepted by \"the establishment.\" Otherwise you have no progress, right?\n \n As an example, I can think of this one theory that came out a while ago that turned an entire establishment on its head. Where one idea had been accepted for centuries, a single individual looked closer at his world than anyone had before and discovered that things worked differently than people believed. Oh, there was backlash, as there always is (even to this day), but more and people people looked at his work, looked at the evidence and decided he was right. His theory was modified and improved upon, but it has remained essentially unchanged.\n \n The discovery and development of the theory of evolution is one of the crowning achievments of man's (and woman's) scientific exploits. Sure, there could be another theory to come along, anything is possible. But anything else that we come up with still have to explain why evolution fits so damn much of the evidence we have.

   "Another pointless diatribe by Heavenbound, leading to the mighty logical conclusion that you should also teach something other than gravity and atomic theory just because \"it's a theory.\"\n Brilliant connection.\n\n While your evaluation of HeavenBound's motivations and rationale may be correct, fishpower is certainly correct in principle. Any teacher of science tries to convey the idea that there are other possiblities. In fact, in high school physics you are more likely to learn Newton's theory of gravity that either Einstein's or quantum gravity. They are all three correct in a limited domain - Newton in our every day lives, Einstein when considering the very, very large, and quantum gravity for the very, very small.\n \n How about biology? We know that evolution happens, but are our theories that explain why evolution happens correct, or can there be other possibilities? As a matter of fact, the theory of natural selection (as well as sexual selection) are two of the oldest theories of science that haven't been falsified by later observations. (As I said, Newton's theory of gravitation works on normal sized objects - it is used to calculate orbital mechanics for satilites and space shuttles. But it isn't right, as Einstein showed. A current problem for science is to reconcile three conflicting theories of gravitation.\n \n The point is that a science education is much more than a memorization of facts. It is (or at least should be) an effort to teach what science is and how it works. It is an effort to teach methodological naturalism - the scientific method. Rational questions are how science works. A scientist makes an observation that doesn't seem to be explained by current theory and asks why. Darwin proposed gradualism - the accumulation of small, heritable changes (even though he was completely ignorant as to how they were conveyed) in populations of organisms. That inheritance is not just a matter of the mixing of blood or essence or some such, but the passing of some sort of particular factor that determines the charactaristics of an organism was one of Darwin's most brilliant predictions. It wasn't until the 1930s and 40s, when Mendelian genetics were rediscovered that it was realized that genes were the particles of inheritance that Darwin had predicted. The brilliance of that prediction has been overwhelmed by the confirmation of Darwin's theory of natural selection.\n \n But I digress. Back to the teaching of science. I have some experience in doing so. Besides being a TA during graduate school, I have taught from 7th grade through high school. 7th grade was a course in general science. As long as we were on schedule, I reserved every Friday for any question about any aspect of science that my students wanted - class material, news stories, any experience as long as it could be remotely related to science. I hope that all of those students left my class with the idea that it is always OK to question science. After one earns a bachelor's degree, does original research (asks questions) for a master's, and then completes a significant and original research project (more questions) for a Ph.D., then it becomes quite clear that the examination of other possibilities is how science advances.\n \n Sadly, creationism is an assertion of dogmatism. One begins with the conclusions and rejects anything that cannot be accomodated into a narrow world view. Creationists don't ask meaningful questions.",

   "Is there some truth in the idea that 1 + 1 = 3?\n \n There can be perceived truth in a lot of things that are based in ignorance. Such as the idea that the sun revolves around the earth. Well... there is some truth in that concept in the sense that from the perception of an ignorant observer on earth, the sun does appear to travel around the earth. But in reality, the truth is that the earth revolves around the sun.\n \n Is that the sort of idea you are trying to convey with your statement that \"[You] think there is some truth in everything\"?\n\n \n well we figured out it revolved that was a step forward now wasn't it?\n \n We have to stand before we can walk, and some theories have to be presented just because it has a chance to further our knowledge, even if it is a load of...... never mind",

   "Right. That's what I said. Science is a process and a way of learning. In order to learn one must certainly have an open mind. To decide on the answer before examining and testing the evidence is how a closed mind works. That's how \"creation science\" works.\n \n But \"creation science\" is an attempt to distort and twist the evidence. In some cases what is presented by \"creation scientists\" is either an outright lie or based on the stupidity of the speaker. Would you like an example?\n\n \n I don't find anything wrong with trying to prove something. You never know, they may disprove themselves one day. :p",
