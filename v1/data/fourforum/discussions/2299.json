The security measures are just another attempt by our government to balm the public while pursuing policy that puts them in even greater danger. What's the ultimate plan, each person who travels will have his/her own federal bodyguards? Only WASPs need apply, of course.\n\n The current policy is to check EVERYONE very carefully at the airport (as if the little old white lady is as likely to drive the plane into a building as an Muslim-looking man who is part of a group of other Muslim men) instead of devoting a greater proportion of resources to checking more carefully the tiny percentage of people who are Muslim looking, and you are calling MY proposal \"extremely expensive\"?! \n \n I was not arguing that we heavily advertise what we are doing; for all I care we could switch to profiling but let everyone think the policy is still against that. The idea that we screen people at the airport only in order to hoodwink the public and not in order to try to catch some people is simply paranoid. \n \n Preventing even one additional attack is worth a lot of expense to me, and one cheap way to address the problem is to stop wasting money on frisking grandma. And you have an excellent point about WASPS; it is really the Muslims who need protection because we all know the terrorists want to kill them. WASPS are clearly a threat to airlines as shown by their long history of hijacking planes. And even if they were not it risk, I am sure you would relish any opportunity to see them get harassed.\n \n By the way, I am a darker-complected white guy who would more than happy to get pulled aside because I fit a physical profile while the little old ladies get to go ahead without delay. Why I am willing? Because I care about the security of this country which is more than I can say for the people who are against common sense measures like profiling. We have a problem in the country at least as big as the threat of terrorism, and it is that all too many Americans are hysterical and hypersensitive about issues of race. This obsession has rendered us stupid on SO many issues. We have been conditioned, like Pavlov's dogs, to start salivating when the most minute whiff of the issue of race is detectable. It must stop.",

At some level you always have to, like the teacher who punishes the whole class for a few troublemakers, punish some innocent people in order to get to the guilty ones, and since the Muslim population in the U.S. is miniscule to the size of the rest, the welfare of the mass majority is weighty enough to justify these kinds of measures.\n \n Plus if I were Muslim, I would welcome a closer eye on me and my co-religionists if it might prevent the deaths of thousands of my fellow countrymen (not to mention to myself, family and friends). Second, Muslims are the closest to the radicals and bear greater responsibility than the rest of us for not rooting out these people from among their ranks.
