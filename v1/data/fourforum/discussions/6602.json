I can't see Ken Ham getting hired by a proper university no matter how many people think evolution is just a theory.\n\n \n The problem here is likely to be more insidious. It is already clear that morality screening is going on with regard to appointments to high level scientific advisor positions in the US. There will be nothing too overt as you can imagine how much damage will be done to business confidence if it becomes apparent a clearly anti-scientific method President is in the White House.\n \n Like his stance on abortion/gay marriage his statements on intelligent design and evolution are mainly attempts too appeal to the people who support his party and will lack much real substance.",
