   "**\n You have to wonder how much they took from the darwinist playbook.\n \n \"Article: In U.S., science distorted for political and corporate agen Topic List < Prev Topic | Next Topic < \n \n Reply | Forward < Prev Message | Next Message < \n \n \n NASA\n In U.S., science is distorted to promote political and corporate agendas\n Friday, September 07, 2007 by: Mike Adams\n \n In the United States today, science is no longer a pure study. The science \n primarily publicized today is science that supports the interest of \n business. You see this in many areas, but most notably in medical and \n environmental science. Let's start with the environment, because the \n censorship of environmental science has been blatant and extreme.\n \n Under the Bush Administration, government-employed scientists are routinely \n told they cannot report results indicating the progression of global \n warming. The United States is the last among industrialized nations to \n claim that carbon dioxide emissions produced by human civilization have no \n impact whatsoever on the world climate. This is an utterly ridiculous \n position, and yet one that U.S. policymakers insist upon. These \n policymakers go out of their way to censor scientists whose data and \n conclusions might run counter to the desired belief.\n \n The United States is the only advanced nation that refuses to ratify the \n Kyoto treaty, and, to support its justification, the U.S. government has \n for a long time insisted there's no such thing as global warming. To make \n that claim, it must distort science. The science clearly shows that human \n civilization is having a marked and destructive impact on the global ecosystem.\n \n Medicine is another field where so-called science stops resembling science. \n Instead, it becomes propaganda designed to sell drugs. The clinical trials \n used by the Food and Drug Administration to make drug approval decisions \n are conducted almost entirely by the drug companies themselves. These \n companies go out of their way to hire scientists willing to design and run \n these studies to produces precisely the result that the drug companies \n want. This is easy to accomplish; any researcher refusing to play along \n with this fraudulent science game is not offered additional work. In the \n worst cases, they are terminated and blackballed from the industry.\n \n This manipulation of drug trials is routine today. Drug companies are able \n to support almost any conclusion, no matter how ridiculous or preposterous, \n by pumping enough money into the studies. They can then picking the studies \n they want to forward to the FDA and make sure that on-the-take researchers \n are involved at every stage of the game. The FDA then bases its drug \n approvals on these junk science manipulations.\n \n Junk science and the discrediting of alternative medicine\n While distorted science is used to promote synthetic chemicals that are \n extremely dangerous and almost universally ineffective, the same sort of \n distortion is used to attack anything that could compete with high-profit \n pharmaceuticals. Bad science is used to attack vitamins, nutrients, and all \n natural therapies that powerful corporations can't patent to make real money.\n \n Vitamin E was routinely discredited in the mainstream media, for example, \n using remarkably bad science. Researchers tested synthetic, low-dose \n versions of vitamin E on populations with high risks of heart attack or \n stroke. When deaths occurred within the sample population group, the \n headlines read, \"Vitamin E causes Heart Attack!\" It's a preposterous \n conclusion; but this is how deeply distorted science has become today in \n its quest to promote the interests of corporations. (In truth, researchers \n weren't even using vitamin E, they were using a synthetic chemical with a \n molecular structure that isn't the same as vitamin E from plants.)\n \n Residents of the United States like to think they live in a nation based on \n solid science. Although there is plenty of rigorous science taking place \n within the United States, much of the most important science produced today \n is based entirely on creating the illusion that something sold by a \n corporation is good, or that new regulations that require businesses to \n conduct themselves with environmental responsibility are not necessary. \n It's interesting that science always seems to reflect the interests of \n corporations here in the United States, and rarely the interests of the \n People, the planet or the future of human civilization.\n \n Consider NASA\n How good is science in the United States? Let's take a look at one of the \n most prestigious scientific organizations, the National Aeronautics Space \n Administration, better known as NASA. NASA's science is so bad that the \n organization spent $300 million to launch -- and crash -- a satellite into \n planet Mars. One of the scientists failed to convert the metric system to \n the English system, and as a result, some of the navigation computations \n were off and $300 million went up in a cloud of red Martian dust.\n \n Last year, NASA deleted the phrase, \"to understand and protect our home \n planet\" from the NASA mission statement. Apparently, protecting Earth is \n not high on the priorities list for an agency that has become the Science \n Mythology Department of the United States government. Ever since Bush \n appointed NASA administrator Michael Griffin to the head post in 2005, \n NASA's scientific reputation has nosedived into the ground faster than a \n poorly programmed Mars orbiter. The question on everybody's mind is, \n simply: What the heck happened to NASA? And why is the agency's top \n bureaucrat now officially denying that global warming is a problem?\n \n It's true: In a recorded interview that aired on National Public Radio a \n few weeks ago, NASA head Michael Griffin actually said, on the air, that it \n was arrogant and unfair to believe that global warming was a problem that \n needed solving. This left all the other NASA scientists gasping for air and \n e-mail blasting their resumes out to private-sector institutions that still \n remember what \"scientific thinking\" really means.\n \n NASA is also the organization that launched the twin robot rovers to Mars, \n also at a cost of several hundred million dollars. Before the launch, NASA \n didn't bother to test the robots to see if they could take pictures without \n overloading their memory and constantly rebooting. NASA scientists \n apparently decided they would only start debugging the software that \n controls the Mars Rover after the robot was on the surface of Mars. It was \n a laughable mistake. By some miracle, NASA scientists were able to make the \n rovers work, but only at great expense and while running the risk of total \n mission failure.\n \n NASA was a great organization back in the 1960s and pulled off some amazing \n feats, but today it's a joke; a bloated bureaucratic agency whose only \n skill seems to be burning up taxpayer dollars in the high atmospheres of \n various planets. I'm not saying rocket science is easy, but at least NASA \n could bother to test its equipment before rocketing it off to distant planets.\n \n The (fake) search for a cure\n When it comes to cancer, the \"search for the cure\" is also a sad joke. \n We've had tens of thousands of people working on a cure for cancer for \n decades. The \"search for the cure\" industry is absolutely huge, and yet \n with all the scientists and all the money and all the research, we still \n have no cure from the world of medicine. Not only that, they have delivered \n no cures for Alzheimer's, diabetes, depression, fibromyalgia, chronic \n fatigue syndrome, heart disease, strokes, dementia, osteoporosis, or kidney \n disease. In fact, after decades of research and tens of billions of dollars \n in funding, conventional medicine has cured nothing!\n \n What have the scientists been doing all this time with all this money? \n Members of the public are running around in circles raising money, funding \n the \"race for the cure,\" dumping their hard-earned cash into a huge \n financial black hole of so-called research. We're standing by waiting for \n cures from a scientific community that, it turns out, isn't even interested \n in curing disease. The industry is far more interested in treating and \n managing disease, because that's where the profits are found.\n \n If the US medical research companies were interested in real science, they \n would stop trying to research the disease and start trying to research the \n causes of the disease. If you identify the causes of cancers -- which is \n quite possible without a $100 million government grant -- then you can halt \n the diseases. At least 90 percent of all cancers are directly preventable, \n for example, through simple low-cost or free solutions. There is no need \n for cancer to be an epidemic in our society today. Cancer is easy to \n prevent. Recent research shows that vitamin D supplements (or sunlight \n exposure, which produces vitamin D), slash cancer risk by an astonishing \n 77% in women (and that includes ALL cancers).\n \n There will never be a chemical cure for cancer, because cancer is not a \n disease based on germs, an infection, parasite or virus. There is no \n chemical that can cure cancer, but there are many natural remedies and \n prevention strategies that very effectively eliminate cancer. Scientists \n aren't looking for those, however. They're steeped in the world of \n synthetic chemical medicine.\n \n Where has the real science gone?\n These are just a few examples of the ways in which America's version of \n science is failing. Science today seems largely dedicated to conning people \n out of their money or conning people into believing falsehoods about health \n or the environment. Junk science has become the tool of corporate and \n government con artists, and sadly, the public isn't educated well enough \n about skeptical thinking to know the difference between real science and \n junk science. For example, few people understand the difference between \n absolute vs. relative statistics on the efficacy of drugs, and because of \n that, drug companies are able to convince people their drugs are effective \n for nearly everyone when, in reality, many drugs only work on about 5% of \n the population.\n \n Science needs to divorce itself from business interests and politics. If we \n are to engage in real science in America, it needs to be based on the quest \n for knowledge and understanding, independent of business or political \n interests. We should not predetermine what scientific outcomes we wish to \n see; we should learn to adapt and evolve as a civilization, allowing \n science to teach us important things about ourselves and our world.\n \n Because science without ethics isn't science at all... it's just propaganda \n for either profit or power.\n \n ###\n \n About the author: Mike Adams is a consumer health advocate with a mission \n to teach personal and planetary health to the public He has authored more \n than 1,500 articles and dozens of reports, guides and interviews on natural \n health topics, reaching millions of readers with information that is saving \n lives and improving personal health around the world.

Apparently killing this parasite will instantly cure all cancer. The problem being: 1. It's complete horse-pucky. 2. See #1.).

   "science goes after cancer with epigenetics....I guess doctors are fed up with Darwinism in regards to medicine......they need to be concentrating on a holistic (whole body) cure, not a cure of the tumor itself, which is nothing but a symptom of the underlying cause.\n\n \n Well when you have a phenotype which has developed cancer you cannot be faulted for treating that phenotype rather than future offspring it might produce or has produced. Granted one could do so based on Darwinistic principles, but generally the patient takes first priority. Treating the patient has to utilize applicable therapeutic modes and evolution is not one of them. As to \"holoistic\" thats a laugh when tested clinically holoistic is not worth the trouble. With cancer you treat the tumor and attempt to prevent spread. There are of course many modlaities these days which go beyond the classic surgical and chemo or radio therapy.",

   "Does curing some but not all cases qualify as curing or not?\\\n \n \n \n \n \netailed Guide: Leukemia - Children's\n What Are the Key Statistics About Childhood Leukemia?\n Leukemia is the most common cancer in children and adolescents. It accounts for about 1 out of 3 cancers in children. Overall, however, childhood leukemia is a rare disease.\n \n Of the estimated 3,800 children (ages 0-19) who will develop leukemia in 2007, about 3 out of 4 (2,790) will be diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Most of the remaining cases will be acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Chronic leukemias are rare in children.\n \n ALL is most common in early childhood, peaking between 2 and 4 years of age. Cases of AML are more spread out across the childhood years, although it is slightly more common during the first 2 years of life and during the teenage years.\n \n ALL is slightly more common among white children than among African-American and Asian-American children and is more common in boys than in girls. AML occurs equally among boys and girls of all races.\n \n The 5-year survival rate for ALL in children has greatly increased over time and is now more than 80%. This is mainly due to advances in treatment. The 5-year survival rate for children with AML has also increased over time, and is now more than 50%.\n \n The 5-year survival rate refers to the percentage of patients who live at least 5 years after their cancer is diagnosed. Many of these patients live much longer than 5 years. Of course, 5-year survival rates are based on patients first diagnosed and treated more than 5 years ago. They may no longer be accurate, as improvements in treatment are likely to result in a more favorable outlook for recently diagnosed patients.\n \n While survival statistics can be useful, it's important to keep in mind that the outlook for each patient is different, and depends on a number of factors. Many of these prognostic factors are discussed in the section,\n",
