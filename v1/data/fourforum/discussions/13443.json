   "I'm taking the advice of JPSartre12 & starting a thread to discuss some of the questions I had after reading that other thread entitled \"What caused the Civil War?\"\n \n Is it possible to learn from history?\n Is it possible to learn from one's mistakes?\n \n \"The people who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\" A very large problem is created when there is confusion about what actually occurred during a historical timeframe. However, even when the \"historical facts\" agree, there is still debate & disagreement on how to interpret the information. The ensuing disagreements & debates sometimes become an obstacle to learning.\n \n Albert Einstein wrote:\n \nThe significant problems we face can not be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them. or We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.\n\n He also said:\n \nInsanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\n\n I believe a different level of thinking is required to move past a historical event & learn from it. One way to do this might be to admit the mistakes in thinking that originally created the problems. Fr'instance, the concept of slavery & (even worse) practice of slavery resulted from faulty thinking & irrational reasoning. Science has demonstrated (through the Human Genome Project & more) there is no longer any logical underlying basis for racial or ist belief systems. The concept & practice of slavery was based on an irrational belief system which has now been disproved. \n \n Another problem when it comes to learning from history is created when historical analysis & understanding is distorted or corrupted using Presentism.\n \n\n Presentism is a mode of historical analysis in which present-day ideas and perspectives are anachronistically introduced into depictions or interpretations of the past. Some modern historians seek to avoid presentism in their work because they believe it creates a distorted understanding of their subject matter.\n \n The Oxford English Dictionary gives the first citation for presentism in its historiographic sense from 1916, and the word may have been in use in this meaning as early as the 1870s. Historian David Hackett Fischer identifies presentism as a logical fallacy also known as the \"fallacy of nunc pro tunc\". He has written that the \"classic example\" of presentism was the so-called \"Whig history\", in which certain eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British historians wrote history in a way that used the past to validate their own political beliefs. This interpretation was presentist because it did not depict the past in objective historical context, but instead viewed history only through the lens of contemporary Whig beliefs. In this kind of approach, which emphasizes the relevance of history to the present, things which do not seem relevant receive little attention, resulting in a misleading portrayal of the past. \"Whig history\" or \"whiggishness\" are often used as synonyms for presentism, particularly when the historical depiction in question is teleological or triumphalist. (Please note: can't link) \n \n \n Presentist style historical analysis, or revisionist history, very often results in using the past to validate or justify present belief systems. Attempting to resolve cognitive dissonance through denial & self-justification doesn't help when trying to learn from the past. If the goal or aim is to \"learn from history\" this way of thinking bogs us down. Is it possible to learn from one's mistakes if one doesn't admit to making any? The problems seem to multiply exponentially when a nation or country continues to do this. \n \n I thought of some of these things while reading that other thread entitled \"What caused the Civil War?\" What would be the reason or motivation to censor, whitewash or otherwise diminish the importance of slavery as a major cause or factor in these discussions? Isn't it enough to admit slavery was one of the most important, if not the most important factor? \n \n Let's face it, back then, racist belief systems were not confined to any one area of the USA. Racist belief systems were a national problem, not a regional one. Most academic scholars today do not make claims based on one region of the country being uniquely racist. It seems more likely the majority of people back then  held racist beliefs. Why do some people today seem to insist it was one region or another that was uniquely racist? I mean the double standard that looks to find historical justifications for one person or one region to be remembered as war criminals & for another person or region to be operating under purely humanist ideals just seems unreasonable to me. I think it also highlights the problems inherent to a presentist type of history that \"uses the past to validate present beliefs.\" \n \n After listening to people debate the question of \"What caused the Civil War?\" I have been left with the impression that the more important question to ask is \"What would be the reason or motivation to censor, whitewash or otherwise diminish the importance of slavery as a major cause or factor in these discussions?\" \n \n The only answers I seem to be able to come up with are cognitive dissonance, denial & self-justification. & isn't that the same level of thinking that created the problems in the first place?\n \n Is it possible to learn from history?\n Is it possible to learn from one's mistakes?",

It is the victors who get to write the history books. The further away from the actual events then the historical revisonists step in. Creating their own version of what occured. To say slavery was a major cause may or may not be true. It is through what filter you view the writings and which writings you read. The British had already abolished slavery in 1833. They even took the arrogant steps of holding drumhead courtsmartials and hanging those they caught running slaves at sea. That slavery was an abomination and evil is putting it rather mildly in my eyes. Yet we had slavery abound in this country almost from its inception. You can argue whether or not the common practice of indenturing was slavery. Yet the indentured one was not free to come and go until the terms of indenture were met. To me the problem is multiplied by the historical revisionists who muddy the water to further a political end or goal. Who can say what the majority of the population thought about slavery or even if they did. We know the abolitionists did for sure. The political figures of the day we can gain some insight if the revisionists have not totally obscured events and sayings. For the new immigrants not speaking English, I doubt that slavery was some thing they though much about. \n \n To say can we learn from our mistakes, perhaps. To some the thought that they could be wrong is sheer lunacy. Its not working because we aren't doing enough of it or its not getting enough money. It is a complex issue that raises a lot of tempers.",

To me the problem is multiplied by the historical revisionists who muddy the water to further a political end or goal. \n\n \n Sometimes after the muddy waters are stirred, a time of quiet will allow the waters to become clear again, perhaps even making it possible to become a bit closer to reflecting reality.\n \n The relatively recent appeal to celebrate a Confederate or Neo-Confederate History Month was a recent stirring of these muddy waters.\n \n \nWho can say what the majority of the population thought about slavery or even if they did. We know the abolitionists did for sure. The political figures of the day we can gain some insight if the revisionists have not totally obscured events and sayings. For the new immigrants not speaking English, I doubt that slavery was some thing they though much about.\n \n \n \nHistorical amnesia is as dangerously disorienting for a nation as for an individual. So it is with the current wave of enthusiasm for \"states' rights,\" \"interposition,\" and \"nullification\"-the claim that state legislatures or special state conventions or referendums have the legitimate power to declare federal laws null and void within their own state borders. The idea was broached most vociferously in defense of the slave South by John C. Calhoun in the 1820s and '30s, extended by the Confederate secessionists in the 1850s and '60s, then forcefully reclaimed by militant segregationists in the 1950s and '60s. ...\n States Of Anarchy | The New Republic \n\n \n In moving forward, wouldn't it be more fruitful to adapt a more reality based framework within which to view these things, an alchemy of history perhaps? As opposed to the current striving for mediocrity, or the premature cynicism & the blame game of partisan politics?\n \n Dare I dream?\n \n \nTo say can we learn from our mistakes, perhaps. To some the thought that they could be wrong is sheer lunacy. Its not working because we aren't doing enough of it or its not getting enough money. It is a complex issue that raises a lot of tempers.\n\n \n \nLet's have a Neo-Confederate History Month that draws attention to the endless commemorations of the Lost Cause that have wrought nearly as much damage as the Confederacy itself. Neo-Confederate History Month | The New Republic \n\n \n Maybe all the hullabaloo surrounding the call for celebration of Confederate or Neo-Confederate History Month could be viewed through the lenses of an alchemy of history of sorts? Maybe we should take a long, hard look at these punctured myths? Instead of nostalgically applauding the 'Lost Causes' perhaps we can move forward  & away from them? In the game of chess (& maybe in life itself ...) a move may sometimes be seen as either accidental or providential, maybe the only difference is the narrative we impose?\n \n Dare I dream?\n \n \nDaring ideas are like chessmen moving forward; they may be beaten, but they may start a winning game. \n -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832)\n",
