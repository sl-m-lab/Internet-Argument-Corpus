   "A huge debate has erupted here in Germany about how to deal with criminal youths. Currently, people from the age of up to 18 are treated as \"youths\", while the judge can chose whether or not to treat people between 18-21 as \"youths\" as well. This leads to very small punishments in comparison to treating them as \"adults\". \n \n After a case of two foreign teenagers heavily assaulting a german retiree in the subway of Munich, this debate has been started as part of the election campaign in the state of Hessia.\n \n [An URL I can only provide with more than 10 posts.....]\n \n What do you think? From which age should people be treated as \"adults\" at the courts? As conservative politicians have proposed, would interning them in training camps make sense instead?",

   "\"Perhaps they could go to a juvenile art institute where they learn the art of scupture by rendering large rocks into small ones.\"\n \n *lol* yes I like this idea. It would violate our current constitution though, so at least here this is impossible for the moment. Is there a country in the first world where this would be possible?\n \n \"I would make a distinction between violent crime and \"property\" crime.\"\n \n An interesting way. This would solve a lot of the difference between our current legal system and the opinion of the people.\n \n As the debate here is mainly focused on foreign youths, should they be treated more harshly than citizen's crime? The sentiment of the ordinary people would be that in addition to violating the law, foreigners are also abusing our hospitality after all.\n \n Today a number of additional proposals have been thrown into the public debate. An interesting one would be to change immigration: If citizenship would be granted only on probation for the first ten years and those people could be denationalized upon violating the law, immigrants might start respecting the legal system much more.",
