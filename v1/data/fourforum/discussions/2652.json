   "And you thought there weren't any atheists in foxholes, they're apparently not in prisons either, according to several studies, some dating back nearly 80 years, others very recent. \n \n http://www.skepticfiles.org/american/prison.htm\n http://www.freethought.freeservers.com/reason/crimestats.html\n http://members.shaw.ca/tfrisen/morality/stats/prisons.htm\n http://www.holysmoke.org/hs00/prison.htm\n \n How in heaven's name can this be possible? Being an atheist is synonymous with being immoral, that much I've gathered from participating in these discussion boards. At least that is the claim made often by theists, who assuredly inform me on a daily basis that no god means no morality. \n \n Are these statistics telling us the exact opposite, that being religious increases your chances of criminal behavior? Could it be that the Christian doctrine of total forgiveness for any sin or trespass, no matter how grievous or heinous, being only a prayer away is sending the wrong message to people? Are atheists the ones who \"walk the line\"?",

   "\"Saying\" that you are a Christian will certainly get you special privileges in the political arena. So maybe it's the same with their sister organization? \n \n When Jesus told Peter that he must be crucified, Peter said, &#8220;God forbid it!&#8221; Paraphrasing a little here, he told Jesus that he would pull his sword and strike anyone that attempted to take him away. Jesus knew who was doing the talking here &#8211; it was Satan. That&#8217;s why he told Satan to get away from him. (Mathew 16:23)\n \n To the point: We are influenced by Satan more especially when he uses religion &#8211; even more, the religion of so-called Christians. To break the law, then use Christianity to lessen the blow, shows just how much influence the Powers of Darkness have on our culture. Satan and his bunch love to see those stats. He sits in his hole sneering, saying, &#8220;With a God like that of those Christians, who can believe a word He says? They should be atheists or Krishnas! Maybe this will prove it.&#8221;\n \n Proof? How can there be proof that we fight not against flesh and blood, but against evil spirits and their ideas?\n \n To me that&#8217;s just another notch in Ol&#8217; Nick&#8217;s handle, billsco.",
