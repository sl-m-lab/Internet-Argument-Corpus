He united the nation in a way that we have not seen since...\n \n Matthew\n 14\n 1 term of high school\n (I feel so young and under-educated...)\n\n \n I'm no expert on the Reagan years, but I have done some research on Star Wars. It did not and will not work.\n \n They've tried just about everything. Space lasers, ground lasers, airplane lasers, missiles, and other things. There are two problems with all of those things. One, they are either theoretical (the airplane lasers aren't built as far as I know), or they didn't work. (guns in space for example) Two, such a missile defense system cannot stop a full-on nuclear attack. One missile yes, maybe even ten or twenty, but not anything on the level that the USSR would have launched if there was a nuclear exchange. \n \n The following link shows the Russian nuclear capability, which is about 60% of what the USSR had. (since Ukraine inherited about 30% of the USSR's nuclear arsenal, and there were other republics which easily account for the remaining 10%)\n http://www.bullatomsci.org/issues/2000/ja00/images/chart2.gif\n \n If you add up the number of missiles/bombs, you get just under 1200, which means that the USSR had around 2000. (1200/60*100 = 2000)\n \n Lets assume for a time that these defense systems do actually work. (not a proven fact) There might be 50 satellites, each shooting a few times in the minutes that it takes the nukes to reach their targets. Lets say each satellite is capable of shooting down ten missiles. That's 500 down, 1500 to go. Some of the nukes are dropped from planes, so lets assume they are shot down. 100 more down, 1400 to go. Then, there might be other ways to shoot down half of that - 700 left. Congratulations, you've just been hit with 3,500 nuclear warheads.",

   "I would have to say Benjamin Franklin is 'the most' important person in U.S History. As a matter of fact, I don't even think it's disputable.\n \n No other single person has contributed to so many of our modern inventions, philosophies, and historic events. I think our historians give him a lot of credit, but I think American's really take him for granted.\n \n Electricity, light bulbs, stoves, libraries, fire departments, the almanac, farming, mercantile, banks, the revolution, the militia, the minutemen, printing presses, eyeglasses, daylight savings time, writer, philospher, scholar, ambassador, husband, father, statesman, the alliance with France, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, abolitionist, lived to the age of 84! OMG, you can't imagine how important this man was....\n \n \n \n \n Leviathan\n\n \n I agree. Historians don't emphasize Franklin's contributions enough. They're too busy shouting praises for our first president, and Abraham Lincoln. Don't get me wrong, these were great men, and deserve every bit of recognition. Benjamin Franklin, though, did so much more for our country. A lot of our technology and political philosophies are based on his work and contributions.",
