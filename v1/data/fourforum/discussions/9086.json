McKINLEY Jr.\n URUAPAN, Mexico - Norte\u00f1o music was blaring at the Sol y Sombra bar on Sept. 6 when several men in military garb broke up the late night party. Waving high-powered machine guns, they screamed at the crowd to stay put and then dumped the contents of a heavy plastic bag on the dance floor.\n \n Five human heads rolled to a bloody stop.\n \n \"This is not something you see every day,\" said a bartender, who asked not to be named for fear of losing his own head. \"Very ugly.\"\n \n An underworld war between drug gangs is raging in Mexico, medieval in its barbarity, its foot soldiers operating with little fear of interference from the police, its scope and brutality unprecedented, even in a country accustomed to high levels of drug violence. \n \n In recent months the violence has included a total of two dozen beheadings, a raid on a local police station by men with grenades and a bazooka, and daytime kidnappings of top law enforcement officials. At least 123 law enforcement officials, among them 2 judges and 3 prosecutors, have been gunned down or tortured to death. Five police officers were among those beheaded.\n \n In all, the violence has claimed more than 1,700 civilian lives this year, and federal officials say the killings are on course to top the estimated 1,800 underworld killings last year. Those death tolls compare with 1,304 in 2004 and 1,080 in 2001, these officials say. \n \n Mexico's law enforcement officials maintain that the violence is a sign that they have made progress dismantling the major organized crime families in the country. The arrests of several drug cartel leaders and their top lieutenants have set off a violent struggle among second-rank mobsters for trade routes, federal prosecutors say. The old order has been fractured, and the remaining drug dealers are killing one another or making new alliances.\n \n \"These alliances are happening because none of the organizations can control, on its own, the territory it used to control, and that speaks to the crisis that they are in,\" said Jos\u00e9 Luis Santiago Vasconcelos, the top federal prosecutor for organized crime.\n \n Attorney General Daniel Cabeza de Vaca said a steadily rising tide of drug addiction within Mexico had spurred some of the murders, as dealers fought for local markets. At the same time, more and more honest police officers are trying to enforce the law rather than turn a blind eye to drug traffickers, often paying with their lives, prosecutors say.\n \n But those assessments, other authorities say, are overly rosy and may explain only part of the picture. Some experts say the Mexican police forces, weakened by corruption and cowed by assassinations, are simply not up to the task of countering the underworld feuds unleashed by the arrests of cartel leaders over the last six years. \n \n Many of the dead made their living in the drug trade and perished in a larger struggle for territory between a federation of cartels based in Sinaloa, on the Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf Cartel from the northeastern state of Tamaulipas, federal prosecutors say.\n \n The five men beheaded in Uruapan, in Michoac\u00e1n, were street-level methamphetamine dealers, addicted themselves to the synthetic drug. They were linked loosely to the Valencia family, which once controlled most of the drug trade in the state and is a part of the Sinaloa group, the police say. The killers came from a gang called The Family, believed to be allied with the Gulf Cartel. \n \n A day before, the killers had kidnapped the five men from a mechanic's shop they had been using as a front for selling \"ice,\" as crystal methamphetamine is called on the street. They sawed their victims' heads off with a bowie knife while they were still alive shortly before going to the bar, law enforcement officials said. \n \n \"You don't do something like that unless you want to send a big message,\" said one United States law enforcement official here, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n \n The beheadings, in fact, have become a signature form of intimidation aimed at both criminal rivals and federal and local authorities. In the tourist town of Acapulco, killers from one drug gang decapitated the commander of a special strike force, Mario N\u00fa\u00f1ez Maga\u00f1a, in April, along with one of his agents, Jes\u00fas Alberto Ibarra Vel\u00e1zquez. \n \n They jammed the heads in a fence in front of the municipal police station. \"So you will learn to respect,\" said a red note next to them. . . .",

   "http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO404E.html\n \n Bush appoints a Terrorist as US Ambassador to Iraq\n by Michel Chossudovsky\n The Bush administration has appointed the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations John D. Negroponte to take on the the position of US ambassador to Iraq. Negroponte is slated to take on the position, when the coalition authority, headed by L. Paul Bremer, formally relinquishes control on June 30th.\n \n Viewed as a \"seasoned career\" diplomat, the nomination of Negroponte is presented by the US media as \"a bridge to the international community\".\n \n He is expected to \"smooth the way for a U.N. resolution that would boost the new Iraqi government's legitimacy. The U.N. already is helping to lay the groundwork for the election expected in January, 2005, and is likely to oversee it.\" (Business Week, April 26, 2004)\n \n His mandate, however, is not assume the usual diplomatic functions of an Ambassador in a foreign country.\n \n What is envisaged is not an \"embassy\" but a full-fledged occupation government, whose primary mandate will be to impose US military rule and curb the resistance movement.\n \n In the absence of a real Iraqi government, to whom will he present his credentials as ambassador?\n \n Negroponte's \"embassy\" in Baghdad will, according to press reports, constitute the largest US \"embassy staff\" in the world with some 3000 employees, including up to 1,000 Americans.\n \n In Washington, there is discussion as to whether the \"embassy\" should be under the jurisdiction of the State Department (which normally oversees US diplomatic missions in foreign countries) or the Pentagon. In practice, the embassy staff, including CIA and military attach\u00e9s will be in permanent liaison with the Pentagon, the US military high command in Iraq and the CIA\n \n Who is John Negroponte\n What is the background of John D. Negroponte and why is he being sent to Iraq?\n \n John Negroponte served as US ambassador to Honduras from 1981 to 1985. As Ambassador in Tegucigalpa, he played a key role in supporting and supervising the Nicaraguan Contra mercenaries who were based in Honduras. The cross border Contra attacks into Nicaragua claimed some 50 000 civilian lives.\n \n During the same period, Negroponte was instrumental in setting up the Honduran military death squads, \"operating with Washington support's, [they] assassinated hundreds of opponents of the US-backed regime.\" (See Bush Nominee linked to Latin American Terrorism, by Bill Vann, http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/VAN111A.html ) . . . .",

   "Interesting to note that after Negroponte went to Iraq, the terroristic attacks started. Guess he was giving the various Iraqi groups little seminars on terrorism. He must have picked up the beheading strategy from them.",
