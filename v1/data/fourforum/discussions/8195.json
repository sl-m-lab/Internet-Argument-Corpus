   "Due to some links in diplomatic sources I am well aware of serious tensions between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus. Some hawkish Turkish politics are in no way going to give up their territorial claims to Cyprus despite some international agreements even. \n Now fancy that Turkey with that Cyprus burden in EU. Some experts are highly suspicious that Turkey with her disgusting terror record (Grey Wolves and Ali Agca attack on Pope John Pal II in 1981 and killing of the promising Cypriot journalist Kutlu Adali in 1996 and arson fires of Grey Wolves in Greece' islands and Armenian genocide previously). There were times people were talking of fascism in Turkey! BTW death of the Grey Wolve's leader Catli in 1996 in a car accident brought to light the relations between Turkish terror mafia strongmen and the govt. \n I strongly doubt it's OK with Turkish govt now. I mean its tools to achieve goals. Discords over Cyprus could lead to terror wars in European space to be further widened to full-scale European war.",

   "From the sounds of it you are right. The message at the moment seems to be that Turkey will be getting a special relation type of deal rather than a full membership. The reason of this is of course among the reasons you stated.\n \n I guess it's similar to the situation with Israel who wants to be counted a part of Europe yet it doesn't really work out in the current political climate.",
