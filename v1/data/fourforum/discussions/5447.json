   "The problem with being 100% anti-abortion is that it is an extreme position. Everyone has to draw the line somewhere, though not necessarily in the same place.\n \n Some will say that life begins at conception and aborting that life is wrong 100% of the time. This is an extreme postion.\n \n Others will say life begins at birth and abortion should be allowed right up to the second before (or perhaps up to 18 years of age). This is also an exteme position.\n \n To work out where your line is, you should consider all sorts of scenarios.\n \n Consider whether you would allow the abortion of a child if it is the result of a rape. Some who say they believe abortion is wrong, would still allow it in this case, but the child/fetus in this case is as 'innocent' as any other, so why make an exception in this case? It's not that easy to answer anymore. But some, when considering this scenario, will move their line a little.\n \n What if the life of the mother is threatened? Yet again, the child is just as 'innocent' as any other, but some who say they are 100% anti-abortion might move their line here too. It's possible that the death of the mother might compromise the fetus still in the womb. This would make the decision a little easier, one death or two. But what if you have a 60% chance of saving the fetus? What about only a 40% chance? You might argue that the death of the mother would make the child's life less worth living, having only one parent.\n \n But that brings up a whole host of new questions.\n \n What if the child is going to be handicapped? Who can judge the quality of life of a handicapped person? How handicapped does the child have to be before we can say they have no quality of life? Blind? Blind and deaf? Blind, deaf and dumb? Mentally handicapped? Blind, deaf, dumb, and mentally handicapped? Female? What degree or type of mental handicap?\n \n Also, if we insist on a baby being born even though the mother is going to die, then single parent families must be fine and there should be no problem with singles adopting children. And if a child can cope without a mother, then gay men adopting babies must be dandy too.\n \n Then we get onto the religious side of things (widening the topic a little here). If two people, one religious and the other atheist, happen to have exactly the same view on abortion, is the view of the religious person worth more because they have the backing of the supreme being? What if we have two equally religious people with differing views, possibly both believing they have the backing of the same supreme being? Is the atheist's view worthless, as he has no supreme being to back him?\n \n Dragonfly, welcome to the forum, and I hope you find lots of interesting stuff here. I don't believe you are 100% anti-abortion (I don't believe anyone is), but your line may well be near that end of the spectrum. Keep an open mind and don't stick to your point of view without at least considering others.\n \n Smiley",

   "Another touch of raw reality for fetus worshippers:\n \nStreet children throughout the world are subjected to physical abuse by police or have been murdered outright, as governments treat them as a blight to be eradicated-rather than as children to be nurtured and protected. They are frequently detained arbitrarily by police simply because they are homeless, or criminally charged with vague offenses such as loitering, vagrancy, or petty theft. They are tortured or beaten by police and often held for long periods in poor conditions. Girls are sometimes sexually abused, coerced into sexual acts, or raped by police. Street children also make up a large proportion of the children who enter criminal justice systems and are committed finally to correctional institutions (prisons) that are euphemistically called schools, often without due process. Few advocates speak up for these children, and few street children have family members or concerned individuals willing and able to intervene on their behalf.\n \n The term street children refers to children for whom the street more than their family has become their real home. It includes children who might not necessarily be homeless or without families, but who live in situations where there is no protection, supervision, or direction from responsible adults.\n \n While street children receive national and international public attention, that attention has been focused largely on the social, economic and health problems of the children -- poverty, lack of education, AIDS, prostitution, and substance abuse. With the exception of the massive killings of street children in Brazil and Colombia, often by police, which Human Rights Watch reported in 1994, very little attention has been paid to the constant police violence and abuse from which many children suffer. This often neglected side of street children's lives has been a focus of Human Rights Watch's research and action.\n \n The public view of street children in many countries is overwhelmingly negative. The public has often supported efforts to get these children off the street, even though they may result in police round ups, or even murder. There is an alarming tendency by some law enforcement personnel and civilians, business proprietors and their private security firms, to view street children as almost sub-human.\n \n In several countries where we have worked, notably Brazil, Bulgaria, and Sudan, the racial, ethnic, or religious identification of street children plays a significant role in their treatment. The disturbing notion of \"social-cleansing\" is applied to street children even when they are not distinguished as members of a particular racial, ethnic, or religious group. Branded as \"anti-social,\" or demonstrating \"anti-social behavior,\" street children are viewed with suspicion and fear by many who would simply like to see street children disappear.\n\n Human Rights Watch: Street Children\n \n Abandoned children of this sort occur in religiously extreme nations where women are not valued and where women are forbidden access to birth control and abortion.\n \n But the fetus worshippers care not for these abandoned children. They care only about what is in the womb. Once a child exists outside the womb none of these fetus-worshipping fools have an iota of concern for them.",

You make such sweeping generalizations when it has bee proven that conservatives are much more generous than liberals in contributing to all of the needs you assume we ignore. The fact is simone, that if you were really informed in the things you think you know to be true, and are really sincere in your concerns as you claim to be, you would be a true conservative.\n \n You claim to value life, yet you endorse the genocide of 1.4 million unborn babies per year. While at the same time you call we who value the unborn fetus worshipers; and you call conservatives bigots? And at the same time you resist the Death Penalty which legally executes capital murderers. Your world view is upside down and about as consistent as Hitlers, who claimed claimed to care about the German people as he committed genocide on the disabled, the Gypsies, Homosexuals and the largest victim class, the Jews. All the while rewarding those who carried out these atrocities. Sound familiar? Because that is exactly what you represent as you demonize people like me who have a consistent world view which only seeks to hold the guilty responsible for their actions and protect the innocent. \n \n Here is the evidence that conservatives outgive liberals by an average of 30%.\n \u0095 Although liberal families' incomes average 6 percent higher than those of conservative families, conservative-headed households give, on average, 30 percent more to charity than the average liberal-headed household ($1,600 per year vs. $1,227).\n \n \u0095 Conservatives also donate more time and give more blood.\n \n \u0095 Residents of the states that voted for John Kerry in 2004 gave smaller percentages of their incomes to charity than did residents of states that voted for George Bush.\n \n \u0095 Bush carried 24 of the 25 states where charitable giving was above average.\n \n \u0095 In the 10 reddest states, in which Bush got more than 60 percent majorities, the average percentage of personal income donated to charity was 3.5. Residents of the bluest states, which gave Bush less than 40 percent, donated just 1.9 percent.\n \n \u0095 People who reject the idea that \"government has a responsibility to reduce income inequality\" give an average of four times more than people who accept that proposition.\n \n Brooks demonstrates a correlation between charitable behavior and \"the values that lie beneath\" liberal and conservative labels. Two influences on charitable behavior are religion and attitudes about the proper role of government.\n \n The single biggest predictor of someone's altruism, Willett says, is religion. It increasingly correlates with conservative political affiliations because, as Brooks's book says, \"the percentage of self-described Democrats who say they have 'no religion' has more than quadrupled since the early 1970s.\" America is largely divided between religious givers and secular nongivers, and the former are disproportionately conservative. One demonstration that religion is a strong determinant of charitable behavior is that the least charitable cohort is a relatively small one -- secular conservatives.\n \n Reviewing Brooks's book in the Texas Review of Law & Politics, Justice Willett notes that Austin -- it voted 56 percent for Kerry while he was getting just 38 percent statewide -- is ranked by the Chronicle of Philanthropy as 48th out of America's 50 largest cities in per capita charitable giving. Brooks's data about disparities between liberals' and conservatives' charitable giving fit these facts: Democrats represent a majority of the wealthiest congressional districts, and half of America's richest households live in states where both senators are Democrats.\n \n While conservatives tend to regard giving as a personal rather than governmental responsibility, some liberals consider private charity a retrograde phenomenon -- a poor palliative for an inadequate welfare state and a distraction from achieving adequacy by force, by increasing taxes.

The fact is simone, that if you were really informed in the things you think you know to be true, and are really sincere in your concerns as you claim to be, you would be a true conservative.\n \n You claim to value life, yet you endorse the genocide of 1.4 million unborn babies per year. While at the same time you call we who value the unborn fetus worshipers; and you call conservatives bigots? And at the same time you resist the Death Penalty which legally executes capital murderers. Your world view is upside down and about as consistent as Hitlers, who claimed claimed to care about the German people as he committed genocide on the disabled, the Gypsies, Homosexuals and the largest victim class, the Jews. All the while rewarding those who carried out these atrocities. Sound familiar? Because that is exactly what you represent as you demonize people like me who have a consistent world view which only seeks to hold the guilty responsible for their actions and protect the innocent. \n \n Here is the evidence that conservatives outgive liberals by an average of 30%.\n \u0095 Although liberal families' incomes average 6 percent higher than those of conservative families, conservative-headed households give, on average, 30 percent more to charity than the average liberal-headed household ($1,600 per year vs. $1,227).\n \n \u0095 Conservatives also donate more time and give more blood.\n \n \u0095 Residents of the states that voted for John Kerry in 2004 gave smaller percentages of their incomes to charity than did residents of states that voted for George Bush.\n \n \u0095 Bush carried 24 of the 25 states where charitable giving was above average.\n \n \u0095 In the 10 reddest states, in which Bush got more than 60 percent majorities, the average percentage of personal income donated to charity was 3.5. Residents of the bluest states, which gave Bush less than 40 percent, donated just 1.9 percent.\n \n \u0095 People who reject the idea that \"government has a responsibility to reduce income inequality\" give an average of four times more than people who accept that proposition.\n \n Brooks demonstrates a correlation between charitable behavior and \"the values that lie beneath\" liberal and conservative labels. Two influences on charitable behavior are religion and attitudes about the proper role of government.\n \n The single biggest predictor of someone's altruism, Willett says, is religion. It increasingly correlates with conservative political affiliations because, as Brooks's book says, \"the percentage of self-described Democrats who say they have 'no religion' has more than quadrupled since the early 1970s.\" America is largely divided between religious givers and secular nongivers, and the former are disproportionately conservative. One demonstration that religion is a strong determinant of charitable behavior is that the least charitable cohort is a relatively small one -- secular conservatives.\n \n Reviewing Brooks's book in the Texas Review of Law & Politics, Justice Willett notes that Austin -- it voted 56 percent for Kerry while he was getting just 38 percent statewide -- is ranked by the Chronicle of Philanthropy as 48th out of America's 50 largest cities in per capita charitable giving. Brooks's data about disparities between liberals' and conservatives' charitable giving fit these facts: Democrats represent a majority of the wealthiest congressional districts, and half of America's richest households live in states where both senators are Democrats.\n \n While conservatives tend to regard giving as a personal rather than governmental responsibility, some liberals consider private charity a retrograde phenomenon -- a poor palliative for an inadequate welfare state and a distraction from achieving adequacy by force, by increasing taxes. Ralph Nader, running for president in 2000, said: \"A society that has more justice is a society that needs less charity.\" Brooks, however, warns: \"If support for a policy that does not exist . . . substitutes for private charity, the needy are left worse off than before. It is one of the bitterest ironies of liberal politics today that political opinions are apparently taking the place of help for others.\"\n \n In 2000, brows were furrowed in perplexity because Vice President Al Gore's charitable contributions, as a percentage of his income, were below the national average: He gave 0.2 percent of his family income, one-seventh of the average for donating households.

But one would think they were better informed about the basic teachings of Christ.\n\n \n This is what makes you a despicable hypocrite simone. You have the nerve to make assumptions about conservatives as you ignore the evidence that it's the liberals who don't give. The evangelical and conservative churches not only benefit the poor in America but in every third world country on the planet. Even countries which persecute and kill christians. Here's a break down of the almost 300 BILLION Americans donated in 2006:\n \"What people find especially interesting about this, and it's true year after year, that such a high percentage comes from individual donors,\" Giving USA Chairman Richard Jolly said.\n \n Individuals gave a combined 75.6% of the total. With bequests, that rises to 83.4%.\n \n The biggest chunk of the donations, $96.82 billion or 32.8%, went to religious organizations. \n \n This figure represent mostly conservatives donating to churches which use that money to serve the poor and indigent throughout the world and to support missionaries who live their and serve the people.\n \n The second largest slice, $40.98 billion or 13.9%, went to education, including gifts to colleges, universities and libraries.\n \n This figure represent mostly liberal giving which supports elitist institutions but does little to serve the needs of the poor.\n \n About 65% of households with incomes less than $100,000 give to charity, the report showed.\n This figure tells us that the majority of givers are middle class and support these charitable causes freely and with the intent of helping the less fortunate. But based on the link above, which you ignored, we know that conservatives are responsible for giving 30% more than liberals, and THAT MEANS THAT CONSERVATIVES GAVE 90 BILLION MORE THAN LIBERALS FREELY AND WILLINGLY. I agree that the government should tax liberals in order to get them to pay their fair share to the needy, but conservatives are already giving. And I resent your self righteous drivel that implies that it is christians like me who are saying \"let them eat bread,\" when it is you hypocritical liberals who don't have a charitable bone in your bodies in comparison.\n \n Americans give record $295B to charity - USATODAY.com",

But our argument is a moral and ethical one. It is undeniable that you and I and every other person on this forum were once exactly like the 1.3 million unborn children who will be denied life over the next 12 months. That's over 4000 babies a day who will never see life. And I'm only talking about America, not the rest of the world.\n \n It is also undeniable that at the very most, only 5% of those abortions are due to incest, rape, a seriously deformed baby, or due to the health of the mother. The vast majority of abortions that are procured in this country are used as a form of birth control for irresponsible women. That is not why abortions were originally legalized.\n \n Also, do you know that if you get your own wife pregnant,(if you're married) as her husband, and the legal father of the child, if she decides that she wants to abort it, and you don't; you have absolutely no say in the matter? Even if you relieve her of all financial responsibility, or to raise it at all, it's her call and you have been relegated to the position of a sperm donor with no rights to protect your own unborn child from being denied life. Is that right in your opinion?\n \n See above how sinjin makes this distinction regarding Lacy Petersons baby? Lacy Peterson was 8 months along. Yet, we have had many debates here where these pro-death advocates have argued in favor of late term abortions. Even President elect Obama voted for the live baby bill which allows abortionists who delivered aborted babies that were strong enough to actually survive the procedure, to place it in a fridge until it died. Now that's the humane concern for the innocent of these leftist hypocrites who claim to care about people. \n \n But who speaks for these children NATO? Surely not them! And here's more on convicting people who cause the death of the unborn. You will see that laws vary from state to state but the unborn seem to have some rights everywhere, unless it's the MOTHER who decides to kill it. Talk about a license to murder, huh? \n Prosecutors Across the Country File Charges in Unborn Babies\n \n I ask you, how is that consistent at all? If the fetus has no human rights prior to birth for the sake of abortions, then how can they attempt to convict a person for killing them, and accidently no less, as no malice existed in some of these cases.? Yet they do. \n Prosecutors Across the Country File Charges in Unborn Babies' Deaths\n \n By Liz Townsend\n \n Acknowledging that unborn babies are separate victims of crime, prosecutors across the country are charging the babies' killers with homicide and manslaughter - - as long as the deaths were not caused by abortion.\n \n While some of these cases have resulted in convictions and long prison terms, courts in many states continue to treat an unborn baby's death as only an additional injury to the mother.\n \n Twenty-four states have laws that recognize babies as crime victims during all or part of their pre-natal development. These laws deal only with unborn children injured by criminal assailants and do not affect legal abortions. [A factsheet on these state laws is available at www.nrlc.org/Whatsnew/sthomicidelaws.htm.]\n \n A bill pending in Congress, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, would recognize unborn children as victims under federal criminal laws, but most acts of violence are governed by state laws. [For more information, see National Right to Life Unborn_Victims/keypointsuvva.html.]\n \n In Mississippi, the killer of an \"unborn quick child\" can be charged with manslaughter. Eric Laquinne Brown of Pontotoc, Mississippi, received a life sentence November 29 for the murder of Shorlonda Moore and a concurrent 20-year sentence for manslaughter in the death of her unborn baby.\n \n Brown pled guilty to strangling his pregnant ex-girlfriend on January 22, 1999, leaving the bodies of Moore and her unborn child in a burned-out car in Memphis, Tennessee, the Associated Press (AP) reported. Brown killed Moore \"primarily because she was pregnant and was causing him problems, demanding child support,\" Assistant District Attorney Clay Joyner told the AP.\n \n An unborn baby was one of three people killed in a 1998 fire that destroyed an apartment building in El Reno, Oklahoma. Ryan Owen McCarty, 18, received three concurrent life sentences November 30 for the first-degree murders of Johnny Joe LeBleu, 24; Felicia Chisholm, 16; and Chisholm's unborn baby, the Oklahoman reported. Oklahoma law allows a homicide prosecution only if the child is \"viable\"; the killing of an \"unborn quick child\" can be considered manslaughter.\n \n McCarty was convicted November 8 of all three murders. Felicia Chisholm's family had asked Canadian County District Judge Edward Cunningham for the sentences to run consecutively. They expressed disappointment when the concurrent sentences were announced, since McCarty may be eligible for parole in his lifetime. \"I guess this is our life sentence, reliving that day over and over again,\" Chisholm's mother Cindy told the Oklahoman.\n \n Prosecutors in states that rely on case and common law instead of a statute in cases involving unborn victims of violence have a much more difficult time obtaining a conviction. Olivia Taylor Garcia, an eight-month-old unborn baby, died October 10, 1998, after she was delivered in an emergency Caesarean section when a drunk driver collided with her family's car in Ontario, California. Her mother Raylene survived with a broken pelvis, broken ribs, and punctured lung, but Olivia spent four hours on a respirator at Loma Linda University Medical Center fighting for life until she died in her father's arms, the Daily Bulletin reported.\n \n However, Antonio Ortiz, the drunk driver who caused her death, was acquitted of manslaughter November 24 when a judge determined Olivia was not a \"viable human being.\" California law allows homicide charges to be brought against the alleged killer of an unborn baby after the embryonic stage, from about the eighth week after conception. If the defendant is charged with manslaughter, the baby must meet the \"legal definition of life\" outside the womb, according to the AP.\n \n In Olivia's case, prosecutors did not believe they could meet the \"very high standard\" of proof that Ortiz knew the risks of driving drunk that would be required in a homicide case, prosecutor Kent D. Williams told the AP, and instead charged Ortiz with manslaughter.\n \n \"The manslaughter law is very unfortunate in that it makes an arbitrary distinction,\" Williams told the Daily Bulletin. \"It's a distinction without a difference. It shouldn't make a difference whether a baby is killed inside or outside the womb.\"\n \n West Valley Superior Court Judge Mary Fuller ruled that Olivia was \"clinically dead\" after she was delivered, with only a \"weak heartbeat and ineffectual attempts to breathe,\" according to the Daily Bulletin. Fuller decided there was no evidence that Olivia's brain stem was functioning, which is a requirement to prove a person is alive.\n \n \"I don't care what the judge said,\" Olivia's mother Raylene Garcia told the AP. \"To my husband and I, she was alive. We held her. We watched her die.\"\n \n NRLC Associate Western Director Jan Carroll told NRL News that pro-life legislators in California have tried several times to pass a law allowing prosecutions for the manslaughter of unborn babies, but have not been successful. The Garcia case has revived interest in changing the law, Carroll said.\n \n \"Maybe something good can come out of this,\" Raylene Garcia told the Daily Bulletin. \"Maybe a law can be passed. Maybe that's what Olivia died for.\"\n \n The tragic deaths of a 14-year-old girl and her 7-month-old unborn baby in Boston have focused attention on how Massachusetts law views unborn victims of violence. Based on a 1984 Supreme Judicial Court ruling, the state's homicide law applies to the death of a \"viable fetus,\" according to the AP. The court did not define what \"viable\" means, leading to continuing court battles over the interpretation of the law.\n \n Two men, including the baby's father, were charged with double murder November 4 for stabbing 14-year-old Chauntae Jones in the stomach, killing her and her unborn baby. Kyle Bryant, 19, the baby's father, and Lord Hampton, 20, allegedly lured Jones to an abandoned hospital in Mattapan, beat and stabbed her, and buried her in a pre-dug grave, according to the Boston Globe.\n \n Pro-abortionists immediately criticized prosecutors, saying that treating the unborn baby as a separate victim could be used to erode the \"right\" to abortion. \"The assault or violence that harms a pregnancy is an attack on a woman,\" Melissa Kogut, executive director of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Abortion Rights Action League, told the AP. \"The focus ought to be on the violence that harms a woman.\"\n \n State pro-lifers insisted that both victims, mother and child, should be persons in the eyes of the law. \"This is a baby,\" said Maryclare Flynn, executive director of Massachusetts Citizens for Life. \"This family lost two people, and a defendant, or defendants, must pay for these two lives.\"\n \n On the same day Bryant and Hampton were charged in the deaths of Jones and her baby, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court heard the appeal of another case involving the death of a seven-month-old unborn baby and her mother, the AP reported.\n \n Michael Crawford was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the 1989 deaths. At the trial, the judge \"instructed the jury to consider the fetus viable if it was potentially able to live outside the mother's womb,\" according to the AP.\n \n Crawford's attorney, Matthew Robinowitz, argued to the Supreme Judicial Court that this definition was too broad and that, with the lack of a clear definition of viability, his client did not know the unborn baby was a legal person and should not be held responsible for the baby's death, the AP reported.",

Check out foster children and adopted children by category, with bios of their histories and what they have accomplished in life. And consider that had they been aborted they wouldn't have been able to contribute to life as they have. Adoptees and Fosterees -\n \n And before you give up on people with bad starts in life, check out Dave Thomas's life story. Dave Thomas Biography - Biography.com\n Thomas, Dave (1932-2002)\n Biography\n Founder of Wendy's International restaurant chain; television spokesman. Born Rex David Thomas, July 2, 1932, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Thomas never knew his birth mother, and was adopted by a couple from Kalamazoo, Michigan, at the age of six months. Thomas's adoptive mother died when he was only five, and by the age of 10 Thomas had lost two stepmothers as well. He spent summers in Maine with his adoptive grandmother, Minnie Thomas, who was his closest relative and a big influence in his life.\n \n When Thomas was still a pre-teen, his family (his father, Rex, had remarried again) moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he worked at such jobs as a paperboy, golf caddy, and at a soda fountain counter in a drugstore. At 15, Thomas got his first job at a restaurant, and when his family decided to leave Fort Wayne to move again, he refused to leave, dropping out of school in the 10th grade and going to work full time.\n \n Thomas served in the Army during the Korean War as the manager of an enlisted-men's club. Upon returning to Fort Wayne, Thomas found his former boss at the Hobby House restaurant, Phil Clauss, owned some of the first franchises of the budding Kentucky Fried Chicken chain. Clauss offered Thomas the opportunity to move to Columbus, Ohio, to turn around the restaurants, which were failing. Colonel Sanders's signature chicken had been a big hit for the Hobby House and Thomas thought he could sell it in Ohio. By 1968, a few short years later, a 35-year-old Thomas sold the franchises back to the headquarters for $1.5 million.\n \n After complaining that he couldn't find a good hamburger in Columbus, Thomas decided to open his own restaurant. On November 15, 1969, he opened the first Wendy's restaurant, named for his eight-year-old daughter, Melinda Lou, known as Wendy. She was the youngest of his five children with his wife Lorraine, whom he married in 1956. Known for its square hamburgers and choice of toppings, Wendy's quickly caught on and within less than a decade grew into a franchise of 1,000 stores.\n I ask you NATO, would the country have been better off had Dave been aborted? Do you realize that the persons who may have held the key to curing the great diseases of out time or discovered inter-dimensional jumping may have been aborted last year, or last decade, or yesterday? What hubris man has to believe we are qualified to determine that a child doesn't deserve life based only on what we can see now, today, based on this limited perspective we have.\n \n \nLate term abortion? I can't say that I'd support such a concept. In the first couple of months it's a different story, if the child isn't going to survive to full term then that's when they would die on their own. Maybe that's why I'm of the position that I am, I don't like the idea of women being told that they're second class compared to someone or something that might not even come into existence in the first place.\n\n \n Women being asked to be responsible for their actions without requiring that the innocent child die for their irresponsibility isn't making women second class citizens. It is only making them take personal responsibility for their actions. And you should also know that because of abortion, their is a very real shortage of babies for adoption by loving parents who desperately want a child. So our system isn't overwhelmed by unwanted babies by any means.",

   "...What exactly is the pro-abortion propaganda you speak of?\n\n Here's an excerpt from an editorial regarding this issue and it voices your stated concerns almost verbatim. \n 2. THE RATIONALE FOR ABORTION\n \n There are a number of reasons given to justify abortion. It is important to examine their accuracy or validity.\n \n Some say, \"Better an aborted child than an abused one.\" It has already been demonstrated that the most abused child is the one killed by the abortionist. It is significant that as the number of cases of abortion increases, the number of cases of child abuse goes up also. If abortion were a deterrent to child abuse, the statistics would go in the opposite direction. We hear that child abuse has reached epidemic proportions. That should be no surprise, for as we cheapen the value of human life, the inclination to abuse it grows.\n \n Advocates of the pro-life movement are sometimes accused of making their presentation \"emotional.\" But shouldn't any compassionate person be disturbed by the wholesale slaughter of totally innocent children? However, the abortionists are good at making emotional appeals too. How often do the abortionists let a discussion go by without bringing in a heart-wringing case of the woman who was a victim of rape? There are those who mistakenly want to offer abortion as the way out.\n \n The woman who is the victim of a rape needs the loving support of the church community. All the wagging tongues that suggest she might have invited the attack should be stopped. Many times pregnancy does not result, but when it does, the woman will ultimately realize that the baby conceived is as much a victim as she is. In no possible way can we place on the baby the blame for the rape. So snuffing out the life of the baby is as unjust as executing the woman because she had been raped. God in His infinite wisdom sometimes takes the most sordid situations which man can create, and brings something beautiful from them. A classic example of this is the singer Ethel Waters, who has brought joy and inspiration to the hearts of many. She was the product of the raping of a very young girl. It is true that the mother might feel that she cannot rear the child because it would be a constant reminder of her tragedy, but she could place the child for adoption where he would bring joy to the hearts of some couple who wanted a child but could never have one of their own. This could be a happy solution for all.\n \n Another reason given for promoting abortion is poverty. Nothing is more disgusting than to hear some social do-gooder argue that abortions are needed for the poor. It is a personal affront to me, for I was born in what government would have called the poverty bracket, and have lived there most of my life. I ought to know better than the fellow who wrote the sociology textbook, whether life in such circumstances is worthwhile or not. I was tenth in a family of thirteen, so material things were not very abundant in my childhood. I know what it is like to see Christmas come and go, and there was no present for me. We did not have expensive works of art at home, but I still vividly recall the beauty of the sun setting behind the Allegheny mountains. We used to spend Sunday afternoon hiking over the mountains, and those trips were as full of adventure as anything the rich children could buy. We discovered how to have a good time with what was available.\n \n Then too, we sometimes hear the argument that women will have abortions anyhow, so we should make it safe for them. But the Scriptures never imply that we should make wrongdoing safe. On the contrary, we are told that the wages of sin is death. If we were to transfer this principle to other situations, we would see how ridiculous it becomes. Robbing banks is dangerous, so we should make it safe. Sometimes a rapist gets hurt, so we should protect him against\n \n this danger. If such reasoning seems foolish, remember that some are asking for it to be made safe for a mother to destroy the child she was responsible for begetting. The whole thing is absurd.Justice for the Unborn\n \n \nThe thing is that we don't know. The lowest people can rise to greatness, but only if they have the drive to get there. And a lot of time that journey is too hard and they just give up and resign themselves to what they perceive to be as their fate.\n\n \n Your fist sentence is exactly right. WE DON'T KNOW! We don't know what the future holds regarding these children's potential, yet millions of women make decision for the future based on their immediate circumstances with no consideration of what the long term costs will be to the world. My point is that we all have value, and to be exterminated for the sake of another's convenience without even considering that child's future potential is not only shallow and shortsighted, but arrogant. \n \n And what other segment of our society has the legal right to end a life based on their own personal convenience? No other. Only women have that right based on the shallow excuse that God endowed them with the gift of propagating the human race. They act like it's some curse which demands the right to choose, but they don't get pregnant spontaneously. They actively participate in the process that leads to pregnancy. So it becomes an issue of responsibility, not victimhood.\n \n This is the way of thinking that this multi billion dollar industry doesn't want you to consider. And remember this too NATO, as the pro-abortion side makes all of these shallow excuses to justify abortion, and works with lobbyists to extend it to late term and live abortions, their true motivation is the money this industry generates. They obviously don't care about people as they exist for the sole purpose of destroying life. \n \n \nSome adoptees may have performed great things, but not all of them will. They're no more special and bound for greatness than you or me who lived with our blood relatives.\n\n \n True again, but is death preferable to adoption in your opinion? I would like some adoptees to weigh in, and I doubt we'll get even ONE to agree with that premise. They embrace the opportunity to live and accomplish their hopes and dreams just as you and I do.\n \n \nIt's not for me to decide whether or not we'd be better off if certain people were aborted before they were born. I'm just offering up reasons for why I support my position.\n\n \n Agreed again NATO, my point is that since we don't know, shouldn't we ere on the side of life and opportunity? Have you considered that since these approximately 40 MILLION babies have been exterminated over the past 35 years, have you considered how many Einsteins, philosophers and hero's have been snuffed out? Of course we don't know, but just using the laws of probability, we know they have been many, even millions. How many scientific and medical breakthroughs have been killed in the mothers womb?\n \n And how many inventors who might have eased world suffering with the power of their imagination have been denied life through abortion? The cost to this world due to abortion is incalculable by any measure of the standard. It is a selfish and shortsighted action which only considers the immediate needs of the woman without considering the long term impact on society or the world at large. And it is shortsighted on a moral basis also which is why so many women regret their decision for the rest of their lives. They too come to realize the potential they destroyed for selfish reasons which were based only on immediate circumstances, made at the moment.\n \n \nGreat now I have a new look on the situation. I thought I had an idea of how to look at it, now I've got to look at the whole abortion issue in the same context of government sanctioned bailout programs for homeowners who can't afford the houses they bought in the first place. That's a bad attitude to have, \"Go ahead and buy a big ****ing castle that costs several billion dollars! The government will spent good taxpayer money to ensure that you get to keep it!\"\n\n \n Nothing worth having comes easy my friend, and so it is with the truth. Life is a journey and we must consider the long term consequences of our actions before just accepting that our actions are correct at first glance. That is a perspective that the pro-abortionists don't want you to consider. I'm glad we discussed this and don't expect you to agree with on every level of rationale. What I do expect is for you to search your conscience and sense of moral justice as you read the pro-abortion justifications in the future and judge them according to a longstanding and consistent perspective that considers more than just their shortsighted and selfish world view.",

How many of these abused children would become dysfunctional with no hope of reform and turn towards crime and become serial killers and rapists motivated by their parents' hatred for them?\n \n How many of those 1.3 million potential lives will be put up for adoption? The CPS and foster care system is already overwhelmed and underfunded, they can't cope with the sheer number they have already, and a lot of the excess children who aren't being cared for are living on the streets or in cardboard boxes, fighting just to scrape by from one day to another on whatever they can find in the dumpster, and however much loose change they can get by collecting cans.\n \n What it comes down to is, is it better if these potential lives are aborted before they can begin and before a consciousness is developed, or afterward when they'll fully experience and be immersed in suffering and pain before dying?\n Basically, he is perfectly reflecting the \"Better an aborted child than an abused one.\" justification for abortions. Not intentionally, as he is only repeating the talking points which he has heard for so many years. That is what I was responding to and I am totally correct in making the correlation. And your denials do nothing to disprove the valid point I'm making.",

You have been hearing these justifications subliminally for years. When you've seen ads like the one you describe, you automatically linked it to poor women having unwanted babies.

   "\n The woman who is the victim of a rape needs the loving support of the church community. All the wagging tongues that suggest she might have invited the attack should be stopped. Many times pregnancy does not result, but when it does, the woman will ultimately realize that the baby conceived is as much a victim as she is. In no possible way can we place on the baby the blame for the rape. So snuffing out the life of the baby is as unjust as executing the woman because she had been raped. It is true that the mother might feel that she cannot rear the child because it would be a constant reminder of her tragedy, but she could place the child for adoption where he would bring joy to the hearts of some couple who wanted a child but could never have one of their own. This could be a happy solution for all.\n \n\n \n This is one of those extreme situations i would definitely abort. I couldn't imagine anything more vile than reproducing something with the DNA of a sick, psychopath. Even with my views on the horrific procedure that is abortion, the former for me would be far far worse.\n I would not even consider adoption in this instance, I would spend the rest of my life wondering if that spawn would then follow any genetic pre-disposition for disgusting, violent acts such as the rape that caused its existence. If it did, it would be my fault. \n I would not take any risk with such an existence. It makes me sick even writing about it in this post.\n \n Sorry for my emotional perspective, the very idea of this situation shakes me to my very core.\n It is one of the extreme situations i refereed to though.",

And we fight to save the 1.3 million unborn babies you demand women have the right to kill each year. And you call that having a heart? And then you will argue to save convicted murderers and seek compassion for mass murdering terrorists who seek to exterminate your own children. So how dare you say you love America, or that you even know what love is when all you represent is defending those who kill the innocent. \n \n 2) If you really loved and respected the America the founders envisioned, you wouldn't be so anti-christian and threatened by the morals we bring to the table which are right in line with what the founders represented. Here's what I mean...\n Writings of America's Founding Fathers\n \n Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness-these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them...reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.\n The First Amendment does not include the phrase \"separation of church and state.\" It reads: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" Nowhere does the First Amendment suggest that Christianity cannot be heard in the public square.\n \n The first public school law was passed in 1642. The past 350 plus years a Biblical world view was taught in the public schools. Science, Law, History,Theology all conformed to Gods standard. In 1963 the beginning of the end for a moral America came, God was officialy removed from the public schools. Would the founding fathers of America agree with this??\n \n First lets hear what the Bible says about governments and rulers.\n \n Isaiah, Prophet of God.700 B.C.\" For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee (God) shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.\" Isaiah 60:12\n \n Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ. A.D. 57 \" Let every soul be subject unto the higher power. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are are ordained of God.\" The epistle of Paul to the Romans.\n \n David, King of Israel. 980 B.C. \"The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.\" 2 Samuel 23:3 \n \n The Mayflower Compact\n \n In ye name of God, Amen. We whose names are underwriten, the loyall subjects of our dread soveraigne Lord King James by ye grace of God, of Great Britaine, Franc, & Ireland king, defender of ye faith, &c. Haveing undertaken, for ye glorie of God, and advancemente of ye Christian faith, and honour of our king & countrie, a voyage to plant ye first colonie in ye Northerne parts of Virginia, doe by these presents solemnly & mutualy in ye presence of God, and one of another, covenant & combine our selves togeather into a civill body politick; for our better ordering & preservation & furtherance of ye ends aforesaid; and by vertue hearof, to enacte, constitute, and frame shuch just & equall lawes, ordinances, acts, constitutions, & offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most meete & convenient for ye generall good of ye Colonie: unto which we promise all due submission and obedience. In witnes wherof we have hereunder subscribed our names at Cap-Codd ye .11. of November, in ye year of the raigne of our soveraigne lord King James of England, France, & Ireland ye eighteenth, and of Scotland ye fiftie fourth. Ano: Dom .1620.\n (see photocopy)\n \n The above is an exact transcription of the Mayflower Compact from a photo-scan of the original page of William Bradford's History Of Plymouth Plantation in his own handwriting.\n \n Christopher Columbus 1492 The name says it all, \"Christ bearer.\" \"Blessed be the light of day, and the holy cross we say; And the Lord of verity, and the Holy Trinity.\"\n \n Think about the places he named; San Salvador means \"Holy Savior\" Vera Cruz means \"True Cross.\" La Navidad means \" Nativity\" or \"Christmas.\" Then he named Trinidad, which means \"The Trinity.\"\n \n Today you can read his log. A quote from it, \"It was the Lord who put it into my mind to sail to the Indies. The fact that the Gospel must be preached in so many lands -- that is what convinced me. Charting the seas is but a necessary requsite for the fulfillment of the great commission of our Lord and Savior.\"\n \n William Bradford 1590-1657 Mayflower passenger Sept. 1620. A Governor of the Plymouth colony.\n \n \"They (the Pilgrims) had a great hope and inward zeal of laying some good foundation or at least to make some way there unto for the propagating and advancing of the gospel of the kingdom of Christ in those remote parts of the world, yea though they should be but even a stepping stone unto others for the performing of so great a work.\" In his later years he wrote with \"grief and sorrow\" of the growing secularism and the loss of \"constant faithfulness\".\n \n The Pilgrims -- First called separatists or wanderers. Around 1600 this group was called puritans. They started in England in the counties of Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, to purify the church and break away from the Church of England. In 1608 the group went to Holland and for twelve years John Robinson developed these people into what would be the founding fathers of America. The minority of the people sailed on the Mayflower and landed at Cape Cod after many delays and 63 days. The first year half of the pilgrims died but the rest survived and were joined by the others the next year.\n \n Fisher Aimes -- Author of the first ammendment, wrote an article called \"School books\" in the Pladium magazine in January 1801, \"We have trouble in the classrooms, we are putting in new text books. Nothing wrong with new books but we are spending more time on them than the Bible; it is drifting to the back of the classroom. We cannot tolerate this in American education. The Bible's morals are pure, its examples are captivating and noble.\n \n George Washington -- From Farewell Address17 September 1796 -- \"The Bible...is the one supreme source of revelation of the meaning of life, the nature of God and spiritual nature and need of men. It is the only guide of life which really leads the spirit in the way of peace and salvation. America was born a Christian nation.\"\n \n \"Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.\" \"It is impossable to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible.\"\n \n Benjamin Rush -- A signer of the Declaration of independence and founder of five Universities, three of which are still in use today, Ist Proffesor of chemistry in the U.S. In 1791 He wrote a paper \"The defence of the use of the Bible as a school book\" He wrote 12 reasons not to take the Bible out of school but at the end of the paper he wrote \"If we were to remove the Bible from pulic schools we would be waisting so much time punishing crimes and taking so little pains to prevent them.\"\n \n Woodrow Wilson -- \"The foundations of our society and our government rest so much on the teachings of the Bible that it would be difficult to support them if faith in these teachings would cease to be practically universal in our country.\"\n \n Calvin Coolidge -- \"The fundamental basis of this nation's law was given to Moses on the Mount. The fundamental basis of our Bill of Rights comes from the teachings we get from Exodus and St. Matthew, from Isaiah and St. Paul. I don't think we emphasize that enough these days. If we don't have the proper fundamental moral background, we will finally wind up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody but the state.\"\n \n Theodore Roosavelt -- \"Progress has brought us both unbounded oppourtunities and unbridled difficulties. I believe that the next half century will determine if we will advance the cause of Christian civilization or revert to the horrors of brutal paganism. The thought of modern industry in the hands of Christian chariity is a dream worth dreaming. The thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining. The choice between the two is upon us.\"\n \n \"There is only one morality. All else is immorality. There is only true Christian ethics over against which stands the whole of paganism. If we are to fulfill our great destiny as a people, then we must return to the old morality, the sole morality.\"\n \n Harry S Truman -- The fundamental basis of this nations law was given to Moses on the mount. The fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from Exodus and St. Matthew, from Isaiah and St. Paul. I dont think we emphasise that enough these days..\"\n \n John Adams -- \"In 1798 he made proclamation that the 9th day of May that year would be a day of solemn humiliation, fasting, and prayer that the people of the US would offer their devout addresses to the Father of Mercies.\" Just let the President TRY to do that today!!\n \n Earl Warren -- Chief justice of the supreme court, 1954 \n \"I believe that no one can read the history of our country without realizing that the good book and the spirit of the savior, have from the beginning have been our guiding geniuses.\"America's Founding Fathers\n \n Because you not only deny, but hate the true principles upon which this Country was founded, for you to say that you love this Country or the intent of the founders, is either to blatantly lie or to be so steeped in ignorance as to have been deluded by the lies which you prefer over the truth that originally set us free. My side is attempting to preserve the founders intent and your side is attempting to reshape America in your Godless, atheistic and secular humanist image which bears no resemblance at all to what made us the great Nation we used to be.",

They separated themselves from any and all who didn't live according to their rules, and even killed some for breaking their legalistic rules. Jesus brought freedom and liberty to the oppressed and the outcasts of that society, especially the women. He defines true love and acceptance while never condoning sins which He understood were harming the doer, more so than God.\n \n You think that the shall nots in the bible are rules to hold you down and restrict your free will. They are nothing of the sort. They are warnings of a loving father to protect us from the results of these destructive activities. And here we are on a debate forum and because I point out these spiritual laws which apply to all of us universally in the context of the subjects we debate, you accuse me of being a pharisee as you miss the testimony I give regarding the freedom from sin's bondage which is available in Christ.\n \n Jesus was the great liberator of humanity yet you believe the lie that He wants to limit your freedom. He liberated women especially against the will of the Sanhedrin. He gave rights where none existed before. This is the truth I live by and share here. But it is constantly thrown back at me as if I'm personally judging you.

Charting the seas is but a necessary requsite for the fulfillment of the great commission of our Lord and Savior.\"\n\n \n Here's another entry from Columbus' log upon his first encounter with a \nWestern Hemisphere nation, the Arawaks:They... brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things, which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks' bells. They willingly traded everything they owned.... They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features.... They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane.... They would make fine servants.... With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want. \n\n Christopher Columbus and the Indians by Howard Zinn\n \n These Arawaks were noted for their hospitality, their belief in sharing, which brought them to grief at the hands of the Christian Europeans:\n \nThe Indians, Columbus reported, \"are so naive and so free with their possessions that no one who has not witnessed them would believe it. When you ask for something they have, they never say no. To the contrary, they offer to share with anyone....\" He concluded his report by asking for a little help from their Majesties, and in return he would bring them from his next voyage \"as much gold as they need . . . and as many slaves as they ask.\" He was full of religious talk: \"Thus the eternal God, our Lord, gives victory to those who follow His way over apparent impossibilities.\"\n \n Because of Columbus's exaggerated report and promises, his second expedition was given seventeen ships and more than twelve hundred men. The aim was clear: slaves and gold. They went from island to island in the Caribbean, taking Indians as captives. But as word spread of the Europeans' intent they found more and more empty villages. On Haiti, they found that the sailors left behind at Fort Navidad had been killed in a battle with the Indians, after they had roamed the island in gangs looking for gold, taking women and children as slaves for sex and labor. \n\n From the above website.\n \n Yeppers!
