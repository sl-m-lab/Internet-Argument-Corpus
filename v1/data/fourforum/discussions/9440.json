   "Said Organization is a center that seeks to build and maintain an infrastructure and network among White Americans in a Reformed theological context for exclusive leadership, church growth and theological research for today's world. \n \n This Organization was led to its existence due to the lack of an intentional multifaceted structure through which the Reformed White community in all its diversity can reach its fullest potential in America with the view of impacting White Americans and their communities. The cultivation of this infrastructure will be fulfilled through these three aspects of the mission of this organization: (1) the advancement of White Reformed leadership, (2) growth of Reformed White churches and (3) theological research that addresses the pathologies of White America and the challenges of this complex world.\n\n \n what are your impressions?",

I have heard it argued that the term is really only useful for racism. It is exceedingly difficult (impossible) to define what the boundaries are. So using it to \"classify\" a person doesn't bring much clarity to the picture. \n \n That isn't to say that an ethnic group might not use some term to identify itself in an effort to promote unity or pride in self. \n \n But I think in general the divisions are so blurry that maybe the concept will fade away with time.",

If you are human, you are of the human race. The other variations that some people call 'race' are not meaningful in a biological sense. Because of the genetic bottleneck that appears to have happened 75,000 to 80,000 years ago, there is not enough variation in the homosapien species to have 'races' yet.\n \n The races could be called 'ethnic groups'.. but such minor variations as pigmentation and minor bone structure and features are not large enough to seperate them into 'race'.",
