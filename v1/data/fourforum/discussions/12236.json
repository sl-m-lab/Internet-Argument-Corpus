   "So I notice that Symbiote tends to search the forum pretty heavily. \n \n So I decided to do the same for kicks and giggles. \n \n What I found is in the 10 pages of threads in this forum, not a single one talks about Creationism as valid based on its own merits. \n \n That's 250 threads. Not a single one arguing Creationism is true on something other then a false dichotomy. \n \n If the sky is not pink with black stripes, it must be green with white spots!\n \n wallaby at least tried to argue that his belief was valid on its own merits. Why can't creationists do the same?",
