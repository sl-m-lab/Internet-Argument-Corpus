   "http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2479146.ece\n \n \nConservative religious groups have tried to mobilize opposition against the new law. They worry about the status of marriage in Norway. Progress Party members are concerned about how children will cope with same sex marriages. \n \n Despite efforts from these opponents, the law passed by a two thirds majority. \n \n After the vote Wednesday evening, opponents from the Christian Democrats and Progress Party were among the first to leave. Supporters of the legislation stayed behind to celebrate. \n \n \"I am extremely pleased that we managed to get this last stage passed. Now we have to tackle the prejudice which still exists in society,\" Finance Minister Kristin Halvorsen, also leads the Socialist Left Party, told news bureau NTB.\n \n Norway is the sixth country to adopt same sex marriage laws. Holland was first in 2001. Norway has had a Registered Partner law since 1993. \n \n The most controversial aspect of the new law is offering state funded fertility treatment to lesbian couples. Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Great Britain already provides this service. Up to now, Norwegian lesbian couples have gone to Denmark for this procedure.\n",

   "Norway is a wonderful country. I traveled there with my dad and some friends back in 1978, I think it was, for several weeks of cross country skiing. How lovely this country is, and people there live better than most people do in the United States. The standard of living is higher than ours, and people enjoy universal medical care that is excellent, protection for workers, a minimum of 5 weeks paid vacation per year, and generally good health because of the network of ski trails around the country. Now same-sex couples will have equal treatment under the law. \n \n The only down feature I experienced in Norway was the food, which, like the Swedish food I knew as a child, was awful. Boiled fish and boiled potatoes with no butter are probably pretty healthy, though. I didn't see any fat Norwegians. \n \n I took my daughter last year to the Norway pavilion at Epcot at Disney World. It's not exactly Norway, but the character breakfast, which features the various princesses and a big array of meats and cheeses and egg dishes, was wonderful, probably the best character meal in all of Disney World, better than the breakfast at Cinderella's Royal Castle. So folks who have small children might think about the Norway pavilion for a character breakfast. \n \n I will probably take my daughter to Norway and Sweden at some point, when she is older. For now, we'll just read about them.",
