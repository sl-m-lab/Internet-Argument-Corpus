   "Here's how I think it goes. What's everyone else think?\n \n\n Leviticus 18:22\n Thou shalt not lie with man as with a woman, it is an abomination.\n \n Romans 1:25-26\n They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator-who is forever praised. Amen. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.\n \n Matthew 8:5-13\n When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. \"Lord,\" he said, \"my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering.\" Jesus said to him, \"I will go and heal him.\" The centurion replied, \"Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him, \"I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" Then Jesus said to the centurion, \"Go! It will be done just as you believed it would.\" And his servant was healed at that very hour.\n\n \n Leviticus is the Holiness Code for priests and rituals used by the Jews to separate themselves from the Pagans. It is invalid to Christians along with all the other kosher laws it contains. Because Pagans had male/male sex (often using prostitution) as part of fertility rituals, the Jews separated themselves from the Pagans by not allowing that. It is talking about ritual uncleanliness.\n \n In Leviticus 18:22 and in Romans 1:26, the word \"abomination\" is actually \"ritualistically unclean\". So, Leviticus 18:22 would refer to those men who have sex with men but would not normally do that and are not attracted to men. It refers to men who are, by nature, attracted to women. Furthermore, the phrasing \"as with a woman\" implies that the man would normally bed women not men, meaning it's a straight guy sleeping with a man for a Pagan fertility ritual. \n \n In Romans 1:26 it would mean people having homosexual sex without originally being homosexuals or bisexuals themselves (yes, this is possible. Homosexuality refers to attractions, not actions.). The word actually means \"unnatural\". Since God cannot defy the laws of nature because he is the law of nature, it cannot mean \"against the laws of nature\". More accurately, this phrase, \"para physin\" means \"uncharacteristic\". It means that the person's actions were different from their usual actions. Besides this, in Romans homosexuality is not being called a sin. Instead, gay sex is being used as a form of penance. They turn from God, and so he decides that they should be gay to cleanse themselves. Certain translations also mention that the people who were \"turned gay\" by God had loveless sex based only on lust. It ignores loving relationships.\n \n Also, in that time they believed that sperm was the full baby and the woman was simply an incubator (no concept of an egg). This is why masturbation is wrong: it kills the babies with no chance to live since they have no incubator. The lack of incubator in a male would make it wrong to have sex with a male as the babies would just die which would be murder. Since sperm is not a full baby, it isn't murder, and therefore this argument doesn't really apply.\n \n Soddom was also not burned for gay people. It was burned because the people were greedy (\"fullness of bread\" the Bible calls it). The scene with the angels? That was hazing. Lot was being a good host and kept them from being hazed since they were the \"new guys\" in town.\n \n In the story of the Roman soldier's servant being healed, it can be viewed that Jesus endorsed homosexuality. He lived in Galilee which was a Pagan area, not in Judea where the Jews were. Because he was a Galileen he would have known that the Pagan Romans had no problem with homosexuality. When Matthew wrote this, he used the Greek slang word \"pai\u00a7\" for a servant who is also a catamite. Roman soldiers often had sexual relationships with their boy servants. Jesus would have known this. If he had something against homosexuality, would he have healed the boy? He seems to be approving of their relationship.\n \n Um, I think I've covered everything I've come across.",

It is the opinion of Eziekle for one. \n \n \n\n Your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters. You not only followed their ways, and acted according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways. As I live, says the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done. This was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy. They were haughty and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.\n \n Ezekiel 16:46-50\n \n\n \n And what did Joesphus say about it?\n \n \n\n the Sodomites, overweeningly proud of their numbers and the extent of their wealth, showed themselves insolent to men and impious to the Divinity, insomuch that they no more remembered the benefits that they had received from him, hated foreigners and declined all intercourse with others. Indignant at this conduct, God accordingly resolved to chastise them for their arrogance...\n \n Josephus, Antiquities I: 194-5 \n \n\n \n So, it is not just my opinion, but the opinion of the scriptures, and the opinion of Josphus (who probably took it from the Jewish scriptures).\n \n Then , let's look at the Bablyonian Talmud\n \n \n\n The men of Sodom waxed haughty only on account of the good which the Holy One, blessed be He, had lavished upon them...They said: Since there cometh forth bread out of (our) earth, and it hath the dust of gold, why should we suffer wayfarers, who come to us only to deplete our wealth. Come, let us abolish the practice of travelling in our land...\n \n There were four judges in Sodom named Shakrai (Liar), Shakurai (Awful Liar), Zayyafi (Forger), and Mazle Dina (Perverter of Justice). Now if a man assaulted his neighbour's wife and bruised her, they would say to the husband, Give her to him, that she may become pregnant for thee. If one cut off the ear of his neighbour's XXX, they would order, Give it to him until it grows again.\n \n If one wounded his neighbour they would say to the victim, Give him a fee for bleeding thee [bloodletting was sometimes considered medically beneficial in those days; Here the Sodomite judge cruelly ruled that if one beats you until you bleed, you owe your attacker money for this \"beneficial\" medical service\"...]\n \n ... they had beds upon which travellers slept. If the guest was too long they shortened him by lopping off his feet; if too short, they stretched him out...\n \n If a poor man happened to come there, every resident gave him a denar [coin], upon which he wrote his name, but no bread was given [the store owners recognized such coins, and refused toa accept them]. When he died, each came and took back his (denar)...\n \n A certain maiden gave some bread to a poor man, hiding it in a pitcher. On the matter becoming known, they daubed her with honey and placed her on the parapet of the wall, and the bees came and consumed her. Thus it is written, And the Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah, because it is great (rabbah): whereupon Rab Judah commented in Rab's name: on account of the maiden (ribah).\n \n Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 109a\n \n\n \n And Rambam\n \n \n\n \n Nachmanides commenting on the verse \"AND WE SHALL KNOW THEM\".\n \n Their intention was to stop people from coming among them, as our rabbis have said, for they thought that because of the excellence of their land... many will come there and they despised charity... they continued provoking and rebelling against Him with their ease and the oppression of the poor... In the opinion of our Rabbis, all evil practices were rampant among them. Yet their fate was sealed because of this sin - i.e. they did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy - since this sin represented their usual behaviour more than any other. Besides, since all peoples act righteously towards their friends and their poor, there was none among all the nations who matched Sodom in cruelty.\n \n Nahmanides (Ramban) Commentary on Genesis, 13th century\n \n",

   "EPISTLES of Peter (which were written by Peter).\n \n Next....\n\n \n Ah, you are speaking of 1st peter and second peter.\n \n No, Neither of those appear to have been written by peter.\n \n From http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/1peter.html\n \n \n\n Paul J. Achtemeier writes: \"The letter, therefore, beginning with a carefully crafted exordium whose purpose was to win the attention of the audience, followed by a series of topical discussions and concluding with a peroration, shows elements of judicial and epideictic structures, but seems to reflect most closely the deliberative rhetoric of its Hellenistic age. Whether or nto the author set out deliberatively to craft a letter that included such elements of formal Hellenistic rhetoric is difficult to say, although it would be equally difficult to deny him all acquaintance with formal rhetoric in light of the shape of the letter itself.\" (A Commentary on First Peter, p. 6)\n \n Eric Eve writes: \"Despite 1 Pet 1:1, the author is unlikely to have been the apostle Peter. The cultured Greek of the epistle makes it perhaps the most literary composition in the NT. The apostle Peter probably knew some Greek, but 1 Peter does not look like the product of an unlettered (Acts 4:13) Galilean fisherman. It employs a sophisticated vocabulary incorporating several NT hapax legomena, and its author appears to have some command of the techniques of Hellenistic rhetoric. He is also intimately acquainted with the OT in the LXX, whereas we should have expected the Galilean Peter to have been more familiar with an Aramaic Targum or the Hebrew.\" (The Oxford Bible Commentary, p. 1263)\n \n Donald Guthrie objects that Peter would have made use of the LXX when addressing himself to Gentiles. But the problem is not simply that of citation from the Greek Septuagint but also that of the unconsious influence that follows from regular familiarity with the text. Paul J. Achtemeier writes: \"The intimate acquaintance of our author with the Greek language is shown by the text of the OT which the author quotes and to which he alludes frequently: it is the LXX rather than the MT. Direct quotation is limited to two instances (gegraptai, 1:16; en grafh, 2:6), and there the text is rather clearly the LXX (1:16 from Lev 19:2; 2:6 from Isa 40:6-8, though with modifications); additional clear examples of quotation would include Isa 40:6-8 at 1:24-25 and Ps 33:13-17 (MT Ps 34) at 3:10-12, in both instances with modifications. In addition to quotations, allusions to the OT that contain LXX language occur in such places as 2:3, 7, 9-10, 22-25; 3:14; 4:14; 5:8, indicating that the author was saturated with the language of the Greek Bible. The absence of influence from the language of the Hebrew Bible or the Targumim on the one hand, and the clear influence of the LXX on the other, show that the author was at home in Greek rather than Semitic culture, and such is likely not to have been the case with Simon Peter.\" (A Commentary on First Peter, pp. 6-7) \n \n\n \n More on the site about the first peter\n \n From the same site about 2 peter.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/2peter.html\n \n \n\n Kummel presents the arguments that make all critical scholars recognize that II Peter is a pseudepigraph (Introduction to the New Testament, pp. 430-4):\n \n 1. The literary dependence on Jude rules this out. II Pet 1 and 3 already have a number of contacts with Jude: cf. II Pet 1:5 with Jude 3; II Pet 1:12 with Jude 5; II Pet 3:2 f with Jude 17 f; II Pet 3:14 with Jude 24; II Pet 3:18 with Jude 25. The most striking agreements with Jude are shown in the portrayal of the false teachers in II Pet 2 and also in the illustrations based on the OT and the pictures drawn from nature, agreements in the exact wording and extensive agreements in sequence. The false teachers deny the Lord Christ and lead a dissolute life (II Pet 2:1 f = Jude 4), they despise and blaspheme the good angelic powers (II Pet 2:10 f = Jude 8 f), they speak in high-handed fashion (&#965;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#947;&#954;&#945;; II Pet 2:18 = Jude 16), they are blotches on the communal meal (&#963;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#959;&#953; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#969;&#967;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;; II Pet 2:13 = Jude 12), they are clouds tossed about by the wind, devoid of water, for whom the gloom of darkness is reserved (II Pet 2:17 = Jude 12 f), they are denounced for their fleshly corruption and their unrestrained mode of life (II Pet 2:10, 12 ff, 18 = Jude 7 f, 10, 12, 16). The sequence of examples of punishment from the OT in Jude 5 ff (Israel in the desert, fallen angels, Sodom and Gomorrah) is arranged in historical order in II Pet 2:4 ff and modified (fallen angels, Flood, Sodom and Gomorrah) because the author of II Pet needs the example of the Flood to combat the deniers of the parousia. The general statement in II Pet 2:11 makes sense only if note has been made of the concrete example mentioned in Jude 9. The image in Jude 12 f is more genuine and more plastic than the parallel in II Pet 2:17.\n \n\n \n So, as always, your claims are not backed up with facts.",

Did it start by the Jewish scholars who lived at the same time and would have known about these religions and were themselves trying to discredit Jesus? No, it started with an Islamic writer named Yousuf Saleem Chishti, in his book, What is Christianity. This book is available by the way in a classics edition from Islamic booksellers. He wrote in this book on pages 87-88, \"Mithra was considered the son of God, he was a savior, he was born of a virgin, he had twelve disciples, he was crucified, he rose from the grave the third day, he atoned for the sins of humankind, and he returned to his father in heaven.\" \n \n Where did he get this information? No one knows, he listed no sources, and none have been found. However that didn't stop a writer in the late 1800s and early 1900s named Gerald Massey from using Chishti as his source for the same information.\n \n What is interesting is the way that others have built on Chishti's initial claims. The really bizarre claim added to Chishti's by later writers is that of Mithra supposedly being born on December 25. You see this is mentioned nowhere in the bible about Christ, but was chosen by the early church with no claims to being Jesus' actual birth date. \n \n What do we know about the Mithra cult? I quote from Ronald Nash in Christianity and the Hellenistic World, \" We do know that Mithraism, like its mystery competitors, had a basic myth. Mithra was supposedly born when he emerged from a rock; he was carrying a knife and torch and wearing a Phrygian cap. He battled first with the sun and then with a primeval bull, thought to be the first act of creation. Mithra slew the bull, which then became the ground of life for the human race.\" Nash and other scholars are unanimous in their conclusions that the so-called \"simularities\" between Mithra and Christ are not found prior to the advent of Christianity and the birth of Jesus. It was only after Christianity became established that pagan influences merged with and borrowed from Christianity to come up with the alleged simularities previously mentioned in this post.  (members.aol.com) \n \n Conclusion: The so-called Mithra simularities are bogus and have no basis in fact. \n \n Christ is the real thing. \n \n PAGAN RUSURRECTION CLAIMS REFUTED\n \n http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0169a.html",

   "Love to see you try to prove it.\n\n \n The burden of proof would be on you since there are no original christian writings. Plenty of copies, but alas no first print versions.\n \n The Apostles thought Jesus was the one, but that doesn't mean they were right. They stayed Jewish and from what I've read so did Jesus. It wasn't until Paul/Saul realized that the only people who beleived what they were saying was the gentiles and the Apostles weren't in any rush to save them or share the Kingdom of God (or Kingdom of Heaven depending on which Gospel you like best.) \n \n My favorite same story but before Jesus is the story of Sin.\n \n Background\n \n The moon-god is by excellence the god of nomadic peoples, since the moon is their guide and protector at night when they undertake their wanderings. This is just as the sun-god is the chief god of an agricultural people. The cult, once introduced, would tend to persevere, and the development of astrological science culminating in a calendar and in a system of interpretation of the movements and occurrences in the starry heavens would be an important factor in maintaining the position of Sin in the\n \n Sin's chief sanctuary at Ur was named E-gish-shir-gal (\"house of the great light.\") His sanctuary at Harran was named E-khul-khul (\"house of joys.\") On seal-cylinders, he is represented as an old man with a flowing beard and the crescent as his symbol. In the astral-theological system he is represented by the number 30 and the planet Venus. 30 probably refers to the average number of days (correctly around 29.53) in a lunar month, as measured between successive new moons.\n \n The \"wisdom\" personified by the moon-god is likewise an expression of the science of astrology in which the observation of the moon's phases is so important a factor. The tendency to centralize the powers of the universe leads to the establishment of the doctrine of a triad consisting of Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar, personifying the moon, the sun, and the earth as the life-force.\n \n [edit] Origin of name\n \n He was named Sin in Babylonia and Assyria and was also worshipped in Harran. Sin had a beard made of lapis lazuli and he rode on a winged bull. His wife was Ningal (\"Great Lady\") who bore him Utu (\"Sun\") and Inanna, and in some texts, Ishkur. His symbols are the crescent moon, the bull, and the tripod (which may be a lamp-stand.) An important Sumerian text (\"Enlil and Ninlil\") [1] tells of the descent of Enlil and Ninlil (pregnant with Nanna - Suen) into the underworld. There, three \"substitutions\" are given to allow the ascent of Nanna - Suen. The story shows some similarities to the text known as \"The Descent of Inanna\".\n \n [edit] Seats of Sin's worship\n \n The two chief seats of Sin's worship were Ur in the south, and Harran to the north. The cult of Sin spread to other centers, and temples of the moon-god are found in all the large cities of Babylonia and Assyria.\n \n He is commonly designated as En-zu, or \"lord of wisdom.\" During the period (c.2600-2400 BC) that Ur exercised a large measure of supremacy over the Euphrates valley, Sin was naturally regarded as the head of the pantheon. It is to this period that we must trace such designations of Sin as \"father of the gods\", \"chief of the gods\", \"creator of all things\", and the like. We are justified in supposing that the cult of the moon-god was brought into Babylonia by Semitic nomads from Arabia.\n \n The moon god of Ur and first son of Enlil, the Sumerian god of earth and air. As 'lord of the calendar', his cult exhibited monotheistic tendencies, since it was Sin 'who determines the destinies of distant days' and whose 'plans no god knows'. According to Genesis, Abraham hailed from Ur by way of Harran, both cities devoted to the moon god. In Arabia, Sin was also worshipped under various titles and it is likely that Mount Sinai, first mentioned in Hebrew texts about 1000 BC, was connected with moon-worship.\n \n Other names for Sin were Suen and Nanna. Addressed in prayer as 'perfect in lordiness', Sin was associated with fertility, 'lord of the cowherders', the nether world, and kingship. A myth of Nanna's wooing of Ningal, the mother of goddess Inanna, relates how the god is repulsed until he has filled the rivers with the early flood, made the grain grow in the field, and caused fishes to be in the marshes, reeds along the banks of rivers, stags in the forest, plants in the desert, honey and wine in the orchards, cress in the garden, and long life in the palace. Only when all this bounty occurs is Ningal prepared to come and live with Nanna in his lofty dwelling on top of the ziggurat in Ur.",
