The difference is one of exposure (they don't have anything like the public profile of the US movements) and the pervasive attitude to religion in the UK- people are generally much less up front about their religious beliefs over here.\n \n On the poll results, there is some ambiguity IMO. When it states 22% of people believed in creationism what exactly was the question posed? does that mean young earth creationism or old earth creationism or both? Also interesting is the apparent indication of how intelligent design has been rapidly adopted as a method of explaining ones position.\n \n The program, Horizon: A War on Science is on tonight at 9:00pm on BBC2, should be an interesting watch.",

What is now loosely called the 'design argument' has been known to philosophers for at least two centuries as an a posteriori argument (literally, 'from backwards'). It is examined at length and dismissed by Hume in his 'Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion' published in 1779.",

   "Well nothing at all in the program about the MORI poll, but instead a focus on four prominent figures of ID movement (Johnson, Dembski, Behe, Meyer) and their role in the development of the position over the last two decades.\n \n I think the program makers granted the IDists a remarkably prominent platform on which they could present their views- which they did with a typical evasion of their religious motivations by avoiding any reference to Christianity and trying to present themselves in the guise of scientists (which is true for Behe but not the others.)\n \n Countering their contributions were Dawkins, Attenborough and Miller. Dawkins was typically dismissive of the validity of ID and to the point about the intelletual dangers it poses, Miller countered the arguements of irreduable complexity and the alleged mathematical improbability of evolution and Attenborough made some more reservedl but no less powerful observations on the true nature of the fundementalists agenda.\n \n This was against the backdrop of material on the Dover trial and some stuff on the Vatican's outlook on ID. As often happens with a popular science program examining a contentious issue very little science was examined at all, which is a shame as it is through such analysis that ID is exposed as the pseudo-science it truely is. Also, while the program tried to be impartial it gave considerable interview time to the ID group which failed to convey the weight of opinion against them in mainstream science.\n \n Overall an interesting watch, but a bit of a PR coup for the IDists, IMO.",

   "Thanks for the link TimTim.\n \n I agree with you on the phrasing of the questions in that there is no adequate repsonse that describes the position of a person who maintains a belief in God at the same time as fully accepting the findings of science on evolution etc. I feel they would have been pigeon-holed into response C as they are unlikely to chose response A that infers an atheistic outlook.\n \n The most surprising result is the support for teaching ID and creationism in science classes, although we don't know what context these responses were made. The question doesn't say if ID/creationism should be taught in science class as an alternative or as a counter example to show a non-scientific explaination of a natural event.",
