No where else and in no other civil rights aspect do we see this type of statement. \n\n \n Because Matthew, society has to take the time to define its standards. We don't start with the assumption that anything-goes; standards are developed over time. Your question is no different than the recent couple in Germany in the news who are brother and sister wondering why they should not be allowed to marry. Marriage laws have to have limits somewhere in terms of what sort of arrangements of people suffice to be considered marriage, and this is all a part of simply determining (over time) where those limits fall.\n \n Many rights in our society DID have to go through a people-deciding process, so you are wrong that on no other issue do we see that sort of thing happening. In fact, even with civil rights itself, it happened in the form of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It happened earlier than that with women's suffrage. Voting on civil rights is a well established precedent. Some things have become rights, some haven't. It's a process that our society goes through in defining its standards. The problem is that some in your movement seem to want to circumvent that process.",

All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen. At the end of the day, any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful. It may not need a full majority in some cases, but it needs enough people on board. That's why legislation requires not only voting (by legislature), but elected officials to do so as well. There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law--it involved a national debate, protests, etc. Sometimes this process results in our country (the people) granting civil rights legislation, and sometimes it doesn't (depending on whether it is deemed warranted). The process (which will undoubtedly take years) is going on right now in regards to gays.

I'm saying that it has to go through a process of determining what is bigoted and what is reasonable in the first place by determining the standards, and I think voting on ballot initiatives is part of that process. Just because someone says something is bigotry does not automatically make it so. What determines whether or not an issue on a ballot initiative is 'bigotry' is the issue being voted on (and the standards society sets on it). For example, in Germany recently, there is a lot of news about a brother and sister who are wanting legal marriage. As a result Germany is having to go through a process of determining if they should provide legal marriage for incest couples (and they are giving it serious consideration). So there is a process over which it is determined if this couple is experiencing bigotry or not. I think these ballot initiatives are part of that process here in terms of gay marriage.\n \n \nVery libertarian of you, but I believe that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice, it should. If wrong is happening, and the government can stop it, it should.\n\n \n If evil and wrong are indeed happening, then sure. That's what we're determining as a society, as well as the best way to fix it. Just using terms like \"wrong\" and \"evil\" may make for great rhetoric, but it doesn't determine anything here. No one is disagreeing that the govt should put a stop to evil and wrong; the issue is a.) whether or not evil and wrong are indeed taking place in the issue of gay marriage (and therefore using the issue on ballot initiatives), and b.) how to best deal with it if it IS evil and wrong (civil unions, redefining marriage, etc.) My point is that I think ballot initiatives are simply a way to help determine these things on a controversial issue in society. How would you determine what issues are valid for use on ballot initiatives? What criteria would you use? Or would you throw out the whole concept of ballot initiatives altogether regardless of the subject matter?\n \n \nGee, now I'm supposed to offer solutions before you even get what the point is?

   "Matthew, in one regard I agree with you. I believe fully in the right of the individual to do what he will. It is when those individual rights come into conflict that society becomes involved. I am not harmed because one man wishes to live for all eternity with another; it is his sovereign right to make that decision. That man can even establish a legal construct to ensure that his fortune is inherited. Again, no harm to me. Where I come into the picture is when the gentlemen seek to pass a peremptory acceptance by all of society on their actions. You wish to compel me, as a member of society to say \"yey, I approve this action\" when I in fact do not. In so doing, you violate my own right to self determination.

   "I'm not sure that being treated equally, in general or without qualification, is a civil right.\n\n Obviously not.

   "Matthew, in one regard I agree with you. I believe fully in the right of the individual to do what he will. It is when those individual rights come into conflict that society becomes involved. I am not harmed because one man wishes to live for all eternity with another; it is his sovereign right to make that decision. That man can even establish a legal construct to ensure that his fortune is inherited. Again, no harm to me. Where I come into the picture is when the gentlemen seek to pass a peremptory acceptance by all of society on their actions. You wish to compel me, as a member of society to say &#8220;yey, I approve this action&#8221; when I in fact do not. In so doing, you violate my own right to self determination. Once two individuals with a common claim on a right come into conflict it falls to the purview of the society to effect legislation concerning the common good. \n\n \n \n Yet I am asked to accept and celebrate heterosexual relationships and marriage.

Those two facts led to it spreading through the gay population more quickly than the straight population, at least at first. But if you look at current infection rates, taking into account the skewed initial infection rates, straights are getting AIDS at the same relative rate as gays. If patient zero had been straight then AIDS wouldn't be associated with gays at all. So no, you don't get to blame gays for AIDS.

You said that the chances were slim of homosexuals staying together 28 years or more, and for your evidence of this you provided a opinion piece in the Washington Times that referenced a highly flawed study about the correlation of HIV and high risk sexual behavior (http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030711-121254-3711r.htm). Most of the references in that study were from other studies about the effectiveness of retroviral drug therapy. The group conducting these \"studies\" never kept a consistent pattern for selecting participants. For years they only accepted non-monogamous, HIV+ men who attended AIDS clinics in Amsterdam. That's way too many variables to be a truly scientific study.

This rumor may have started with Randy Shilts' 1987 book And The Band Played On (and the movie based on it, in which Dugas is referred to as AIDS' Patient Zero), but neither the book nor the movie state him to have been the first to bring the virus to North America. He was called \"Patient Zero\" because at least 40 of the 248 people known to be infected by AIDS in 1983 had had sexual intercourse with him, or with someone who had sexual intercourse with him. However, four years after the publication of Shilts' article, Dr. Darrow repudiated his study, saying that its methods were flawed and claiming that Shilts had misrepresented its conclusions.\"\n Either way it seems highly implausible to me that we could ever know or narrow down for certain to a single known person as patient 0 for the U.S.",

I said that had Patient zero been straight, there's a possibility that Patient 1 wouldn't have existed. We know that it's more difficult to transmit sex via straight sex, so there's nothing wrong with posing the 'what if' scenario. I'm sure that gays don't like thinking that they are the reason that AIDS has reached such a level in the US, but that doesn't change the basic facts.\n I, also, mentioned the other avenues that HIV spread in the US, but they trailed the spread in the gay community. \n \n And your assertion, in bold above, is inaccurate. Straights can't catch AIDS just as easily as gays. Transmission vaginally is less likely to result because there is less risk of blood/blood contact, for one thing and most straights aren't heavy into the Hershey Highway.

Straights during that time were more likely to use condoms, for the prevention of pregnancy. Condoms prevent HIV transmission, straight sex, does not.

Let us now peruse the tarnished pages of history. Gay men seem to have frequently married one another throughout history. In fact, in some societies marriages between gay men were officially recognized by the state, as in ancient Sparta, and on the Dorian island of Thera.\n\n \n \nLet us now leap across the waters to look at gay marriages among the American Indians, particularly the Sioux and the Cheyenne. In most such marriages one of the two men was a berdache, a transvestite/medicine man who wore men's clothes only when he joined a war party, where he cared for the wounded. The berdaches were especially popular with young people, for they were excellent matchmakers - in a sense they personified the very concept of marriage - and fine love talkers. They got married to either the loafers of the village, or would become the second or third \"wife\" of the chieftain. Usually their husbands were more ridiculed than they themselves were, not because of homosexuality, which Indians generally tolerated, but because such husbands usually abandoned their economic status in society, and let the berdache do all the work to create the model household. \n\n \n To put it another way, there are many many examples of gay marriage throughout history.

   "I am willing to grant for the sake of argument that all societies before the year 2006 condoned, permitted, encouraged, celebrated, and otherwise accepted homosexual union. I will grant ye these things because they are entirely irrelevant to the discussion of our society in 2007. One could just as easily argue that England once burned heretics; therefore, we should not speak English. The whole argument that X did something therefore Y should be able to do something is not supportable by logic, but it is a tried and true doctrine of American politics. \"Clinton did X, therefore Bush doing Y is appropriate\" and vice versa. How do ye cut through the nit-wittery?\n \n The question is what benefits OUR society. Laws are made, indeed, all economics and societal interactions are governed by one premise: \"what is best for the society and individual.\" Our society assigns a value to the heterosexual union. Indeed, the monogamous heterosexual union is regarded as conditio sine qua non by our society whereas homosexual union does not represent an essential element to society. This value equation is made by our society regardless of what another society or civilization current or ancient valued. That is the bottom line. As Matthew and others have stated, societal values have and are changing. Perhaps someday society will see a value in homosexual unions. That value may perchance simply be recognition of harm suffered by those couples denied homosexual marriage. There is presently no awareness of significant harm done and society thus sees no value in change, ergo, the status quo. \n \n If ye would effect that change, ye must demonstrate 1: the harm, 2: the benefit.

   "Description of Appeal to Tradition\n \n Appeal to Tradition is a fallacy that occurs when it is assumed that something is better or correct simply because it is older, traditional, or \"always has been done.\" This sort of \"reasoning\" has the following form: \n [*]X is old or traditional [*]Therefore X is correct or better.This sort of \"reasoning\" is fallacious because the age of something does not automatically make it correct or better than something newer. This is made quite obvious by the following example: The theory that witches and demons cause disease is far older than the theory that microrganisms cause diseases. Therefore, the theory about witches and demons must be true. \n \n This sort of \"reasoning\" is appealing for a variety of reasons. First, people often prefer to stick with what is older or traditional. This is a fairly common psychological characteristic of people which may stem from the fact that people feel more comfortable about what has been around longer. Second, sticking with things that are older or traditional is often easier than testing new things. Hence, people often prefer older and traditional things out of laziness. Hence, Appeal to Tradition is a somewhat common fallacy. \n \n It should not be assumed that new things must be better than old things (see the fallacy Appeal to Novelty) any more than it should be assumed that old things are better than new things. The age of something does not, in general, have any bearing on its quality or correctness (in this context). In the case of tradition, assuming that something is correct just because it is considered a tradition is poor reasoning. For example, if the belief that 1+1 = 56 were a tradition of a group of people it would hardly follow that it is true. \n \n Obviously, age does have a bearing in some contexts. For example, if a person concluded that aged wine would be better than brand new wine, he would not be committing an Appeal to Tradition. This is because, in such cases the age of the thing is relevant to its quality. Thus, the fallacy is committed only when the age is not, in and of itself, relevant to the claim. \n \n One final issue that must be considered is the \"test of time.\" In some cases people might be assuming that because something has lasted as a tradition or has been around a long time that it is true because it has \"passed the test of time.\" If a person assumes that something must be correct or true simply because it has persisted a long time, then he has committed an Appeal to Tradition. After all, as history has shown people can persist in accepting false claims for centuries. \n \n However, if a person argues that the claim or thing in question has successfully stood up to challenges and tests for a long period of time then they would not be committing a fallacy. In such cases the claim would be backed by evidence. As an example, the theory that matter is made of subatomic particles has survived numerous tests and challenges over the years so there is a weight of evidence in its favor. The claim is reasonable to accept because of the weight of this evidence and not because the claim is old. Thus, a claim's surviving legitimate challenges and passing valid tests for a long period of time can justify the acceptance of a claim. But mere age or persistance does not warrant accepting a claim. \n\n http://search.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-tradition.html",

   "Kronus,\n \n You can point to times the status quo was bad, I can point to times when the status quo was (is) good. Where is the relevance? I concede that my argument gives the impression that I was arguing \"The status quo is always good, except when it's bad, but then it is changed and becomes good again.\" That was not my intent. My point was rather that the status quo requires critical mass to change. That critical mass has not yet been achieved. Pundits on both sides argue that because of X in the past, Y in the present should happen. My point was that this is irrelevant and that the point must be decided on its own merit..\n\n Then we're on the same page here. All I've been trying to do is shoot down the \"It's always been that way so it must be good\" argument, so that the issue of gay marriage can be decided on the actual issues, such as fairness and justice. \n \n \n\n The gubment is not responsible for your psychological fulfillment..\n\n You left out social. Be that as it may, it is true that the more people and organizations stand up and say \"It is not ok to discriminate against this group\" the harder it is for people to display their biggotry. The government can't wave a magic wand and make prejudice disappear, I'm not trying to say that they can. But if the government acknowledged that gay couples are just as good as straight couples it would be a strong message to homophobes that their opinion is not acceptable, and that's worth shooting for.\n \n \n\n Further, tax benefits doth not an argument make. The blind currently receive generous tax deductions on account of their lack of vision. This does not argue effectively for blindness. The tax incentive is a case of quid pro quo, whereby society expects to receive a benefit from that heterosexual union. This benefit is presently not ascribed to the homosexual union by society. Folks currently receive a tax credit of $1,000 per child. This doth not constitute discrimination against the single, or the childless.\n\n No, but it is a case of discrimination against gay couples with children, isn't it? And the benefits are not a case of quid pro quo; the government is not bribing people into having kids. The purpose of marriage benefits are to help a couple build a life together, nothing more. All that gay couples want is full access to the same benefits that straight couples have. You have to admit, anything less would be unfair, wouldn't it?",

This is part of my earlier argument that the messenger is as important as the message. \n \n The nut is the individual who goes to a St. Patrick's Day parade and insists on drawing attention to his sexuality, be that individual a homosexual or heterosexual. Note, that I do not wish to see homosexuals barred from the parade, but a recognition that the event is not about sexuality. If ye are Irish and homosexual ye are no less Irish than if ye are Irish and heterosexual. Activists who insist on carrying banners proclaiming their sexual proclivities have no part of a parade on city streets be they hetero or homo. \n \n This is not about discrimination, this is not about protest, this is about decorum. When ye engage in behavior in public, prepare to be judged on that behavior. That is precisely what Joe is doing, and if this is bigotry, ye are complicit in it by not decrying the actions of the fringe. Joe hears the argument that homosexuals should be free to do what they will in the privacy of their own homes, then is confronted with the image of banner carrying protestors in a public parade dedicated to Irish heritage. Joe is receiving a message, but it is not the message ye want to send.\n \n Ye believe that your message is bulletproof, irrespective of the messenger. My point is that the message is often trumped by the messenger. \n \n So lets recap:\n I have acknowledged:\n That the actions in question are committed by the fringe\n That the fringe does not reflect the actions of mainstream homosexuals\n \n I have not argued against homosexuality. I have not attacked homosexuals. If anything, I have presented a course of action by which your goals might be realized. This does not fit with my definition of bigotry.\n \n Again: My premise is not that homosexuality is wrong, but rather, that the arguments in favor of homosexual marriage has not reached the critical mass to effect change. I believe that through thoughtful advocacy such as that made by Kronus and Coyote, that this change may be made. I also note that others actions are slowing what some consider to be inevitable.",

This is part of my earlier argument that the messenger is as important as the message. \n \n The nut is the individual who goes to a St. Patrick's Day parade and insists on drawing attention to his sexuality, be that individual a homosexual or heterosexual. Note, that I do not wish to see homosexuals barred from the parade, but a recognition that the event is not about sexuality. If ye are Irish and homosexual ye are no less Irish than if ye are Irish and heterosexual. Activists who insist on carrying banners proclaiming their sexual proclivities have no part of a parade on city streets be they hetero or homo. \n \n This is not about discrimination, this is not about protest, this is about decorum. When ye engage in behavior in public, prepare to be judged on that behavior. That is precisely what Joe is doing, and if this is bigotry, ye are complicit in it by not decrying the actions of the fringe. Joe hears the argument that homosexuals should be free to do what they will in the privacy of their own homes, then is confronted with the image of banner carrying protestors in a public parade dedicated to Irish heritage. Joe is receiving a message, but it is not the message ye want to send.\n \n Ye believe that your message is bulletproof, irrespective of the messenger. My point is that the message is often trumped by the messenger.\n\n \n You have an overly narrow view of gay and lesbian community groups, their role and message. They exist to educate, increase visibility and to erradicate prejudice. I sincerly doubt you would have a problem with displays of heterosexuals and how they live. It may not take the form of a specifically straight community group or a straight banner, but the recognition is there(groups of families, for example). There is no need for straight specific groups or banners. This is because heterosexuals are already the majority, and enjoy more easy and open recognition in countless ways, which people are so accustomed to on a daily basis, it's not even given a second thought. There is no need to educate or to increase awareness and visibility when it comes to straight people. This is a problem for some, because it involves gays. Just like the holdling hands in public issue, and the gay movies, TV shows and books and pride parades and marriages. It only bothers some because the common denominator is gay. \n \n There are other groups, which would not be directly related to being specifically Irish, which receive recognition.\n \n \nSo lets recap:\n I have acknowledged:\n That the actions in question are committed by the fringe\n That the fringe does not reflect the actions of mainstream homosexuals\n\n \n I don't agree that they are the fringe.\n \n \nI have not argued against homosexuality. I have not attacked homosexuals. If anything, I have presented a course of action by which your goals might be realized. This does not fit with my definition of bigotry.\n\n \n You just don't want to see homosexuality. In suggesting the course of action, you are naieve to the social reality I explained above in this post. You would like homosexuality out of sight and out of mind, despite your usually nice words. You don't consciously acknowledge your prejudice and ignorance as a comfortable member of the straight majority which takes for granted its recognition and rights.",

As has been pointed out numerous times, marriage has changd in other ways. I would like to know what the motivation really is in your view, for opposing gay marriage, since it is not tradition in general. Perhaps tradition is being applied as the sole argument only when it involves gays. Otherwise, tradition is not an argument.",

   "My dear sir, I do not care what ye believe! Ye may hate me with every ounce of your strength and it would not bother me one whit. My concern is not your feelings, but your methods. I would not call Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. panderers for seeking to change hearts and minds rather than engage in headlong frontal assaults against prevailing opinion. Right now, ye are outnumbered two to one. The ratio argues more for diplomacy rather than militancy. Ye will not threaten, ye will not assault your way to the prize ye seek. \n \n But please, by all means, assign whatever feelings and motivations to my posts that ye see fit. If ye really believe that my proposed methods are so contrary to your interests, continue your quixotic charge against the ramparts of marriage. Do the opposite of whatever I suggest. Read whatever ye will into these messages. It matters not. \n \n Ye call me a bigot, and a homophobe. Ye believe that I hate ye for what ye are. Nothing could be further from the truth. Hate is not the opposite of love. To hate something, ye must invest emotional energy into that thing. I am INDIFERENT to ye. I am not working to prevent your rights anymore than I am working to promote them. I'm in it for the argument. Watching your attempts to construct a cogent line of reasoning provides nearly the same amount of amusement as regarding water beetles on a pond, but one tires of poor arguments as surely as one tires of beetle watching. I am not anti-gay, I am anti-poor-argument. That is why I have attempted to goad ye towards something a little more fruitful. Your progress so far has been, frankly beetlesque, and I fear that writing the word bigot is the height of your rhetorical prowess. \n \n It never ceases to amaze me the level of narcissism my opponents possess in believing that my thoughts and feelings revolve around antipathy towards them. Chances are ye will hate me long after ye have finished reading this sentence. Ye will be forgotten in my mind by the next sip of coffee. Who then is the hatemonger?\n \n I quack in your general direction.\n\n \n This is excellent writing style, with vivid imagery, but you're still not comprehending the issues. I have not moved to your way of thinking. I don't believe you can say you are so cooly detached and neutral on this issue, when you put the onus on me to submit to Joe's point of view. \n \n You suggest that if Joe has a negative view of me because I am different, that I make it my own problem, and act according to Joe's irrational fear of what I am and represent. In this way I am complicit in giving legitimacy to Joe's own fears of me for being gay. Now, if I don't give legitimacy to those fears and act accordingly, you say I risk Joe having a problem with me. Joe already has a problem with me. Joe needs to recognize that his own irrational fears of me, his unreasoned negative reactions, are the problem. What I am doing, in representing who I am, is not the problem.",

Since the topic of gay marriage was brewing at the time, I asked them what they thought about it. The most important thing to them was to get some of the benefits of marriage - the ability to inherit property, social security benefits, etc. automatically; the unquestioned ability to visit the spouse in the hospital and other such practical considerations. It was not as important to them to have it officially called marriage and they thought that pushing the idea of gay marriage too early would cause more harm than good. They thought that a step by step approach was better - i.e. win the rights of married couples first and later start pushing for it to be called marriage. \n \n I would tend to agree. There is benefit to changing societies step by step as opposed to trying to push all at once. People who are used to a particular social structure can get used to small social changes much easier than they can get used to large jumps. It is a delicate balance - too small a change and it takes too long to improve things, too large a change and the reaction might even move you backward in your agenda.

   "Jake, you're like the pouting kid who, when a parent has other reasons for not letting their kid play in the street, the kid insists over and over and over \"you just don't like me.\"\n\n \n Well, not wanting the kid to be hit by a car, is a good, logical reason. Most parents would say that.\n \n What you are saying, goes something like this:\n \n A bunch of neighbourhood kids get together to play. Mike, Jason and Sally don't want Tara to play in \"their\" sandbox with their toys. They insist it's not because Tara is Tara, and Tara shouldn't take it personally. It's not that they dislike Tara. It's just that they don't want or believe in Tara being there, and it's the rule. No other reason is given. Every other kid in the neighbourhood is welcome to play, but not Tara.\n \n \nBased on the dogmatism in your posts, I'm obviously not going to be able to convince you that someone can (and some do) oppose gay marriage based on other reasons than dislike for gays. (or bigotry, or hate, or whatever the get-the-most-effect-word of the day is.)\n\n \n Yeah, essentially because it's a belief to not include gays. I am interested in examining that belief, not simply hearing it stated that it is a belief. \n \n \nYou've put up your brick wall, but I'm not going to sit all day and argue with it. I've given you examples, reasons, and clearly explained this. So at this point you've made it clear you've dug your heels in and are not going to budge no matter what truth anyone ever told you.\n \n Have a good day.\n\n \n Indeed, put your own blinders on, and not try to see it from the perspective of the one you wish to exclude. Just keep stating it is a belief or a rule, and never get beyond scratching that surface.",

   "It's about lowering expectations of gays. Your condescending, patronizing attitude helps convince me of that. If gays were all lobbying for civil unions, the same people would say gays deserve less equality than that. Any measure of equality is always such a struggle. The opposition is worried about what we will ask for next, if we get too big for our boots. They say, at every granting of rights or benefits or recognition to gay couples, that gays can't be given this or that, because it is too much like what heteros have.\n\n \n You do what you want. I only suggested, many times, that you'd be much more likely to get the desired results by appealing to the general public's sense of fairness as opposed to trying to redefine what many consider a sacred union between a man and a woman. But you do as you wish, just don't cry to me when it continues to generate a backlash.",
