   "No, it does not. If anything it has been used to substantiate the very old age of the sea floor, which by itself contradicts the view, held by XXXXXX, that the earth is 6000 years old. The accepted value is about 150,000,000 years, for the sea floor alone. Changes in the earth's magnetic polarity over time have been stored in rock materials able to retain records of the earth's past magnetic polarities. This, in conjuction with symmetrical patterns along the sea floor led way to the theory known as plate techtonics. Given all the other geologic information, inferences led way to experiments that actually yielded measured results. 1 to 6 cm/yr is the range agreed upon by virtually everybody. That being true it is reasonable to assume that an account the sea floor's past movements can be plotted vs time. Thus, the scientific data supports the assertion that the earth is old.",
