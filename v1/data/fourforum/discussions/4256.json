The palestyenians and israelis were talking cease fire before she was the secretary of state. This is becuase teh palestenians have a new leader that the israelis think they can deal with. The egyptians set up the summit, and she was there and gone before the summit ever took place. So, what exactly did she have to do with it? The russians contributed more to the peace process than Rice did, with theri annoncement that they would recognise the new palestenian government and render political, financial, and military support if required. The Israelis had no choice at that point. The US is not going to risk a military confrontation with Russia so the israelis can keep playing their childish games, and israel knows it.\n \n So far her list of accomplishments include giving a speach in paris, and visiting GB. Neither of those is really an accomplishment. I just finished watching her speach. It was about as close to groveling and admitting we were wrong about the whole Iraqi mess as any Bush administration official has come. \n \n You seem to jump the gun on these things (short attention span?). Thus far, the woman has accomplished nothing at all. We will have to wait and see how she does. Giving a speach, fliying theough the middle east, and getting a warm reception in GB (which is not at all unusual for an Americna politician.....GB engaged in teh same Iraqi folly that we did) are not acomplishments.",

   "That's some of the most absurd stuff i've ever read. The US doesn't want to deal with Russia? Here's a clue. We did when Reagan was president. They're not a superpower anymore. The US isn't worried about Russia. \n\n \n During the reagan administration we never \"dealt\" with russia. We had an arms race with russia, and won. Yipee. We also engaged in a policy of MAD, an apt acronym if ever one existed. Whay we are talking abotu in this case is a clash between conventional forces. I will tell you a secret, our conventional forces are good, but not great, and a conventional clash over the israeli/palestenian conflict is unthinkable. Loook at what we have already spent on our crusade in Iraq, then imagine that instead of a conscript military using 20 yr old weapons, we were facing the Russian military, which has modern weapons and well trained troops. We could not afford such an engagement. The last time the russians threated military action regarding israel was during the 6 day war when they threatened to attack if the US did not cease supply drops to israel. We stopped the same day. It is simply not worth it to the us to enter into a war, even a small one, with the russians over israel. The russain economy is in such a postion that a war would actually be benificial to them. They have large amounts of military related excess manufaturing capability sitting idle. the Us does not. A war with a well armed, well trained opponent would be a major financil hit to us. Wven the war in Iraq, against a poorly armed and virtually untrained opponent has been a major finacnial hit.\n \n \nAs for Israel's \"childish\" games, that's also so specious it doesn't deserve a response. No facts huh? \n \n \n Of the last 12 cease fire agreements, israel has broken 11. For years the israelis have demanded a halt to terrorist attacks while simultaneously (usually the same week) engaging in antagonistic activities. the most recent example of this is their most recent calls for a cease fire which coincided TO THE DAY with their announcement that they planned to bulldoze 200 more palestenian homes for their new \"security zone\". They palyed this same stupid gema with Arafat. They would insist that he stop attacks, then issua mandates that palestenian police not carry rifles. They would call for a cease fire and promise peace, then launch that same week an assasination campaign against prominent palestenian clerics. \n \n These are stupid israeli games. My personal take on this is that the israelis want to avoid peace at all costs. Currently, israel is a nation lacking natural resources, lacking industrial infrastructure, and nobody on the planet besides the US is willing to do business with them (you would have to be cracked as a businessman to want to deal with the israelis). Currently , israels biggest source of income is US aid. While US politicians can justify sending a nation in the grips of a civil war a sack of gold every time they get into financial trouble, they cannot justify just sending a sack of gold routinely during peace time. US aid to israel has always been scheduled to diminish with the cessation of hostilities. Such a decrease would be disasterous to the israelis. \n \n \nPalestinians are finally realizing that it's not about land for peace; it's about peace for peace. They may just be getting it.\n\n \n The odds of seeing a total cessation from the palestenian terrorists in orur lifetime is nul. The israelis have outkilled the palestenians nearly 10,000 to one. They have on more than one occasion killed over 30,000 civilians in one night (Ariel Sharon personally supervised at least one such slaughter during his stint in the military). You do not just forgive something like that and move on. When you consider the border restrictions that israel is talking about, plus the hard feelings that are going to be prevelant in the palestenians for at least the next generation, there is no real possiblity of a full cease frie from the palestenian front. \n \n If you engage in war crimes and take genocidal steps against a population, theya re not just going to forgwet about it overnight. The israelis ar still suing people over war crimes committed during WWII. the last time Israel committed a major war crime was last week.",

   "As your average, ignorant but opinionated American, I am not surprised...........\n\n \n You should really work on your self esteem. :p \n \n This may give you some idea of the history of the problem, and who actually started it.\n \n \nPalestinian and Arab spokesmen commonly claim that the recent Palestinian terrorism is the result of the Israeli 'occupation' of the West Bank and Gaza, adding that the violence will cease only when the 'occupation' is ended. \n \n Despite this claim, it should be recalled that the many Palestinian and Arab rejectionist factions (such as the Hamas and the Hizbullah) repeatedly declare that even if Israel would fully withdraw from the territories they will continue their attacks, since they refute Israel's basic right to exist. \n \n More importantly, however, the basic premise of the Palestinian claim - that the 'occupation' causes terrorism - is historically flawed. Arab and Palestinian terrorism against Israel existed prior to the beginning of Israeli control over the West Bank and Gaza as a result of the Six Day War of June 1967, and even prior to the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948. \n \n For example, Arab terrorism was rampant during wave of anti-Jewish riots in 1920-21 (which was characterized by the brutal murder in Jaffa of the prominent Jewish author Y. Brenner), during the 'Disturbances' of 1929 (which included the massacre of the Jewish community in Hebron), during the Arab Revolt of 1936-39, and in many other recorded incidents of wholesale anti-Jewish Arab violence throughout the pre-state period. \n \n The Palestinian terrorism campaign was stepped-up on the eve of the UN Partition Resolution of November 1947, and led to the joint Arab invasion of 1948-49 which delineated the boundaries of the newly established State of Israel. \n \n Indeed, this deplorable violence can be traced back to the beginning of the renewed Jewish settlement of the Land of Israel over a century ago. \n \n After the War of Independence, Arab terrorism expanded in scope. In 1952, when 'fedayeen' terrorist border incursions reached their height, there were about 3,000 incidents of cross-border violence, extending from the malicious destruction of property to the brutal murder of civilians. In the years 1951-1955, 503 Israelis were killed by Arab terrorists infiltrating from Jordan, 358 were killed in attacks from Egypt, and 61 were killed in attacks originating from Syria and Lebanon. This anti-Israeli violence encompassed both frontier settlements and population centers, and was perpetrated, for the most part, against innocent civilians, most of them new immigrants. \n \n In conclusion, the oft-repeated Arab claim that the Israeli 'occupation' is somehow to blame for the Palestinian terrorism is nothing more than an empty retort, repudiated by the facts, and disproved by a century of historical reality. \n\n \n If I go to an Israel - hate site, (\"If Americans Knew\") I see the claim that 3576 Palastinians were killed since Sept. 2000 by Israel, while 1042 Israelis were killed by terrorists. Roughly 3 to 1 - a lot less dramatic than your numbers. \n \n That's the problem with \"numbers\". The vast internet of today can provide just about anyone some numbers to prove their argument. Sources really should be questioned, in spite of the predictable cries from the three-word-phrase users of \"poisoning the wells\".\n \n Can you name your source for the 47,000 figure? I'd like to take a look. Can you refute the history quoted above? I'd like to see that source too.",

The problem is that your numbers are bad if ytou are trying to use them as overall casualty numbers. We are talking about a conflict that has been going on for 50 years and you show up with numbers for the last 5. The violence has been greatly reduced in the last 10 years or so. Partly becuase the israelis wiped out so many palestnians that they are short of fighters, and partly becuase when the israelis started counting single engagement death tolls in the tens of thousands, even the US put some pressure on them to back off. \n \n According to Eckhardt, 50,000 civilians were killed just during the israeli/Egyptian war.\n \n \n We have been conditioned to think fo the israelis as the good guys since they are our allies. If you do even minimla research into the subject you quickly find that the israelis are far more bloodthirsty than the palestenians, they are in violation of more UN resolutions than saddam ever was, and they are the only country in the ME that we know for sure has WMDs.

   "Legal and Political Status:\n \n Arab Israelis are citizens of the Israel with equal rights. In 1948, Israel's Declaration of Independence called upon the Arab inhabitants of Israel to \"participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions\". \n \n The political involvement of the Arab sector is manifested through both national and municipal elections. Arab citizens run the political and administrative affairs of their own municipalities and advance Arab interests through their elected representatives in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. Arab Israelis have also held various government positions, including that of deputy minister. At present a member of the Druze community is serving as a government minister.\n \n The Declaration also promises that Israel will \"ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex\" and guarantees \"freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture\". \n \n Israel has extensive anti-discrimination laws. Moreover, since the founding of the State, the status of Arab Israeli women has been significantly improved by legislation stipulating equal rights for women and prohibition of polygamy and child marriage. Israel remains one of the few countries in the Middle East where women enjoy equality in rights and personal freedoms, including the right to vote and be elected to local and national office.\n \n The only legal distinction between Arab and Jewish citizens is not one of rights, but rather of civic duty. Since Israel's establishment, Arab citizens have been exempted from compulsory service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). This exemption was made out of consideration for their family, religious and cultural affiliations with the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world, given the on-going conflict. Still, volunteer military service is encouraged and IDF service was made mandatory for Druze and Circassian men at the request of their community leaders. \n \n So much for your attempt to lie about all Pals being refugees.",

Especially one with the comparatively small population of Israel and dependent on our aid for economic survival? The Sauds are certainly more self-supporting and service our ME oil needs.

   "Exactly how does $2 billion a year compensate for wars with egypt? that's one of the most clueless statements i've ever heard.\n\n \n Egypt lost an estimated $30 billion in the war with israel (since israeli forces targeted primarily high value industrila targets). The US effectively paid that bill in order to keep egypt from counter attacking, which would have been disasterout to israel following the 6 day war since the russians had already threatened to become directly involved if the US did not stop supply drops, and the US was not about to risk open war with the USSR over a little spot in teh desert like israel.\n \n Since then, we have paid egypt billions in friendship money. Its only real purpose being to keep egypt from becoming involved in the israeli situation. \n \n \nyou've been exposed. you may wish to retreat now. it's clear where you senitments lay (or lie which may be more appropo).\n\n \n You have yet to do anything here but express your ignorance of the entire situation. Your entire argument is based on emotion and sorely lacking in knowledge or facts.\n \n \nIf you don't know why the US needs Israel then some research might be in order. If your bound to trust the Saudis, then we see where your allegiance is\n\n \n So why don't you tell us why the US needs israel (this shouldbe amusing). I would imagine you are going to make some idiotic statement about military basing. We don't maintain military bases in israel because they are not big enough to support even a moderate sized base. They lack the infrastructure, nor do they have sufficient port facilites (and we would prefer not to expend 100 billion building them). \n \n So, what exactly do we need isreal for, besides using them occasionally as a tool to attack other nations without showing direct involvement? Now that it seems we can no longer use israel to this end (since it appears the international community is no longer going to allow us to get away with it), why should we not discard them like an empty pop bottle? Pull economic aid and let them wither and die. I see no need to continually supprot a nation athat cannot survive on its own.",
