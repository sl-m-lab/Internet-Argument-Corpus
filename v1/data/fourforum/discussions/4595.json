   "According to the State Department's annual drug-trafficking report, a federal law took effect in 1985 authorizing the United States to penalize countries that do not control illicit narcotics production. Today, these same countries are now producing larger quantities of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and other drugs, Furthermore, three years after installing a pro-U.S. government, Afghanistan has been unable to contain opium poppy production and is on the verge of becoming a narcotics state. Opium poppy is the raw material for heroin. Colombia is the source of more than 90 percent of the cocaine and 50 percent of the heroin entering the United States. The report also listed Mexico as a major producer of heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana destined for U.S. markets. Source: New York Times and Associated Press.\n \n Some would argue that the only solution would be the legalization of drugs. By removing the criminality of drug sales, possession and usage, the United States government could devote more of its law enforcement resources on other crimes such as murder, rape, assault etc. Furthermore, they argue that regulation of such drugs could create a revenue enhancement for federal, state and local governments. The counter argument suggests that by legalizing drugs, the government grants an implicit consent that drug consumption is morally acceptable. Others argue that the U.S. should focus more on the demand side of the problem by increasing funds for psychiatric and psychological counseling. Their argument is based on the idea that if the individual is properly counseled and medicated, the demand for illegal narcotics would drop significantly. The counter argument is that this solution is cost prohibitive and will only result in replacing one problem with another. Still others offer a more hard-line approach when it comes to dealing with foreign countries such as setting a deadline for the removal of narcotics production. If the deadline passes, the U.S. should utilize various crop-field-burning methods so as to totally obliterate any type of crop production. This would effectively eliminate the central piece of drug production across the planet. The counter argument, however, is that this policy would prevent farmers from switching to other crops in order to earn a legitimate living. I believe that the problem of illegal narcotics in the United States poses a greater threat to the average citizen than any terrorist and/or nuclear threat in existence today. Perhaps a balanced integration of all three of these solutions is our only answer.",

   "Hey Joe, welcome. \n \n How far are you willing to compromise on illicit drugs? Say you are a pharmacist in this new atmosphere that condones and allows hard drugs. It is your mandate to dispense with them to customers. I come in and we exchange pleasantries, since I'm dating your daughter. I ask for a couple doobies, some meth and a date rape pill. Are you okay with this?",

   "You know being 18 and living just 50 miles outside the third largest city in the United States...I've seen a lot of drugs go around. I personally stay away from them, but some of my classmates are caught up in some very crazy stuff. I would just have to make one to two phone calls and I can get anything from Alcohol, Marijuana, Cocaine, Ex, Speed, Heroin, and PcP....probably within 1 day too.....pretty sad......but the kids I've talked to that say they do it are just like it's awesome, it takes you away form everything.....\n \n With divorce and screwed up home lifes its no wonder so many people get caught up in crazy stuff. Relationships that fail, and financial struggles don't ease the burden either. I think the best way to fight drug use is to restore people's lives and heal the psychological damage and scars. Otherwise it is futile to stop drug dealers and country's producing drugs, because where there is a will there is a way, and the crack head I know would probably resort to a meth lab in his basement just to get his high before he quit. \n \n I think if you hit the problem at the core, that being the person him/herself, then you will achieve something. Once you address that then you tackle the drug empire. I don't know that's just my thoughts...",
