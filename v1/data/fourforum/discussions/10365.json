   "- i take it you haven't read the book?\n\n \n I've read Behe's arguments. As a biochemist, I don't take them seriously. His understanding of the applications of probability theory is poor at best, and outright wrong at worst. Creationists misuse probability theory routinely.\n \n \nI think you are doing yourself a disservice by by such silly claims. If random mutations are \"random\" don't you agree that the probablity of 2 mutations happening on the same gene at the same time is pretty low? And that 2 mutations happening on the same gene at different times is lower than one mutation on the gene?\n\n \n The probability of any point mutation is low, whether it's random or not. For example, the probability of a point mutation resulting from errors in DNA replication in eukaryotes is usually about 1 in a billion base pairs replicated. There are, of course, other sources of point mutations besides errors during replication. There are also many additional sources of change in DNA sequence during replication: recombination, duplication, deletion, frame shift, chromosomal fusion or fission etc., etc. So every new organism will contain several alterations in its DNA sequence possessed by neither parent. Maybe they are random, maybe they aren't, but they are always there. The individual probability of any particular change may be low, but the probability that there will be change is very high.\n \n Second, as I pointed out, the probability of mutation is cumulative. Although the probability of a series of mutations in a single gene is progressively lower the more there are, there is no reason to assume, as Behe does in his simplistic probability estimates, that these all have to occur simultaneously -- this is why I call Behe's understanding of probability theory as applied to evolution terminally flawed. They can follow one after another from generation to generation. There are several examples of this in the microbial literature, where a sequence of improbable mutations can e fixed in a relatively few generations because of the sheer number of opportunities involved.\n \n Bear in mind also that the majority of the genome of current eukaryotes was established close to its present state when they were single celled organisms or simple metazoa, with a short generation span and many progeny. Even if you could calculate probabilities accurately -- and you can't -- you have to figure in the number of opportunities to try them out. Even the most improbable mutational event becomes inevitable if you wait long enough, or have enough organisms in which it can occur.\n \n \nI don't agree with this either/or binary logic.\n\n \n Well, whatever. Behe and his buddies misuse probability in their arguments, which fall flat as a result. If someone wishes to make the claim that mutations are directed as opposed to random, then it behoves them to demonstrate a mechanism for the directionality. Mere appeal to miscalculated probabilities is insufficient.",

And that 2 mutations happening on the same gene at different times is lower than one mutation on the gene?\n\n \n Your reasoning would be applicable if only one copy of the gene in question ever existed.\n \n If the chance of mutation A happening is one in a billion, and the chance of mutation B happening is also one in a billion, then the chance of them both happening together to a single gene is, as you say, beyond the realms of possibility at 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.\n \n However, we're not talking about a single gene. A population of a billion bacteria is nothing unusual, and all of them will contain the same gene. So while the odds of any individual experiencing mutation A are very low, the odds of one of them experiencing it are pretty high. The lottery works on the same principle. You probably won't win, but someone probably will.\n \n Ok, so now we have our billion bacteria, one of which possesses mutation A. However, the odds of mutation B stacking with it are still only 1 in 1,000,000,000.\n \n If mutation A isn't particularly helpful, that's probably the end of the story. But if mutation A is helpful, then that bacterium will outcompete its peers for resources, and breed more readily than they do - either better in absolute terms, or better in immediate proximity, when in competition for the same resources. Either way, the proportion of the population possessing mutation A will increase until they predominate. Now there isn't just one copy of the A-mutant gene in circulation, there are about a billion, and the odds of mutation B stacking with just one of them are greatly improved. Once again, if mutation B is helpful the descendents of that bacterium will flourish and overrun the population, so that in a relatively short time (a few hundred bacterial generations) a single cell possessing neither mutation can give rise to a population of a billion all possessing not one but two billion-to-one mutations - a population ready for the next billion-to-one mutation to occur, and stack, and flourish, and so on.\n \n So how rapidly does this occur? Well, with bacteria able to reproduce around 2000 times in a month, let's be really conservative and postulate two helpful billion-to-one chance mutations per month, with 1000 generations for them to flourish betweentimes. That's in one tiny bacterial population of 1,000,000,000 cells. To put that into perspective, there are around 1,000,000,000,000,000 bacteria - a million times as many - in your body alone.\n \n And over what period of time are we talking about evolution having occurred? Try two billion years prior to the first multicellular creatures, with frankly incalculable numbers of bacteria applied to the problem. If one person-full of bacteria can come up with billion-to-one helpful mutations at a rate of 2,000,000 per month, how many billion-to-one helpful mutations could accumulate over an entire planet in the course of 2,000,000,000 years?\n \n I hope that helps :)",

It only takes 30 generations (2^30) to get 1,073,741,824 or ~1 billion progeny, all with mutation A. If the chances for mutation B are 1 in a billion, then one of those billion progeny with mutation A will also have mutation B, and then if A+B are truly advantageous, natural selection can really take over.\n \n Even if mutation A is somewhat deleterious, that does not mean it will be instantly wiped from the population (that would only happen if it were lethal). It might persist and find conditions where it could still multiply without too much competition from wild type. And even if mutation A by itself were lethal, all you would have to do is reverse the order of mutations. If all the mutations individually were lethal, then you would be up against a probability hurdle, but then that doesn't mean one can't have auxiliary mutations that would prevent the significant ones from being lethal.\n \n To claim as Behe does that the chances of getting 2+ favourable mutations in one gene are so astronomical as to be physically impossible is simply ignorance.

   "Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. \n\n \n Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory.\n \n \nThis is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state. \n\n \n As others have pointed out, large, visible phenotypic changes can arise from comparatively minor genetic/epigenetic differences in macro creatures like apes and humans. Consider a cell to be a housebrick. Modify a brick and you end up with something that's still, essentially, a brick - but modify the instructions for how many of them you stack up and you can turn a house into a skyscraper.\n \n Macro creatures also have a number of evolutionary avenues available to them that are denied to bacteria, which help offset the numerical and reproductive advantage bacteria have. Sexual reproduction provides the opportunity for frequent recombination of genes and phenotypes (a source of variation) and gives rise to sexual selection. Consider how vigorously males compete for a harem of females in the animal kingdom: that genetic bottlenecking is a much more efficient way of finding 'good' gene combinations than the bacterialogical method of everyone breeding and fighting for resources at once.\n \n \nIMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes.\n\n \n Unfortunately not, and I'll try to explain why.\n \n To calculate such a probability, you would need to calculate how long it 'should' take RM to induce that many mutations, and compare that with, say, the fossil record or other dating methods, yes? If the number you came up with was far too big, you could eliminate RM.\n \n However, it's not possible to calculate how long RM 'should' have taken - and here's why:\n \n If you take sections of 'junk' DNA from two species and compare them, you can count the differences and use observed rates of random mutation to estimate how long it was since they shared the same section of DNA - which is probably about how long it's been since they were the same species. You can then check that against the fossil record and see - as we invariably do - yep, that matches up.\n \n The trouble is, that technique only works for junk DNA that doesn't help or hinder the organism. \n \n Let's go back to my bacterial example and think about what's going on there. For the sake of argument, let's say those bacteria experience a mutation - any old mutation - at a rate of one per generation, and that half of their DNA is junk. If we compare the junk DNA from the single cell in the first generation to one of the cells in the 300th, we would probably see about 150 differences. With me so far? 300 generations seperate the two, half the mutations happening to the junk DNA.\n \n Ok, now we can hand our data to another scientist who works backwards: 150 random mutations in half the genome means around 300 in the whole genome. He measures the rate of random mutation (1 per generation), and estimates that the two samples we've given him are 300 generations apart.\n \n So far, so good: he's been able to correctly deduce the generation gap between two genomes.\n \n So now we ask our pet scientist to calculate whether RM was responsible for the helpful mutations that distinguish our first and 300th generation bacteria.\n \n Assuming he can actually determine which alterations to the genes are the helpful ones, he's looking at two billion-to-one events which he knows have happened in just 300 generations. Now we know, from observing the experiment, that RM was responsible, but the scientist cannot calculate how likely that is, because he doesn't know what the population sizes were The chances of two billion-to-one events stacking purely at random if the population was just 10 are absurdly small. The chances, if the population was a billion, are very good indeed.\n \n So what's missing from your list of information:\n \n \n1) the difference between human and ape genome, how many point mutations etc. that make up the difference.\n 2) the mutation frequency of primates\n 3) the time period when homo sapiens that it took to develop from the \"Ur monkey\"\n\n \n is a population graph spanning the last twenty million years or so. Without that, calculations of how likely RM was to be responsible for the genetic changes are impossible. Anyone who claims otherwise really doesn't know what he or she is talking about, and certainly shouldn't be writing books on the subject.",

Much of the difference between chimps and man are likely to be due to rearrangements of genes and alteration of master genes than to simple point mutations. After all we do know that so far as genes alone go the match is between 95 and 99%. If you take 30,000 genes as the approximate number in both species then you have about 1,500 alterations to come up with. If chimps and man sepearted about 5 million years ago and a generation is say 20 years (thats long) then there have been 5,000,000/20 or 25,000 generations. That means 1,500 genes/ 25,000 generations of less than 1 gene per 10 generations or mutating and fixing 1 gene per 200 years. Somehow that seems fairly reasonable to me. Now there are 30,000 genes which are subject to possible mutation that would mean for an individual the odds of mutating one gene would be something like 30,000 per billion or one in 300,000. Those are not terrible odds are they if there were 30,000 ancestors in the population then for any generation the odds of a mutation would be about 1 in 10 generations.

In pondering human origins, Dominy said, anthropologists have long been stumped by the sudden, nearly simultaneous increases in our brain size, body size, and geographic range, while other apes changed little. Early humans simply must have found some source of better nutrition to make it all possible, they reasoned.\n \n \"That's the big mystery of paleoanthropology,\" Dominy said. \"What changed? Why did our earliest human ancestors deviate from the pattern we see in living apes to evolve this incredibly large brain, which is very energetically expensive to maintain, and to become a much more efficient bipedal organism?\"\n \n For years, the answer was thought to be the growing importance of meat in the diet, as early humans learned to hunt. But, Dominy pointed out, \"Even when you look at modern human hunter-gatherers, meat is a relatively small fraction of their diet. They cooperate with language, use nets; they have poisoned arrows, even, and still it's not that easy to hunt meat. To think that, two to four million years ago, a small-brained, awkwardly bipedal animal could efficiently acquire meat, even by scavenging, just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\" \n \n Some anthropologists have begun to suspect the new source of food consisted of starches, stored by plants in the form of underground tubers and bulbs--wild versions of modern-day foods like carrots, potatoes, and onions. Once early humans learned to recognize tuber-forming plants, they opened up a food source unknown to other apes. \n \n \"It's kind of a goldmine,\" Dominy said. \"All you have to do is dig it up.\"",

After all the hetrozygotes have a mixture of the two types and that results in a MUCH reduced tendency to form dimers or polymers. And of course the heterozygotes DO have a tendency to live while the normals die of malaria. And since evolutionists and other biologists call it evolution you are not exactly free to declare otherwise ya know. As to not seeing a difference between the polygeneic divergence between apes (like the chimp - monkeys are very far back in the tree) and point mutations like sickle cell trait - thats just nuts of course biologists and even those nasty old darwinists see a vast difference.

   "From answers.com Evolution: \"A gradual process in which something changes into a different and usually more complex or better form.\"\n\n \n However, evolution also produces simpler forms (e.g. parasites), and many examples of evolution don't involve major changes in complexity at all. There is no inexorable drive towards ever-greater complexity. Greater complexity arises because nothing is stopping it.\n \n \nA bacteriae might lose its resistance if it looses exposure to the antibiotica. However i have yet to see evidence of humans reverting to a more apelike state. \n\n \n Odd. I see reversion to ape-like behaviour in humans all the time! As a species, we haven't really evolved all that far away from our origins, more's the pity, though we like to pretend we have. Look, it's naive to compare a single gene reversion in bacteria directly to a more complex system like mammalian development, where many genomic elements are involved. A single gene reversal is not very improbable, but retracing the exact route we took from our common ancestor with the other apes to our present is highly improbable. It's easy enough to build a house brick by brick, but disassembling it the same way is not as easy.\n \n \nHumans are more advanced/intelligent than apes right? We could determine this with say an IQ-test\n\n \n So? We have relatively bigger brains. It would be rather embarrassing if we weren't mentally more capable.\n \n \nThe haemoglobin molecule has lost much of its effect, so it's obviously worse than it's normal state, on the other hand this might be useful for the organism as a whole.

I am always surprised that \"neodarwinists\" see no qualitative difference between a point mutation leading to a sickle H. and the transition from monkey to man. Maybe you are too hung up in the specifics of molecules/genes to see this?\n\n \n First of all, biologists see quantitative differences between single alterations in a gene and the evolution of different developmental pathways that involve multiple genes. To this extent, many small changes add up to a big change. However, they also observe qualitative differences, because differences in developmental pathways owe more to the differential expression of common genes than to single point mutations in individual genes, though obviously both have a role to play. A point mutation in a regulatory gene, for example, can affect more than one developmental pathway. Many genes in development have multiple effects, depending on where, when and to what extent they are expressed.\n \n So no, developmental evolution is not as simple as a single point mutation, but both are new information in the genome that affect how the organism grows and functions.",

When there is no clear pattern to the scatter of mutations detected, then there is no reason to assume it's non-random (it might conceivably be non-random, but if the pattern isn't clear, it wouldn't be recognised as such, anyway).\n \n No scientist has sat down and actually been able to prove that all mutations are random, though their survival through various subsequent selection processes is obviously very much non-random. It's just that there's been no way of proving whether mutations are the result of random or non-random processes, and in most cases they give every indication of being random through the absence of a visible pattern. Natural selection then acts on the variants provided. Unless there's a way of directing mutations specifically towards some parts of the genome, and actively preventing them in others, there's no way of showing that mutations are goal-oriented. Any apparent goal-orientation would then be the appearance after the fact of selection.",
