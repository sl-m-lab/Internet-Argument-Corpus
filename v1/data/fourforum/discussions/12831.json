   "I have never seen better evidence that a good financially competent tyrant is preferable to a bunch of corrupt, inept politicians than the fiscal situation of California.\n It would have been better to have left the Spaniards govern it. A new El Zorro is needed and badly.\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities revealed that 13 states face shortfalls in the next fiscal year and another 11 states expect budget problems within the next two years. For example: Florida is forecasting a $1 billion shortfall, New York is projection a $4 billion deficit, but that pales in comparison to the $14 billion deficit projected in California. But California's problem isn't the lack of income. California State Senator Dick Ackerman said \"Our problem is we've just been spending too much. Our income has gone up every year, but the rate of spending has gone up greater than the income.\" This is probably true with most of the cities, counties, and states facing a budget shortfall.\n \n Since California leads the pack in fiscal mismanagement, it can be used as an example of what not to do. The California voters staged a coup several years ago by recalling the sitting Governor, Gray Davis. Davis had inherited a budget surplus but yielded to a spend-happy legislature and the state began to run up massive deficits. As a result, Davis was dumped and Arnold Schwarzenegger (the Governator) was elected to restore fiscal discipline to the state.\n \n But replacing the governor did not replace all the spend-happy legislators.\n \n Shortly after taking office, Schwarzenegger proposed several ballot propositions to solve the fiscal crisis. One was a Constitutional Amendment to limit spending and another was a Constitutional Amendment to control the budget. Unfortunately the politicians, bureaucrats, and unions spent millions to defeat the measures.\n \n Why would anyone oppose fiscal stability? The answer is simple. The proposed spending cuts would cut off the pork and these special interest groups would no longer be able to feed at the public trough. When the votes were counted, the special interest money defeated fiscal sanity. After the humiliating defeat, the Governator was reduced to a political 'girlie man' and began to sign the budget busting spending legislation. As a candidate Schwarzenegger promised to make government more efficient, but in reality the General Fund spending has increased 44% since he took over.\n \n Currently California is spending $400 million to $600 million more each month than it is collecting in revenues. Most families would recognize this as a problem, but big spending politicians are oblivious to such trivia. But Schwarzenegger woke-up from his 'girlie man' slumber and signaled - the Governator was back.\n \n Governor Schwarzenegger said: \"We do not have a revenue problem; we have a spending problem.\" To address the chronic boom-and-bust budget cycle and spending problem he proposed the 'Budget Stabilization Act' as a long term solution; and massive cuts to reduce the deficit as a short term solution. But on cue, the politicians, bureaucrats, and unions opposed the cuts spending and efforts that would restore California to a sound fiscal footing. For these big spending politicians, cutting spending is like sunlight to a vampire.\n \n [Gov. Schwarzenegger Proposes Budget, Declares Fiscal Emergency]\n \n This political melodrama wouldn't be complete without an ironic twist. The same politicians that spent California into debt now want to modify the existing term limits requirement with Proposition 93. This clever sleight of hand proposition would nullify the existing term limit requirement and allow these irresponsible politicians to remain in office for several more years. The justification for this charade is that if the proposition isn't passed California would 'lose' all that experience. Remember, these are the same clowns that created the $14 billion deficit. California can not afford that kind of experience.\n \n But California isn't unique. Fiscal irresponsibility is an affliction that has infected most Progressive politicians. Spending someone else's money and living the high life of a political big shot gives them a feeling of entitlement.\n \n Taxpayers need to pay attention to California and make sure that your state doesn't follow the same path.\n \n judythpiazza@newsblaze.com",

   "THE first patient Dr Sherwin Nuland ever treated died horribly in front of him. James McCarty, a 52-year-old construction boss, had eaten too much red meat, smoked too many Camels and suffered a heart attack. Dr Nuland, then but a student, was asked to keep an eye on him while he recuperated. Suddenly, McCarty threw his head back, bellowed out a wordless roar and hit his own chest with balled fists. His face turned purple, his eyes bulged out of his head, he took &#8220;an immensely long gurgling breath&#8221;&#8212;and he died. Since this was half a century ago, Dr Nuland did what the textbooks then recommended. He cut open his patient&#8217;s chest and tried, unsuccessfully, to massage his heart back to life with his bare hands. It felt like &#8220;a wet, jellylike bag of hyperactive worms&#8221;. And it did no good. The &#8220;dead McCarty&#8230; threw back his head once more [and gave] a dreadful rasping whoop that sounded like the hounds of hell were barking.&#8221;\n \n That story is one of several that make up &#8220;How We Die&#8221;, a book Dr Nuland wrote in 1993, after a lifetime of watching the effects of terminal illness. Because modern life is so clean and orderly, he argued, people expect to die with dignity. But this may be wishful thinking: death can be dirty, ugly and often involves the &#8220;disintegration of the dying person&#8217;s humanity&#8221;. Despite its gloominess, &#8220;How We Die&#8221; was a huge success, because it addressed with excruciating honesty mankind&#8217;s greatest fear. \n \n \n \n The current debate about health-care reform is in part a debate about death, which is why it evokes such fear. Some of this fear is absurd. Outside a town-hall meeting in Reston, Virginia, last week, a few buffoons likened Barack Obama to Hitler. But most of the protesters are sane. Mr Obama plans to cover millions of uninsured people, says Brittany Tomaino, a young would-be oncologist. He will have to find the money somewhere. That means cuts to Medicare, the government health plan for the elderly, which covers her 95-year-old grandfather, she reckons. &#8220;If he needs care, they&#8217;re going to give it to someone younger,&#8221; she predicts. \n \n A slim majority of Americans support Obamacare. But that majority is declining, and the passion is mostly on the other side. Pro-lifers, for example, worry that reform will mean taxpayer-funded abortions. Half of all Americans believe this will happen. Democrats point out that the bills in question do not mention abortion. Pro-lifers respond that the language is vague enough to allow bureaucrats to add abortion funding after the bill is passed. They also fret, like Ms Tomaino, that Mr Obama will deny life-saving treatment to Grandpa to save money. This possibility alarms Grandpa, too. Americans over 65 currently receive, through Medicare, fantastically generous health insurance for which they pay only a small fraction of the cost. Only 23% of them think Obamacare will make them better off, while a growing plurality think it will hurt them. \n \n Health reformers always smash up against two unpalatable truths. We are all going to die. And the demand for interventions that might postpone that day far outstrips the supply. No politician would be caught dead admitting this, of course: most promise that all will receive whatever is medically necessary. But what does that mean? Should doctors seek to save the largest number of lives, or the largest number of years of life? Even in America, resources are finite. No one doubts that $1,000 to save the life of a child is money well spent. But what about $1m to prolong a terminally ill patient&#8217;s painful life by a week? Also, who should pay?\n There are no easy answers. Unfortunately for Mr Obama, some of his academic chums have pondered seriously and publicly about the questions. Cass Sunstein, an adviser, has written extensively about which life-saving rules are most cost-effective. Ezekiel Emanuel, a doctor whose brother is Mr Obama&#8217;s chief of staff, wrote a paper for the Lancet, a medical journal, in which he proposed a system for determining who should be first in line for such things as liver transplants or vaccines during an epidemic. Among other factors, he suggested taking age into account, with adolescents and young adults getting priority, because they have fully developed personalities and many years of life ahead. This may be philosophically defensible, but it is political poison&#8212;Dr Emanuel even included a graph showing voters above and below the ideal age how much less their lives are worth. Conservative talk radio predictably dubbed him &#8220;Dr Death&#8221;. Republicans vowed last week to outlaw the rationing of care by age. \n Blithe and distrustful\n \n Mr Obama&#8217;s supporters say that objections to his reforms are largely based on misunderstanding, fuelled by Republican scaremongering. They have a point. But the Democrats&#8217; bigger problem is that most Americans have pretty good health insurance and no idea how much it costs. Taxpayers foot the bill for the old. Most workers with employer-provided health insurance imagine that their employer is paying for it, when in fact it comes out of their wages. Soaring medical inflation depresses Americans&#8217; standard of living and threatens to bust the budget. The system is riddled with waste. Yet most Americans feel little urge to make it more efficient. When asked if insurance firms should be obliged to pay for expensive treatments that have not been proved more effective than a cheaper alternative, 56% say yes. \n \n Few Americans have a clear idea how Obamacare will affect them&#8212;unsurprisingly, since even quite basic details are undecided. The uninsured have the most to gain, but they are only 15% of the population. Everyone else has something to lose. \n Many Americans do not trust the government to do anything much, let alone make decisions about life and death. Small wonder Mr Obama finds the headwind against health reform so blustery.\n \n \n \n http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14363134",

   "I weigh out any number of factors when choosing fruits and vegetables. If something is better quality, less expensive AND organic, I will pick the organic. \n \n A new factor coming into play which weighs heavily on my list of shopping priorities when I choose fruits and vegetables is the business itself. For example, at present, there is a boycott of Whole Foods because the head guy (whose name escapes me) is opposing Obama's health care reform (among other disreputable business practices he's been engaged in). Single payer? Forget that.\n \n His employees have a terrible health plan, but he's signed on the dotted line (and sold them out) to the health insurance industry. Who cares if they can't even cover the cost of their deductibles on those salaries?\n \n In some cases, it's best to just scrub, scrub, scrub the tomAtoe.\n\n \n \n A slim majority of Americans support Obamacare. But that majority is declining, so soon you will belong to a minority.\n \n Organic food here in Australia is at least twice the price of the 'non-organic' variety. As I said food snobbery suits the rich.",

   "There are a constellation of issues in the U.S. contributing to the weight problem, including increasing rates of obesity among children as well as increasing rates of childhood diabetes. For example, we consume enormous amount of sugar in our foods (read your supermarket labels), there is not nearly enough quality fresh fruits and vegetables in many communities, we have high degrees of cholesterol in our diets. We have a schizophrenic relationship with items like alchohol, either irrationally shunning it altogether, or downing six-packs instead of a glass of non-fat milk or a half-glass of wine (which helps cuts cholesterol - as the French know when they nibble fatty cheese, yet stay slim). Meanwhile, there are entire supermarket aisles devoted only to sodas (read the sugar on those).\n \n There's a large supermarket I shop at that has excellent fruits and vegetables. Yet I can't tell you how many times any one of their numerous employees has quietly inquired, while ringing my items out, what the names of various fruits and vegetables are. And then, how do I prepare them.\n \n Many Americans are simply uninformed about these items, loaded with nutrition, which should represent about 9 servings per day (not 5) in a given individual's diet. \n \n We adapt to the foods we eat. If you start eating better, you may feel deprived at first, but you will eventually develop a keener sense of food quality, eventually finding other things that used to entice you, well, repugnant even.\n\n \n According to a recent article I read, the main reason for obesity in the USA is the increase of the size of food serves at restaurants and take-away food shops.\n When I was in New York City, a few years back, I remember that I ordered once a ham sandwich, it didn't have one layer of ham as in Australia but several layers, it was food obscenity. It was gross, I had to throw out most of the ham in order to eat it. I just can't understand America, I have visited many countries, in spite of differences I still felt I was on planet Earth.

Only America is another planet.\n\n \n At this point in life, and with restaurants the way they are tending, I prefer my own food preparations, rather than eating out. Usually I can make something much better, and for less. There are good places, but I save it for when they can make something you can't, you're on the road, or they just cook well. One has to know where to look though.\n \n Next time you're in the Big Apple and want a ham sandwich, I'd recommend trying one of the small Cuban spots in Spanish Harlem. Or a few of the more distinctly known family-run Italian-American delis.\n \n New York has some wonderful Jewish delis, too.\n \n But if you don't know, you can wind up poisoned, not to mention health violations.",
