   "The Tao that is spoken of or writen of is not the true Tao for a reason.\n \n Very good now you must meditate. The only course of action for you is non action. One may only progress through the act of nonthought. If you have tried meditation and it has failed you we may discuss the nature of God. If you have not do not attack me for what I say. All that I know to be true is based on meditation. That is non thought.\n \n You see thought and non thought are oppiste. They each make up half of the mind. It is quite posible we have distroyed our environment and created endless wars because we as western peoples have not stayed true to the nature of ourselves. Is it that hard to believe we can not name God? We may not see God. We may not rationalise God into exsitance through the being of the writen word. I have come to know god and peace through meditation. Devision is an illusion. So is anger. We are all parts of the living whole. Indivisible manifestaions of the living force I call it Tao you may call it God or natural processes. These are just words. The meaning is the same.\n \n Now you may debate the nature of nonthought. Now you may debate the nature of meditation. I would be meditating now if it was not my firm bielief that we as one people must recognise the unity in all things and distroy the illusion of division inorder to give a world to our childern. I am driven by the firm belief that western thought and eastern thought exsist to compliment each other. This is known a balance. It is arogance that started the opium wars. It is a fact that the chinese teach to thier childeren the western people sold drugs and invaded thier advanced nation. \n \n Bill Clinton did sail a Aircraft battle group down the taiwan strait. Nt korea is close to war. Is is that hard to see what drives us to distroy each other is the way we think. Is it that hard to believe there may be good people in China.\n \n Now you must stop thinking and now you must start meditating. Non thought is the key to balance. \n \n Fear leads to hatred, hatred leads to anger, Anger leads to Violence and Violence leads to suffering. Meditate the future of the world depends on it.\n \n I am a western person who lives in the east. Iam here because of the actions of the USA. I only speak english now because the USA protected Australia. So mabe I am here to say there is another way. We need not repeat the mistakes of the past. You see everything in the world is born of the mind. I pray we distroy the illusion of devision. I pray we distroy the illusion of hatred thier is still time. May God be with us all.",
