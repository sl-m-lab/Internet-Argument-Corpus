   "Soccer is huge where I live in the midwest U.S. It has grown in popularity tremendously in the past twenty years. We now have 54 dedicated soccer fields on park district property alone. I can witness as to the popularity here because the industrial park I work in also hosts the first of the large area soccer complexes. Many a time I have battled incoming weekend tournament traffic leaving work on summertime fridays. Is it to much to ask for mini-van people to get the hell out of my way so I can get myself to a cold beer??? I think not.\n \n Soccer is also has been a high school sport in the state of Illinois as well for a good many years.\n \n Daewoo is right in that back in our days of our youth soccer was nearly non-existant in the U.S. We learned to play it in school gym class for a week or so and that was the end of it. Dribbling the soccer ball around some orange cones on a blacktop playground is the way I remember the instruction -- NOT a hell-of-a lotta fun...unless one purposly knocks down every friggin' cone to get a laugh from one's fellow students. :p \n \n Anyhoo, good luck to the team from Scotland. \n \n Get drunk?

Then when the drink starts to wear off, usually by Full Time then you get to the closest Pub and that is where the Real fun Starts :)\n \n It will be interesting day I assure you.\n \n Glad to hear that the beautiful game has some admirers among our American Brethren.",

I have no idea if we have either anymore. The only thing KC has in the realm of sports right now are the Royals (Baseball) the Chiefs (American football) and then the various local high school and little league sports and the like.

(I mean I would assume that is why they made such a big deal about the hockey strike.)
