   "I been listening to people attack artists, musicians, actors, and directors about the content of their art. People want them to stop it to get it off the \"air waves\". I agree, allot of what's considered entertainment today is inappropriate for children, but it's not the artists marketing to the children it's the record labels, radio stations, movie studios, and television stations doing the marketing. You see if they didn't market this stuff to children they would make any money. \n \n They know children aren't being monitored correctly and they're taking advantage of this. The artists have no control over who or how their art is being marketed. Hell, most of the time they don't even own the rights to their own art. It's all done by the record labels, radio stations, movie studios, and television stations. Why doesn't anyone attack them? If we keep letting them get away with it, they won't stop as long as they get their money. \n \n Attacking the artists won't solve anything. If the record labels, radio stations, movie studios, and television stations wanted to market their products responsibility they would, but they don't, because parent keep giving their kids the money to buy inappropriate entertainment. \n \n Jerry Springer didn't make the decision to have his show on 4PM so all the kids can watch a show about transsexual prostitutes with penis enlargement, when that get how from school. The TV station made that decision. Why, because if the kids are watching then they can get the commercials to get more money. \n \n Ludacris doesn't pay MTV to play his video about sex, the record label does. The vast majority of Hip Hop music and videos should only be play at times when children aren't able to view it, but it's not. Why, money. Your money. Record labels, radio stations, movie studios, and television stations don't care about responsibly, because there's no money in it. \n \n Just think about this, the record label that sued that 13 yr girl were the ones who marked that music to her, and I have a good feeling that music wasn't appropriate for her age.",

   "Recording artists are also resposible for what comes out of their mouths. The industry is driven by the executives, that is true, but the artists should also stand up and say they don't want to make this type of music, but they don't, either. Why? Because they, too are driven by the almighty dollar- $300 bottles of Krystal, the biggest Rims (ugly) on their escalade, women, fur coats... Why would they want to give all that up? Just for something as lousy as... ETHICS??? MORALS??? C'mon, this is America! \n \n BTW, I am not familiar with the lawsuit you mentioned",

   "...but would you be happy about helping to market that rude, crude disrespecter of women, Andrew Dice Clay? Is money the only concern of the entertainment industry?\n\n sadly, money is the only concern of probably 99% of all business. in fact, if there was a strong enough ethical influence among consumers that it would affect profit, then of course they would adjust their product to suit demand, not because of ethics.\n \n for instance, in NY they banned smoking in all business properties as well as age restrictions and taxes and a number of other deterents to detract people from buying cigarettes. but this was not because smoking kills. its because when smoking kills, the cigarette companies suffer massively from lawsuits. making money is still the main reason for all those actions (or in this case, not losing money)",

   "So what exactly should we complain about more? The fact that indecent entertainment exists or the fact that there is a market for it? The fact that many entertainers choose to be smutty or the fact that those in charge of the industry choose to market smut to kids? The fact that kids have access to the smut or the fact that parents don't prevent that access? The fact that the industry won't police itself or the fact that (up until very recently) the government for the most part had a hands off approach? There are so many ways to go with this and so many seperate discussion threads. I'm sure I haven't exhausted all the possibilities. I have noticed something. I do agree with one post that stated in essence that quality entertainment does exist if you look for it. Still, I have to say that relative to the past, quality is waning and in it's absence the industry chooses to market indecency, smut, obsenity and gratuitous violence. In the end, quality entertainment will outsell indecency.",

   "We have brought this upon ourselves. The general community supports mass consumption of virtually everything... whether it be high quality entertainment, total garbage, or morally objectionable material (to various segments). Try and take it away, and hear us roar!\n \n The classfication and rating system that reviews this material is not meant to be in charge of morals enforcement, it just provides a guide for consumers. If consumers choose to ignore these ratings, or cannot provide adequate supervision for their own children, then surely we can't blame the purveyors of this material.\n \n The real problem is that it is virtually impossible not to offend at least one segment of the community, by giving into the demands of another. We are surrounded by prudes.\n \n I agree with the earlier posts... switch off offensive advertising, don't buy their offensive material, TAKE CONTROL of your own life!",
