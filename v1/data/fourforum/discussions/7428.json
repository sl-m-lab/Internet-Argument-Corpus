   "Dear Readers\n I have been following thi whole Iran thing. I have heard this thing on the radio, the television, and on the computer about the possibility of sanctions on Iran. What are sanctions? What is that to do for that country? I mean is it like going to be, \"Ok Mr. Iran, here are your sanctions\".\n \"Ok, I guess that is the end of my nuclear program.\"\n Come on. What can sanctions do to prevent weapons or whatever the hell they are doing?\n I think I know what it is.\n But, I also heard that they removed all their money from all European banks. So, if it is what I think it is, I don't know.\n Anyway. Please explain. I searched on the internet, and it gave me something other than what I was looking for.\n -John",

So it's not so much the sanctions that cause deaths and/or other problems, but the ruler's unwillingness to relent. Pride kills a lot of people. UN sanctions have to be done, in many cases.",
