The potential of future WMDs?\n\n \n And the big deal about the supposed \"looting\" of explosives (which ABC has now stated did not happen by the way...ouch, that must have killed you, huh?) is....? the future or possible use against our soldiers?\n \n \nWow, what a reason to support it. \n It's not as bad as Vietnam. \n \n \n Not a reason to be against it either\n \n \nYES.\n YES WE ARE. \n YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT THIS.\n When we bomb a suspected insurgent hideout we also take out all the neighboring houses containing innocent men, women, and children. None of them had a gun in their hand nor did they want one. Their surviving relatives might want a few guns after their loved ones are blown away by us. \n \n \n Like the man said, war is hell and unfortunately there will always be people who are innocent victims. The way your side describes it though is like the U.S. is intentionally targeting innocents or ripping babies from the mother's nipple and shooting it..gimmee a break\n \n \nThen when you turn 18, vote for a Republican and enlist in the Marines. Then you'll be able to kill all the 12 year olds that you want.\n\n \n You're gonna sit there and tell us that if you had a 12 year old with a gun wanting to shoot you that you'll just lay down your gun and let him do it then? LOL, you aren't human\n \n \nAnd that's so unlike Bush. emoticon_rolleyes He would never claim that if Kerry were president that we would have more terrorists attacks.\n\n \n Well, his comments are based more on fact and reality than Kerry's. Let's take the draft issue. FACT: Republicans don't want it and in FACT voted down the bill that DEMOCRATS initiated. When Kerry says there WILL be a draft, how does he know this, based on the FACTS? He can't and doesn't. Now, in the case of more terrorist attacks, based on the FACTS of Kerry's position (or lack thereof), he intends to pursue terrorists through the courts. This is a joke and sends that very message to the terrorists, one that wreaks with weakness and will only embolden them to commit more acts of terror. If I'm not mistaken (and I'm sure that you will claim I am no doubt), the terrorists have stated that our weakness is Somalia is what emboldened them to destroy the WTC\n \n \nNeither does Bush. He says everything is going fine. Or at least he admits over and over that \"it's hard work.\"\n\n \n You can't admit that Kerry doesn't have a plan, can you? All you can do is make a negative comment about Bush\n \n \nCould you explain it? Is it \"stay the course\"? That's been working so well.\n\n \n Seems to me that his plan is to have a democracy on either side of Iran (that would be Afghanistan and Iraq) so that the seeds of democracy can spread there so we won't have to kick the S*** out of the Iranians too. That sounds to me like a plan that has some vision to it. Now, Kerry's plan.....? And it IS working well, despite how easily you are lead by the press. Man, no doubt you would have been in the Hitler Youth as well\n \n \nHow will you know unless you try it out? Not much could be worse than the mess Bush has gotten us into.\n\n \n Got news for you, this is gonna get much nastier than you might want to admit. I'm not gonna lie to myself and say that we can totally defeat terrorism. They will hit again and it could be devastating, and we may very well have to turn that God forsaken area to glass. Kerry will not even consider the use of nukes and THAT is scary Ace. Those country could be a smoldering pile and he'll still be be getting indictments...oh yeah, can't get any worse...grow up\n \n And by the way, that 16 year old has a better grasp of reality than you could ever dream of having",

   "I mean COME On people.... what is so wrong with Bush.\n\n \n 1) No accountability\n 2) Extremely irresponsible Fiscal policies\n 3) Abandonment of science as a whole\n 4) Abandonment of discussion and open discourse as a whole\n 5) Flip flopping on virtually every campagin promise he made\n 6) Attacking Enviromental policies such as Superfund\n 7) Underfunding NCLB by $27 billion\n 8) Not vetoing a SINGLE spending bill\n 9) Flip Flopping on his own statements, such as Social Security, where he stated that he would put the SS surplus away, and when he raided over $150 million. \n \n That took less then 30 seconds to come up. \n You should read this to get a better, insider's view on the adminstration. \n \n \nHe supports what he does and even if we didn't find the \"phantom\" WMDs that were supposedly in there, there still was a good reason to go into Iraq.\n\n \n Does he really? \n \n It seems to me, and this site, that Bush flip flops and doesn't support what he says or does. \n \n As for good reason? What would that be? Liberating the Iraqis? Oh wait, Secretary Wolfowitz, in a Vanity Fair article which is posted on the DOD's website says this:\n \n \n\n The third one by itself, as I think I said earlier, is a reason to help the Iraqis but it's not a reason to put American kids' lives at risk, certainly not on the scale we did it\n\n \n \n\n It was a good reason even if there was a small chance there were WMDs there. AND folks ....REALITY CHECK! Iraq isn't as bad as Vietnam.\n\n \n Right. Good = Bad. There are thousands of unguarded Nuclear weapons in Russia. Explain to me how it makes more sense to invade a country we think, based on sketchy, cherry picked evidence, has WMD and not secure Russian nukes we know are there. \n \n \nAND we aren't killing innocent  babies and children and women.\n\n \n On the contrary, this report says we are all too willing\n \n \nRhodes said his sergeant told him to prepare to gun down the man and told another Marine to be ready to shoot the woman and child. As the family moved closer to the fuel line, the sergeant told Rhodes that if they came another few meters, the Marines must kill them.\n\n \n Sounds like innocent people. \n \n \nLOOK how i used the word \"innocence.\" If some1 picks up an AK-47 or and RPG, Hell, yes, I'd try to kill that person.\n\n \n How about not understanding the English language as many of the people who attempt to get pass checkpoints in cars and are therefore shot? Is that innocent or are they just as guilty of picking up an Ak-47? \n \n \nLet's go Kerry way. Wait a minute...he doesn't have one, all he does is use FEAR to go against Bush.\n\n \n The Bush administration has basically said a vote for Kerry is bringing another terrorist attack. Your stance is not only ignorant, but it full of hypocrisy and double standards. Apparently fear and reality are same thing to you. \n \n \nHe never says how he will do that. How he will make peace.\n\n \n Through a police action which has proven to work in Ireland and a host of other terrorist events in the past. \n \n \nHow he would get \"other\" countries to help. HEY, let's all bash Bush and vote Kerry, bush is bad, bad, bad... WELL FOLKS... BUSH has a plan unlike Kerry.\n\n \n And what exactly is this plan? Last time I checked, Bush was helping the terrorists. Not only has he given them hundreds of thousands of easy to reach targets, but has removed a leader who has persecuted them for a decade. In addition, he's caused a huge recruitment for the terrorists as well as failing to secure nuclear material throughout the world. As if that was bad enough, he hasn't cut their Saudi prince funding, and let Afghanistan's southern regions fall into Taliban hands, and the North into Warlord hands, not to mention that the search for Bin Laden, which 160,000 troops in Iraq should be doing, is being down with less then 15,000, most of which are merely there to keep the peace. It's time for you to get a reality check. \n \n \nTo me, Kerry is much much worse... Bush at least has the BALLS to keep his story straight.\n\n \n True, he just backstabs you when you're not looking. \n \n \n\n Kerry would be a good storyteller because he never tells the same story twice ..hah... lol... \n\n \n Mindless rhetoric devoid of facts does not help you make your points, unless your point is that your argument is fundamentally weak and ignorant, which you are doing quite well. \n \n \nif kerry thinks the UN will do anything, let him...in my view SCREW THE censored PANZY UN.\n\n \n Alright, now without the UN, we will have to pay for most, if not all of the humanitarian aid costs. That will run easily into the double digit billions. Also, we'd have to bribe people for basing rights more then we did now. That will easily run into the triple digit billions. Then we'd have to bribe, extort, threaten and blackmail countries into getting them to help us, like we did in Iraq. Expect that to run into the trillions. Not only will you be paying for \"freedom\" from the UN, but there will be no legitimacy in the eyes of the World, and no funding without mafia tactics. Operation Desert Storm cost the US less then 1/100th of the cost of Operation Iraqi freedom. Also, not only will your taxes rise to meet this cost, but the world as a whole will become far more hostile to American intentions, while ultimately will make our lives harder, and the cost and quality of life, higher and lower respectively. Think before you post. Syklopps61 is probably the last person you want to learn your debating and analytical skills from. \n \n \nI think they are almost as dumb as FRANCE.\n\n \n Therefore the US is dumb as well. France, Germany and Russia where all looking out for their best national interests, just like the US does. If France is dumb for that, then we are just as foolhardy for following the same doctrine in looking out for your country first. It is extremely hypocritical and full of double standards to attack a country for doing what your country does as well. \n \n \nno offense to ya guys there but your country hates BUSH... ANYWAY..Kerry abandoned his fellow brothers in arms during Vietnam after getting his \"well-earned XXXXXXn purple hearts\" and then he turned away and bashed the hell out of our POWs...WTF kerry? MMMHHHMMM\n\n \n Bashed the hell out of the POWs? Is this provable or devoid of facts like the rest of your argument? Abandoned his fellow soldiers? Kerry was the spokesman of Vets against the war, he was simply telling the stories and opinions of other soldiers who were also against the war. \n \n \nthe death penalty and abortion, he would much rather kill the Innocent (the babies) than kill the guilty (death row inmates)\n\n On the contrary, if you knew anything about the death penalty you would know it costs roughly $1-2 million more to kill someone then to keep them in prison for life. Not only is that a redistribution of funds away from the state, and the means to prevent crime through social and police networks, but it promotes the death of more innocents due to this lack of funding. Also, many defense lawyers were disbarred within a period of 6 months after losing a death penalty case. If that was not bad enough, we also know that with forensic evidence, many inmates have been exonerated, yet this technology is new, so you have to consider how many people died before they could have been saved. As for abortion, Kerry has specifically made it clear that he is against legislation that does not have the mother's health at heart and minor notification, which none of the bills against abortion have had in their text. If you would like to discuss the penalty, I would be more then happy to give you the fiscal facts. \n \n \nAS FOR HIM BEING CATHOLIC..i'm catholic and he sure in the hell from what i hear and see of him isn't catholic... I WISH I COULD VOTE FOR YA BUSH BUT I\"M ONLY 16..good luck \n\n \n The last JFK that ran for office has questions about him being too Catholic. Now this JFK is not Catholic enough. Talk about hypocrisy. As for Bush, his own church has launched scathing attacks on him for not following his own religion.",

HIS lack of action is what brought about the 9-11 attacks\n\n and here you show your true colors, putting words in my mouth, not once did i even imply that i expected bush to do something about terrorism before 9/11. i am appalled by what he is doing right now, namely spending billions of dollars and thousands of lives in war and NOT fighting terrorism",

We did not know if the WMDs were there. All countries have the potential to produce WMDs. Whoever took those explosives definitley has them (at least someone has them). Now, what do you think the chances are that they will be used against our troops in the current war? Compare that to the chances of Iraq developing WMDs where they had none under UN sanctions.

LOL, you aren't human\n\n Did I say that?\n \n \nWell, his comments are based more on fact and reality than Kerry's.\n\n No, I'm sorry, but No. They both are lying sacks of ....\n \n \nLet's take the draft issue. FACT: Republicans don't want it and in FACT voted down the bill that DEMOCRATS initiated. \n\n FACT: Democrats voted it down too. The bill was authored as a protest.\n \n \nWhen Kerry says there WILL be a draft, how does he know this, based on the FACTS? He can't and doesn't. Now, in the case of more terrorist attacks, based on the FACTS of Kerry's position (or lack thereof), he intends to pursue terrorists through the courts. This is a joke and sends that very message to the terrorists, one that wreaks with weakness and will only embolden them to commit more acts of terror. If I'm not mistaken (and I'm sure that you will claim I am no doubt), the terrorists have stated that our weakness is Somalia is what emboldened them to destroy the WTC\n\n Um, yeah, ok. Let me type FACT and then follow it up with a bunch of speculation. You think that if we would have prevailed in Somalia they would have just quit? :)\n \n \nYou can't admit that Kerry doesn't have a plan, can you? All you can do is make a negative comment about Bush\n\n Kerry may or may not have a plan. I actually don't care. I know Bush doesn't have a plan other than to keep doing what we've been doing, which is getting us nowhere fast.\n \n \nSeems to me that his plan is to have a democracy on either side of Iran (that would be Afghanistan and Iraq) so that the seeds of democracy can spread there so we won't have to kick the S*** out of the Iranians too. That sounds to me like a plan that has some vision to it. Now, Kerry's plan.....? And it IS working well, despite how easily you are lead by the press. Man, no doubt you would have been in the Hitler Youth as well\n\n And when they democratically elect a radical Islamic government just like Iran, that'll show those mullahs. Oh, I forgot, we aren't going to let that happen in our puppet govt. so rebel groups will continuously fight it. It's a no win situation.\n \n \nGot news for you, this is gonna get much nastier than you might want to admit. I'm not gonna lie to myself and say that we can totally defeat terrorism. They will hit again and it could be devastating, and we may very well have to turn that God forsaken area to glass. Kerry will not even consider the use of nukes and THAT is scary Ace.

Following the war, several pounds of yellow cake uranium showed up in a dutch scrap ship which they traced back to that site. Upon review, they found that ENTIRE BUILDINGS at the faciltiy, which we KNEW contained nuclear materials, had disapeared. The buildings themselves had actually been disassembeled and sold as scrap.

The way your side describes it though is like the U.S. is intentionally targeting innocents or ripping babies from the mother's nipple and shooting it..gimmee a break \n \n \n We are intentionally targeting innocents by intentionally bombing civilian areas in \"insurgent strongholds\". We get information that a particular house may be used by insurgents, and we bomb it, destroying t and the surrounding homes, which we can logically deduce are filled with civilians, and in absence of evidence to the contrary, innocent civilians.

That sounds to me like a plan that has some vision to it. Now, Kerry's plan.....? And it IS working well, despite how easily you are lead by the press. Man, no doubt you would have been in the Hitler Youth as well \n \n \n Except that we instead apparently have puyppet governments on either side of Iran, which has announced that it WILL be developing nuclear weapons, and it WILL be accelerating its program in order to defend itself from the US threat (even nations that we currently consider \"friendly\" like egypt have accelerated their programs. They learned their lesson.....Iraq=no threat, easily defeated= invasion and occupation.....N.Korea=Nuclear weapons, clear and present danger=Amerifca too cowardly to act).\n \n We haven't really managed to beat the Iraqis yet, I think you should reign in your enthusiasm for kicking the S*** out of the iranians. We have been taking casualties in Iraq since day 1, with no real end in sight. Iraq has been under sanctions for the last decade. Iran, on the other hand, has not been under sanctions. They have a much better military than Iraq did, and more international support.\n \n \n As far as the whole \"hitler youth\" thing, I think you would likely fit in there much better than anybody else here (except perhaps siegfriedson) with comments like this:\n \n \nOh, so you actually think every arab (and non-arabs) living in the Middle East wants to kill american civilians?

   "Quote-Pro Bush: \"Why do you all hate bush so much and not Kerry\"\n \n First, it is good to see one of your tender age interested in the election process. When I was your age I only had two things on my mind and one of them had wheels. You should rethink the word \"all\" because most of those who support Kerry do NOT have hate for the President, they simply think he is not the best choice to lead us in the troubled times we face. Around 70% of eligible voters have registered to vote in this hotly contest and one thing the majority, regardless of preference, have in common is that they are good people, not given to hate. Heated debate and hot arguments over politics are as American as apple pie and a product of our free country. Sadly, some, from both sides will inject hatred and venom into the exchanges. Young people like you are our future and I fear your generation will not inherit the safe, united, opportunity-filled country that mine did. I will offer the following suggestions: (1) Never stop learning, study all sides of a question and make your decisions with an open mind; (2) Don't be a follower .... Republican, Democrat, Liberal, Conservative, go where your mind and your heart leads you. I guarantee you life is not a straight line and many opinions you hold now will change; (3) Respect those you disagree with, they can teach you a lot; (4) If you encounter hatred, resist the urge to hate back in kind.

He hasn't even made major measures to secure our OWN nuclear material that is spread throughout the WORLD. We have given nuclear material for research prurposes to many countries that HAS NOT been returned. Not to mention that bush has done NOTHING to secure Russia's wmd, which are lying around poorely or not guarded at all. \n \n Bush could litterally slaughter 5 innocent children and you would give him a pass. \n Bush could give the terrorists a nuke and you would give him a pass.\n Apparently questioning leaders is not something you think is good.",

Oddly, it appears to be used for counter terrorism, mainly aganist Iran. \n \n \nIn separate interviews with me, however, a former C.I.A. station chief and a former military intelligence analyst said that the camp near Salman Pak had been built not for terrorism training but for counter-terrorism training. In the mid-eighties, Islamic terrorists were routinely hijacking aircraft. In 1986, an Iraqi airliner was seized by pro-Iranian extremists and crashed, after a hand grenade was triggered, killing at least sixty-five people. (At the time, Iran and Iraq were at war, and America favored Iraq.) Iraq then sought assistance from the West, and got what it wanted from Britain's MI6. The C.I.A. offered similar training in counter-terrorism throughout the Middle East. \"We were helping our allies everywhere we had a liaison,\" the former station chief told me. Inspectors recalled seeing the body of an airplane-which appeared to be used for counter-terrorism training-when they visited a biological-weapons facility near Salman Pak in 1991, ten years before September 11th. It is, of course, possible for such a camp to be converted from one purpose to another. The former C.I.A. official noted, however, that terrorists would not practice on airplanes in the open. \"That's Hollywood rinky-dink stuff,\" the former agent said. \"They train in basements. You don't need a real airplane to practice hijacking. The 9/11 terrorists went to gyms. But to take one back you have to practice on the real thing.\"\n \n Salman Pak was overrun by American troops on April 6th. Apparently, neither the camp nor the former biological facility has yielded evidence to substantiate the claims made before the war.\n\n \n http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030512fa_fact\n \n \n\n Sorry, they started the war of civilizations\n\n \n So we haven't done anything bad or wrong since 9/1 :p 1? \n \n \n\n Can't comment on that, didn't hear about it, but again, I'm not sure that Duo meant this either...he again inferred that Bush is responsible for every ounce of nuclear waste around the world\n\n \n No. I didn't, that is a fabrication.

Unfortunatly, our leaders have declared that the constitution is non-binding in foreign policy affairs, which leaves them free to deal with whatever evil bastard they wish.\n \n \n \n \nWell, when people fail to see the obvious in an attempt to be \"above the fray\" and so tolerant, then yeah, I would have to say that's PC\n\n \n The problem is, your \"obvious\" seems to so completly fly in the face of available information and common sense that it is astounding. Like most racist philosophies, it is so lacking an factual substance, and so rooted in ignorance, that it defies any attempt at defense.\n \n \n \n \nGod help us if that option is taken off the table\n\n \n That option was never on the table. The politician that nukes the ME can count their career as over, and we all know it.. In addition, backlash fro the rtest of the world would be swift and severe. This is not like the \"old days\" when other countries needed us more than we need them. 30 days of sanctions against the US would have people starving in the street here.\n \n \n \n \nI would much rather be blindly optimistic than mired in the doom and gloom in which you seem to wallow\n\n \n I will take the ugly truth over a beautiful lie any day. \n \n It may not be as pleasant, but at least you know where you stand. I have come a long way in life, and have suceeded more than I have failed, and one thing I have learned si that you can never get ahead if you allow people to lie to you, or tell you what they think you want to here. I have never had room for \"yes men\" in any of my endeavors. \n \n Blind optimism is dangerous. Unless you are willing to open your eyes and admit there are problems, there will never be solution to those problems. Unfortunatly, even if you close your eyes really tight, and cover yourself with the sheet so not even a toe is showing, the boogeyman can still get you.",

   "[QUOTE=syklopps61]\n \n \n Oh c'mon, you are the type that will point a finger the first chance you get..there is NOTHING Bush cold do that would make you \"feel safe\"\n\n \n Depends. The fact is that terrorists can get nukes from Russia, seal them in lead containers and ship them to a American port with a timer that is set to dentonate when the ship enters port. New York? 17 million people dead in less then 10 seconds. What has Bush done to stop this? Secure the ports? Less then 3% of all containers are checked at all. Secure out shipping partners? The fact that we still have massive drug and illegal human shipment is a testament to that failure. The fact that we haven't gotten nuked yet is a amazement. I can go pour potassium cynaide into my local water plant and kill hundreds of thousands. I can place chemicals, bombs and guns on planes and they won't find them until I e-mail them like the young XXXXX who managed to place items on multiple planes over several weeks. It amazes me how little Bush has done to secure this country and you are giving him a free pass on this. \n \n Apparently you think doing nothing is good and therefore Bush is absolved of all his failures. Name me one thing Bush has done to secure the homeland. \n \n \n\n I make it a point to never waste my time reading \"proof\" of what the ignorant claim\n\n \n You also make it a point to specifically remove all facts from your arguments. You haven't provided a since fact yet. \n \n \n\n I will remain consistent and not waste more time trying to pick out every little thing that we have done \"wrong\" or \"bad\", suffice it to say that not everything has gone as well as those who live in Oz would like it to be. Is that the \"fault\" of Bush, no...plans are made and the enemy doesn't sit around and let you implement it without taking actions to derail your plan\n\n \n So no, you will not answer the question. Apparently your scilence is testament to your lack of analytical thinking. \n \n \n\n Wow, I had no idea that the nuclear programs in every country were under our control.\n\n \n Nuclear program and nuclear research are two different things. If Bush GAVE the terrorists a nuke, would you give him a free pass? \n \n \n\n Goes to show the value of a public educatioon I guess...SCARED..who ME...you betcha!! LOL You completely ignore the oil for food scandal, how convenient\n\n \n I have commented on the UN before very harshy which you choose to ignore to fabricate arguments that never existed. Facts and your arguments are deathly allergic to each other. \n \n \n\n It has suddenly dawned on me why you and others like you, the ones who claim to be not for Bush OR Kerry, lack the backbone to come out and admit you support Kerry. With all this **** you throw out about Bush, even YOU know that your guy can't come out of his four years without having it cover his face as well, but you would look hypocritical trying to defend it...SO, you can sit back four years from now and say \"I didn't support Kerry\"...spineless\n\n \n Bush and Kerry are both wankers that deserve nothing from the American public except a swift kick to the curb. Doesn't it **** you off when people you stereotype destroy your lies and fabrications? \n \n Unlike you, I favor good candidates.",

   "How is he arrogant? Because he took action without the consent of the spineless and corrupt U.N.? If that constitutes arrogance then you live in Bizarro World. And how is he ignorant? Because he acted upon information provided to him by numerous intelligence sources that as of yet has not panned out, especially because of that same spineless and corrupt U.N.\nNo, far from it. It is actually possible to be pro-war and anti Bush. I am. We did the right thing in Iraq. Saddam needed removing. I don't actually think he was ignorant over it either. He knew full well that Saddam was a much lesser threat than he made out, but he worked the crowd and got the result he wanted. As much as I hate him I do have to give him that one. No the arrogance I refer to is the one I am afraid I have seen in many other Americans as well, yourself included. The innate belief that the US is somehow a divinely superior place, that it can do no wrong and that any who disagree are evil. And again for ignorance I mean again in a less specific sense. The man does not read! I find that concept so overwhelmingly terrifying. He also has no concept of the world around him, before his presidency I'd be surprised if he'd even left the country. Hence he is woefully inadequate in international relations, the man just doesn't have a clue how to deal internationally.\n \n \n \nPLEASE explain this one in more detail..I can't wait to hear it\nBasically his election in the first place, the fact that due to friends and family in the right place he got elected. Not through his own merit. And this in a society that claims such things don't work like that.\n \n \n \nOf all the ignorant and flat out retarded remarks I think I've ever heard, YOU win the prize for this one! He sends Americans to die to defend this country and free 50 million people from tyranny, and you have the idiocy to say he believes freedom is only for Americans.\nI think we both know that's not quite the reason Iraq happened. It's certainly not the reason he claimed it happened. So why should I credit him with it. What of the puppet dictatorships that the US has supported in South America when it serves their interest? Often after a democratic government has been overthrown. OK it wasn't Bush who was at the reigns, but he to me symbolises that entire system, US foreign policy buggering over a country to serve their own 'freedom' and 'democracy' loving purposes. OK Iraq was too high profile to install a dictator, but I'm sure He would have done if he could get away with it. Let one thing be quite clear, whatever the real reason for Iraq, 'democracy' was not it. \n \n \n \nDON'T YA LOVE IT?? LMAO Hell, you hate Capitalism to ANY degree\nNo, I don't. Not sure where you got that from, as far as I know it's the first time I've ever mentioned Capitalism. You're right I'm no huge advocate of it, but agree with it generally. However anyone who even slightly understands the system realises that it has to have some checks in it or it just doesn't work. Unless they happen to be a CEO of a huge corporation that is. Like all of Bush's buddies.\n \n \n \nSo, being spiritual is to tear apart scientific progress? Man, you really are a loon.\nI said nothing of the sort. There is a massive difference in spirituality, and using outmoded and defunct morals to enforce your own version of it on others who just want to lead normal and happy lives.\n \n \n \nNow go ahead and whine to the Administrator and get me kicked off, I couldn't give a rat's A##\n \n On that note, it's been real...no doubt I'll be booted for this one, but it was well worth it!!!!\nDo I detect a hint of paranoia? To be honest nothing you have said has insulted me in the slightest. So you have called me stupid for my views, I could happily say the same of you for yours. It's a debate, people get passionate about what they believe in. Honestly just because you'd label me a Liberal doesn't mean I go running off crying every time someone disagrees with me.

There IS a possibility that he has a bit more information from better sources than we have. I can freely admit a lack of knowledge about many things..I'm secure enough in myself to make those admissions, something that I feel a good number here aren't able to do. I have freely admitted when someone has a point or has \"gotten\" me. I think it's a bit of a stretch for people to say with such certainty that Bush did certain things because of certain motivations. My biggest problem with those is that there seems to be NO possibility of another side. They completely dismiss the possibility of conspiracies when it comes to the U.N. and Iraq, yet have no problem with Haliburton and colonizing countries, when that simply has not happened. I have to say that I feel like many here take their \"knowledge\" a little too seriously, almost like they are playing a serious game of fantasy baseball or something or some computer strategy game, and have come to the conclusion that mankind would be better served if only we would listen\n \n \nNo the arrogance I refer to is the one I am afraid I have seen in many other Americans as well, yourself included.

What other country sends aid for disaster relief to other countries, even our enemies? Do THEY offer in return? It seems to me that YOU all have the problem, expecting us to be perfect when we can't be.

Are you telling me that if a travel to France to look at the freaking Eiffel Tower, that I somehow have an understanding of how the world works? Give me a break LOL\n \n \nBasically his election in the first place, the fact that due to friends and family in the right place he got elected. Not through his own merit. And this in a society that claims such things don't work like that.\n\n \n GEEEEEEEZ, and Kerry I guess is just a regular guy like you and I, huh? Worked his way up STRICTLY on his merit, had nothing to do with family connections, rich wives, etc. And who in God's name ever said that things like that don't happen in this society? I've never heard anyone claim that. What is said is that it's POSSIBLE for people from any walk of life to succeed, and that is VERY possible\n \n \nI think we both know that's not quite the reason Iraq happened.

Let one thing be quite clear, whatever the real reason for Iraq, 'democracy' was not it. \n \n \n It's easy for me to say, all of us for that matter, but in my opinion if Bush had started out saying that we were going there to take away Husseins ABILITY to produce WMD, then he wouldn't have gotten so much criticism. Anyway, what country on this planet sacrifices and assists other countries without wanting something in return or some benefit for doing so. Why is that so freaking bad to you? I'm sure wherever you live that your leaders don't do anything strictly out of the kindness of their hearts\n \n \nUnless they happen to be a CEO of a huge corporation that is. Like all of Bush's buddies.\n\n \n Ummm, HELLOOOOOOOOOOO? Bush is a wealthy man, why would he be firends with ME or YOU? Of COURSE his friends are going to be wealthy, powerful people. Are you willing to say that Kerry's friends are regular schmucks like us? Does the name HEINZ mean anything to you? How about all his phony Hollywood buddies? Or his sleazy lawyer buddies? yeah, a real regular Joe, huh?\n \n \nI said nothing of the sort. There is a massive difference in spirituality, and using outmoded and defunct morals to enforce your own version of it on others who just want to lead normal and happy lives.\n\n \n Well, I'd much rather have a man with morals than NOT, unlike our previous President. Like it or not, the President does set a certain tone in the U.S., and under Clinton we had high school kids doing Monica's in front of classes because the President did it too. We had sleazy corporate dealings going on under the sleazy Clinton Administration, and Bush came in and has cleaned them up\n \n \nDo I detect a hint of paranoia?

I saw nothing that indicated that the entire article was about Salman Pak.\n\n \n Briefly? \n \n how about<b></b>: \n \n \nIn separate interviews with me, however, a former C.I.A. station chief and a former military intelligence analyst said that the camp near Salman Pak had been built not for terrorism training but for counter-terrorism training. In the mid-eighties, Islamic terrorists were routinely hijacking aircraft. In 1986, an Iraqi airliner was seized by pro-Iranian extremists and crashed, after a hand grenade was triggered, killing at least sixty-five people. (At the time, Iran and Iraq were at war, and America favored Iraq.) Iraq then sought assistance from the West, and got what it wanted from Britain's MI6. The C.I.A. offered similar training in counter-terrorism throughout the Middle East. \"We were helping our allies everywhere we had a liaison,\" the former station chief told me. Inspectors recalled seeing the body of an airplane-which appeared to be used for counter-terrorism training-when they visited a biological-weapons facility near Salman Pak in 1991, ten years before September 11th. It is, of course, possible for such a camp to be converted from one purpose to another. The former C.I.A. official noted, however, that terrorists would not practice on airplanes in the open. \"That's Hollywood rinky-dink stuff,\" the former agent said. \"They train in basements. You don't need a real airplane to practice hijacking. The 9/11 terrorists went to gyms. But to take one back you have to practice on the real thing.\"\n \n Salman Pak was overrun by American troops on April 6th. Apparently, neither the camp nor the former biological facility has yielded evidence to substantiate the claims made before the war. \n\n \n You call that brief when it contridicts the entire Salman Pak claim? \n \n \nI pulled up the National Review Online and they had an article that said that Salman Pak was INDEED a terrorist training camp. Naturally, you'll dismiss those facts because it wasn't on CBS or CNN\n\n \n And yet you offer nothing to prove this. Refering to a source that you cannot cite or even mention specifically by page, date and article says much about the substance and factual basis of your arguments. \n \n \n \n Okay, so Bush has control over the nuclear RESEARCH in North Korea? And your question is stupid, so no need to answer it\n\n \n What do you not understand about US nuclear material being used for research programs in a multitude of countries? What do you not understand about nuclear weapons not being guarded in Russia? What do you not understand about lack of US resolve to remove nuclear material in the former USSR countries, many of which the US has troops in?\n \n If Bush handed Bin laden a nuke, you'd congradulate him. \n \n Has bush done one bad thing in your opinion? \n \n \n\n LOL, thanks for making my point. You will never be wrong because you can't decide on anything, always riding the fence.

   "[QUOTE=syklopps61]\n \n \n Because being supreme ruler of Bizarro World you feel it's your duty to enlighten those of us who wither in the face of your brilliance\n\n \n It amuses me and disturbs me that that is the best you can do. \n \n \n\n No Duo, I just ignore your rantings\n\n \n rantings: Definition Noun\n Anything remotely dealing with facts, historical data, scientific data, and logical analyatical deduction. \n \n \n\n I never said it was okay..if you would get your head out of your ***, you would see in my posts about Bush that I don't support EVERYTHING he has said or done, I am forced to defend him against people like you with an irrational and psychotic hatred of a man who doesn't deserve that sort of extreme reaction.\n\n \n Ah, the pyschological fallacy. Instead of actually refuting what we say, you resort to why we dislike Bush. Instead of providing facts and factual based arguments, you put resort to blaming our subconscience feelings. Talk about a weak argument. I could say you are wrong because you think Bush is a God. Does it disprove your arguments? No. Does it prove I'm right? No. It is merely a coup out from actually discussing the issue and using honest discussion. We have been discussing ports and you have never criticzed Bush for doing nothing to make this country safer. If Bush GAVE Bin Laden a nuke, you'd give him a free pass. If Bush personally murdered 500 innocent children, you'd give him a free pass. if Bush FIXED the election or attempted to like Nixon, you'd give him a free pass. \n \n \nFurthermore, as illustrated by your rantings, NO percentage would satisfy you. If he ordered the hiring of a few hundred more Inspectors, you could maybe increase the inspections to 5% or 6% (just a guess)\n\n \n Your ignorance is showing. A few hundred more wouldn't even raise it 1/2 a %. We have litterally MILLLIONS of shipments annually and we scan less then3 % of them in any form or fashion. What would be decent? 70% considering the amount of weapons, drugs, human cargo, and nuclear material that is out there. \n \n \n...would that satisfy you and make you feel cozy and warm? Probably not, how about Bush hire 30,000 more inspectors and upped it to 50%, would that please YOU?\n\n \n 70% would be fair, but not great. \n \n \n\n Well, obviously what Bush says is true, like it or not.\n\n \n The fact that you said this about a politican virtually destroys all credibility you have anywhere. \n \n \nWE have to be right 100% of the time and they only have to get it right ONCE. That therefore means that unless we CAN inspect 100% of all shipments entering this country (which is impossible in THIS world), it would be hard by rational people to lay BLAME on Bush for something like that happening\n\n \n What do you not understand about doing nothing, which you find acceptable? \n \n \n\n LMAO, can always count on you to give me a good laugh!\n\n \n Apparently logic and not applying double standards are something lost on you. You absolve Bush for his failures on the grounds that he can't control everything, yet you won't apply the same rational and logic to Clinton. Double standards. \n \n \n\n Bush lowered taxes.........now go ahead and irrationally ramble about how bad that is, Mr. Conservative\n\n \n The fact that you said this highlights your extreme economic ignorance, which adds to your extremely lack of knowledge about Us policies in the ME. I, unlike you, will actually answer a question. Lowering taxes during periods of recession is usually good for increasing the supply of money in the market, leading to investments, new business, new jobs and the ability to get out of the recession. However, contiunual tax cuts with mounting costs, such as SS, the baby boomer, Medicare, military expenditures is not a good idea. We went from $5.6 trillion to $7 trillion in less then a single term. Not to mention that due to the record deficits, government borrowing is at a all time high, which not only hurts the dollar worldwide, but decreases the buy power of the dollar, hurting fixed income workers the hardests. With the rising expenditures, and Bush's massive liberal programs, cutting taxes now is a bad idea. Borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow, spend, spend spend, cut revenue, cut revenue, and hope everything works out. Faith based math and economics. Cruising for a bruising. \n \n \n\n LOL, I don't know how to attach a link. Besides, does it REALLY matter with you? I mean REALLY? I could have link after link refuting your dinky little paragraph and you would STILL find a way to spin it, so tell me, why should I bother?\n\n \n Except that you can't. Wow, you don't know how? That is pretty funny. The fact that you can't cite anything says besides what you pull out of thin air without any form of any logic or any backing says how much your arguments have in substance. Apparently facts, logic, science and proof mean nothing to you. The basic ideas of debate revolve around proof and facts, which you have just show to have a contempt of. \n \n \n\n Of course he has, but not regarding terrorism. He should veto more, he should shut down the borders (P*** on the Dems/Libs who want it wide open), never should have signed the drug prescription program. See, I have the guts to support someone who I know is human and can't please ALL of us on every issue\n\n \n Except you said that What Bush said is true. Makes people wonder doesn't it? \n Should veto more? How about veto PERIOD? \n \n \nI am a Patriot and have no problem saying that those who take glee in Bush making some mistakes are NOT Patriots);\n\n \n You are a nationalist. A patriot would be disgusted at both choices. The fact that you actually defend Bush's mistakes says you aren't. nationalism has the blood of millions of innocent lives on its hands. \n \n \nbeing a fence sitter and non-committal, you escape any criticism for supporting anything or anybody in the event it doesn't work out.\n\n \n i rememer when Moderate was a good term, the whole non-extremist deal...\n \n \nYou constantly criticize the candidates and say you support GOOD candidates, unnamed of course (maybe it's YOU that's the unnamed candidate, huh?

   "I tell you what, I'll make a deal with you...I'll stop \"patting ourselves on the back\" for the good we've done if yopu quit harping on all the evil we've spread through the world for so many years...oh but wait, in the case of evil, there is no statute of limitations..I see how it works\n\n \n I am more than happy to consider the good we do, as soon as somebody manages to point it out to me. Maybe you could list some specific instances of US aid that did not come with some pretty serious strings attache. I doubt it, but you can try. \n \n Just so I have a sense of the sclae you are working from, how many good deeds does it take to make up for a bad one? Lets take operation condor, where Thousands of people were turtured or assasinated. Here is a bief description of Operation Condor (from Wikipedia):\n \n Operation Condor (Spanish: Operaci\u00f3n C\u00f3ndor) was a campaign of assassination and intelligence-gathering, dubbed counter-terrorism, conducted jointly by the security services of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay in the mid-1970s.\n \n \nThe right-wing military governments of these countries, led by dictators such as Videla, Pinochet and Stroessner agreed to cooperate in sending teams into other countries, including France, Portugal and the United States to locate, observe and assassinate political opponents. They also exchanged torture techniques, like near drowning and playing the sound recordings of victims who were being tortured to their family. Many people disappeared and were killed without trial. Their targets were 'leftist guerrilla terrorists' but many are thought to be political opponents, family and other innocent people.\n \n Operation Condor was unofficially supported by the United States, since it feared that the left-wing powers in the region would create a second communist Cuba. It appears that Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State in the Nixon administration, had an important role in giving US sanction to the operation. CIA documents show that the CIA was closely linked with Contreras up to, and even after, the assassination of Letelier.\n\n \n Keeping in mind that, since the release of the documents required by the hinchey ammendment (except for those, of course, which were \"lost\" (CIA sources say shredded) the day before they were due to be released) we now know that the CIA's role in operation Condor extended far beyond mere moral support or silent approval, and that they actually took an active role in many operational aspects of the operation, exactly how many good deeds does it take to make up for something like this?\n \n Or, lets pick soemthing else that doesn't directly involve the death of thousands (though it did result in the death of millions in the end).\n \n In 1970, Salvador Allende was democratically elected as president of Chile. The US, not fond of his socialist views, Supported a coup against Allende. It was apparent that the coup would not work without the military being on board, and the military could not be brought into the game without the blessings of Ren\u00e9 Schneider, a constitutionalist and an important army commander. Schneider would never have supported a coup, since Allende had been constitutionally elected. The CIA had Schneider killed (I said that it wouldn't invlove the deaths of thousands, this was just one guy assasinated for preferring to live in a democratic republic, like the US, rather than a dictatorship).\n \n Pinochet tootk the seat as president, and turned the nation into a constitutional dictatorship (still had a constitution, but all power rests with the president, essentially allowing him to change the constituon at will, unlimited power basically). Of course, as tends to happen when a popular government is destroyed and somebody declares themself dictator, millions ended up dead, but that is for another segment.\n \n So, how many pound of rice make up for the destruction of a constitutional republic and the installation of a dictator, with all the trimmings (death squads, secret police, etc...)?",

   "Phunting, let me start by saying that I appreciate your taking my comments better than some have in this forum.\nHeh, no worries :) \n \n \n \nYou presume much, knowing what he was thinking and all. There IS a possibility that he has a bit more information from better sources than we have. I can freely admit a lack of knowledge about many things..I'm secure enough in myself to make those admissions, something that I feel a good number here aren't able to do. I have freely admitted when someone has a point or has \"gotten\" me. I think it's a bit of a stretch for people to say with such certainty that Bush did certain things because of certain motivations. My biggest problem with those is that there seems to be NO possibility of another side. They completely dismiss the possibility of conspiracies when it comes to the U.N. and Iraq, yet have no problem with Haliburton and colonizing countries, when that simply has not happened. I have to say that I feel like many here take their \"knowledge\" a little too seriously, almost like they are playing a serious game of fantasy baseball or something or some computer strategy game, and have come to the conclusion that mankind would be better served if only we would listen\nI don't claim to know what he was thinking, but I can suspect. And I am sure that he knew full well Saddam's level of threat, he had the resources of the intelligence services of the most powerful countries in the world. I cannot believe all was as he made it out. I understand, and even agree with, his reasons for doing it however. And I also agree with your point that all the criticism is a little one sided.\n \n \n \nIt's less arrogance than it is a frustration with those like you that find so much evil in us and never stop to look at the good. Call it arrogance all you want, but would Europe BE Europe without us intervening in WWII? I agree that we have no doubt gotten our hands dirty, but does that diminish all the good we have done? What other country sends aid for disaster relief to other countries, even our enemies? Do THEY offer in return? It seems to me that YOU all have the problem, expecting us to be perfect when we can't be. And when we feel we have to defend our good deeds whenever you all nitpick and find some bad here and there, then you scream we are arrogant.\nBut that is almost the point. America has so much that is wonderful about it, but Bush to me represents none of those things. And I assure you a lot of other countries who give out disaster aid, to 'enemies' as well. The nit picking, well I agree. But would say that that is the price of being in the public eye. I think nit picking is not only understandable but almost essential to any powerful figure, be they a person or a nation.\n \n As for the arrogance. I have spoken to several Americans who have basically claimed that Americans are somehow 'better' than everyone else just because their culture is a superpower. That is what I mean by arrogance.\n \n \n \nHow do you KNOW he doesn't read? Did you hear that Bush is reported to have a higher IQ than Kerry? Many on the arrogant Left think Bush is stupid because he doesn't speak the Queen's English like John Kerry...BFD. Seems to me that YOU are showing a certain degree of arrogance yourself.\nBecause he admitted it in interview. And I know many say he is stupid, and I don't agree with them. I think he is very intelligent, he is just not exceptionally literate. But I think that is worrying in a figurehead as well.\n \n \n \nAgain, quite a stretch. Does one HAVE to travel to have an idea of how the world works? Are you telling me that if a travel to France to look at the freaking Eiffel Tower, that I somehow have an understanding of how the world works? Give me a break LOL\nWell yes. I think that you can only understand how the world works, and certainly how it looks at your own culture, by spending time out of it. No matter how much you learn about other countries, it just can never compare to actually seeing the world through another culture. And I think in a world leader, this knowledge is essential.\n \n \n \nGEEEEEEEZ, and Kerry I guess is just a regular guy like you and I, huh? Worked his way up STRICTLY on his merit, had nothing to do with family connections, rich wives, etc. And who in God's name ever said that things like that don't happen in this society? I've never heard anyone claim that. What is said is that it's POSSIBLE for people from any walk of life to succeed, and that is VERY possible\nI agree, Kerry is also guilty of this. So are most politicians I'm sure. But it is still a reason I don't like Bush. And when I say people claim it doesn't exist is because of the idea of the so-called 'American dream'. That somehow only in America can the average guy succeed that is perpetuated so often in the media, whereas the truth proves so very different.\n \n \n \nIt's easy for me to say, all of us for that matter, but in my opinion if Bush had started out saying that we were going there to take away Husseins ABILITY to produce WMD, then he wouldn't have gotten so much criticism. Anyway, what country on this planet sacrifices and assists other countries without wanting something in return or some benefit for doing so. Why is that so freaking bad to you? I'm sure wherever you live that your leaders don't do anything strictly out of the kindness of their hearts\nOh I quite agree. And I repeat I think we did the right thing in Iraq. However I don't think the right thing was done in the other oppressive regimes we have supported and set up. There is a difference between working for the interests of your own people, and actively damaging the people of another country.\n \n \n \nUmmm, HELLOOOOOOOOOOO? Bush is a wealthy man, why would he be firends with ME or YOU? Of COURSE his friends are going to be wealthy, powerful people. Are you willing to say that Kerry's friends are regular schmucks like us? Does the name HEINZ mean anything to you? How about all his phony Hollywood buddies? Or his sleazy lawyer buddies? yeah, a real regular Joe, huh?\nI know, that was just a flippant after comment. My point is capitalism needs checks to work as a system, Bush seems intent on destroying these checks wherever possible.\n \n \n \nWell, I'd much rather have a man with morals than NOT, unlike our previous President. Like it or not, the President does set a certain tone in the U.S., and under Clinton we had high school kids doing Monica's in front of classes because the President did it too. We had sleazy corporate dealings going on under the sleazy Clinton Administration, and Bush came in and has cleaned them up\nI think the idea that high school kids emulating Lewinski is pushing it, but I agree with you. However the point is that these are personal morals, and while they should influence decisions they have no right to be imposed on others. Clinton never attempted to change the constitution to impose his morals on others. Bush's stance on contraception, abortion and homosexuality would be fine if they were just his personal opinions. However when he attempts to force these opinions on others he becomes oppressive. \n \n \n \nLOL, not paranoia, just have had some whiners that run and cry over the slightest thing and been whacked across the knuckles by the Administrator, SOOOOOOOOOOOO just kinda figured it was inevitable :-D\nIt's ok, it takes a lot more than that to send me off whining.",

Both parties, democratic and republican, have come out in support of banning gay marriages, and states that had initiatives on the ballot banning them saw overwhelming support for the bans. \n \n I think this is a problem with our current society, failure to recognise that \"freedom\" means sometimes allowing people to do things which you find distasteful (and I do personally find gay marriage disatasteful....that's not the point).\n \n I am no Bush fan (nor was I a kerry fan), but fair is fair, and those folks who are somehow twisting same sex marriage bans into a bush issue are deludign themselves. Admittedly it is easier than admitting that your society as a whole is apparently the problem, and you most likely will never get your way, but it still isn't right.\n \n It seems that perhapse int he last election you were a single issue voter. Since there was no canidate ont he ballot who was pro gay marriage, who did you vote for, if you don't mind me asking?",

   "I must wholeheartedly agree with jitobear. I would never like Bush under any circumstances for the reasons above. But for me it is this one issue that really pushes me to hate him. His other policies are just, IMO, misguided. But his stance on marriage, to the extreme of attempting to change the constitution. Well it is no less that oppressive, discriminatory and utterly utterly unacceptable in a modern society. \n \n Indeed the problem is with society, but society takes its cues as much from it's leaders as anyone else. As long as the president is spouting this antiquated hate-fuelled rubbish I don't see we can effectively address the problem in society as a whole.\n \n As for the fact that there was no pro-gay stance, I voted for Kerry. I don't agree with Kerry's stance on it either, but at least he is not actively trying to make things worse. The first priority is to get rid of Bush before he does damage that takes us too long to undo, then we can find a decent president to replace Kerry.",

Would this not be a personal moral decision based on belief system adherence, actually defining those friendships as fair weather superficial associations for whatever purposes with a belief system established dislike of their alternative lifestyles?",

   "In order to get married you have to be considered a legally compentent human being and generally at least 16 in North America. You also have to be able to sign a legal document which disregards animals from the mix right there. The age part and the legally competent will take care of mother or fathers getting married to their childern. \n \n As for polygamy, it already occurs in Utah and a commune in BC\n\n\n \n Does it actually say a legally competent human being? As we all know, the Left muttles everything (definition of IS and WAS ring a bell..only gone down hill since that humdinger)...we all know some sleazeball like Edwards will do something to change all that. He'll channel the voice of some dog speaking to him that if he could sign that paper he would. Then we'll have touchy feely types like you who think \"why should that person's happiness be any different from mine\" and you'll be saying why not. Don't even try to tell me that 20-30 years ago you were thinking \"why can't gays be married\"? You and those like you were weak-minded enough to buy a bunch of BS from something like 3% of the population that need something to whine about, and you want to appear to be enlightened and tolerant\n \n And as far as polygamy, is it supported nationwide? It may OCCUR but it's not condoned by the government",

If the leaders and subsequently politicians of the belief system had decided love thy neighbor would have developed more followers (control) than condemning alternative lifestyles, neither gay marriage nor polygamy would be issues. If unable to offer greater control to leaders, any change within a social structure pursed by minor segments of a population is normally doomed to failure. That ability to use non-essential conflicts to refocus a populace from important issues has historically caused the downfall of most empires.
