   "Wow, so many post in a night\n \n \nWell, you are apparently admitting that I am correct in that we do not know for sure. What God has to do with it I do not know, because I did not bring that side of the debate up. My argument is purely of logic and philosophy.\n\n \n We know for sure whether the fetus is a 'person' because 'person' is a legal concept not a biological one. The fetus is not currently a person and abortion is not illegal, so it cannot logically be murder.\n \n I was merely turning your argument around, not constructing one of my own.\n \n \n\n Consider for a second that you are wrong, and that abortion really is the killing of thousands and thousands of people.\n\n \n I cannot be wrong in this. The fetus is not legally a person. It's a fact.\n \n \n\n Then is abortion a woman's right? Of course not. No one has the right to take a life for the sake of convenience (I'm not talking about aborting because the mother's life is at stake, for now just clear-cut convenience).\n\n \n Again, this is wrong. Even if the fetus were considered a person, it would not automatically invalidate a woman's right to have an abortion. No one currently has the right to live attached to another against that other's will and against that other's consent, so the fetus would not automatically gain this right even if it were considered a person. It would be violating the woman's right to her body, and the Federal gov't cannot Constitutionally support the fetus' life by violating her rights.\n \n \n\n So you commit a logical fallacy by assuming women have this right, because you assume that people are not being killed, while you provide zero hard evidence that this is the case.\n\n \n You don't seem to know much about this subject.\n \n \n\n So, once again you are risking thousands and thousands of lives based on a hope.\n\n \n Yet you are risking thousands of women's rights based on a belief. Whom do you believe to be more important in the pregnancy relationship? I believe the woman is. Her rights should be paramount. They cannot be equally important, because supporting the fetus' right to live off her body violates the woman's right to her own body and supporting the woman's right to her body makes the fetus' right to her body inferior.",

   "You can't refute this, unless you want to argue that all parents are guilty. All births result in deaths. Causality is not a sufficient condition for calling something a murder or killing. Your \"refutation\" was talking about shooting someone in the face. Yes some actions which result in inevitable deaths (shooting people in cold blood) are murders, others (for example, giving birth) ,are not. The fact that an action and death are causally linked is not sufficient to call murder.\n \n\n \n This part of your argument has become incoherrent. Yes, giving birth is not murder. I never said giving birth was. I did say that making the decision to bring a person into a world where they have no chance to survive or have enough food makes the parents morally culpable.\n \n \n\n My stance has always been that the mother has the right to refuse to provide sustenance - that is; the use of her body. I am not saying all abortions are like this.\n \n\n \n So you are against all abortions that are not sustenance related? And what's more, if a mother left her 1 year old child in the middle of the woods and it died of hunger, this would not be morally wrong? Is this your position?\n \n \n\n That's nice, but it is completely inconsistent with your abortion position.

Insert conclusion here.\n \n\n \n My post about animals was in jest. I half thought you were joking by claiming that they could be considered people. If you want to provide evidence as to why animals might be people, then by all means do so. I can posit that feti may be people because I and all other persons started out as one.\n \n \n\n Innocent until proven guilty applies in the court-room. Law requires it.

It remains the case that if you cannot prove an action is murder, only that it \"maybe is, maybe isn't\", it isn't suitable for legal condemnation in a courtroom.\n \n Again, you are going to have to bite the bullet in some way here; either reject the legal principle of innocent until proven guilty, or take the more hardline stance of arguing that feti certainly are people, a factor you have until now maintained is unknown.\n\n \n As for the \"innocent 'till proven guilty\" thing goes, explain how that applies to a fetus. Are you saying they are \"objects 'till proven human?\" Don't try to tell me what stances I have to take. When you explain how American legal docrtine applies to my argument, I'll revisit it.",

This suggests your premise, \"An action which leads to someoe's inevitable death\" isn't something you can consistently maintain.\n \n Similarly, if you believe the timeframe is an issue, mothers who get pregnant with a child with a life-ending birth defect have put them in a sitatuation where they will inevitably die very quickly - according to your principle - this makes them killers too.\n \n \nSo you are against all abortions that are not sustenance related?\n\n \n I am against actively killing the fetus, yes, except in cases of self-defence.\n \n \nAnd what's more, if a mother left her 1 year old child in the middle of the woods and it died of hunger, this would not be morally wrong? Is this your position?\n\n \n The Mother has the right to stop providing for the child at the age of 1. There may be an obligation on her part to stop providing in a relatively careful way - for example leaving the child outside an orphanage, rather than locked in a basement, or in the woods - or just broadcasting that there was an abandonment occurring at a certain time and place.\n \n In an abortion context, this would mean allowing pro-life doctors to attempt to keep the fetus alive by artificial means, if they so chose to try.\n \n \nIf you want to provide evidence as to why animals might be people, then by all means do so. I can posit that feti may be people because I and all other persons started out as one.\n\n \n They might be people. They have brains, and blood, and are more intelligent and speak a more complex language than many young humans. Since they might be people, we should ban killing them, and harshly punish anyone who eats them, because its not worth taking the risk over billions of lives. This is where your position leads if you consistently apply it - prohibiting the death of everything that might be a person.\n \n \nAs for the \"innocent 'till proven guilty\" thing goes, explain how that applies to a fetus. Are you saying they are \"objects 'till proven human?\" Don't try to tell me what stances I have to take. When you explain how American legal docrtine applies to my argument, I'll revisit it.\n\n \n Innocent until guilty applies in a courtroom. If you want to punish somebody for murdering a fetus, you have to prove that they murdered a fetus, not that they might have. This is what innocent until proven guilty means.\n \n The principle does not apply \"to a fetus\", unless you are pressing charges against a fetus.",

This is an improvement on your previous:\n \n\n Believe it or not, my views have not changed. If I had previously had any inkling of a belief that you would turn this into a debate on semantics I would have been more thorough. In the interest of time, I did not do this. However, we can go that road if you really want.\n \n\n Your points:\n \n Indicate that giving birth is a \"cruel action\", if it provides a non-significant chance of survival and death follows. Therefore to avoid being murderers, mothers should abort feti that have a non-significant chance of survival? but again, all birthed children eventually die. The long-term chance of survival is nil.

To avoid being murderers mothers should not abort feti with a non-significant chance of survival because this reduces any small chance they might have had of survival. However, mothers should not conceive of children that they know at the time hold a non-significant chance of survival (i.e. they plan on aborting it anyways).

Therefore some mothers are cruel.\n \n In regards to your quote of my first post: Yes, I used the word murder in my original post because I began with the assumption that people would recongize that we do not know whether feti are people or not, and thus recognize that we do not know if they are being murdered. However, the first question is one of \"personhood.\" This must be proven before murder. I ought to have stated this in my original post for clarity's sake, but if you must know it didn't occure to me at the time.\n \n Tough? Could've fooled me...\n \n\n So, do you believe that species is a morally relevant factor in determining whether an action was murder or not?

   "Just as you were stating that it was not as an example, so was I stating that it was to me as an example. So, your reasoning that we can know if it is or is not a person is because people disagree on whether or not it is? That theory could use a bit more explanation.\n\n \n You state we cannot know if the fetus is morally a person. Yet you state it is to you, and I state it is not to me. Therefore we know if the fetus is morally a person. Since there are no objective morals outside the human mind, whether it is morally a person can only be expressed in such ways.\n \n \n\n If we clarify this it will probably open up a door to our differences. Do you officially believe that there is not one true set of morals?\n\n \n Surely you could have figured that out :p \n \n \n\n Ok, well much of your post is basically pompous huffing and puffing, so I won't waste my time that part. I'll drop the boxing analogy and whatnot for now, their intended meanings were lost, but they weren't really important to begin with.\n\n \n Pompous? How dare you! I prefer \"egomaniacal\" emoticon_xclown \n \n It's not my fault you propose faulty analogies and my huffing and puffing blows them down.\n \n \n\n And you can \"lol\" all you want.\n\n \n I certainly will ;)\n \n \n\n So tell me what it is about a brain that has not developed that requires more protection than a brain that is temporarily out of commission?\n\n \n When did I say a non-developed brain needed more protection?\n \n My question before was: Which is more morally corrupt? Violating the (currently non-existent) rights of a creature that has no consciousness, no thoughts, no feelings, no brain, no concept of self or choice or violating the very much existent rights of a creature that is conscious, has complex thoughts, very much has feelings, has a brain, a concept of self and of choice and has the knowledge that her rights are being disposed of in favor of what is growing inside her?\n \n \n\n First of all, for this analogy to work, the \"hit\" cannot be an accident. So say you hit me on purpose, and the only way I could survive was to live attached to you for...oh I don't know how about nine months. Would you say that if you were forced to allow me to live attached for the nine months this would not be just?\n\n \n Nope. I would not. Even if I caused the accident and laughed as I did it I would never think it was just to allow my body to be shared against my will and without my consent. That would be piling injustice upon injustice.\n \n If you caused the accident on purpose (negating the word \"accident\" eh?), I would not think it was just to force you to donate the organs I need or for me to live attached to you.

I will borrow some of Louis Pojma's points to illustrate what they are. If one society, ethically relative as it is, does not have a principle of tolerance, then it has no reason to be tolerant of any of the principles of another society. This means that one society cannot rationally criticize anything another society does that they might consider a heinous principle. It follows, then, that moral relativists cannot criticize anyone outside of their own culture. \"Hitler's genocides, then, as long as they are culturally accepted, are as morally legitimate as Mother Teresa's works of mercy.\" So, oppression of minorities, the poor, slavery, etc. are all as moral as their opposites.\n \n Another problem is that reformers are always wrong since they go against the values of their cultures. William Wilberfore of the 18th century, Pojman points out, was thus wrong to oppose slavery in the 18th century, et al.\n We normally feel, however, that the individual is the \"courageous innovator who...stands against the mindless majority.\"\n \n Furthermore, our normal view is that we have a duty to obey the laws of our society because it, in general, promotes the human good. However, this is problematic, because while the majority may believe the law is good, and thus moral, a subculture (with it's own morally relativistic views) may not recognize that law as being just, and therefore disobedience becomes morally mandated. The Klu Klux Klan, then, is morally justified in breaking laws that protect blacks, Catholics, and Jews.\n \n The final problem I'll point out is that there is no clear definition of just what entails a culture or a society. I might belong to a church that opposes the state, and that is a culture. My roommate and I form a small society. I could even consider myself an individual culture. The problem we run into now is that, not only can no culture challenge the values of another, but since a \"society\" can be anything, no one can challenge anyone on anything.\n \n (For the sake of giving credit where it is due, a great deal of the above was taken from Dr. Louis Pojman's \"A Critique of Ethical Relativism\")\n \n \n\n Haha, that's your comeback? emoticon_xclown Very weak, zenodotus.\n \n\n Keep it up.

If you mean man's natural state of things, well, the only natural state that can possibly be is the state that has occurred. If you mean his earliest state, then I would further argue that even monkeys work together. Even they are not in a pure anarchy, and hence do not live by pure moral relativism.\n \n Furthermore, do not think that I am arguing for a society that is completely morally relative, or for one which believes it has all the right answers. I am arguing that we do not know if abortion is wrong. Moral relativism cannot be used as justification because it can be used to justify any action. Moral objectivism may contain flaws, but it at least compels us to continue thinking about what is right and what is wrong, as opposed to using moral relativism as a kind of \"cop-out.\" I think it is safe to say that we needn't realistically worry about society becoming one of pure moral objectivism any time soon. However, we ought to worry about the morality of our actions today (including abortion), and moral relativism is no strong defense.",

The analogy would have to be something more like this (although throughout the course of this thread I have been berated for attempting to build analogies, so I will say this analogy is not perfect, but corrects what I see as a key flaw in your pool analogy): You invite a bunch of kids to your pool, knowing that if one of them comes, there is a significat chance that you will drowned one of them on purpose. This would be murder. Inviting the kids is analogous to having sex, whether or not they come to the pool is analogous to whether or not you become pregnant, and the known probability of drowning them should they come is analogous to the known probability of aborting them should you become pregnant. The lifeguard is really analogous to the mother's conscience, because if the kids are in the pool then she is already pregnant. However, I'll assume you intended him to be analogous to contraceptive measures (condom, the pill, etc.). My response is that even if a women takes these steps, she is still responsible for the outcome of her actions, and ought to be prepared to accept the child as opposed to killing it. If she isn't, she is guilty of murder.\n \n \n\n Zenodotus, just to be clear, do you no longer wish to continue the discussion you were having with me?

If you can demonstrate that the premises flow from a particular moral system - say utilitarianism, or virtue ethics, or some such, than we can view your position as at least justified within that moral framework, but as free-floating propositions they are extremely vulnerable.\n \n \nI would argue that they do represent a very coherent moral program. And I would also state that, although it may be difficult to prove why each is individually true, it is equally difficult to prove why each is false.\n\n \n Can you identify a coherent moral program which has these features:\n 1) You are responsible for any fetus you carry inside you (Excluding some circumstances), but not responsible for other people who are reliant upon your assistance in a similar way, such as children in foreign nations who are reliant on your financial support to live. What is the criteria for responsibility, that makes you responsible for some but not for others? \n \n 2) Any action you take that knowingly and significantly raises the chances of a person you are responsible for's untimely demise without the threat of greater loss to the one making the action is murder.\n \n I'm not asking you to derive from first principles - that's a copout that people do sometimes pull in debates about moral issues, but I am at least looking for you to identify some moral framework in which these assumptions hold.\n \n I can, for example, identify the \"natural rights\" framework, as put forward by the classical liberals, applied consistently, or the \"absolute property rights\" framework, as put forward by more contemporary libertarian philosophers as supporting my position. It essentially goes:\n \n 1) All people have an absolute right to their own property, which includes the right to exclude, evict, or restrict any other person's access to that body.\n 2) A person's body is their own property.\n 3) The right to evict another, even a fetus, from one's own body, follows.\n \n I'd like you to bring it back to that level.\n \n Now you may disagree with the framework, and that's fine, I don't expect to resolve such differences here, but I'm just interested what framework your position is a part of.\n \n Alternatively, if the abortion is murder claim is derived from simple intuitions, that's acceptable too, but it can not be expected to be convincing to others who do not share those intuitions.",

If she isn't, she is guilty of murder.\n But if you accept that I have the lifegaurd representing the precautions you take to prevent a possible death (though you are fully aware that someone could die in letting children into the pool/having sex), surely you are saying that if you took resonable precautions and they failed (life guard example) then they would be resonsible and therefore a murderer. Otherwise you are back to proving abortion is cruel - as the mother has taken many acts that drastically reduce the chance of a person being born (especially if we assume personhood is granted at birth) seeing as she has taken drugs that prevent implantation. Given that already the chance of the person being born was intended to be 0, and you have no problem with that - then abortion does not really decrease the chance of the survival from the start as it was intended to be 0.

   "Not sure how much time I will have to continue the debate, but while I can I'll try to address some of the bigger stuff.\n \n \nNot sure I follow, do you have to beleieve everyone's opinions of everything to be morally reletavistic, or just recognise that everyone sees the'rs views as just. Surely the latter otherwise you are going to run into a mass of contradictions. If I recognise that you truly beleive that you are right and can justify yourself yet I think you're wrong (as there are going to be assumptions we disagree on) surely I'm still being morally relativistic rather than absolutist? I don't think that my morals are a true or absolute code, I just follow them because I expect me to do the same thing as you (i.e do what they believe in).\n\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism I may have been remiss in making it sound like moral relativism is a proscriptive theory. It is in fact descriptive (you do not have to understand or know of it to live it). It holds that there are NO absolute moral truths (even to the point of moral tolerance not being a requisite for morality). Wikipedia sums it up fairly easily in the first paragraph.\n \n\n Only if you intend to get pregant and then have an abortion, in a normal situation no abortion/drowning is intended and in most cases you will take steps to prevent it. Yes, planning to get pregant for the purpose of aborting a child is wrong, yet I beleive legally unable to be untangled from normal cases and rare enough to be excluded.\n\n \n You seem to be suggesting that some people hold no thoughts on what they will do should they become pregnant. Were this the case, and a woman became pregnant, she would now be faced with the decision out of the blue (sort of). It is still wrong for her to abort. It doesn't matter how little she meditated on it before having sex. The baby is no more or less proven to be a person regardless of how much she thought about becoming pregnant. Therefore, being that it is not known if killing the fetus is taking a life, the abortion remains wrong.\n \n\n But if you accept that I have the lifegaurd representing the precautions you take to prevent a possible death (though you are fully aware that someone could die in letting children into the pool/having sex), surely you are saying that if you took resonable precautions and they failed (life guard example) then they would be resonsible and therefore a murderer. Otherwise you are back to proving abortion is cruel - as the mother has taken many acts that drastically reduce the chance of a person being born (especially if we assume personhood is granted at birth) seeing as she has taken drugs that prevent implantation. Given that already the chance of the person being born was intended to be 0, and you have no problem with that - then abortion does not really decrease the chance of the survival from the start as it was intended to be 0. Or is birth control also cruel?\n\n I don't know what you mean by precautions against possible death. By death do you mean abortion? If so this analogy doesn't make sense to me because you seem to be calling the lifeguard her conscience (the only precaution there is against abortion). However, one cannot say one has taken every precaution in terms of their conscience and still failed, because were this the case she could not have possibly aborted. If, however, you mean the lifeguard to be birth control, then in response to your last question: yes birth control is cruel, but only in the context that you have put it. If one uses birth control as a method of not getting pregnant but uses abortion as a back-up plan for that birth control, it is cruel because it has lead to abortion. If birth control is used knowing that, should it fail, a birth will be had, then it is not cruel because it has not lead to any abortions.\n \n\n Now you may disagree with the framework, and that's fine, I don't expect to resolve such differences here, but I'm just interested what framework your position is a part of.\n \n\n I appreciate your desire to take a few steps back. Here is the moral framework that I support, albeit simplified (from Kant):\n 1. Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.\n 2. Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.\n \n Number two is very important in this case, because if the fetus is a member of humanity (as I believe we are assuming), aborting it is using it solely as a means, not as an end also.\n \n Now, for fairness' sake, I believe you owe me your preferred moral framework, at least so we understand where each of us is coming from.\n \n\n I'm afraid I don't see the connection. Don't suppose you could offer a formal derivation to prove it could you?\n \n\n It's been a while since I had a class containing formal logic, so I apologize that I don't remember all the symbols. Let's see...\n 1. Feti might be people.\n 2. Any action that knowingly and significantly raises the chances of a person you are responsible for's untimely demise without the threat of greater loss to the one making the action is murder.\n 3. Abortion results in greater loss to the fetus than the mother.\n 4. You are responsible for your feti.\n 5. If feti are people, the act of abortion knowingly and significantly raises the chances of a person's untimely demise.\n 6. Abortion might be murder.\n \n In other words:\n 1. A\n 2. If (B and C and D) then E.\n 3. D\n 4. C\n 5. If A, then B.\n 6. E\n \n Keep in mind that we are assuming that abortion is murder in the instance of this \"proof,\" if you don't keep that in mind it won't really make sense (so for example, 1 really reads \"Feti are people.\"). Furthermore, I realize [2] could be worded more clearly, but I am reluctant to reword it for that sake because \"certain people\" enjoy using the revising of that logic against me. If I word to reword [2] for clarity's sake it would read:\n 2. If an action knowingly and significantly raises the chances of a person's untimely demise, and you are responsible for that person, and that action threatens the one making it less than the one receiving it, then the action is murder.",

If what you provided is in fact that, or you don't know what it is, that's ok too.\n\n \n I don't know what you're talking about, I provided you with it days ago:\n \n \nI can, for example, identify the \"natural rights\" framework, as put forward by the classical liberals, applied consistently, or the \"absolute property rights\" framework, as put forward by more contemporary libertarian philosophers as supporting my position. It essentially goes:\n \n 1) All people have an absolute right to their own property, which includes the right to exclude, evict, or restrict any other person's access to that body.\n 2) A person's body is their own property.\n 3) The right to evict another, even a fetus, from one's own body, follows.\n\n \n This isn't to me an assumption, since it too has further justifications, but I don't intend to debate what's the best overall moral system here with you.\n \n \nDoes it really seem to you that the mother is being used? Be honest (and I don't mean that as a personal attack).\n\n \n Yes, it does, indeed my entire objection to the pro-abortion to date has been the making of use of the woman's property, her body, contrary to her will.\n \n \n The woman is \"being used\" not only as a means, but also as an end because she had the choice in becoming pregnant.\n\n \n And the fact she had a choice in becoming pregnant means she is being used as an ends by forcing her to carry a fetus against her will how?\n \n \nThe baby, if killed, is being used solely as a means.\n\n \n We have already distinguished between killing and refusing to supply resources to. By withdrawing one's support from another, one is not using them as a means, one is not using them at all.\n \n The Kantian approach is deeply hostile to your position in several ways - firstly, your approach is ends based - and to quote Kant:\n \n\"Empirical\" principles--principles oriented toward some outcome in the physical world-- cannot be the basis of morality, because they are always heteronomous; even when the goal is personal happiness, concerns about particular outcomes or courses of events can never have the status of universal laws of nature.\n\n \n That the prohibition of abortion results in less early deaths of \"feti\", even assuming they are people, must be explicitly rejected as contrary to Kant's judgement that we must treat individuals as ends rather than means. The meaning of this is a rejection of what appears to me a consequentialist approach you are putting forward. The mother cannot be taken as a means simply to provide for a preferred outcome. The comments you make regarding a mother being a murderer unless she prevents greater harm to herself are explicitly utilitarian and cannot be rooted in a deontological moral framework.\n \n Furthermore, Kant's position is founded on the treatment of rational beings as ends, and I am sorry to say, person or not, a fetus caught at a sufficiently early stage is certainly not a rational being, by any stretch of the imagination. Kant goes as far, I believe, as to assert that \"rational beings are persons\", and his entire argument is built around an ethics for \"rational beings\", persons who have their own goals and objectives.\n \n So I very much dispute that Kant's position can be construed in any way as treating feti as ends, and as in asserting that a woman is treated as an end by forcing her to carry a child to term against her will.\n \n The universalisability of the Kantian framework, the categorical imperative, makes it difficult to see how you could assert simply \"mothers are responsible for their feti, if they played a part in getting pregnant\", without universalising this principle to apply responsibility to a great many other situations. To interpret the categorical imperative this narrowly leaves it essentially meaningless.\n \n But what is more puzzling is how such a position would ever lead to the specific assertions you make, how does treating people as ends and not means lead to \"a person is a responsible for their fetus\", or \"cruel actions that result in deaths are murders\" or other things along those lines - there is no chain of reasoning I can see that in any way links the two.",

Once the law is false you can derive nothing further from it without putting it through more tests. I suggest reading up on some basic logical fallacies: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent\n \n\n If you think it is obvious people had will, you should also think it obvious that feti are not people.\n \n\n Why? Expand on this declaration.\n \n\n You can assume feti have the moral properties of people, but not people in the Kantian sense. If Kant produces an ethics for rational beings, they do not apply to non-rational beings.\n \n If you wish to derive ethics from Kant, you must derive ethics from Kant - you cannot simply construct straw man opponents and knock them down with Kant.\n\n You should never tell a person what their ethics must and must not be in an ethical debate. It is on your shoulders to be prepared to refute their ethics directly if you believe they are wrong, the origin of which has no bearing. If you believe that personal ethics must fall directly within certain borders created by arbitrary philosophers you've got a serious problem. If you cannot refute my argument without telling me what I am and am not allowed to believe ethically you are throwing up your hands in conceit. My arguments are not straw men, I have explained why and those reasons should not be difficult to discern. (Not to mention you have still not proven why feti would be considered non-rational by Kant, even if I did believe his word was Truth, which is something you clearly want).",

   "It's been a while since I had a class containing formal logic, so I apologize that I don't remember all the symbols. Let's see...\n 1. Feti might be people.\n 2. Any action that knowingly and significantly raises the chances of a person you are responsible for's untimely demise without the threat of greater loss to the one making the action is murder.\n 3. Abortion results in greater loss to the fetus than the mother.\n 4. You are responsible for your feti.\n 5. If feti are people, the act of abortion knowingly and significantly raises the chances of a person's untimely demise.\n 6. Abortion might be murder.\n \n In other words:\n 1. A\n 2. If (B and C and D) then E.\n 3. D\n 4. C\n 5. If A, then B.\n 6. E\n \n\n \n Okay the first line requires a modal operator and two quantifiers. Using \"V\" as the universal quantifer and using \"[]\" to indicate the possible mode, we can rewrite this as: \n \n 1. Any fetus may be a person, symbolized as: Vf|[](f = p) \n \n Now, onto line 2. This is another identity statement, rather than a conditional whose antecedent is a conjunction, and one that uses predicates at that. We can wrap the \"significantly raises the chances\" under the clause of untimely death. We can rewrite this as:\n \n 2. Any action that knowingly leads to untimely death is murder, symbolized as: Va|Ua = m \n \n Line 3 is just a simple object-predicate relation:\n \n 3. Abortion results in greater loss to the fetus than the mother such that it is an action that knowingly leads to untimely death, symbolized as: Vf|(Lf < Lm|Ua))\n \n Line 4, like line 3, is again just a simple object-predicate relation, rewritten as:\n \n 4. You are responsible for all of your feti, symbolized as: Vf|Rf\n \n Line 5 is a conditional, but not in the form that you have translated it. If we are to say:\n \n 5. If feti are people, and the act of abortion knowingly leads to the untimely death of that person, and the act of abortion results in greater loss to that person than to the mother, then abortion may be murder, symbolized as: Vf, Va|([]((f = p)) & (Ua = m) & (Lf < Lm|Ua)) [If/Then] ([](fUa = m))\n \n Line 6, like line 1, specifies a possibility and therefore requires a modal operator and may be rewritten: \n \n 6. Abortion may be murder, symbolized: Va, Vf|[](fUa = m)\n \n So while the derivation you provided was valid, it was not the argument that you were trying to make. Your derivation should have looked like:\n \n 1. Vf|[](f = p)\n 2. Va|Ua = m\n 3. Vf|(Lf < Lm|Ua))\n 4. Vf|Rf\n 5. Vf, Va|([]((f = p)) & (Ua = m) & (Lf < Lm|Ua)) [If/Then] ([](fUa = m))\n 6. Va, Vf|[](fUa = m)\n \n Written like that, line 4 seems pretty superfluous to your argument.\n \n Moreover, the conclusion that abortion may be murder seems to me to be question-begging, because it is precisely what we are trying to determine. \n \n \nKeep in mind that we are assuming that abortion is murder in the instance of this \"proof,\" if you don't keep that in mind it won't really make sense (so for example, 1 really reads \"Feti are people.\"). Furthermore, I realize [2] could be worded more clearly, but I am reluctant to reword it for that sake because \"certain people\" enjoy using the revising of that logic against me. If I word to reword [2] for clarity's sake it would read:\n 2. If an action knowingly and significantly raises the chances of a person's untimely demise, and you are responsible for that person, and that action threatens the one making it less than the one receiving it, then the action is murder.\nSo you're assuming that abortion is murder, and concluding that abortion is murder. I'm sorry, but I think you'll need an argument that doesn't beg the question, and that establishes your claim.\n \n You'll need to start from premises that do not assume such a claim, and your conclusion will need to be an actual identity claim rather than a possible identity claim.",
