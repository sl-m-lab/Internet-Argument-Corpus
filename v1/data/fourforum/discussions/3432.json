   "I would love to see a link for these \"facts\" that say the bible coudn't have been written by humans. Can you show me a link that proves you didn't make this up! Not that we doubt you but It is a tough one to digest without tums.\n\n God warned Adam and Eve that if they ate of the forbidden tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they would surely die, and they did. They forfeited life in Eden, the \"garden of delight.\"' The ground was cursed for their sakes, and brought forth thorns and thistles (Genesis 3:17-18). Disobedience to the Creator and His fixed creation decree for man and the world reaped hostility of creation denied toward man.\n \n We find this principle reiterated elsewhere in Scripture. The creation, when denied by man's rebellion against God, witnesses to God's eternal power and Godhead (Romans 1:18-20) by strictly enforcing man's submission to its inherent, fixed laws by peril, pain, sickness and death. For example, when Cain killed his brother Abel, Abel's blood cried to God from the ground which had received it. The result was Cain's, the tiller of the ground's, being \"cursed from the earth,\" so that henceforth it would no longer \"yield her strength\" to him (Genesis 4:3-121.\n \n The creation witnesses man's deeds Joshua could say of a stone that \"it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God\" (Joshua 24:27). Moses therefore quite literally called upon the heavens and the earth to hear his words to the people of Israel in praise of the Lord (Deuteronomy 32:1-3). Most striking of all Bible passages about the witness of creation itself against God-denying man is a statement of Jesus Christ Himself. When the Pharisees asked Him to rebuke His disciples for welcoming Him as \"the King coming in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest\" (Luke 19:38), He answered: \"I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out' (LuKe 19:40).\n \n The rest of creation watches and suffers while man himself is subject to the bondage of corruption due to his rebellion against the Creator. The apostle Paul tells us of this fact in one of the Bible's most revelatory, sad, yet gloriously hopeful passages (Romans 8:18-23). This passage teaches that redemption in Christ is effective not only for believing, born-again \"children of God\" in their \"glorious liberty\" (Romans 8:211, but also all His creation. Our God's eternal purpose is established in and from the beginning of creation (Acts 15.18) and forever. The fixed laws and created individual entities of creation which we observe and must conform to are but the results and the proof of His eternal dominion and providence.\n \n While originally made for God's joy and man's benefit, creation is of necessity hostile to men ignoring or defying it. Just so a hot stove, invented to cook nourishing and delicious food, painfully blisters the finger of the child who disregards his elder's warning, \"don't touch HOT\" We see the hostility and, so to speak, retribution of creation in our own bodies. We require a balanced diet and sufficient rest for well-being and life itself. We inevitably suffer when denying our bodily needs and limits. This is a commonplace of elementary knowledge, and it is a corollary of the fixed created identify of man. So is the innate 24-hour rhythm or cycle of our bodily functions, found also in many other organisms. Man's body rebels when this rhythm is violated, for instance in transcontinental air travel through the well-known \"jet lag.\" This rhythm fits the biblical record of creation in six 24-hour days, but it does not fit supposed eons of evolving time and time spans. Many more examples exist which show that the denial of our physical created identity and its fixed needs and limits entails our physical suffering. While everyone really knows this, the basis and explanation of this fact in creation is not often recognized.\n \n In other practical matters the fixed laws and boundaries of creation are plain and inescapable. Anyone working with plants knows that he will reap what he sows, that different plants require different conditions of soil and climate, that plants cannot live without water, that there are limits to selective breeding determined by the gene pool of the kind of plant we work with, and soon. All this is true for animal husbandry as well. Sometimes we \"stretch\" the limits of the original kind by purchasing one desired trait at the cost of sacrificing another. Likewise, we disregard the specific qualities of the materials we use in construction and engineering only at our peril. Especially in medicine the penalties of faulty medication are immediately evident, proving the fixity of created, inherent qualities of both medicinal substances and of the human body.\n \n Man's practical existence in this world is thus evidently dependent upon his knowledge of and obedience to certain fixed principles. Now fixed principles are compatible with biblical creation, but not with the fundamental flux and change of any and all evolutionist models. Evolutionist belief in perennial flux and change at the root of all phenomena cannot account for the fact that poison does not heal but kills, that oaks always grow from acorns, or any other fixity of nature. To the evolutionist, the common truth of gardening and agriculture which provides his physical sustenance, \"as you sow, so shall you reap, must be false, asfor him genetic and environmental change takes place continually, eithergradually(Darwinism) or by \"mega-leaps\" (Gould-Eldredge's punctuated equilibrium). Because of theirdenial of creation and its fixed kinds and laws, evolutionists could not produce and really cannot account for the rise of modern science, Instead, modern scientific advances had to await the coming and expansion of biblical creation-based Christianity (see Stanley Jaki, Science and Creation).\n \n What all this amounts to is that evolutionism militates against survival of any and all natural entities. Darwinist evolutionism with its gradual transmutation of species amounts to continual dying out of species as they are transformed. Punctuated equilibrium evolutionism is really an accommodation to the fundamentally creationist \"appearances\" of the fossil record and the world we observe, that is, \"stasis\" or absence of cnange and flux. The very \"mega-leaps\" it postulates require genetic changes of a kind (mutation)which almost always instantly kills. Furthermore, the strange new entity suddenly arising through an alleged genetic \"mega-leap\" requires not flux, butfixity both of its own kind and in the world around it if it is to survive. This is really the error of evolutionism, and the proof for creation, in a nutshell: survival requires fixity of inheritance, environment, and behavior. Evolution, as evolution, denies fixity Creation, as creation, establishes fixity. The god of theistic evolution cannot be a true God because he is the author of fluxand death ratherthan fixed creation and thus survival-life.\n \n Probably the denial of creation most harmful and hostile to man himself is found in human society. The history of mankind, particularly in our own century, clearly confirms that creation denied becomes the enemy of creationdenying man It is as Whittaker Chambers has written: \"Man cannot organize the world for himself without God; without God man can only organize the world against man. \"2 In its most innocuous form this fact is shown by creationdenying man's inability to give reliable advice and guidance to his fellow men. A humble erstwnile evolutionist college professor admitted that he \"wasn't able to offer much guidance as a teacher. I thought my ideas were no better than anybodyelse's, and I never considered God's ideas. So, it was a matter of `what works for you,' which wasn't too helpful to students, of course,\"3 A lack of values and fixed principles from which to counsel naturally stems from any perspective ignoring creation.\n \n Active pursuit of philosophies, policies and views denying creation wreaks even more navoc upon man, precisely to the extent of their consistency and mplementation. C.S. Lewis sums up what happens:\n \n What Satan put into the heads of our remote ancestors was the idea that they could \"be like gods\" could set up on their own as if they had created themselves . . . And out of that hopeless attempt has come money, poverty, ambition, war, prostitution, classes, empires, slavery the long terrible story of man trying to fins something other than God which will make him happy.\n \n The reason why it can never succeed is this. God made us; invented us as a man invents an engine. A car is made to run on gasoline, and it could not run properly on anything else. Now God designed the human machine to run on Himself. He Himself is the fuel our spirits were assigned to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on There is no other That is why it is just no good asking God to make us happy in our own way\n \n That is the key to history. Terrific energy is expended civilizations are built. . . but . . Some fatal flaw always brings the selfish and cruel people to the top and it all slides back into misery and ruin. In fact, the machine conks They are trying to run on the wrong juice.4\n \n On occasion even passionate enemies of God and creation themselves recognize this truth dimly in their own despair. For example, V.I. Lenin wrote in a letter of 1921: \"I hope we will be hanged on a stinking rope ... If this happens, it will be well done.\"5 Lenin had already acknowledged earlier that \"The [Soviet] state does not function as we desired. How does it function? The car does not obey. A man is at the wheel and seems to lead it, but the car does not drive in the desired direction.\"6\n \n In his famous poem, \"The Hound of Heaven,\" FrancisThompson has unforgettably expressed the truth that created reality is the enemy of all who would deny God and His creation:\n \n I fled Him, down the nights and down the days;\n I fled Him, down the arches of the years;\n I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways\n Of my own mind; and in the mist of tears\n I hid from Him, and under running laughter,\n From those strong Feet that followed, followed after.\n They beat and a Voice beat\n More instant than the Feet\n \"All things betray thee, who betrayest Me.\"\n \"Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me.\"\n \"Lo! naught contents thee, who content'st not Me.\"7\n Our very misery, pain and death arising from denying creation and the Creator testify to the truth of creation as the foundation of reality, life and survival. In this hostility of creation denied, \"the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold down the truth in unrighteousness; because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse\" (Romans 1:18-20).\n http://www.creationism.org/csshs/v09n2p04.htm here's another",

   "These factual facts are in fact the facts that the facts support and that's one facted up fact.\n\n Even today, many scientists reject particles-to-people evolution (i.e. everything made itself). The staff scientists working at the Creation Science Foundation have published many scientific papers in their own fields. Dr Russell Humphreys, a nuclear physicist working with Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has over 20 articles in physics journals, while Dr John Baumgardner's catastrophic plate tectonics theory was published in Nature. Dr Edward Boudreaux of the University of New Orleans has published 26 articles and four books in physical chemistry. Dr Maciej Giertych, Head of the Department of Genetics at the Institute of Dendrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, has published 90 papers in scientific journals. Dr Aw Swee-Eng was Associate Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Singapore, and is now Head of the Department of Nuclear Medicine and Director of Clinical Research at Singapore General Hospital. So an oft-repeated charge that no real scientist rejects evolution is completely without foundation.\n Thanks toAnswers In Genesis for this.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The best argument that there is a GOD - and it often moved me deeply - is this one that he proves from generation of species: a cow always bears a cow, a horse a horse, etc. No goldfinch produces a siskin. Therefore it is necessary to conclude that there is something that directs everything thus. ---Martin Luther (350 yrs. before Darwin).\n \n 1. I love science. The further it advances, the more it disproves \"Darwinian\" evolution. In fact, science has advanced to the point that almost all secular scientists have completely abandoned \"Darwinian\" evolution in favor of \"rapid mutation\", \"radial symmetry\", \"punctuated equilibrium\", or variations of this far-out theory. It is the only explanation (in their minds) for the complete lack of fossil evidence (despite literally millions of discovered fossils) of any specie changing into another. There is no such thing as macro-evolution. Micro-evolution, however, is very possible and is in fact explained in the Bible. \"...all their \"kinds\" and all their variations.\" In other words, species adapt, sometimes quite quickly. However, a finch is still a finch (irony intended) after adapting. A lizard is still a lizard and a monkey is still a monkey ! Charles Darwin himself summed it up best in his \"book.\" \"Noting the abundance of fossils, numerous transitionals must be found to prove my theory.\" Enough said !\n Science, real science-the work that ferrets out empirical facts about the nature that surrounds us-has been co-opted by an ancient philosophical/religious doctrine the origins of which can be traced back to at least 400-700 years before Christ. Known today variously as scientism, evolutionism, metaphysical naturalism, and Darwinism, this doctrine has been so effectively interlaced with science that it is often difficult for the scientist, much less the layperson, to separate the two.\n \n \n 2. The research dealing with mans \"evolution\" from the apes (or to be specious, ape-like ancestors) begins with the assumption that man did in fact evolve from the apes. No observations or interpretations are allowed to question this apriori assumption. What has been sought in paleo-anthropology then are the transitional stages from ape-like animals to man. Transitional forms have proven as elusive here, however, as between any other plants or animals. In short, the missing link remains missing.\n In conclusion, it seems there is no end to the speculation over the bestial ancestry of man and it would appear that all scientific caution has been thrown to the wind. However, with today's scientific advantages and advances we will see evolution falling farther by the wayside scientifically and advanced as fact philosophically to our children. There is more than ample evidence for mans sudden and abrupt appearance-creation if you will-and absolutely none for a long gradient process or evolution. It takes more faith to believe in evolution than it does creation. One is easily proven and apparent while the other is frauds and tricks.\n http://evolutionlie.faithweb.com/\n is this better?",

   "Even today, many scientists reject particles-to-people evolution (i.e. everything made itself). The staff scientists working at the Creation Science Foundation have published many scientific papers in their own fields. Dr Russell Humphreys, a nuclear physicist working with Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has over 20 articles in physics journals, while Dr John Baumgardner's catastrophic plate tectonics theory was published in Nature. Dr Edward Boudreaux of the University of New Orleans has published 26 articles and four books in physical chemistry. Dr Maciej Giertych, Head of the Department of Genetics at the Institute of Dendrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, has published 90 papers in scientific journals. Dr Aw Swee-Eng was Associate Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Singapore, and is now Head of the Department of Nuclear Medicine and Director of Clinical Research at Singapore General Hospital. So an oft-repeated charge that no real scientist rejects evolution is completely without foundation.\n Thanks toAnswers In Genesis for this.\n\n \n John R.

   "\n The best argument that there is a GOD - and it often moved me deeply - is this one that he proves from generation of species: a cow always bears a cow, a horse a horse, etc. No goldfinch produces a siskin.

   "Most non-scientists seem to be quite confused about precise definitions of biological evolution. Such confusion is due in large part to the inability of scientists to communicate effectively to the general public and also to confusion among scientists themselves about how to define such an important term. When discussing evolution it is important to distinguish between the existence of evolution and various theories about the mechanism of evolution. And when referring to the existence of evolution it is important to have a clear definition in mind. What exactly do biologists mean when they say that they have observed evolution or that humans and chimps have evolved from a common ancestor? \n \n One of the most respected evolutionary biologists has defined biological evolution as follows: \n \n \"In the broadest sense, evolution is merely change, and so is all-pervasive; galaxies, languages, and political systems all evolve. Biological evolution ... is change in the properties of populations of organisms that transcend the lifetime of a single individual. The ontogeny of an individual is not considered evolution; individual organisms do not evolve. The changes in populations that are considered evolutionary are those that are inheritable via the genetic material from one generation to the next. Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different alleles within a population (such as those determining blood types) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest protoorganism to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.\" \n \n Evolution is a process that results in heritable changes in a population spread over many generations. \n This is a good working scientific definition of evolution; one that can be used to distinguish between evolution and similar changes that are not evolution. Another common short definition of evolution can be found in many textbooks: \n \n \"In fact, evolution can be precisely defined as any change in the frequency of alleles within a gene pool from one generation to the next.\" \n - Helena Curtis and N. Sue Barnes, Biology, 5th ed. 1989 Worth Publishers, p.974 \n \n One can quibble about the accuracy of such a definition (and we have often quibbled on these newsgroups) but it also conveys the essence of what evolution really is. When biologists say that they have observed evolution, they mean that they have detected a change in the frequency of genes in a population. (Often the genetic change is inferred from phenotypic changes that are heritable.) When biologists say that humans and chimps have evolved from a common ancestor they mean that there have been successive heritable changes in the two separated populations since they became isolated.  \n Unfortunately the common definitions of evolution outside of the scientific community are different\n Standard dictionaries are even worse. \n \n \n \"evolution: ...the doctrine according to which higher forms of life have gradually arisen out of lower..\" - Chambers \n \"evolution: ...the development of a species, organism, or organ from its original or primitive state to its present or specialized state; phylogeny or ontogeny\" - Webster's \n \n \n These definitions are simply wrong. Unfortunately it is common for non-scientists to enter into a discussion about evolution with such a definition in mind. This often leads to fruitless debate since the experts are thinking about evolution from a different perspective. When someone claims that they don't believe in evolution they cannot be referring to an acceptable scientific definition of evolution because that would be denying something which is easy to demonstrate. It would be like saying that they don't believe in gravity!  \n \n excerpts from What is Evolution?\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html",

   "Natural selection and evolution are 2 different subjects.\n\n Not really. Evolution is a change in the allele frequencies in populations over time. Natural selection is one of the mechanisms that causes the changes. There are others.\n \nBasically with non-intelligent (when we were \"apes\" etc.) if it helped us survive, we kept using it and we kept it.\n\n Aside from the fact that we were never apes but actually share a common ancestor with apes, I think that you are on the right track even though you expressed it badly. One might infer from your statement that organisms have some choice as to whether they should use or not use some genetic charistic. Not true. Some genetic characteristics offer advantages that allow survival to reproduce and thus pass along the advantageous characteristics in greater numbers than organisms without that characteristic. For example, brown polar bears would be at a disadvantage while white polar bears tend to survive to reproduce. Thus, you don't see brown polar bears - except on the ACB islands of Alaska, where the brown bears are genetically indistinguishable from polar bears except that they are indistinguishable from any other brown bear in appearance.\n \nNow that we have more motives than just to eat, sleep, and reproduce, we do other things for enjoyment and entertainment.\n\n So do my dog and cat. They both chase anole lizards that they then leave dead in the middle of the living room floor. They chase each other and roll about on the floor in apparent combat with never a scratch inflicted. My dog has a small ball that she brings and puts in my hand so that I will throw it for her to chase. The day that we mow the lawn is a big day in my dog's life. She dashes around checking on the progress of the mowing, edging, and blowing. Her actions are much more than just to eat, sleep and reproduce. She has fun.\n \nSo when we keep using a skill or something like that it gets passed down to our children.\n\n Skills are learned. You aren't talking about evolution but sociology. Evolution is a matter of genetically heritable characteristics.\n \nTo my understanding that's what evolution is, use it or lose it, and if it helps you survive, most animals (including humans) use it.\n\n Actually, it is a matter of selective pressure. Does a characteristic offer an advantage? The it will likely become more common in a population. Is a characteristic a disadvantage? Then it will likely become less common. Neutral characteristics can go either way, and a mutation that changes a neutral characteristic, which would tend to remain stable, either causes it to increase (as an advantage) or to decrease (as a disadvantage).\n \nOn the note of natural selection, that's more common sense than anything else.\n\n Well, when Darwin explained his theory to T.H. Huxley, Huxley said, \"How stupid of me not to have seen that.\"\n \nBasically it's that if you do stupid stuff (like decide to not eat, not sleep, jump in the way of cars, shoot yourself, etc.) you don't pass your genes on to your children (because you don't have any).\n\n What are you talking about? Natural selection is a differential reproductive advantage gained from advantageous genetic characteristics. Fast gazelles tend to reproduce more often than slow ones. People who don't have MD or ALS tend to reproduce in greater numbers than those who do. Deciding to do \"stupid stuff\" has nothing to do with natural selection. Natural selection is an antibiotic resistant bacterium, or an insecticide resistant lawn pest. Natural selection isn't a decision. It is a statistical tendency.\n \nApplied to evolution this means instead of being stupid, they did stuff where they couldn't survive, so they didn't pass their genes on.\n\n Nope. It has nothing to do with stupidity.\n \nMaybe that's why we're getting stupider as a species: when we're stupid now we can still stay alive.\n\n I don't even see how that follows from your incorrect argument. Stupidity has nothing to do with it. Natural selection (as only one of the mechanisms of evolution) is a matter of genetic characteristics that offer an advantage that allows the organism to reproduce.",
