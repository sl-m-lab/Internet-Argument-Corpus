   "How did the first cell come about?\n \n It's just that that is what evolution hinges on, not how a monkey became a man.\n\n First, no one claims that a monkey became a man. I could also make snide remarks about religion that display zero understanding, but I won't.\n \n Second, evolution doesn't hinge on the origin of the first cell. Let me give you a parallel example. In 1942 the first self-sustaining fission reaction was accomplished. This was done without ever seeing an atom, a proton, or a neutron. This was done without even understanding how uranium came about. You see, even back then it was understood that the energy production of the sun was the result of the fussion of hydrogen, but the source of any of the higher elements wasn't understood.\n \n I guess that means that all of that science that produced atomic bombs and then hydrogen bombs was wrong. They were doing science without understanding the origin of any of those elements. Why is it that fusion of hydrogen produces energy and fission of uranium does too? Why is it that it takes energy to split helium and it takes energy to fuse iron?\n \n Those questions were answered in my life time. Turns out that the science was mostly right even though the origin of the elements wasn't understood. The origin wasn't important to the theory.\n \n Let me try another. Is it important that you understand the process of automobile manufacture in order to learn to drive? Doesn't your ability to learn how to operate a car hinge on how it was made?\n \n Evolution is the science that explains the observed changed in the heritable characteristics of living organisms. It presumes that the organisms are alive and makes no attempt to explain the origin of that life. If you wish to claim that your magic sky-man did it, OK. That is irrelevant to the theories of evolution. Again, evolution presumes life.\n \n While I strongly suspect that the origins of life are naturalistic, and therefore explainable by naturalistic methods (like science), evolution doesn't require that it be so. And in the studies of the origins of life, evolutionary concepts have been used and applied. But that doesn't make evolutionary theory invalid any more than your inability to explain the origin of your god makes your religion invalid.",

How the first \"cell\" came about is of no concern of the theory of evolution as that theory deals with change in living organisms only. It will be concerned with how the second and third cells differed from the first, but not where the first one came from. In fact the theory is so unconcerned with how live started, there is no contradiction in someone believing in a god creating the first cell and letting evolution do the rest of the work. There are studies into how life might have started in purely naturistic (ie without a god waving a magic wand) means and its called abiogenesis.\n \n 2. The theory of thermodynamics includes a law dealing with entropy. It crudely speaking talks in terms of a closed system tending to entropy. Life isn't a closed system as it has energy from the sun and the earth fed into it. A simplified analogy is the tower block. If one took the strawman of the \"laws of entropy\" seriously, we would have to give up building them, as they would be impossible for we take a pile of disordered parts and build an ordered structure from it. Of course its not impossible, it just requires lots of energy to achieve.\n \n 3. Information theory is a diverse subject and the exact nature of the information depends on context. If I am transmitting information, I need to be concerned with noise (unhelpfully called entropy, though it has nothing to do with the entropy of thermodynamics) and generally the more ordered the signal, the more information it contains. If I'm interested in compression, the opposite is the case for regular sequences contain less information and thus can be compressed more. The upshot of this is that a mutation that adds a single base pair to a chromosome adds information (and at the same time may also decrease the information, all depending on how information is measured).\n \n But I still maintain that you should make the effort to learn about these subjects for yoursefl, to really understand why you ask poor questions and to enable you to ask better questions in the future.",

As has been explained to you now on several occasions, the theories of evolution do not deal with the origin of life. By definition, evolution considers changes in living things. If you with to claim that your magic, invissible, being created the first living cell, then you are free to do so.\n \n...as it is a scientific question and is supported by science's own discoveries (Pasteur, etc).\n\n You are confused. Pasteur's work dealt primarily with fermentation. He first showed that fermintation was caused by an organism (yeast), and that if that organism were excluded or destroyed, then fermentation didn't occur. He then demonstrated that milk spoiled because of the introduction of invisible organisms. Pasteur believed that these organisms were present in the air and were so small that they were invisible. He showed that wine spoiled for the same reason. He demonstrated that these organisms did not arise spontaneously in the wine/milk but were introduced from external sources.\n \nAnother problem with evolution is that it is constantly taught as an increase in order and complexity while the very laws of entropy and evolution work against it.\n\n More confusion. Evolution isn't taught as an increase in complexity. Perhaps you should learn the basics of what you claim to oppose before you speak. Also, is makes no sense to state that the laws of evolution work against evolution.\n \n As for entropy, technically there is no such thing as a \"law\" of entropy. Entropy is relevant in a discussion of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. Entropy is a property of a system. In statistical thermodynamics entropy is stated differently. It is the multiciplicity of configurations of a given state of a system. In this case, the word disorder is used. Creationists tend to confuse this with a messy room or with complexity.\n \nEvolution, contrary to popular belief, does not add information to the genetic code. It rather refines the information already present.\n\n Tally ho, Nallyo! Off you go on a different subject. Now we are into information theory. Please define information. Are you talking about Shannon information, since by that definition an increase of information in the message is by definition impossible. That is the usual technique of creationists. Shannon information isn't actually applicable to biology.\n \nEntropy talks about the breakdown of materials/systems over time, not the building up of them.\n\n Who cares what entropy talks about if you don't understand what it is. While the entropy of a closed system can never decrease, there is nothing that prevents a decrease in entropy in one region at the expense of an equal or greater decrease in another region.

   "How did the pyramids get built after the flood with only a few people?\n\n A good question. Not only the pyramids, but all of the archaeological wonders of ancient Egypt. We know that the Egyptian civilization is very old and that the pyramids were build almost 4800 years ago. This presents a real problem for Noah's flood. The pyramids show no signs of having ever been covered by water so either we have to crowd the civilization of Egypt into an impossibly short time after the flood, or the flood has to be moved from the usual 4500 years ago to some time to allow for the thousands of years necessary for the Egyptian civilization. But if we do that, the whole basis of the chronology of the creation and the flood from the Bible becomes nonsense.\n \n And as you correctly point out, how long after the flood would it take for the population of the earth to grow to the point where a workforce large enough to build the pyramids could exist? Remember, there is also the necessity of Babel and the Chinese civilizations that are also older than the usual date of the flood.\n \nWhere did all the water go?\n \n Yes. And where did it come from. If anyone would like to see what the vapor canopy looked like, you have to go outside on an overcast day to get some idea. Of course, there isn't enough water in a heavy cloud layer to cause flooding on the scale of Noah's flood, so the \"vapor canopy\" must have been quite dense and thick. And that vapor would have increased the air pressure at the surface to the equivalent of several thousand feet of water. In addition to the greenhouse effect of such a canopy, it would have been full of latent heat. Of course, when vapor condenses to water it releases latent heat. In the case of enough water to cover the highest mountains, the heat released would have been enough to raise the air temperature above boiling.\n \n The vapor canopy is a silly idea based on no evidence. It is an ad hoc response to try to explain the source of the water.\n \n But of course, it would have required more additional water to flood the earth to cover the mountains than exists on earth today.

Please demonstrate the intelligent mind in the process of evolution.\n \nPlease stop bringing up the Egyptian pyramids argument.\n\n Why, because you can't answer it? I thought so.

I don't underestimate what the Egyptians did and am perfectly aware that they didn't have computers as powerful as those we have today. \n As has been pointed out (try to pay attention this time) the pyramids cause problems for creationism that you don't seem to understand. Or are you merely trying to raise a red herring? You are arguing against points that weren't made. You seem to be thrashing around in a desperate effort to make your mythology seem rational.\n \n The usual date of the flood of Noah claimed by leading creationists is about 4500 years ago. This figure is based on the geneologies of the Bible. The same method that gives an age of the earth at about 6,000 years. The age of the pyramids by all reliable measures is greater than 4500 years, and there is a history of the Egyptian civilization that extends back farther than that, to at least 5000 years ago, including several other pyramids that clearly demonstrate the learning process of pyramid building. The stepped pyramid was build around 2750 B.C., about 250 years before the flood, and the Great Pyramid at Giza was built about 2600 years B.C. That means that they were there before the flood - and yet they show no sign of ever being under water.\n \n The only options are to push the date of the flood back far enough into the past to allow enough time for a population to grow large enough to build the pyramids. I don't care what you think of the technology of the Egyptions, there wouldn't have been enough people to build those pyramids for many, many years after the flood.\n \nand 2) the Egyptians had the slave labor of a nation, the enslaved Israelites.\n\n Nonsense. In spite of what you saw at the movies, the Israelites didn't build the pyramids. There is no record in Egyptian history at the time of the building of the pyramids of the Israelites.\n \n Check this site: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/pyramid/explore/age2.html",

   "Please stop bringing up the Egyptian pyramids argument. Two things: 1) we often underestimate what previous generations can do since they didn't have our technology (hence, the reason many people cannot believe we got to the moon on computers that were 1/10 the computers we have as PCs today) and 2) the Egyptians had the slave labor of a nation, the enslaved Israelites.\n\n \n Why should we stop bringing it up? It's a valid question! \n Your source of information seens to xcome from B grade movies, the Egyptians never used slave labour. The labour was a well paid and well fed willing workforce.\n Now, perhaps you can address the questions as stated above, instead of running away.\n How about addressing the problen you have with the Tigris and Euprates? You know, the rivers that were described in the bible and the very same rivers that are still there after the flood.\n hmmmmm?",

   "More about the building of the pyramids:\n \n In order to get to the population of today, Henry Morris assumes a population of 2 about 4000 years ago and a growth rate of 0.5% per year. The actual population growth rate between 1900 and 2000 was more like 0.133% according to the Encyclopedia Britannica.\n \n But no matter, let's use Dr. Morris' number of 0.5% per year. Now since the pyramids show no sign of a flood, we must assume that they were built after the flood. So how many people would have been available to build the pyramids in the years after the flood. We will presume that the entire population of the earth was involved in this work and that there were no plagues or disasters the could have altered the rate of population growth.\n \n If we begin with 8 people, 100 years later there would have been 13 (13.1733) available to build the pyramids. After 500 years there would have been about 97 (96.8547). How about after 1000 years? 1172. That is an absurd number and the time would have been only 1500 years before the birth of Christ. When Christ was born, the population of the entire world would have been 2,080,867.\n \n By the way, you can calculate it yourself. The population (P) after any number of years (N) would be P = 8 * 1.005^N\n \n Is it any wonder that Nallyo doesn't like us bringing it up?",

   "Now be serious, I don't want to hear any more \"scotty beamed it down\" theories, plotter. How do evolutionists believe that the first cell came to be?\n\n \n Requsite note that evolution does not concern itself with the origin of life, and the accepting evolution does not require you to believe that the origin of life was naturalistic.\n \n The first cell was not created ex nihilo, it emerged from earlier replicators. These replicators themselves evolved from earlier replicators still.\n \n We do not know for certain anything about the very first life on earth. It is highly unlikely we ever will (almost zero chance of fossilisation, almost zero chance of finding them even if they did) however we are getting someway towards formulating a credible path for its emergence.\n \n The most likely candidates for the origin of life are hydrothermal vents. What probably happened is that near one of these vents the heat and chemical composition formed amino acids, these acids may have collected in a small hollow or indentation in a rock and by absolute brute chance formed a self-replicating polypetide sequence. This sequence may have been as short as 40 amino acids. Being a not-very-good replicator it will have produced a vast number of mutants, most of these mutants were, of course, not replicators themselves but others were.\n \n Now, each replicator will require certain chemicals to produce the copy from, other chemicals may help the reaction and other chemicals will be produced as by-products from these rections. Now, it is again likely that some of the by-products from some replicators would help other replicators. And sometimes groups of replicators would form (a-<b-<c-<d-<a, say) where a's by-product helps b, b helps c, c helps d and d helps a.\n \n These groups are called hyper-cycles. Hyper-cycles are significant because they allow the replicators to solve a significant problem - small replicators aren't very good and so have a maximum length they can be before the poorness of their replication prevents from producing a reasonable number of exact copies.\n \n From hyper-cycles came later replicators such as RNA, it is perhaps also possible that some of these hyper-cycles produced protective lipid-bubbles (psuedo-cells?) to protect themselves.\n \n Things then passed through a stage popularly known as 'RNA-world' where RNA formed the most common replicator. Somewhere among this RNA-based life the first cells emerged. DNA also emerged as a better storage method than RNA - it is a matter of debate whether cells or DNA came first.\n \n This first cell was nothing like modern cells. It probably had no nucleus, and certainly no organelles.\n \n You may well feel the above is highly speculative, and you'd be right. We don't know how life originated on earth - the research needed is being done now. That's because it's science. Science doesn't have all the answers, it doesn't have complete truth - it just gets closer all the time.\n \n Research has shown that amino acids can be formed from inorganic materials by natural processes. Research has shown that polypeptides can self-replicate. Research has shown that RNA can self-replicate. Research has shown the plausability of the RNA-world model. Research has produced likely life-trees tracing all life back to something akin to the Archae and hyperthermophiles. While mathematical modelling can demonstrate the theoretical possibility of the various steps in the model above.",

Remarkably simply chemistry is required to produce these (many lipids will form cell like-structure when placed in water), and it certainly not beyond the capabilities of RNA to produce these from raw materials.\n \n Originally, cells were probably effectively colonies of indepent RNA molecules - but over time those that maintained functional groupings of RNA (i.e. those that reproduced as a whole) would have an advantage over this that did not.\n \n \nAlso, how do these naked amino acids replicate? In a cell, a large number of enzymes and energy go into producing a replica from other materials present.\n\n \n Amino acids don't (and can't) replicate. Larger structures composed from amino acids can. While DNA requires a whole load of complicated help to replicate, simpler replicators do not.

The heartbeat of a rat is required because it maintains the chemistry of the rat, without the pumping of the blood to bring oxygen to the organs and take damaging by-products away the chemistry of the rat will change.
