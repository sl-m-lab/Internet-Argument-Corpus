Whether that's an 'actual change' or not depends on your definition of the situation.\n \n James.",

   "The key change in the plan is that US Forces will remain in the areas they sweep. Previously, patrols would pass through a sector, clean out the bad guys, then leave whereupon the bad guys would return. \n \n Where before, we were content to go into the kitchen, turn the lights on, squash the roaches, then pad off to bed, now we will remain in the kitchen with the swatter poised and the light on. Problem is, it costs money to burn that light. \n \n The upside of all of this is that my brigade's rotation will speed up and we will likely return sooner than anticipated. That being said, I'm still curious why my 19 year old buddy from Oklahoma can go through 8 weeks of basic training, 13 weeks of andvanced training and then deploy to Baghdad while a 19 year old Baghdad resident who has had three years to train is not up to snuff. Yeah, I know -intuitively I understand that the US Soldier has the benefit of an established military training program. Still, you'd think that the Baghdaddy would at least be familiar with the territory...It is just troubling....Sadly, I agreed with much of what Durbin said and I despise the man. I just can't argue with him right now. When Democrats start making sense \"now gods stand up for bastards\" - Othello.",
