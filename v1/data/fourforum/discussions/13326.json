   "Winston Smith", 
   "WHEN Barack Obama outlined his vision for health reform to Congress on September 9th, he insisted that any bill must cut the uninsured by 30m, cost only $900 billion and raise the federal deficit not \"one dime\". The leading congressional bills thus far fail the test, but Max Baucus, the head of the Senate's powerful Finance Committee, now says he can pull this off.\n \n After intense bipartisan negotiations, Mr Baucus (pictured) unveiled his bill on September 16th. His effort would force most Americans to obtain cover, but in return insurers must agree not to drop coverage because customers have \"pre-existing conditions\" or because spending caps have been reached.\n \n To expand coverage, the plan would create internet-based marketplaces that would simplify and standardise insurance offerings. It would also offer refundable tax credits to families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, on a sliding scale, to help them buy insurance. Mr Baucus would also expand Medicaid, an existing health-insurance scheme for the poorest Americans, to cover more of them.\n \n On cost, the bill appears at first blush to offer a breakthrough. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a non-partisan agency, claimed this week that his plan will actually reduce the federal deficit by $16 billion in 2019, and slash deficits over the subsequent decade by half a percent of GDP versus the current trend. Previous proposed health-reform bills have failed this test, with the version now pending in the House being far too expensive for Mr Obama to sign in its current form.\n \n The agency estimates that the plan would expand coverage to some 29m currently uninsured people over the next decade, at a total gross cost of only $774 billion. And thanks to all the revenue earned by a new tax on pricey insurance plans, fees to be levied on medical industries and big cost savings to come from cuts in Medicare (the government health scheme for the elderly), these costs are supposedly more than offset.\n \n Alas, this is too good to be true. A flaw is that the Baucus plan, like its chief rivals, does too little to fix the perverse incentives driving up health costs in the first place. Two more immediate snags may also trip it up: fuzzy maths and petty partisanship.\n \n One problem is that some claimed savings are unrealistic. The plan assumes, for example, that payments made by Medicare to doctors will be cut by nearly 25% in 2011. Senator Judd Gregg scoffs that the \"claim of deficit-neutrality is dependent on Congress's willingness to follow through on painful cuts they have been unwilling to follow through on in the past.\" And the medical-devices industry is already gearing up to escape some of the $40 billion in taxes to be slapped on it.\n \n The other obstacle is partisan bickering. Laudably, Mr Baucus has pursued a moderate course, rejecting a proposal for a government-run insurance scheme. But this and other concessions (on malpractice reform, for example) have failed to win him a single Republican endorsement thus far. Worse yet, such concessions have attracted the ire of such liberals as Senator John Rockefeller, who declared this week that the Baucus bill \"will not have my vote\".\n \n Still, it is too early to count the bill out. The full Finance Committee will consider it next week. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, a leader of the Blue Dog coalition of conservative Democrats in the House, thinks it is \"an important step forward.\" And Olympia Snowe, a Republican moderate member of the committee whose vote could make all the difference, says it \"moves in the right direction.\" Faint praise; but an imperfect bill's saving grace may be the fact that it is better than the alternatives. \n \n Health-care reform: Half a loaf&mdash;or just half-baked? | The Economist\n \n _________________________________________________\n \n I found one comment from a reader interesting:\n \n \n September 23, 2009 4:33\n Americans generally (80%) like our health care system. Rasmussenreports.com found that the number one reason that Americans want health care reform is to control costs. This bill does not do that (according to the Congressional Budget Office). Why then would Americans support this bill?\n \n The CBO also found that this bill leaves 17 million permenently without health coverage. Why would Americans support this?\n \n All of the poor were covered for health care in 1965. In theory, they all still are. The problem is that government health care systems don't work well. If they did, the poor would now all get full health care from Medicaid. Medicaid has had since 1965 to work and it has not. Giving the poor private plans seems the only practical path.\n \n Health-care reform: Half a loaf&mdash;or just half-baked? | The Economist",

Start with that first and let's see how it goes....oh, but wait, the trial lawyers spend way too much to keep Libs/Dems in their pockets...sounds like a special interest group to me.\n\n There are two views on these reputed costs:\n \nThe HHS report put the cost of malpractice insurance to doctors alone at $6.3 billion in 2002, but said much larger costs come from \"defensive medicine\":\n \n \nHHS: Defensive medicine that is caused by unlimited and unpredictable liability awards not only increases patients' risk but it also adds costs. The leading study estimates that limiting unreasonable awards for non-economic damages could reduce health care costs by 5-9% without adversely affecting quality of care. This would save $60-108 billion in health care costs each year. These savings would lower the cost of health insurance and permit an additional 2.4-4.3 million Americans to obtain insurance.\n\n \n That \"leading study\" was a 1996 paper by Stanford economists Daniel P. Kessler and Mark McClellan. McClellan - who is both an economist and a physician - served more recently as President Bush's senior White House policy director for health care, and is now the head of the Food and Drug Administration.\n \n The Kessler-McClellan study is one of the few academic studies that has ever attempted to measure the cost of \"defensive medicine\" attributable to lawsuits. It did so by examining the cost of treating hospitalized heart patients in states that have caps on damage awards and other restrictions on malpractice suits, and comparing them with the costs of treating similar patients in states without such limits on lawsuits.\n \n The Kessler-McClellan conclusion:\n \n \nKessler-McClellan: We find that malpractice reforms that directly reduce provider liability pressure lead to reductions of 5 to 9 percent in medical expenditures without substantial effects on mortality or medical complications. We conclude that liability reforms can reduce defensive medical practices.\n\n \n The Kessler-McClellan study won the 1997 American Economics Association's award in health economics\n\n FactCheck.org: President Uses Dubious Statistics on Costs of Malpractice Lawsuits\n \n From the same source, the other view follows in my next post.",

   "This is the contrasting view:\n \nHowever, a fact not mentioned in the Bush HHS paper is that several other studies of defensive medicine failed to find anywhere near such large costs. A 1990 study by the Harvard University School of Public Health \"did not find a strong relationship between the threat of litigation and medical costs,\" CBO said. And a 1999 study in the Journal of Health Economics found only tiny savings - less than three-tenths of one percent - when studying the cost of Caesarian sections in states with limits on lawsuits, compared to states without limits.\n \n Finally, a 1994 study by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment found some added costs (under $54 million total) due to defensive radiology in children with head injuries and defensive Caesarian sections in certain women with difficult pregnancies. But the OTA study concluded: \"it is impossible in the final analysis to draw any conclusions about the overall extent or cost of defensive medicine.\"\n\n It looks like it all depends upon how you diddle your numbers.",
