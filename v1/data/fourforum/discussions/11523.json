   "A relatively new argument for abortion is that life begins at conception and that any deliberate interruption of the process is murder. Most fundamentalists repeat what they have been told, not what the bible says about abortion.\n \n Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not considered a human life. \n \n If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. -- Exodus 21:22-23 \n \n The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old. \n And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. -- Leviticus 27:6 \n \n Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons. \n \n Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD. -- Numbers 3:15-16 \n \n God sometimes approves of killing fetuses. \n \n And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. -- Numbers 31:15-17 \n (Some of the non-virgin women must have been pregnant. They would have been killed along with their unborn fetuses.) \n Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. -- Hosea 9:14 \n \n Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. -- Hosea 9:16 \n \n Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. -- Hosea 13:16 \n \n God sometimes kills newborn babies to punish their parents. \n \n Because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. -- 2 Samuel 12:14 \n \n God sometimes causes abortions by cursing unfaithful wives. \n \n The priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell. And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen. ... \n \n And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. -- Numbers 5:21-21, 27-28 \n \n God's law sometimes requires the execution (by burning to death) of pregnant women. \n \n Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom.

   "Eh, I'm taking AP European History, and if there's one thing I've learned from that class its that organized religions have a nasty habit of interpreting the bible wrongly for their own benefit. In the middle ages, the peasants would rely on the ministers and higher ranks to interpret the bible. When a person, namely John Wycliffe translated the bible into vernacular, the church became outraged. They had lost most of their power when people started reading for themselves that \"Love thy neighbor\" and \"thou shalt not kill\" are God's word.\n \n Luckily, his popularity prevented him from being burned at the stake. In any case, today's religious bunch are so focused on issues like abortion and gay rights that they conveniently overlook the tens even hundreds of thousands of starving children in Africa, and widespread poverty in our country and in the world. So, one asks himself, \"What would Jesus do?\". Well, Jesus would probably be in Africa helping the poor starving children, not attending abortion rallies and harassing pregnant women, or voting to deny Gays civil rights.\n \n The reason? Its easier. If modern day Christians were really men of God, they would not be standing around voting conservatively. They would be helping people, which is what Jesus really taught. The fact is, its easier to harass pregnant women and shout so loudly about how wrong abortion is. It requires nearly nothing from them, unlike feeding and clothing the poor. That's apparently too much time and money. Who would want to do that, when in their minds they can be just as Christian making women and gay's lives harder instead of making starving children's lives easier?\n \n This leads me to the Catholic priests who sold indulgences. Modern day conservative born again Christians are more concerned with profiting emotionally and financially from Conservative Christianity than they are to actually doing God's work and giving back to the world.",

It's completely absurd to compare a tumour to a healthy fetus, which has a separate blood system, and in a relatively short space of time will be an independent person.\n \n It does no service to the pro-choice lobby to display the sort of attitude that says \"we don't value human life\". If you think abortion is an acceptable moral choice then you have to make a case either that the fetus is not human, is not an individual, is not alive, or is in some other way not worthy of respect. Or you have to make a case that ending it's life is in some way justifiable in spite of these things.\n \n I am pro-choice, but only because I don't believe you can legislate about an issue like this unless there is near unanimity. The suffering and anguish caused by banning abortion is substantial and should not be dismissed, but equally when abortion is legal it should not be seen as a substitute for contraception.
