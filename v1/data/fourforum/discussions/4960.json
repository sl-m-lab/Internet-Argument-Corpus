   "Yes I would like to reply to your accusations that the U.S. prison system is racist. Time and again we see that men like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton defend common criminals behaviour due to the color of their skin. This blatent blaming of race and color must stop. Both men do not see that these people were commiting CRIMES. Yes the one issue I said was a problem in this nation in your forum that falsely accused conservatives being liars. (I hope you read my reply). It once aqgain shows that this nation cannot see past their pety differences and focus upon the common good. Instaed we BLAME someone else for our promblems. Oh it's Bush's fault, or Kerry was the reason I didn't get the purple heart, or those crazy bible thumpers are always imposing on me. It's always about me me me. We must be THE most selfish people on the face of this earth. This MUST change. MR/ Maxwell please stop while you are ahead. Instead next time post a thread worth replying to.",

   "The only real discrepency in the justice system itself that concerns me has more to do with class than race. More money buys you better representation and greater liklihood of getting off or leniency. We need to have more equitable representation in the courts - ESPECIALLY in capital cases where the death penalty may be on the line. No way shoudl some spoiled little rich kid avoid the needle for doing the same crime as poorer kid just because he has money. That is not a fair and equal trial.\n \n As far race factoring in to what leads people to crime - that is another matter. I actually agree with Hunter the each PERSON (not just men) are accountable to their actions. But what about the kids? We could fix so much if we could manage to do better by the kids. Mentoring, stuff for them to do, really kickin schools that keep them interested. But we want it all on the cheap - a great future doesn't come that way.",
