It is not that the issue is one that SHOULD be supported. Rather it is that the ability to VOTE should be supported.\n\n You're going to try to support the \"ability to vote\" by putting up legislation on the ballot which will be THROWN OUT of a court room?\n \n I'm sorry, but that's not \"supporting\" voting.\n If anything, if I were a voter who had that happen to me, I would be pretty annoyed and a little jaded. Even more reason to see my vote as NOT MATTERING...\n \n Get my point?\n \n \n \nThe system of checks and balances (namely the courts) is where the law is determined to be unconstitutional or not. They may yet come up with one that passes constitutional muster. I do not know.\n\n Let's try to put things in perspective, okay.\n I don't see anybody here saying, \"Well, they want to put X on the ballot, and I think it is unconstitutional, therefore the courts should prevent X from being put on the ballot\".\n \n We are explaining WHY we don't think these items should be put up to a vote in the first place.\n I mean, me personally I would LOVE to see something on the ballot revoking churches tax exempt status. But even if a majority agreed, I don't think it should be put on there because it has no point.\n \n \n \nMy argument is that the removal of the vote from an initiative of the people by a legislated body is outside of the checks and balances and is in itself unconstitutional.\n\n Who said anything about removing the vote?\n \n \n \nGoing through the effort is intended so that the voice of the people is heard. It is part of the system of checks and balances on the government. WE the people have a right to be heard, even if our idea is unpopular or even if the legislature does not like it.\n Huck\n\n Oh trust me.\n There is NO DOUBT as to the opinion of some people on this issue.\n You don't need to worry about not being heard...",
