   "Houston elects first openly gay mayor -- latimes.com \nAnnise Parker, a lesbian who has never made a secret or an issue of her sexual orientation, on Saturday was elected mayor of Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city.\n \n With the victory, Parker, 53, will become the first openly gay mayor of such a large American city. The population of the Texas city is about 2.2 million.\n \n Her victory comes two days after Democrats in California's Assembly unanimously tapped John Perez of Los Angeles to be their speaker. He will be the first openly gay lawmaker to hold the powerful post.\n \n With almost all of Houston's 738 precincts reporting, Parker had 53% of the vote and Gene Locke 47%, according to the Harris County website.\n \n The fiercely contested battle leading up to Saturday's balloting was marked by anti-gay rhetoric. Locke, 61, condemned such tactics.\n \n Meanwhile, gay and lesbian political organizations nationwide rallied to support Parker, the city controller.\n \n Parker and Locke, both Democrats in the nonpartisan race, made it to the runoff after garnering more votes than two other candidates on Nov. 3. \n \n Several smaller U.S. cities have openly gay mayors, including Portland, Ore.; Providence, R.I.; and Cambridge, Mass\n.",

In fact I have very clearly argued when asked, that we are a secular society and that it isn't possible to make people live religious lives against their will. That is the epitome of tyranny and wreaks of Islam and Catholicism, both of which I reject as legalistic and oppressive religions. \n \n You constantly fail to realize that true salvation is based on a living breathing and vital personal relationship with the living God. I don't submit myself to a belief system or a religion, I submit my life to my heavenly FATHER who is, was and always will be the king of kings and the Lord of Lords.

No way is giving my opinion which is a free expression of my God given and constitutionally given rights in any way an infringement of anyone to exercise their right to be homosexual. How dare you tell me that I have no right to say what I believe is right or wrong in my own society, and if I dare to do that I am imposing restrictions on anyone at all.\n\n Were you not complaining about the homosexuals \"flaunting\" their sinful lifestyle not so long ago? And if you didn't, in writing, do you not think so?\n \n \nSo tell me my hypocritical friend who has no problem with double standards as long as they favor you, why isn't this practice infringing on my right to believe in God? How can this expression be allowed in a public setting? Anti-God Campaign Coming to the City | NBC Bay Area This is far more intrusive than me giving my singular opinion on a debate forum, yet I don't see you speaking out against it being allowed to reach potentially hundreds of thousands of individuals per day. No problem with that, huh hypocrite?\n\n \n My position is that peaceful coexistence has to be actively enforced. That it requires a minor limitation on all belief expressions in order to get all of them to coexist together. Christians don't get to impose christian laws, Muslims don't get to impose muslim laws, pork stays on the table.\n \n Now, it would be nice if people all just expressed their beliefs with words. Words to words, it would be acceptable. However, it does not stay with just words. It's not just words - it's words that are expressing much deeper and darker acts.\n \n Even in the \"cultured\" west, this seeps through. From employment discrimination to outright acts of violence. Which one might say is just occasional excesses that happen in all areas. But then you look a bit further. Look at what is done, BY STATES, in some areas. Criminalization of homosexuality and similar. Prison sentences for things done between consenting adults in their own homes.\n \n So, if I trusted you to just talk, I'd let you. But I don't, Archie. I see what seeps through your cracks and you would NOT stop at that, had you the power.\n \n Gansao will understand. I want EVERYONE left alone. Gay parades (urgh... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing some of that stuff), nudist beaches (swimming past one to the wonderful algae covered cliffs sounds great until you realize they're populated with 70 year olds with beer guts and similar), street preachers (although maybe a tad less loud) and similar.",
