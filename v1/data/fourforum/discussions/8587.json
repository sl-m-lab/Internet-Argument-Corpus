The morphological changes tend to happen with a change in the environment. \n \n The difference between 'micro' evolution and 'macro' evolution is the number of steps. \"Macro\" evolution is a bunch of 'micro' evoltultions that add up. You have two populations that you can compare that used to interbreed, and for some reason, do not, and then you add on a few 1000 'mircro-evolution' events to each, they become very very different.",

Are you implying that it is possible that certain characteristics arise, de novo, because of the environment?\n \nSomething like beak size will following a bell curve.\n\n Probably true.\n \nMost beaks close to average size, some larger than average, some smaller.\n\n Right. But in this case, there are two different populations\n \nIf pressures change so that those with below average beak size gain some advantage than they can exploit it instantly.

Basically, the genetic variety is already present in the population, so exploiting that variety can happen quickly.\nYet again, ignoring the point of the article. Are you not familiar with the Grants' work?\n \n This is only one of several examples of quite rapid evolution that has been observed by the Grants on Daphne Major over what must now be about 30 years.\n \n Here's the situation. Essentially, there are two food sources from two different plants for the finches on Daphne Major. One is a small seed - easily cracked. The other is a large hard shelled seed. At one time, during a drought, the Grants observed that some native finches, Geospiza fortis, evolved larger beaks that enabled them to eat the larger, hard shelled seeds. In other words, the bell curve was extended at the large bill size end. The article (and I presume the paper published by the Grants) recounts the colonization of Daphne Major by a larger ground finch, G. magnirostris, with a correspondingly larger bill. The point is that large G. fortis and small G. magnirostris are similar in size, having similar beak size. As a result, they directly competed for scarce resources. As a result, large beaked G. fortis and small beaked G. magnirostris were at a reproductive disadvantage. As a result, the smaller beaked G. fortis evolved to specialize in the smaller, more easily cracked seeds that G. magnirostris had difficulty in picking up, while G. magnirostris evolved to specialize in the larger, hard shelled seeds.\n \n Anyone interested should read Weiner, Jonathan. The Beak Of The Finch. 1994. Vantage Books, New York. It won a Pulitzer Prize and is the story of the Grants' research on Daphne Major.",

   "However, if something is \"changing in response to new selective pressure,\" then it must be at least somewhat \"purposeful,\" no?\nNo. It's statistical. It is differential reproductive success. Those individuals that possess heritable characters that tend to lend an advantage in the acquisition of resources thereby tend to survive to reproduce in statistically greater numbers. Thus, the heritable makeup of the population tends to change in response to selective pressure.\n \n It's an argument that has been going on since Darwin first published his theory. Darwin objected to references to natural selection as a theory of evolution because of the Victorian understanding of the word \"evolution.\" It meant change in a specified direction. Darwin didn't mean that, and modern evolutionary theory doesn't carry any connotation of purpose.\n \nIt's evolution junction, what's your function. I may have misinterpreted the statement; for the record, I believe in evolution.\nI don't, and I'm an evolutionary biologist (Montana State and U. of Montana). I believe some things for which I have no evidence. Evolution is not one of those things. I conclude from the evidence that evolutionary theory presents the best explanation for that evidence. I think that the evidence is so convincing that it would be unreasonable not to accept its explanatory and predictive powers. However, should additional evidence that alters or contradicts current evolutionary theory be found in the future, and should that evidence be conclusively tested, then I am willing to adjust my understanding of evolutionary theory accordingly. Such events have occurred many times in the course of my career and life.\n \n I kept my text from the very first course I took on evolution. I would never have thrown that book away. And yet, I can no longer find it. I want to re-read it today to see how theory has changed during my career.",
