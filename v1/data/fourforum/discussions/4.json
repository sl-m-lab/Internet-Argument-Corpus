   "I don't know about what anything is \"meant\" to be. I do know that \"democracy\" was never intended, or even wished, by the \"founding fathers\". The US was founded as a Republic, and remains a Republic.\n \n To believe in democracy is to believe that every person is born free and entitled to everything that society has to offer, as long as they don't infringe on other's enjoyment of the same. Not because their biological parents accumulated wealth. Not because they have bombs or a military.\n \n In the US, wealth is passed on to progeny instead of shared. Labour is valued by how much people can be starved into working. People die of starvation in the street, and a Freddy vs Jason movie is made with billions of dollars. Police arrest someone for stealing food or smoking a joint, and CEOs shake hands with politicians over billion dollar scams.\n \n I believe that is an insane way to run a society. Neither is it an accident. Unfortunately, because if it were, it would be easy to correct in a peaceful manner. Instead, the US was created based on the idea that those who had should continue to have (regardless of how they came to have in the first place). The only way any \"freedoms\" have been won is with bloody battles, such as that for minimum wages (for \"citizens\"), or for the right of Black people to vote (on who the next dictator is).\n \n The true democracy of the first \"Americans\" meant that everyone had a say in everything that affected them. That's democracy. Anything that would mess up your life you got a say in. Which is only right, IMO.",
