   "I came across an old book that I thought would explain everything:\n \n Basic Theories of Distribution, Benjamin J. Catherwood, 1939.\n \n Unfortunately, the damned thing is written in an archaic language. There is no glossary. There is no explanation of what the the word \"distribution\" means. I tried to find an economic definition of the word \"distribution\" but found such stuff lead to the \"Lorenz curve,\" whatever the devil that might be. \n \n Distribution?\n \n Distribution of what?\n \n Who rules distribution?\n \n Catherwood discusses Adam Smith, Thomas Robert Malthus, David Ricardo, Nassau William Senior, John Stuart Mill, which I thought should surely be interesting, but it's unintelligible if I don't have a solid definition of the word \"distribution.\"\n \n Adam Smith: \"An acceptance of Adam Smith's theory of distribution depends upon the acceptance of his concepts of the natural price and its components, the natural rate of wages, the natural rate of profit, and the natural rate of rent.\" Fine, but what is \"natural\"?\n \n Malthus refutes Smith in many cases, but I cannot understand precisely why.\n \n Ricarardo follows the Malthusian order in many intances, fine, but. . . .\n \n Catherwood says that Senior's \". . . discussion of the science is derived from four elementary propositions: men desire the greatest possible wealth at the least sacrifice; moral and physical evil and fear of poverty are the only forces that limit the population; by the use of the results of population the productive powers of the agents may be indefinitely increased; diminishing returns operate in agricultural production.\" What the? Agents? What agents? His propositions seem to be wildly disconnected.\n \n Mill discusses \"private property\" as a operator in the economics equation, \"the right of producers to what they have produced.\" So, who are the precise \"producers\" in this equation, the workers who produced the goods or the \"owners\"?\n \n Mill, at least, coughs up some definitions:\n \n Productive labour means labour productive of wealth.\n \n Labour is either bodily or mental.\n \n By unproductive labour . . . . , will be understood labour which does not terminate in the creation of material wealth.\n \n This accumulated stock of the produce of labour is termed capital.\n \n Nature, however, does more than supply materials; she also supplies powers.",

   "From Wikipedia:\n \n David Ricardo (April 18, 1772 - September 11, 1823), a British political economist, is often credited with systematizing economics, and was one of the most influential of the classical economists. He was also a successful businessman, financier and speculator, and amassed a considerable fortune. . . .Ricardo rejected the orthodox Jewish beliefs of his family and eloped with a Quakeress, Priscilla Anne Wilkinson, when he was 21, leading to estrangement from his close family. It seems likely, for example, that his mother never spoke to him again. This was around the same time Ricardo became a Unitarian.\n \n Ricardo became interested in economics after reading Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations in 1799 on a vacation to the English resort of Bath. . . .",

   "http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/senior.htm\n \n The first holder of the Drummond Chair at Oxford, Nassau William Senior was a detractor from orthodox Ricardianism and more in the the \"Oxford-Dublin\" tradition of supply-and-demand economics. Specifically, Senior can be credited with the initiation in Great Britain of the utility-based demand and the cost of production-based supply scheme, thus an important predecessor of the Marginalist Revolution. John Stuart Mill took much effort to respond to Senior. \n \n Senior also developed an \"abstinence\" theory of capital and interest (in his main 1836 treatise). An important opponent of Malthus's population doctrines, Senior was also one of the developers of the ill-fated \"wages fund\" doctrine. His methodological essays on the scope of political economy - his insistence on the deductive method and his arguments for the distinction between wealth and welfare - are also well-known. \n \n A proponent of laissez-faire, Senior was a active participant in Whig politics, being one of the commissioners responsible for the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. Senior was famously opposed to trade unions and against reductions in working hours (arguing that for enterprise, \"the whole net profit is derived from the last hour.\").",
