   "IF YOUR LIFE WAS A MOVIE, WHAT WOULD THE SOUNDTRACK BE?\n So, here's how it works:\n 1. Open your library (iTunes, Winamp, Media Player, iPod, etc)\n 2. Put it on shuffle\n 3. Press play\n 4. For every question, type the song that's playing\n 5. When you go to a new question, press the next button.\n \n Opening Credits: Leap Of Faith - Bruce Springsteen (appropriate enough, I guess.)\n \n Conception: Numb As A Statue - Warren Zevon...what's that all about?\n \n Being Born: Amnesty Is Granted - Meat Loaf & Sammy Hagar (That works for some reason.)\n \n Waking Up: Glory Days - Bruce Springsteen\n \n First Day At School: Poor, Poor Pitiful Me - Warren Zevon\n \n Falling In Love: Feel Like A Number - Bob Seger (So funny, and yet, so true.)\n \n Fight Song: I Can't Help Myself - John Fogerty (Obviously, it was in a case of fisted rage.)\n \n Breaking Up: The Real Love - Bob Seger (This doesn't belong here!?!? Unless it's not a mutual break-up.)\n \n Prom: Ride The Wind - Poison\n \n Life's OK: Hard On Me - ASIA (uhh, okay.)\n \n Mental Breakdown: Heat Of The Moment - ASIA\n \n Driving: Talk Dirty To Me - Poison (Hey, it works)\n \n Flashback: Against The Wind - Bob Seger (How appropriate)\n \n Getting Back Together: Bad For Good - Meat Loaf\n \n High speed car chase: More Than A Feeling - Boston\n \n Birth of Child: Days Like These - ASIA\n \n Wedding: Lawyers, Guns and Money - Warren Zevon (Am I going to marry that Russian Waitress? :p)\n \n Final Battle: Born To Run - Bruce Springsteen\n \n Death Scene: Bad Moon Rising - Creedence Clearwater Revival (Maybe I'll get killed by a Werewolf or something!)\n \n Funeral Song: Hot Rod Heart - John Fogerty\n \n End Credits: Alive - Meat Loaf (As the credits start...proof that a sequel is in the making.)\n \n Since You've Been Gone - Rainbow...It's going to have a lot of people in it if it's my movie. The credits will be even longer than a Meat Loaf song.\n \n No one has to go with the list I used. You can use whatever you want say what get's played at a devorace and a second marriage or when your kids start kindergarden.\n Have Fun.:p",

   "I don't have all that much on my ipod at the moment, but here it is. I'll probably do a new one when I add more to it.\n \n Opening Credits: The Distance- Cake (Cool enough I suppose. Life is a \"distance\" in a way)\n \n Conception: A Change is Gonna Come- Sam Cooke (Well of course it is. I was being born. Let the world prepare)\n \n Being Born: Some Postman- The Presidents of he United States of America (Hmm, was I suposed to be a postman?)\n \n Waking Up: Thug Luv- Tupac (Hmm, I don't even really like this song and I certainly wouldn't want to wake up to it)\n \n First Day At School: Island in the Sun- Weezer (That would have been cool if my first day of school was on an island....but not on the sun)\n \n Falling In Love: Change- Tracy Chapman (Not really sure what this means. Falling in love is a change from not falling in love I guess)\n \n Fight Song: Somewhere Over the Rainbow- Tori Amos (lol, interesting. I suppose I need to go fight over the rainbow somewhere)\n \n Breaking Up: Drunken Lullabies- Flogging Molly (lmao. If you were having too many drunken lullabies, I guess that would be a good enough reason to break up)\n \n Prom: Brown Eyed Girl- Real Big Fish (Well, I'm pretty sure I went to one of my proms with a brown eyed girl. I'm not sure about the other one)\n \n Mental Breakdown: Gather the Horses- Charlie Mars (Maybe it's something I'll say when I have a mental breakdown...\"Hey you!! Gather the Horses mother f#@*%r!!\" ;-)\n \n Flashback: Smile Like You Mean It- The Killers\n \n Getting Back Together: Even Superman- Ryan Shupe and the Rubber Band (Even Superman gets back together)\n \n High speed car chase: Jesus Walks- Kanye West (apparently he's also drives in high speed chases)\n \n Birth of Child: Irish Pub Song- Flogging Molly (Oh God I hope my first child is not born in a pub)\n \n Wedding: Come On Eileen- Dexy's Midnight Runners\n \n Final Battle: Krazy- Tupac\n \n Death Scene: Wizard Chess- Harry and the Potters (Wizard chess kills. The one at the end of the book could anyway)\n \n Funeral Song: Take Me Out- Franz Ferdinand (Please do actually. I don't want to be stuck in that coffin. That's no fun. Take me out to a party or something)\n \n End Credits: Take Your Mama Out- The Scissor Sisters (Yeah, I will)",
