The DOMA defines marriage as the union of one man and one woman, specifying that a person's spouse must always be a member of the opposite sex.\n \n Additionally, 37 states currently have their own DOMA laws, which puts into place yet another barrier to homosexual activists seeking to have a foreign same-sex marriage sanctioned in the U.S.\n \n Source:\n http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=PV03G01",

Being a member of the GLBT community, I too felt betrayed by Clinton. We put our faith in him to do what was right for human rights and in return we got shafted. \n \n Since then we have become more aware of the GOP's intent when they forced Clinton's hand. We know now that it was their intention to not only inact DOMA but to push more legislation which would further make it impossible to repeal DOMA via the \"Protection of Marriage Act\" H.R.3313, which was recently passed by Congress, as a back up measure after FMA (Federal Marriage Amendment) failed. \n \n \n Hope this helps.",

Maybe these 72% have more sensibility than that. Something to think about.\n\n \n Wow, you actually think the majority argument is a useful tool. I pity you and your \"education.\" \n \n The majority in the past thought killing innocent people was good, and that it was part of their religious rituals.\n The majority in the past thought having a harem of young girls was good and desirable.\n The majority in the past thought kidnapping and raping women was the best way to enlarge their society\n The majority in the past thought slavery was a acceptable practice, and revolved their culture around it.\n The majority in the past thought that killing millions of Jews was good and sensible.\n The majority in the past thought that virtually enslaving Africa was the best foregin policy\n The majority in the past thought that killing off pigs because they were eating all the corn and burning them was good, but in the process starved themsleves\n The majority in the past thought throwing regiment after regiment aganist a heavily fortified position was the normal combat tactic\n The majority in the past thought sending regiment after regiment aganist machine guns was a normal combat tactic.\n Do I need to go on? \n \n The majority simply decides what to do, it does not mean they are correct, nor just, and as history has shown, they haven't been either far too often.\n \n You are once again resorting to a know fallacy\n \n Appeal To Widespread Belief (Bandwagon Argument, Peer Pressure, Appeal to Common Practice): \n the claim, as evidence for an idea, that many people believe it, or used to believe it, or do it. \n If the discussion is about social conventions, such as \"good manners\", then this is a reasonable line of argument. \n \n However, in the 1800's there was a widespread belief that bloodletting cured sickness. All of these people were not just wrong, but horribly wrong, because in fact it made people sicker. Clearly, the popularity of an idea is no guarantee that it's right. \n \n Similarly, a common justification for bribery is that \"Everybody does it\". And in the past, this was a justification for slavery. \n \n http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#bandwagon",
