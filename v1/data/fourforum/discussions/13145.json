   "WASHINGTON (AFP) - Incensed by the election of the first black US president, right-wing militia groups in the United States are rising again after a decade of decline, according to new research on extremist groups.\n \n Ideologically driven by racism and a virulent anti-government, anti-taxation and anti-immigrant agenda, the homegrown groups that thrived in the 1990s and spurred numerous deadly terrorist attacks are expanding, said the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).\n \n \"This is the most significant growth we've seen in 10 to 12 years,\" said a law enforcement official quoted by the SPLC in its special report \"The Second Wave: Return of the Militias.\"\n \n \"All it's lacking is a spark,\" said the official, adding it is \"only a matter of time before you see threats and violence.\"\n\n Right-wing militias on the rise in US: report - Yahoo! News\n \n It's like my weatherman telling me the sun is shining right now...\n \n Thank god we don't have pundits running around spreading gasoline everywhere... :rolls",

   "This doesn't pass the smell test. Time to investigate a little bit more.\n \n First off, what is a \"right -wing\" militia? Is the definition really someone who opposes Obama or any democrat president and forms a violent group? That seems a bit unfair to use the term \"right-wing\". I don't think crazy is right or left wing. \n \n Second, after reading the SPLC website I don't see need for yahoo and SPLC to identify these groups with Glenn Beck. Talk about guilt by association. The SPLC website talks about groups growing because of the 2000 scare, 9/11 conspiracy attacks, etc. A black president is just another event to ignite crazy people. Get someone Jewish in there and I bet you get some crazies too. \n \n Basically this report lumps conspiracy gun-toting crazies in with groups that want congress to follow the constitution. Classic guilt by association and I don't buy it. \n \n Sorry, but just because some racist hick doesn't like Obama and cheers for Beck doesn't mean Beck is a racist and is promoting racist hicks. I can think of one good example. 9/11 conspiracy crazies loved Bill Maher. Bill thought they were nuts and it is unfair to tie those two together. Maher isn't a nut anymore than Beck is. \n \n Finally, the most ironic thing about this article is that it creates a conspiracy theory (identifies instances with circumstantial evidence or no proof at all) about people believing in conspiracies.",

She is already a frontrunner, with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, to take on Mr Obama in four years time.\n\n Sarah Palin blamed by the US Secret Service for death threats against Barack Obama - Telegraph\n \n But hey.

   "Palin ACCUSES Obama of \"paling around with terrorists\"...\n ... and you think that is just as much of an instigator to death threats as being elected???\n \n\n \n LMBO! Good grief.....emoticon_rolleyes\n \n When did speaking the truth become an \"instigator to death threats\"? Obama is well known for keeping company with \"terrorists\". Perhaps the names Ayers (The Weathermen), Farrakan (NOI) aren't familiar to you? They all live within a block of each other. How bloody convenient is that? Don't forget Van Jones. Saul Alinski, an avowed Marxist...Obama's mentor at one time by Obama's own words. Then the ever mouthy Rev. Wright. Just to name a few. \n \n As for the SPLC....they are a bunch of alarmists anymore. They get a great deal of money from the government to post their drivel. Btw: They are not a government entity. And, they are extremely biased. They actually did some good many years ago, but alas the Clinton years turned them into a witch hunting group. \n \n As for militia groups, perhaps you might read up on the U.S. Constitution. Here's a clue....2nd Amendment. That pesky impediment the far left is trying to dispose of. \n \n As with ANY group, there will be some bad apples. The majority of militia groups are decent, hard working Americans who are very informed about the movement toward a tyrannical government. Absolutely nothing wrong with being informed and prepared.\n \n SPLC has a reeeeeally bad habit of lumping regular militia groups in with domestic terrorist groups. Not too honest of SPLC. Fyi: there are a LOT of democrats in militia groups. So, calling them \"right wing radicals\" is ludicrous. People from all walks of life have been checking out militia groups because they have become afraid of their governement. OUR government!",
