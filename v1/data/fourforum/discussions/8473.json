   "Unfortunately, we feminists are slapped in the face with the \"cultural prerogatives\" argument. Sorry, boys, that argument doesn't fly.\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/09/magazine/09BRI.html\n \n July 9, 2006\n The Bride Price \n Photographs by STEPHANIE SINCLAIR\n Text by BARRY BEARAK\n In many societies, the term \"child bride\" calls to mind impetuous sweethearts, a ladder cautiously positioned beneath a bedroom window, a silent kiss in the moonlight and a young couple making an anxious getaway to a justice of the peace. But this is not a ready image the world over. In Afghanistan, a child bride is very often just that: a child, even a preteen, her innocence betrothed to someone older, even much, much older. \n \n Rather than a willing union between a man and woman, marriage is frequently a transaction among families, and the younger the bride, the higher the price she may fetch. Girls are valuable workers in a land where survival is scratched from the grudging soil of a half-acre parcel. In her parents' home, a girl can till fields, tend livestock and cook meals. In her husband's home, she is more useful yet. She can have sex and bear children. \n \n Afghanistan is not alone in this predilection toward early wedlock. Globally, the number of child brides is hard to tabulate; they live mostly in places where births, deaths and the human milestones in between go unrecorded. But there are estimates. About 1 in 7 girls in the developing world (excluding China) gets married before her 15th birthday, according to analyses done by the Population Council, an international research group. \n \n In the huge Indian states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, the proportion is 36 percent; in Bangladesh, 37 percent; in northwest Nigeria, 48 percent; in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, 50 percent. Tens of millions of girls are having babies before their bodies are mature enough, increasing the likelihood of death from hemorrhaging, obstructed labor and other complications. \n \n Stephanie Sinclair's striking photographs of child brides in Afghanistan remind me of my own travels over remote landscapes during the time of the Taliban, when recurring years of drought had parched the final resources from millions of the destitute. Fathers then were especially keen to convert their daughters into brides. It was a way to deliver the girl from hunger - and a way to at least temporarily ward off famine for the rest of the family. Young boys were sold into bondage with the same painful practicality. Rarely have I seen anything more heartbreaking than the tears of a relinquished child. \n \n The drought has since passed, but the poverty remains, as does the widespread custom of early marriage. Some Afghans readily use their daughters to settle debts and assuage disputes. Polygamy is practiced. A man named Mohammed Fazal, 45, told Sinclair that village elders had urged him to take his second wife, 13-year-old Majabin, in lieu of money owed him by the girl's father. The two men had been gambling at cards while also ingesting opium and hashish. \n \n But the practice of early marriage stems as much from entrenched culture as from financial need. Bridal virginity is a matter of honor. Afghan men want to marry virgins, and parents prefer to yield their daughters before misbehavior or abduction has brought the family shame and made any wedding impossible. \n \n Unfortunately, there are no reliable data about the age of Afghans at marriage. Husbands are not ordinarily old enough to be their wives' fathers or grandfathers, but such February-September couples as those pictured here are hardly rare either. In such marriages, the man is likely to view the age difference as a fair bargain, his years of experience in exchange for her years of fecundity. At the same time, the girl's wishes are customarily disregarded. Her marriage will end her opportunities for schooling and independent work. \n \n On the day she witnessed the engagement party of 11-year-old Ghulam Haider to 40-year-old Faiz Mohammed, Sinclair discreetly took the girl aside. \"What are you feeling today?\" the photographer asked. \"Nothing,\" the bewildered girl answered. \"I do not know this man. What am I supposed to feel?\" ",

   "The reason children no longer have to work in sweatshops here is because capital investment in the western world reached sufficient levels that people could make more money with their brains than with their backs, and schooling was therefore a worthwhile investment rather than a waste of 10 years. You'll note that the \"sweat shops\" you condemn, like the stereotypical \"coal mines\" or \"railway worker\" occupations of the past no longer exist, since increased capital investment, mass production and machination made intensive personal labour of this nature wasteful.\n \n Applying the ideal of no-child labour in reality, that's to say criminalising youth employment where it is the norm, where capital investment has not yet reached industrial levels, results only in poverty, death and black market employment (eg child prostitution, scavenging through garbage).\n \n You should also know that child labor prohibition originated in the same place that racial labor prohibition and sexist labor prohibition did, in the unions where middle aged white men sought to protect their privileged position of being the only ones allowed to have certain jobs.\n \n So as much as I appreciate social freedoms, there's no need to mix it with ignorant economic and historical claims. And it's ironic that you'll laud with one hand \"freeing\" women from being prohibited from work, and then with the other cheer on \"freeing\" children from being permitted to work. Maybe in 100 years, children will be permitted to work and women prohibited, and the social progressives of that era can boast about their superior workplace arrangements.\n \n Jyoshu is also correct that \"cultural perogatives\" is a social progressive argument, you are in fact siding with the (neo)conservatives on this one.",

In other countries this may be seen as hypocritical. Might not other cultures see western women being forced to dump their kids in childcare in order to work, despite the impact on the children, as barbaric?\n\n \n \n Let's take this bottom to top, if that's alright. First, women aren't 'forced' to dump their children anywhere. Nowhere codified in law does it state that women are either required to work or required to put there children in daycare nor in practice do we require these things.\n \n As far as the corporal punishment, there is no, to my mind, inherent way to insure that a. children grow up to function properly in society or b. ensure that adults who break the rules do not continue to do so. So there is not a gold standard for corrective policies. However, there would be some punishments for children that would be Inherently evil and wrong. Punishments that would permanently break or warp their psyche, for instance, locking them in a pitch black basement for a week with no food or water. Parents DO have a responsibility to try to make their children understand that they have a requirement to comport themselves in certain ways if they are to function within society and more importantly that there are certain responsibilities that are commensurate with being human.\n As for corrective actions against adults, there is also leeway for enforcing societies rules and punishing those who don't follow them. Again, or humanity must be maintained as the punisher's in order to give legitimacy to the system of rewards and punishment. We could say the there must be a balance between protecting the community and protecting the humanity of both the rule breaker and the system at large. For instance, in a society that relies on hunting for their survival, a child could be punished quite harshly for behavior that jeopardizes the hunt. He's putting many at risk and the behavior must be curtailed quickly. A thorough spanking may accomplish this. However, skinning the child alive and roasting him over hot coals would still be evil and inherently wrong.\n \n There are things that are certainly different between cultures and we must strive to understand and to accept these differences. However, there are absolutes. Some things are Absolutely wrong and even if a culture believes differently, that belief does not change the fact of an evil practice. I would imagine that mostly, these issues would crop up about certain beliefs and treatments of people, codified in law, by birth. Women being considered sub-human or certain castes of people would are subjected to persecution would be examples. Humans have innate value and thus deserve at minimum to retain their humanity.",

Likewise, if an entire society were to say that it is fine to rape and murder anyone who's name ended in Y then the society is wrong.\n\n \n Morality isn't a physical fact like the earth being round.\n It's a belief system.\n \n In the over all picture of things, your version of morality is all ****ed up.\n \n Without some big make-belief entity dictating morality, there is no right and wrong. More so an absolute.\n \n Even with such an entity, the morality systems they embrace do change.\n The Christian bible (which we often discuss as it's the most common one) fully supports slavery in the OT (and Torah) and the NT doesn't contradict such beliefs.\n God commands slavery and never the opposite.\n Yet, because such is not vogue in an anarchistic western society, you'll rarely see someone admit to it. \n \n The ONLY absolute truth that has existed through the ages is thusly:\n 'To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women' \n -Conan, commenting on 'What is Good in Life'",

Banned from seeing their own parents or siblings, they are also prohibited from going to school. With little recognition of the illegality of the situation or any effective recourse, many of the victims are driven to self-immolation - burning themselves to death - or severe self-harm.\n \n Six years after the US and Britain \"freed\" Afghan women from the oppressive Taliban regime, a new report proves that life is just as bad for most, and worse in some cases.\n \n Projects started in the optimistic days of 2002 have begun to wane as the UK and its Nato allies fail to treat women's rights as a priority, workers in the country insist.\n \n The statistics in the report from Womankind, Afghan Women and Girls Seven Years On, make shocking reading. Violent attacks against females, usually domestic, are at epidemic proportions with 87 per cent of females complaining of such abuse - half of it sexual. More than 60 per cent of marriages are forced.\n \n Despite a new law banning the practice, 57 per cent of brides are under the age of 16. The illiteracy rate among women is 88 per cent with just 5 per cent of girls attending secondary school.\n \n Maternal mortality rates - one in nine women dies in childbirth - are the highest in the world alongside Sierra Leone. And 30 years of conflict have left more than one million widows with no enforceable rights, left to beg on the streets alongside an increasing number of orphans. Afghanistan is the only country in the world with a higher suicide rate among women than men.\n \n Campaigners say these are nationwide figures but in war-torn provinces, such as Helmand, the British area of responsibility, oppression is often worse, though the dangers make it impossible for them to monitor it accurately.\n \n The banned practice of offering money for a girl is still rampant - along with exchanging her as restitution for crime, debt or dispute. With the going price for a child bride at \u00a3800 to \u00a32,000 - as much as three years salary for a labourer - many grooms are forced to take loans or swap their sisters instead, explained Partawmina Hashemee, the director of the Afghan Women Resource Centre.\n \n Mrs Hashemee, who has fought for the rights of her fellow Afghan women, initially for refugees in Pakistan, for almost 20 years, said: \"For me the issue that breaks my heart is the forced marriages because of poverty - even girls as young as eight. They don't get to go to school or to go out. They are told 'you are not allowed to visit your family, we paid, now you have to work'.\"\n \n In 2007 a law was passed banning marriage under 16, but Mrs Hashemee said: \"The majority of people are not even aware of it. Early age marriages are increasing.\"\n \n The vast majority of international aid goes directly to the Afghan government rather than non-governmental organisations. Activists are calling on the British to ring-fence some of the funding for human rights issues - such as gender-based projects - and to ensure the money reaches appropriate beneficiaries.\n \n Mrs Hashemee said, in Kabul at least, there had been greater recognition of women's rights over the past seven years as well as major civil and political gains since the fall of the Taliban. But it remains a dangerous environment and female MPs, activists and journalists still live under constant threat of death.\n \n Womankind is calling for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, which says women in conflict zones should be offered protection and recognition of their role in the peace process as well as their human rights. Across Afghanistan women's organisations, such as Mrs Hashemee's, are now turning their attention from providing basic needs to empowering females, teaching them their rights and urging them to vote.\n \n Often illiterate women are instructed on how Islam views women as equal. Training is offered to young men in why sexual abuse is wrong. Communities are being \"mobilised\" to fight for and monitor women's rights - encouraging mullahs to promote the equality that the Koran teaches.\n \n But there are no women's rights associations in Helmand. The closest is one courageous group working in another southern province, Kandahar. Yet Mrs Hashemee is positive. She said: \"I don't want to be disappointed. We will struggle on and hopefully the government and international community will help.\"\n \n In a report this month the chairman of the International Development Committee, Malcolm Bruce MP, said: \"There is a dangerous tendency to accept in Afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere, because of 'cultural' differences and local traditions.\n \n \"We believe that the rights of women should be upheld equally in all countries.

How do I know? Because no one has proven there's anything there! Think that's a planet you see? Can't be. If it existed, someone would have proven it\"\n\n To the opposite, it's sheer ignorance to declare something ABSOLUTLY EXISTS without a shred of evidence. Absolutes are...absolutes. You can say something MAY exist but not absolutly does.\n And you can't do so easily (if ever) in a philosophical discussion when others are shown to be more prone to believing the opposite.\n \n The questions that arise on Cun's position,\n When did it become known that rape and minor sex 'child molestation' was wrong?\n Who says so and why?\n These are asked because in the past they were not universally known nor accepted as anywhere approaching as being societial and morally true.\n \n I posit that, like in many situations dealing with group movements that a few people got an idea and through various means spread that concept to others until it became widely accepted. That through societial brainwashing, you have someone like Cun, who blindly states something as being an absolute fact, past, present and future regardless of any mitigating circumstances.\n It's the same blindness used in religious dogma.\n \n \nI'm well aware that my beliefs don't create objective truth, the entire premise of an objective truth is that it exists independent of the beliefs of any person or group of people.\n\n \n All your stating is that a concept exists somewhere and is true.\n Remember.\n CONCEPT.\n \n Not a THING.\n An IDEA.\n Which is what universal, absolute, objective truth is.\n \n \n \n @CUNx,\n Good and bad are relative terms.\n It can clearly be demonstrated that things you consider good and bad are the opposite to other people.\n While the (generic) terms of Good and Bad (in what ever language) may continue to exist in human linguistics, the concepts they embody ALWAYS change with the times.",

I think the govt. is being to culturally sensitive by not being more forceful with womens rights (ie. I'd be MORE cowboy) but they are doing their best to protect them and change the behavior. Talk to some of the women who survived the Taliban and see what they think. While women still have a long way to go in Islam, and Afghanistan, there's hope now where there was only pain before. You can't blame the way those bastards treat their women on the US, but you can compare how it is still better now (yes there's a long way to go) than under the Taliban!\n \n \n \n \nI don't really see what this has to do with the conversation, but, last I remember, you ridiculed McCain's age, and I disagreed, saying that I didn't think he was too old, even though I didn't agree with his positions on issues (and thus, couldn't support him for other reasons).

I mean Ferraro basicly said that he's only a viable candidate cause he's black, what if Rush or someone said that?\n \n \n \nLet me ask you this, Time. Do you have the courage to step out of your political dogma box and acknowledge that age ridicule is something Republicans practice? That you yourself practiced here on this forum?

I think a lot of people are insensitave about age where they'd never be so about color or sex. Only Dems can play the race or gender card. We ALL know that!\n Agian, though, the common sense knowledge that someone who's old might die before someone who's 50 or 60 is not what Leno et al. are doing.\n \n \n \nBTW I still leave McCain open as an option at present. His experience one point in fact, there. What's also nice about Hillary IMO is that her age provides the benefit of experience without some of the risks once you get further along on that life road.\n\n \n Come on, that comment says nothing! Just because someone's 60 rather than 46 doesn't mean anything, its about the individual.

Again, my wife's been married to a Real Estate agent for 4 years but you wouldn't want her to sell your house. I think governors make better presidents than Senators. I do think you are right about her being an inspiration to women around the world, but inspiration is intangible. I think she'd let the Islamists off the hook and the women would slip backward. She's the one who puts out contradictory information and won't release her information, it's not my 'glasses'. She's much less than forthright about EVERYTHING, from her position on drivers' licenses to her tax returns to her white house 'experience'.",

   "First of all, I didn't get that from the article and secondly, I wouldn't agree that that is the case regardless of the arthor's opinion! \n\n \n The author? This is a major report from Womankind, Afghan Women and Girls Seven Years On. Not a blanket assertion, without cited evidence, as you are proffering.\n \n \n\n Talk to some of the women who survived the Taliban and see what they think. \n\n \n You keep returning to this strawman in a transparent attempt to skirt the point. For no one is denying the realities of life for women under the Taliban. Indeed, you are so familiar with the conditions then, and the improvement of life for women now, then cite some research and link, please. Yes, we all know the execution stadiums are gone. But the subject is much broader.\n \n \nNo, no, I was commenting on how your always running around with your guns drawn about anyone possibly saying something about Hillary being a woman. I know you have aimed anything at me and I wasn't aiming that at you, just commenting on your assumption that the people don't like Hill cause she's a she. \n\n \n I think you would like it if I were indeed running around with guns drawn as such, because I'm supporting this candidate openly; and, when attacking Hillary Clinton, it's convenient to attack or stereotype her supporters, too. As mindless Hillary drones. But I challenge you to find one post of mine where such guns have been drawn. Or that I haven't been simply discussing my position based on evidence, candidates record and positions, and, reason. Indeed, I don't think I could conclude that one anti-Hillary person on this board doesn't like her ONLY because she's a woman anymore than I could conclude supporters like her ONLY because of her gender, either. Clearly, if we were talking about Condi Rice, the sentiments on the part of either parties would be very different. But, clearly sexism is used to attack Hillary by persons -- and persons who might support a Republican female candidate under another set of circumstances -- and, there are people who simply won't vote for Hillary because she's a woman. In fact, I read a woman Democrat quoted in one state who said as much. The president needed to be a man. As far as Republicans are concerned, though, there's been a long-time hate campaign against this person, partly IMO because she was not only a woman, but a woman bucking the tides of convention with her views and actions.\n \n \n I mean Ferraro basicly said that he's only a viable candidate cause he's black, what if Rush or someone said that? \n\n \n Anyone would have been attacked for that statement by the Obama campaign, being as it works at this point. However, I think Ferraro's statement has been taken out of context and misconstrued. Not to mention that she has around 40 years of experience in civil rights, unlike Rush Limbaugh (though he does have CR experience, but in another respect ....). But one would think people would know Gerry better than that ... to look a bit deeper into her statements. I find the Obama campaign disappointing, at this point, in that way. And revealing their own lack of experience, as well lacking regard and value for others' backgrounds.\n \n \n\n Come on, that comment says nothing! Just because someone's 60 rather than 46 doesn't mean anything, its about the individual. \n\n \n We'll have agree to disagree on that one. For I value life experience in a candidate. I think there are perspectives one cannot have until their children have been raised, until they have gone through certain life passages themselves. It's certainly not the only quality, nor would I vote for a candidate simply because they have more life experience than another candidate. But IMO it can factor significantly into the equation.\n \n \nAgain, my wife's been married to a Real Estate agent for 4 years but you wouldn't want her to sell your house. \n\n \n First Ladies are unpaid work positions in our government. It's been one of the great Emperors Without Clothing denials of American society. But all first ladies know it. From Laura Bush to VP First Ladies like Mrs. Cheney to Jackie Kennedy to Eleanor Roosevelt to upstart Hillary Clinton who pushed it out into the open. And has been duly punished by the right ever since, for her treason.\n \n And although many wives have nothing to do with their husband's work, many are deeply involved, putting in hours of unrecognized labor. The fact that Obama has denied this, or is willing to use this jargon, these kinds of attitudes, in his campaign, is unfortunately IMV, yet another example of how he does not fully understand women's issues or what the women's movement has been about. (Not to mention what he and his wife imagine her non-job will be!)\n \n Anyway. Hillary, unlike your wife, who is not a real estate agent -- is also a long-time attorney, and, a Senator. In addition to her many years of experience as a First Lady in Arkansas and Washington. It is, in the words of one campaigner, an unprecedented opportunity for Americans to have someone step into office with a birds eye view of what goes on. She WILL be prepared, for those reasons, among other factors that have often dogged women politicians of her generation. You don't get to slide by without doing your homework, like Watson, on national television.\n \n \nI do think you are right about her being an inspiration to women around the world, but inspiration is intangible. \n\n \n Well, I agree with you there. I think it's just one quality among many. I certainly wouldn't support a candidate \"just because\" they were inspirational. I think that's a weakness in the Obama campaign.\n \n \nI think she'd let the Islamists off the hook and the women would slip backward. \n\n \n I think she looks quite tough on foreign policy. She leaves all options on the table and doesn't bend. She walks the line of \"peace AND strength\" better than any candidate who's run from the beginning. (And while maintaining a coherent vision and record on human rights.) That's essentially what the U.S. needs in an electable Democrat, IMO. McCain is too hawkish, and Obama is too risky in that respect, for a national election. And he WOULD move to the right on foreign policy, whatever his fans imagine of this leader. In a more unpredictable, untime-tested fashion than Hillary. The political pressures of the job being what they are.\n \n \nShe's the one who puts out contradictory information and won't release her information, it's not my 'glasses'. She's much less than forthright about EVERYTHING, from her position on drivers' licenses to her tax returns to her white house 'experience'.\n\n \n Well, the driver's license issue is the only specific you give here*, Time, as to what you're talking about. And there, I think she took a very intelligent positiion, IMO. Look, politicians are not up there to rigidly adhere to only one position, always. They must respond to the electorate, the People, who they are there to represent. She expressed her opinion, and the People of N.Y. did not want that. So, she moved on the issue. She didn't say, \"Now I think this.\" She made an agreement. I see Hillary following what I would consider a contract model of politics, and which I find forthright and realistic, as well as respectful of the public.\n \n Much different than, say, a Republican candidate who says that he is pro-choice in his PERSONAL beliefs, and, then changes to pro-life in his PERSONAL beliefs. When they are running for election, and, right before a big endorsement. Though people do go through those changes, that looks fishy to me. Like they are willing to sell their souls.\n \n \n * I don't consider the tax story a specific since there's nothing there. Just something unreleased. Our tax code is so complicated and the Clintons are so wealthy, it could be anything, something quite technical. I doubt, though, with their history of being relentlessly tailed by Republicans, that they aren't responsible on their tax returns. I think it's just another concoction to use in an election, and a disreputable tactic, too. Rumor mongering and innuendo. Nothing more. Oh, except that now some Obama campaigners can pat themselves on the back for low sinking.",

My sense, though, with intense anti-hillaries, is that they are wearing a distinctly tinted sort. Why?

It would be one thing if you told me you didn't like her position on Iraq, or you disagreed on healthcare. And some, including yourself, sometimes do. But when you hear about \"evil\" \"unreleased taxes\" (guilt before innocence) \"female shrew\" and all the other generalities with no evidence, no cites, no specifics, and perhaps even no wrong-doing, even it were there ... as far as I'm concerned, whether you're Republican, Democrat, or Independent, you're dealing with demonization, stereotyping, and irrationality. In short, the world through one well-known sort of tinted glasses. It is for this reason -- something I very much object to in campaigns, and find something to be concerned about in politics -- that I may not support any major candidate if Mrs. Clinton does not win the nomination. There have been many a foul political movements in history that have risen on exactly those kinds of tactics. From either end of the political spectrum.

   "Time,\n \n As to your challenge on wearing glasses. I think we all wear glasses of a sort. Bias is, after all, a human condition. My sense, though, with intense anti-hillaries, is that they are wearing a distinctly tinted sort. Why? Because all I ever read as to why they don't like the candidate seems surrounded with an aura of innuendo and rumor. Nothing specific, nothing backed up with facts or evidence. It would be one thing if you told me you didn't like her position on Iraq, or you disagreed on healthcare. And some, including yourself, sometimes do. But when you hear about \"evil\" \"unreleased taxes\" (guilt before innocence) \"female shrew\" and all the other generalities with no evidence, no cites, no specifics, and perhaps even no wrong-doing, even it were there ... as far as I'm concerned, whether you're Republican, Democrat, or Independent, you're dealing with demonization, stereotyping, and irrationality. In short, the world through one well-known sort of tinted glasses. It is for this reason -- something I very much object to in campaigns, and find something to be concerned about in politics -- that I may not support any major candidate if Mrs. Clinton does not win the nomination. There have been many a foul political movements in history that have risen on exactly those kinds of tactics. From either end of the political spectrum. If people think America is so different, and could never go that way, they are wrong. All the world over, we are humans.\n\n \n I see what you're saying but I think it is both the tangible and intangible. For instance, there are the basic political views which I'm opposed to (ie. even our views on the function of govt. are antithetical). We've talked specifics there before. Then (and I'm speaking for myself here, but my concerns are probably close to many others who don't support her) there are the personality issues. These are less tangible, but it goes back to the 'I'm not some little woman, standing by my man baking cookies' or whatever, back in 1992. The totality of comments I've heard from her combined with things reported by people that were in the white house (Dick Morris, the stories about making marine honor guards serve Hordourves, secret service stories about her) to me read of a sort of narcissistic, elitist person, the type of which I can't stand (Pub or Dem). Then there are the intangibles, like the secrecy, the questionable funding and fundraisers, the appearance of only telling people what they want to here. These things in their totality make her (again, IMO) seem 'dangerous' and self-serving. The vitriol against big business and oil companies, the college profs. that said she was basically socialist. All that together is what does it for me. \n \n I don't care that she's a woman at all. And I didn't just jump to these conclusions (even though we don't agree with the conclusions) I have put some thought into it. I think there are a lot of people like me. Are there people out there who don't like her, right off the bat, because she's a powerful woman? Hell, yeah. But I don't think that that represents the majority of the opposition to her. I don't think its anything 'personal' per se, its a combo of opposing views and some events that could be construed a certain way.",

But honestly, to me, she comes off as untrustworthy, not as convoluted as John Kerry was, but its a sense of wanting power for power's sake and a willingness to do whatever it takes to get there. It's like her life's been choreographed, and not just like working toward a goal. More like (I'm struggling for the right words) an avatar maybe. To me she seems to change according to what she thinks people want to hear but that, deep down, we don't know her. With Obama (I'm 180 on his politics, too) but there's a sense that he at least believes what he says and that what you see is what you get. Hill seems like she's got a lot of hatred inside and an agenda that only she knows. Maybe this has sounded a bit, I don't know, over the top, but its hard to explain 'feelings' and 'impressions' I'm not intentionally trying to make her sound like the Manchurian Candidate or something, cause I don't believe that, but I'm trying to give a sense of my thought process....

But seriously, we haven't had many true statesmen on either side in a long time. Everyone's got warts. But I feel that you've got to hold your nose and vote for the lesser of evils (figure of speech) every 2 years. My fundamental, core belief is in small govt. I don't see govt. as the way to solve problems, I see it as the cause of many of them. Granted govt. is necessary and it does solve some problems better than any other way. But what this country needs is for people to change their attitudes. Too many people want to suck the govt. dry. By this I'm talking about fraud (Medicare doctors, contractors) as much or more than the individual committing small scale fraud on entitlements (false claims, working for cash, etc...). The numbers of the individual schemers might be higher than the others but the business frauds probably cost more. It sounds corny, but people don't ask what they can do for their country anymore. You'll love this, true story I met her about 3 weeks ago. I couldn't believe it--- My sister-in-law works at Bob Evans Restaurant. Her friend that works there, a 19 year old US citizen, says that she wants to move to Canada because the have 'free' health care and more social programs. Can you believe that? At 19, she's not dreaming about the future, that she'll make it big and what she's going to do with her great aspirations. She's shopping around for the best welfare programs! At 19! Not figuring that she'll work hard and make good money and buy insurance and (god forbid) maybe have enough left over to give to charity or whatever. She's thinking to move to Canada to suck up their 'free' health care. If that's the kind of thinking that becomes prevalent here, we are toast!\n If your house caught on fire, people used to put it out themselves. If they couldn't do it alone their neighbors would help. If it got worse, the local fire dept. would help. If it started getting out of hand the town or city would start fighting and if it was still burning the country would come in and then the state. Because of PROXIMITY and locality of responsibility the chain of help was apparent.\n \n Now if someone gets a grease fire on their stove, they call the news and wonder why the president hasn't come personally, pulled up in his (or her) limo and draped the American flag over the burning pot! (that's a bit out of proportion, but you get the point)\n \n If we can't convince people that they are AT MINIMUM responsible for themselves, we are lost--even without adding things like universal healthcare. It would help even more if we, on top of that, could get a little civic responsibility and 'good works'.\n \n Dem or Pub we've got to make a fundamental change in how we assign responsibility in this country.

   "Believing that some things are always wrong (while others a relative matter) does not mean that one necessarily believes their convictions should be imposed on others at all times.\n \n For example, I may believe that slavery is always wrong, and that selling a 6 year old into marriage to an older man is a form of slavery. That doesn't mean that I necessarily believe my country should forcibly impose its will on a nation that holds such practices. Though I may believe that we should attempt to convince that nation, otherwise -- or work with people in that society who wish to live differently, in achieving such ends through peaceful means.\n \n When I hear of Creons, I think of King Creon from Sophocles' play Antigone. Who wanted total obedience to the State. However, Time seems too libertarian for such a bent.\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJyAQf2KfKk \n \n When I hear of Javert, I think of the obsessed constable in constant pursuit from Les Miserables.\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYCPHHPXTmk&NR=1\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0xi5FqIefE&feature=related",

   "Antonia is correct (and I hope nobody's misunderstood me as believing that EVERYTHING is absolute) that there are things that you can believe are wrong and still leave alone and there are things that ARE wrong that you still leave alone. But relativism would imply that Darfur (and many other genocides) are excusable because that's what the more populous (or controlling) culture believes. \n \n But I also believe that some things should be stopped (and you don't always have to use force to do so). Human beings being sentient, thinking beings should be held to a certain behavioral standard as well as enjoy certain rights. \n \n Do I judge others in the past and present, yes. Did I say my moral view is the end all be all arbiter of what is right and wrong? Hell no. I've got prejudices and issues and failings. Do I think our culture is perfect and always right, hell no. Should we stand up to our own govt. when we think it is wrong? Yes! Should we try and effect change elsewhere when we see evil? Yes. Was T. J. 'evil' for owning slaves? I don't know if you call him evil or a mistaken, but certainly a hypocrite. And I think he knew it as well since he declared his slaves 'free' upon his death. We can call slavery evil without holding every slave owner 'evil'. We don't want to devalue the word. Certainly a slave holder that tortured his slaves would be evil. Could we have a 'good' slaveholder? Doubtful, but we could have a 'kind' one. \n \n Now that thought that we should 'judge' others past or present is ridiculous! We are obligated to think about the world and wrestle with 'right and wrong'! That is our duty as thinking beings. Raping little girls is wrong (always has been and always will be, whether the perpetrator thinks so or not). Thinking that we shouldn't use our judgment to shape the world for the good of mankind isn't progressive, its lazy. To paraphrase; All that evil needs to flourish is for good people to do nothing!\n \n (and that includes in my own country, BH)",

I mean, fundies saying the want to 'protect marrage' isn't the same as executing homosexuals. Its wrong (IMO) but not 'as wrong'. In sharia law, their properties are forfieted and they are put to death. The fundies want homosexuals to 'convert' to hetrosexuality. Its wrong, but not 'as wrong'.\n \n Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with either but we can make a value judgement. And lets not forget that evangelical fundimental christians are a small % of the population and none of their policies are law (ie. defence of marriageforfeitedheterosexuality etc...)",
