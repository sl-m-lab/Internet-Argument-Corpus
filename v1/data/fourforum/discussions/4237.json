My first response would be that our awareness of mental processes requires words or some symbolic representation in order to articulate them to ourselves and to others. \n \n However, language might not be an entirely adequate instrument for explaining our thoughts even to ourselves: though the idea of an \"interior monologue\" seems to suggest otherwise. Before a thought surfaces into consciousness there may be an inarticulate mental stage which we can't, as it were, \"put into words\" \n \n Sometimes a lack of success in communicating a thought requires a listener (or reader) to \"fill in the gaps\" and deduce what is meant.

First, consider a reason for rejecting the view that we always think in language. It consists in the fact that thinking often occurs without the production, manipulation, or perception of sense-perceptible signs, without which there is no use of language. Such occurrences often provoke offers of 'A penny for your thoughts.'\"\n \n This can be found atThe Absurdity of Thinking in Language \n \n \n Read the article.

In that sense, it's part languge by construction...hardwired...not independant from language as the author might be suggesting.\n \n And yes, logically there must be something to be thinking ABOUT, else, you cannot be thinking. The knowledge of what one is thinking ABOUT, requires logical differentiation of something, from nothing (of course). Which invariably gives rise to language...i.e. communicating to yourself, and to others, what you're thinking ABOUT.\n \n -Mach",

Any sense can be used to acquire information from \"reality\". Braille, for instance, allows a blind person to literally read. Just in a different format. It doesn't matter if it's \"good english\", or really poor english, or sign language...it's the symbols behind the language that make the impact.\n \n Toddlers have an innate predisposition to learning language, again, if they aren't exposed to any \"language\", and they grow beyond ~age 13, they miss the window. After that, they have not been shown to be able to develop complex language skills, but can perform rudimentary communication. Odd, I know, we take our early development for granted...\n \n Yes, your ability to think is stunted if you don't develop the lanugage areas of the brain before around age 13. At least, that's what researchers have found to be true. Although it seems to be a a curve. I.e. if you get no exposure until 5, you may do OK, but will still be negatively impacted by those neglected early years.\n \n And to your \"we don't need language\".\n Tell me, think about something that we have no description in language for. What are you thinking about? (the dillema is that logically if you are thinking about \"something\", you have some symbolic understanding of it...i.e. language). Language is used in the broad sense..not just \"English\".\n \n Some info on the web that also has information on the subject.\n \n http://www.educarer.com/brain.htm\n \n\n At 3 months the brain has the potential to distinguish several hundred spoken sounds. Over the next few months the brain organizes itself to recognize only the sounds it hears. During early childhood the brain retains its ability (plasticity) to discriminate sounds it has discarded (i.e., not yet organized). As an analogy, think of putting something into the \"trash\" on your computer. You can still retrieve that information out of the trash as long as it has not been deleted. This is why young children can easily learn foreign languages accent-free. After age ten, this plasticity is lost (the trash was emptied). Children can still learn foreign language but more effort is required. \n \n It is from early infancy to early childhood that these vital connections are made permanent. As we mature, the brain physically changes due to outside experiences. The first three years see the most rapid changes of all of life due to the bombardment of experience (everything is new!). At this time, the brain is most flexible and prepared to learn. \n \n Touch, talking, and things an infant sees and smells all build connections if done with continuity in a loving, consistent, and predictable manner. These connections die if not maintained. If there are no experiences, the connections are pruned back and the brain remains small. \n \n Children raised in environmentally deprived facilities (such as the Romanian orphanages) experience fewer sounds, colors, pictures, interactions and sights. Their brains are smaller than those of children who grow up in sensually rich environments within meaningful relationships. When doctors have studied the brains of children from deprived environments, there is a strong resemblance to brains of Alzheimer's patients. Animals raised in zoos have brains that are 20-30% smaller than animals raised in the wild. \n \n Studies done on over 1,000 abused and neglected children found that children who were rarely touched or spoken to and who had little opportunity to explore and experiment with toys, had brains that were 20-30% smaller than most children their age. In over half of these cases, parts of the brains appeared to have literally wasted away. (There was no allowance in this study for the possibility that these children were affected by F.A.S.) (Ounce of Prevention,1996). \n",

These \"inputs\" are all the products of thought. \n \n Pondering is an abstraction to save yourself from the fact that your conscious mind is an idiot. Tell me: Exactly what did your conscious mind do to determine that it was a good peach? If you were conscious of it, then you could tell me exactly the mathematics and/or logic involved. You won't be able to tell me, because your conscious mind didn't do it.\n \n \n \nOnly the last parts seem to be a good example of a common use of the word \"thinking\". The other stuff is not really YOU thinking. Likewise, if your frontal cortex (?) was blown away, yet you could still literally eat food, and your taste buds etc. still fired off. Would you be thinking about it? No. \n\n \n The common use of the word thinking is based on the completely unfounded notion that if you don't see it, then it's not there: Thinking is the thinking that I'm conscious of. \n \n Suppose you live in Texas, and own a mine in Colorado. The mine sends you reports about how much ore was mined, the state of the equipment, any mishaps, blah, blah, blah. If your wife comes to your office, she would conclude that mining consisted of shuffling papers. \n \n This seems to be the state of affairs with the conscious mind. There's a whole lot of work going on, but you are completely ignorant of it. You get reports. And you think you're a big shot. \n \n \n\n The other stuff is not really YOU thinking. \n\n \n Who is thinking then? If you slam your hand in the door, don't worry: It's not YOU. You contend that the only you is the you you are conscious of. Who dreams? \n \n \n \n\n Likewise, if your frontal cortex (?) was blown away, yet you could still literally eat food, and your taste buds etc. still fired off. Would you be thinking about it? No. \n\n \n Yes. Just because I'm not conscious of thinking, doesn't mean I'm not thinking. You may be totally unaware of what happens in your mine, but that doesn't mean mining isn't taking place. \n \n Haven't you ever been driving in a car? Suddenly you realize that you haven't been consciously driving for a long period of time. Fortunately your subconscious mind knows how to drive. For whatever reason, you hadn't been receiving any reports on driving.",

   "All really the same question. \n\n I don't understand.\n \n \nIn general, information transfer requies differentiating something, from nothing. The objects of that differentiation are symbols/language.\n \n Just as binary is a language involving something/nothing, so must any form of communication, by definition. \n\n \n Is an electrical impulse a symbol? By that definition, worms think using symbols. I guess I had interpreted the question to mean do we manipulate language (symbols) in order to think. Largely, I do not think I do. Thoughts arise from electro-chemical processes, and then are interpreted into reports for the conscious mind. The conscious mind does not seem to be doing the thinking. It is where thoughts are registered consciously. Because we register (rational) thoughts in terms of language (and the thinking itself is hidden), it is easy to think otherwise. This is especially true when concentrated effort is involved, and the conscious mind is getting many detailed reports. The analytical works seems to be happening in the conscious, because you are aware of what appears to be every detail. I suggest that this is still not the case. \n \n I think that the example of \"This is a good peach\" is telling. You asserted that your conscious mind pondered it and arrived at the decision. I think I've shown you this cannot be true, because you have no idea how the decision was arrived at. \n \n \nIf you are suggesting your subconscious is indpendent of \"you\", OK, \n\n No. It seems like that was the position you were taking.\n \n \nand if you suggest the information processing it does is \"thinking\" OK (not useful to lump the two together but fine).

If your hand hits a hot stove, don't nerves react to the temperature change, convert that information to a form it can transmit, send it to the right place, that then differentiates \"hot\" from say, pleasure? \n\n And doesn't a worm do the same thing?\n \n \nYes, that's symbols, that's language. Just a languge you and I haven't yet learned, but certainly CAN learn. \n\n I agree that thinking uses information (electricity). That does not seem like the symbol manipulation I imagined that we were talking about. If you are maintaining that we think on a par with worms, I won't begrudge you that.",
