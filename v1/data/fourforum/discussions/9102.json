I've always wondered why they call it the World Series when there is now only one team not from the US.\n \n Anyway, did anyone see this happening at the end of the regular season? At the beginning of the series? Being a Cardinals fan I'm happy, but they got a lot of help from Detroit.",

A blind man could do better\n\n Well, I'm not really excusing the throwing error, but keep in mind: It's quite a change to go from throwing a ball 90+mph dozens of times on end to tossing one to the (considerably shorter) second baseman covering first base. Heck, haven't you seen the attempted intentional walks that turn into nothing less than an adventure for the catchers?",

They even interviewed the Tigers' coach and he said they had bunt practice with the pitchers before game 5. They still made the horrible throw over third base that cost them 2 runs which was the difference in the game. These guys are supposed to be the best in the nation and they can't make a throw 60 feet when they have time to set their feet and throw? The other aspect is that it was no doubt wet, and there was more than a little bit of pressure. But honestly, I could have done better out there (well at least fielding and throwing the ball). How can the pitchers have at least one error in 5 games straight? That's just insane.",
