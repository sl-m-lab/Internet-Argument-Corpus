Korea's ability to amass enough nuclear weapons and delivery systems to threaten China. \n \n China currently keeps N. Korea pacified with enough food and oil for N. Korea to continue putting most of N. Korea's wealth into military pursuits. This is identical to US support of Israel, reversed as to who supplies what, but identical.\n \n 2. Why, with Israel possessing nuclear arms and delivery systems, does the US single out N. Korea for developing that same capability? \n \n While playing poker is now a US rage, we sure don't know how to play it on the international scene.

   "After many generations of rule under as hash a dictatorship as it gets, IMO the N. Korean general populace has pretty well accepted its fate of living at precarious subsistence levels including famines. Military control of N. Korea is finite. Absolute fear is a powerful motivator to follow government rules.\n \n Though we'll never know actual numbers, it would be interesting to know what China spends on keeping N. Korea in the fold. In this instance I reintegrate my military comparison between China/N. Korea and US/Israel; very cost-effective and far less negative political exposure than being there yourself. \n \n Long-term stability of the comparison is the major issue, totally dependent on military requirements of their benefactors. China felt support of N. Korea necessary when borders were threatened and therein lies the question: Why would China ever feel any danger from a ground war by S. Korea, even with US support (poor ground military record since WW2), with now military fierce N. Korea in place on the cheap? Basic tactics and what I consider excellent defense strategy using mercenaries, proven politically effective and normally efficient throughout history. \n \n Japan's fear of N. Korea is a different issue, cultural and historical, and the primary reason they're sucking up to the US on the nuclear issue. If I was in Japan's position, without nukes, with massive investment in China to eventually replace US markets, I wouldn't be comfortable with a loose cannon like N. Korea in play. All that investment will become at risk if N. Korea can strike at Japan with nukes and China (not particularly fond of anything about Japan other than obtaining their technology and expertise) would be in a position of substantial gain.",

Korea has absolutely no regard for its own citizens. The future political tactics surrounding this are going to get very interesting.\n\n \n It is not a country blowing itself or the attacking countries ally that is the problem. The world would not stand for that. It is the risk of a retalitory strike in response to an attack taking out a carrier battle group that is the real problem. An attacking country using nukes would not be acceptable. In fact, when Bush I warned saddam that if he used chemical weapons the US would use nukes, even our allies, who had troops in theatre, warned the US that if we nuked a country in the process of invading it, they would turn us into a giant version of Cuba (crippling trade sanctions that lasted until we were living in huts and eating rats). \n \n Nukes agains purely military targets of an attacking country would be far more acceptable. If we attacked N Korea, and they detonated a 5 KT nuke over the carrier battle group we were operating from and completely destroyed it, it would be pretty difficult for anybody to really complain since it is a purely military target, and we were the agressor nation. Likewise, if we attacked and they put a 1 Kt weapon in the middle of one of our S Korean bases, can't really complain about that.\n \n This is the real problem with nukes in the hands of your enemy. They raise the stakes to the point that you cannot possibly afford to wage the war. War is expensive enough with conventional means. Look at the war in Iraq. It has cost us a fortune. Imagine how much more it would have cost if on the first day of the war we had lost a carrier battel group, our Saudi bases, and our major base in kuwait. When you are loosing entire battle groups and entire bases at a time, you can't win. \n \n The \"insane\" ruler of N Korea seems to understand what would and would not be acceptable as far as nuclear weapon usage. It looks like the weapon they tested had a yield of around 1 KT. Theya re not sure if that is becuase it malfunctioned or if it was designed small. Russin intel is now saying that the largest N Korean nuke is only 4 KT.\n \n 2 problems with this. First, it is actually harder to build smaller weapons than big ones. This means that the N Koreans program is more advanced than even we thought. Second, it means they understand reality and are structuring their program to it. While 60 KT weapons are cool, they are useless except in a full out nuclear exchange. They are simply too big. The world would never let you get away with using one. Tactical nukes against acceptable, limited targets could be forgiven. 60 KT weapons could not.",

I am much more worried about such countries using the protective shield of their state as a nuclear power to feel free to act irresponsibly on the world stage - such as in funding or arming terrorists to a much higher degree than they are currently doing (for ex. supplying the nuclear \"suitcase\" bombs, etc. ). Though I may be uninformed, I haven't heard of North Korea supporting international terrorism though, if they become sufficiently financially desperate, I wouldn't put it past them to sell nuclear technology at a large profit. Iran worries me more from that point of view - especially where Israel is concerned. Though I may agree with you in condemning many of Israel's actions towards the Palestinians, I do have sympathy toward the everyday people facing such potential horrors as nuclear terrorism. It all comes down to what risks these rogue nuclear countries would be facing and what they would be willing to face.",
