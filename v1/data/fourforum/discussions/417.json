I know it was really freaking me out and for at least a little bit I escaped into \"Oscar Land\" and enjoyed it. No disrespect to the troops and all...but I did need that, and I think lots of people did too. Plus lots of them wore black to show their respect, also the pin of peace. hehe where can i get one of those?! they are awesome!!",
