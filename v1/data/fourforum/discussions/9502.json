   "Against my better judgement, I'm going to respond here to some points, because this is actually a very interesting topic.\n \n \nThe OT is full of laws that don't directly address the issue.

So if the intent of the rule was to prevent graven images, it would be entirely in character to draw the line further back and say \"no carving at all\".\n\n \n But this could also be supportive of the idea that the stones were there for the purpose of signifying humility. The reason that the laws sometimes went farther than what would seem necessary is because of the symbolic nature and what it was to teach. Besides, idolatry (the graven images thing) seems to be an exception to the whole making-the-law-broader-to-include-the-specific thing anyway. Elsewhere it is dealt with is very straightforward direct terms; no guesswork necessary. It seems graven images are serious enough to warrant very direct and blunt prohibition.\n \n And for that matter, I still find it odd that not using hewn rocks would automatically denote not making graven images. Given that hewning is a process of shaping rocks so they will fit together, a rock could conceivably be inscribed with an image and still be a non-hewn rock. Carving and hewning are not necessarily the same thing. It seems to me that a Hebrew could go up to the altar of non-hewn rocks, and inscribe a small picture of a foreign god--the rock would still not be a hewn rock.\n \n \nThis seems unlikely to me. There's no respect for nature in the OT per se, there's no tradition of respecting natural elements as being God's work. Quite the opposite in fact; the Earth was made explicitly for the use of humans.\n \n \n To think this is about respecting nature misses the point; It's not about respect for nature or the earth, it's about not putting human works above what they believe God had already done, because to put a human work into it would have been less humble. This isn't an environmental issue. Regarding ritualistic matters, YHWH worship tended to require more \"humble\" and \"simple\" things than other religions. There are other similar examples in scripture of this as well such as the command to use unleavened bread only, rather than bread puffed up by yeast.

There is a key difference between someone having a religious picture up to remind them of their god, rather than them actually worshipping the picture itself and thinking of IT as a god. Surely you know this.\n\n Yes, I do, and I'm aware we've been over this ground before. I still wonder why Christianity has relented on the image making while Judaism still abhors it, and suspect it has to do with Christianity's early drive to proselytise and convert. But you're right, we've probably exhausted this one.",

   "Anyone Christian who has been to any number of church services and Bible studies should know they aren't supposed to worship statues of Jesus / God / Mary, etc.\n \n But let me remind you, Trebor, of the disparate views of Judaism, especially your own \"anything goes\" Reform Judaism:\n \n What Reform Jews Believe\n \n http://www.beliefnet.com/story/80/story_8054_1.html\n \n Belief in Deity\n \n Beliefs vary among adherents, including that of nonbelief or questioning belief, and all are welcome and considered personal, but the official stance is that there is one God Almighty--Creator, all-powerful, ever-present, and all knowing--formless, incorporeal spirit. \n \n \u0095 Origin of Universe and Life\n \n Most believe that Genesis is to be understood symbolically. God created and controls all phenomena revealed by modern science. \n \n \u0095 After Death\n \n Reform Jews believe in the world to come and a messianic age (but no individual Messiah). Personal beliefs in the details of afterlife are diverse, as there is no official position. Some believe in heaven and hell but only as states of consciousness; some believe in reincarnation; some believe God is all-forgiving; and some may not believe in an actual afterlife. Regardless, Judaism generally focuses on living a virtuous life, rather than working toward reward after death. \n \n \u0095 Why Evil?\n \n No original sin. Most often, Satan is interpreted symbolically to represent selfish desires that are inherent within all. God gave people free will, and people are responsible for their actions. \n \n \u0095 Salvation\n \n The main emphasis is on living the kind of life that God commands, which will surely be rewarded if there is an afterlife. Most believe God is forgiving of all; there is no hell to which some are condemned. Salvation is achieved through faith and prayer to God, good works, concern for the earth and humanity, and behavior that does no harm to others. The extent to which one follows Jewish Law is an individual decision. \n \n \u0095 Undeserved Suffering\n \n God gave humans free will to feel pleasure and pain, and his purpose in allowing deep suffering of the innocent must be good even if mysterious. It is generally believed that God suffers along with the sufferer. More important than knowing why God allows suffering is to work to help those in need. \n \n \u0095 Contemporary Issues\n \n Judaism holds that human life begins upon first breath, and Jewish law requires abortion if necessary to save the mother's life prior to birth. Most believe potential human life should never be terminated casually, but it is generally regarded as a personal decision, especially within the first 40 days of pregnancy. Homosexuality: Homosexuals are God's creation, and Jewish instruction is to love our neighbors as ourselves. Reform (and Conservative) Judaism have a long history of support for homosexual rights. \n \n Discussion:\n \n So, what we have here is a hodgepodge of beliefs that are all over the board, including even non-belief! Some Reform Jews say there is a Creator and some say there is no creator. There is no official recognition of an afterlife, or even a Jewish Messiah. If there is an afterlife, it's based on rewarding works - believing in God is not even necessary (note \"Belief in Deity\" paragraph above). This is somewhat humerous since who is it that's supposedly going to reward those works if God doesn't exist?. \n \n As noted in their beliefs, \"Most believe God is forgiving of all.\" One has to wonder then if Reform Jews will feel at ease in eternity with Adolph Hitler, Saddam Hussein, and Joseph Stalin and other serial murderers running loose in their midst? In addition, rather than embrace traditional Judaism which teaches that Homosexual relations are a sin, Reform Jews openly endorse gay sex, saying such behavior is God-created! What's more, reincarnation is in too if they want, which is a documented pagan belief contrary to reason and traditional Judaism. In short, Reform Judaism is pretty much whatever people want to believe, based on their man-made whims. Questions such as, \"What happens to you if you are not a Reform Jew,\" and, \"How many works, and what kind of works, does it take to be rewarded with the afterlife\" are obviously anyone's guess. IMO, Reform Judaism is a hodgepodge philosophical structure which is ill-defined, often contradictory to traditional Judaism, etc., man-created, and can certainly incorporate and embrace pagan beliefs and subjective, politically-correct dogma. \n \n A Reform Jew discusses his religion:\n \n One of the great problems of Reform Judaism, and I am a Reform Jew, is its lack of definition....\n \n Reform Judaism correctly modified a Judaism that was only dependent on belief and added the mental tool of reason to the religion. Reason has all but destroyed faith or belief because it has concluded that all religious truths, including the Revalation at Sinai, the major source of Jewish ethical and ritual law, must be evaluated through logic and these truths or beliefs have only a relative authenticity,i.e., they must be evaluated with a consideration of the historical, social, economic and psychiologocal persectives of the ancient Jews. As a result of this process, the Reform Jew has eliminated all if not almost all binding Jewish Law, and therfore, all or almost all binding behavior. \n \n The Reform Jew identifies himself primarily on the basis of belief. He believes that Judaism authenticates ethics. Yet Christians, agnostics and aetheists appaer to be ethical, and thus Jewish mandated ethiocal behavior does not differentiate and define the Jew.\n \n Many Reform Jews believe that \"God is in us\" which is denounced by traditional Judaism; the traditional concept of God is One who is separate from us and transcends the natural world....At the recent Reform Convention, the President of the Reform Judaism announced his intent that Reform Jews should re-embrace spirituality. \n \n Reform Judaism is by far the largest branch of Judaism, and the loss of membership in Reform Judaism is staggering. Reform Judaism which constitutes the largest segment of liberal Jews needs help...It recognizes that it has a problem. The rabbis have recognized the problem for several decades, but they have been unable or unwilling to solve it.\n \n http://www.mljewish.org/cgi-bin/retrieve.cgi?VOLUME=7&NUMBER=79&FORMAT=html",
