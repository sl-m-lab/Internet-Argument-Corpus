   "I often hear Kerry supporters claim that a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush. Whenever I ask why, the answer I usually get is that Nader's views are more similar to Kerry's than they are to Bush's.\n \n With that in mind, I'd like to ask Kerry supporters the following question:\n \n If a vote for Nader is indeed a vote for Bush, then is a vote for Libertarian candidate, Michael Badnarik, a vote for Kerry? Why or why not?\n \n Todd Altman",

   "Nader has been trying to run for president forever. I don't know who wins in the number of failed attempts, Lyndon LaRouche, or Ralph Nader.\n \n But, to answer the question:\n \n People assume that Ralph Nader represents the same types of things that the Democratic Party does (not true) so they assume that if Nader weren't on the ballot, then his votes would go to the Democratic candidate (not necessarily true). But, I think it's a fair assumption that someone that would vote for Nader, would NOT vote republican, ever.\n \n I don't know if anyone will care about votes for the Libertarian Party. In 2000, Nader got the third most popular votes http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm \n IF Nader weren't running I highly doubt any of those votes would have gone to Bush, but I'm pretty sure a lot of them would have gon to Gore. If half of Nader's votes had gone to Gore, he would have likely won the election (since he already had).\n \n Badnarick did not run in 2000, so we have no idea how many votes the guy will get in 2004. Nobody said anything else about the other 13 candidates besides Bush, Gore, and Nader. If Badnarick gets the same number of votes as them in 2004, then no one will be talking about where his votes \"would have gone.\"\n \n ps - I am not a Kerry supporter.",
