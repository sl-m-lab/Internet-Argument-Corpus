The Council will be made even more powerful by the treaty, so I'm not sure I'm in favour of it any more. I wait to see whether the Parliament has the balls to reject the legislation or whether it just plays lip service to this unelected body.",

   "I voted pie too, can someone please explain what the constitutional treaty is?\n\n \n Basicly it`s a new framework for the EU co-operation. Instead of being concerned with the (power) relationship between EU and its individual citizens (like your constitution), it is concerned with the (power) relatationship between EU and its individual member states.\n \n It also defines the role for certain institutions (such as a new \"EU president\").\n \n Here is a somewhat lengthy description of the constitution and what it`ll actually mean for its member states: BBC explains the new EU constitution\n \n Oh, and I think Wilting_laughters description is good as well.
