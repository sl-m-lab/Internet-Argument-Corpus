This is not an issue I am really passionat about. I am going to interject that when you quote, you need to quote IN CONTEXT.\n \n \nBased on Iraqi government figures, UNICEF estimates that containment kills roughly 5,000 Iraqi babies (children under 5 years of age) every month, or 60,000 per year. Other estimates are lower, but by any reasonable estimate containment kills about as many people every year as the Gulf War -- and almost all the victims of containment are civilian, and two-thirds are children under 5.\n\n \n The number for children under five is not based on saddams action, they are caused (and credited to) the sanctions we placed on Iraq. We can argue all we want about whether the sanctions were justified or not, but the sanctions were killing the kids. The theory at the time the article was written was that Saddam was divertings such a massive amount of money from the oil for food program that the Iraqis were starving. Now we know he was not difverting nearly as much as we originally believed.\n \n more from the article you cited:\n \n \nIn March 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its own report on the humanitarian crisis. It reprinted figures -- provided solely by the Iraqi Ministry of Health -- showing that a total of 186,000 children under the age of 5 died between 1990 and 1994 in the 15 Saddam-governed provinces. According to these government figures, the number of deaths jumped nearly 500 percent, from 8,903 in 1990 to 52,905 in 1994\n\n \n \nArriving at a reliable raw number of dead people is hard enough; assigning responsibility for the ongoing tragedy borders on the purely speculative. Competing factors include sanctions, drought, hospital policy, breast-feeding education, Saddam Hussein&#8217;s government, depressed oil prices, the Iraqi economy&#8217;s almost total dependence on oil exports and food imports, destruction from the Iran-Iraq and Persian Gulf wars, differences in conditions between the autonomous north and the Saddam-controlled south, and a dozen other variables difficult to measure without direct independent access to the country. \n \n \n \n So, you cite a nuber from an article whose exspress purpose is to disproive that number (second link)?\n \n Also, you apparently visited the page, but failed to scroll down it. Do so, you will not find a single \"starved to death\" or \"lack of medical care\" or \"poor sanitation\". The webpage was criticized for including those deaths, so they stopped doing it. According to the red cross, that number is roughly 154,000 (International Red Cross \"Humanitarian requirements in post war Iraq\").\n \n I have been watching iraqibodycount.com since their inception, just looking for these (obviously) bleeding heart liberals to slip a bunch of unrelated XXXX in to inflate the nuimbers. I have visited every source and sought out every article they quote as a source since the very beginning. They are liberals, but their data is good.\n \n Personally, I do find the battle plan of the US vaugly disturbing. I think that if you are invading a country, the welfare of the civilians in that country should come before all else, including the lives of your own soldiers. I think that woudl cut down on the nuber of military actions udertaken by the US. If you knew right up front that the thrust of your atack would have to be close quarters on the ground in order to ensure tat civilians would not be harmed, people would think twice.\n \n Again, I don;t really feel strongly either way (not letter writing upset or blood pressure raising upset), but don;t attack my source.

Come on, you are going to have to do a little better than that. Especially since they have been under such severe sanctions since gulf I. We were told \"We know they have them, we know where they are\" by our president.\n \n AS far as where the bulk of civilian casualties have come frim, they have NOT come from mistaken target or as the result of errant bombms, or have most of them been the result of rooting out military equipment in civilian areas. They are the result of cluster bombs, specifically the result f these neat little pressure sensitive bomblets.\n \n The way these things work is they are dispersed and they are NOT on a parachute. They are designed to hit the ground and burrow in. This is not just a fluke, the body of the bomblet is actualyl designed for ground penetration.

I don't believe the charter has a scale of responce measures. :-\\\n\n \n Do you mean the two times that they were fired upon while enforcing the no fly zones, or all the other times they were fired on while violating IRaqi air space in direct violation of international law? The only purpose for which we were entitled to overfly Iraq at all was to enforce the no fly zones. Following gulf I, the Iraqis agred to not attack Amrican forces in the region who were carrying out the UN mandate. Iraq maintained full control of their territory, and maintained control of their borders. There seems to be some kindof confusion as to exactly what we were allowed to do under the ceasefire. We were allowed to send UN inspection teams into Iraq. We were allowed to maintin a no fly zone. We were NOT allowed to send our planes into Iraqi air space illegally for the purpose of gathering intelligence. The UN did not sanction this (and the inspection privelage given by the terms of the cease fire was theirs alone) and it was illegal.\n \n If we sent planes in over CHina to gather intel, there is a good chance they would be shot at, and rightly so. If you violate another nations airspce, your planes get shot at. That's life. THe answer is.....Don;t violate other peoples airspace. If a russian war plane flew across the US without clearance it would be shot down. We can't very well pitch a hissy fit when other countries take their air space as seriously as we do. \n \n \nAnd I haven't heard any politician (other than the Democrats) say we broke international law....\n\n \n Nope. Instead when asked about it Rumsfeld looks at the person like they are stupid and answering their question is painful and says something along th lies of \"America was acting in response to a threat.....\" Of course, now we know there WAS no threat.\n \n \nLook, we could use 1441. 1441 called for consequences.

The UN is set up to address international grievences and all member nations agree to defer to the UN in matters such as this. We cannot decide to unilaterally uphold a resolution any more than a private citizen can decide to imprison a thief in their basement. \n \n The security council DID vote on acceptable measures in response to 1441. The US produced a resolution authorising us to invade Iraq BASED on 1441 and it didn't pass. THat was the UN defining consequences to not include invasion and the displacement of the regime. We acted anyway. The UN does not need to specifically pass resolutions barring the invasion of coutries and the displacement of their rulers. It is in the UN charter. Making resolutions specifically prohibiting this would be redundant.\n \n \nI can't believe you people are arguing over the 'legality' of this war.

You cannot unilaterally enforce a UN resolution.

That is just not the way the world works. There are dozens of nations that are in violation of security council resolutions, we can not just start bombing them. THE US IS NOT THE WORLD POLICE FORCE. Policies like this make us more enemies than friends, and in the end those accounts come due.

It is thinking exactly like what you guys are doing that is going to ensure that it happens. IF we kill Bin Laden, it doesn't really matter now, because we have created a hundred Bin Ladens in the last couple of years. \n \n America seems to have this attitude that we can do what we want when we want.

They hate the fact that we feel it is within our power and within our sphere of responsibility to run all over the world spreading our ideology. And we just keep fanning the flames. Americans seem to think that a few extra security guards at the airport, and guards on trains and busses mean they are safe. They honestly believe that by blowing up enough stuff halfway around the world, we will end terrorism. Guy what, guys, we have thousands of miles of costline that are virtually unprotectable. We have millions of containers coming into this country every day, and we manage to inspect less than 2% of them. We have thousands of miles of borders that we are unable to lock down. Americans need to pull their heads out of their collective butts and realise that no amount of security at the airport or train stations is going to keep somebody from setting off a tactical nuke in downtown New York city. \n \n How can you come to the conclusion that there is nothing in the UN charter that would preclude us from taking unilateral action against a sovergn state?

Such provisional measures shall be without prejudice to the rights, claims, or position of the parties concerned.

I can if you really need me to.\n \n And yes, ghost, Saddams Regime was the legitimate, internationally recognised, lawful goverment of Iraq. Were they democratically elected? NO. Were they nice guys? NO. Were they a bunch of tyrants? YES. Does that change matters even one iota? NO. We didn't like them. They did terrible things. The government of China does terrible things, and they have favored nation trade status. THe goverment of Suadi Arabis does terrible things. The government of Rwanda does terrible things. The government of Kuwait does terrible things. The government of Israel does terrible things, AND is in violation of DOZENS of security council resolutions. None of those governments meet the American standard for democracy. We still do not have the right to invade any of those countries.\n \n Unfortunatly, America has a great deal of power, and no idea what to do with it.

The only justified conflict is that in SELF DEFENSE or with approval of the UNSC.\n\n \n I take this as you giving into my point and admitting that Saddam had the right to fire on armed US warplanes violating IRaqs airspace, right? You can hardly justify this war as one of self defense. You are talking about a country on the other side of the world with no ICBMs. What were they going to do? Bury us in junk mail? Their longest range wepaon was a reported MIG drone that MIGHT have had a range of 650 miles empty. Much less than that loaded with weapons.\n \n THis is not hte first time that an AMerican plane has been fired on by a hostile nation. America does NOT allow our planes to be shot down without provocation. Just the fact that there was not immediate and extreme retaliation pretty much cinches that those in charge knew full well those flights were illegal. Look into it. The last time Saddam was know to have an operational fighter in the air, Clinton was still in office. HE couldn;t have violated a no fly zone, so it would have been illegal for American planes to even be over the country without clearance.\n \n \n \nUh... why don't you ask Mohammed Atta about that... who was jealous of our wealth, power, and did hate our people...\n\n \n Form the New York times:\n \n //quote//\n Berlin - The man the FBI has identified as Mohammed Atta was the son of a successful lawyer. He grew up in a middle-class Cairo neighborhood. Not only did he have a good education, but so did his two sisters - one a university lecturer, the other a doctor. His father drives a Mercedes, and the family has a seaside home.\n //end quote//\n \n Yep, sure sounds like a poor guy with a chip on his shoulder because he was. I think you might have picked a better hiacker to use as an example. This guy had a better start in life than I did, and we can't confirm that he ever made or published any political statements. This was a rich kid from an upper middle class family who wanted to be a martyr.\n \n \n \n \nbin Laden is special because he had money to organize al Qaeda. He isn't a planner, he's not the one who's coming up with all of these \"great\" ideas. bin Laden is a name that matters because he had $200 or so million.\n\n \n He appears to be the head of Al Queda, and apparently requires any and all operational plans to be personally approved. He is as much of a planner as Bush is. Seldom oes the CEO of a corporation design their product. Bin Laden is much more than that, though. There are very few people in the middle east who did not know who Bin Laden was even prior to 9-11. The man is a religious icon to muslims. They actually build shrines to him in their houses.\n \n \nNothing that you listed applies to the situtation with Iraq.

   "Attacking Iraq wasn't a war of self-defense in some perspectives, I'll admit. There were no weapons with ranges over a few hundred miles, certainly nothing which could strike American soil. Sadam had an airforce which was in shambles. None of these things were ever included in the case for war. The only self-defense argument the Bush admin used had to do with Saddam passing WMDs to terrorists and other rogue nations, which was and is a very legitimate concern (by terrorists, I'm not talking solely about al-Qaeda). When that is taken into account, yes, it could be seen as self-defense, though I'm sure you don't and never will. That's fine.\n \n No-fly zones were part of the 1991 cease-fire terms I believe (could be wrong), a war which was entirely justified. They were there to protect people living in those regions. The NFZs also had a smaller effect of limiting movement of Saddam's forces, both in the air and on the ground.\n \n \nJust the fact that there was not immediate and extreme retaliation\n\n \n Whenever NFZ enforcers were shot at, they bombed the SAM, or radar, or AAA, or what have you.

Terrorist ties are a little touchier, since SAddam has in the past had relations with Hamas and supproted the palestenian freedom movements. In order to call these terrorist ties, we would have to make a determination about whether Hamas is composed f terrorists or freedom fighters. From a strictly legal standpoint, the palestenian terirtories are occupied territories in violation of multiple UN resolutions. This would tend to mean they would be legally defined as \"freedom fighters\" if the legality of the situation was to be examined at length.\n \n So, without terrorist ties, and without WMD's, how exactly do you ustify this as self defense?
