   "God, I believe, being about Love and compassion, would be left-wing (excepting so many of them are themselves irreligious - as one myself, every time I've gone to protests etc by left-leaning groups they seem to be filled with atheists).\n \n From the Bible we have good words for the meek. Jesus said the love of money is the root of all evil, and spent time, for the most part with the plebs.\n \n More specifically we have\n Acts 9:36\n In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas[ 9:36 Both Tabitha (Aramaic) and Dorcas (Greek) mean gazelle.] ), who was always doing good and helping the poor.\n Acts 10:31\n and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor.\n 2 Corinthians 9:9\n As it is written: \"He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.\"[ 9:9 Psalm 112:9]\n \n Acts 8:9ff deals with someone who tried to buy the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and who was rejected.\n \n Acts 5:1ff deals with someone who tried to hog money, and who was struck down dead.\n \n Most telling for me was\n Acts 2:44 All the believers were together and had everything in common. 45 Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. 46 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, 47 praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.\n \n Common ownership of property is communism. Giving to those that need is very much alike \"From each, according to his ability; to each, according to his need.\"--Karl Marx\n \n The main difference with communism is the belief in it that man is by himself perfectible - that one day we'll attain some kind of man-made paradise here on earth. This idea, that we can do so without God is why I find no comfort with most commuist/socialist groups.",
