   "  Newark officials unveil three-part strategy to prevent gun violence \n\"Basically, there are three elements: intercept guns coming into the city, get the guns in the city off the streets, and get more convictions in gun cases,\" said Garry McCarthy, Newark's police director.\n \n The biggest change will be in the way gun cases are handled. The Newark police will use two detectives to investigate every gun taken off the street, and two assistant prosecutors will be assigned to take those cases into court. It doesn't matter if the gun was used in a crime or taken from a guy drinking beer on a corner. Once the gun falls into hands of police, it will be investigated like any major crime.\n \n McCarthy calls it \"enhancement.\" The focus will be on making weapons possession charges stick, and tracking how the gun got into the city.\n \n McCarthy said teaming detectives with prosecutors is \"an enormous step\" in getting more convictions.\n \n \"This way, there will be shared expertise,\" McCarthy said. \"We'll know exactly what they need to bring a strong case to court.\"\n \n Things like good fingerprints, airtight evidence procedures and reliable witnesses.\n \n In the past, weapons charges were often downgraded or dismissed to clear the court for more serious crimes. For awhile in Essex County, weapons charges were often remanded to municipal courts, like less serious misdemeanors.\n \n Earlier this year, the state upgraded weapons possession to a second degree offense, which in legal parlance brings with it \"a presumption of incarceration.\" The rest of us call it jail time.\n\n Isn't this what Nato has been saying all along?",

   "In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury.

No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n \"the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\" \n\n The CDC, not getting the results they were looking for, did suggest more studies.

   " Are the more restrictive gun law states safer than the less restrictive states? \n\n \n \n Why would we expect them to be since guns can pour in from out of state? \n \n \n Let me get into this because it is a topic close to home. Sinjin voices a complaint I have heard for years from DC. DC has long suffered the irony of being called the murder capital of the US despite having a total handgun ban (although I&#8217;m not sure it still holds has the murder capital title today). Over the years DC politicians have looked to the south and blamed Virginia for this problem. They claimed that the Old Dominion&#8217;s weaker gun laws allow gun runners to pour guns illegally into DC. Now I want to answer both Sinjin and DC&#8217;s Mayor by suggesting you are both focusing on the wrong issue.\n \n I&#8217;m generally not a huge fan of crime statistics but here are a few per capita (rates per 100,000 people) comparisons between Virginia and D.C.\n \n For 2006, the per capita rates were:\n \n Violent crime \n \n VA 282.2\n \n DC 1,508.4 \n \n Homicide\n \n VA 5.2\n \n DC 29.1\n \n For 2007, the per capita rates were:\n \n Violent crime \n \n VA 269.7 \n \n DC 1,414.3 \n \n Homicide\n \n VA 5.3\n \n DC 30.8\n \n Source Table 4 - Crime in the United States 2007\n \n This of course occurs during the last two full years of the D.C. gun ban which was struck down in Heller. \n \n Now here then is the question: If the ease of obtaining a gun contributes to the level of violence, then why is Virginia&#8217;s violent crime and homicide rate so much lower? Guns are both cheaper and easier to obtain in Virginia, for no one has had to \"run\" guns into Virginia to evade a gun ban. \n \n In my opinion the claim that violence in inner cities is greater than surrounding states because guns illegally &#8220;pour&#8221; into the inner cities is nothing more than a convenient myth offered up by politicians who are trying to conceal their failure to deal with the real causes of violence in America. We do not have a gun problem in America. We have a violence problem&#8212;and it is social and economic factors which are the root of this problem, not the number of guns on the streets. \n \n And so I think the question &#8220;Why would we expect them to be [safer] since guns can pour in from out of state?&#8221; misses the point. The real question is why are the guns &#8220;pouring in&#8221; in the first place? What are the underlying social and economic factors driving the demand for guns which are being used for criminal purposes in places like DC? Why are so many people resorting to violence as an answer to their problems? \n \n These are tough questions with no easy answers&#8212;and this is where gun control becomes the easy out for some politicians. Instead of focusing on the more difficult question of why someone would use a gun to take another's life, gun control advocates choose to blame the tool for the hand which wields it&#8212;because for them it is easier to advocate the destruction of a fundamental civil right than to tackle the underlying causes of violence in America. \n \n ---\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put an end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\"--Thomas Jefferson (quoting 18th. century criminologist Cesare Beccaria)",
