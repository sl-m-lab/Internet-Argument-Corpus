They maintain that bodily disorders occur because of interference to the nervous system that is caused by spinal bones impinging the nerves when they become misaligned. This claim is presented as a fact and it has never been proven. In adition to that, most chiropractors reject the germ theory, and it has been proven.",

   "Chiropractors work by manipulating the spine...much like lawyers do. -Dad\n \n Anyway, I have gone to a chiropractor many times, and it does work. The spine is like any other stack, sometimes the pieces can get out of line. Chiropractors can many times help to align the pieces, and provide some measure of relief from the pain associated with this condition. I never believed in chiropractors at all, until my jaw became dislocated while I was sleeping. Imagine waking up to intense pain, only being able to open your mouth about 1/3 of the normal distance, and when it does open, it opens diagonally. I went to my family physician, who gave me skeletal muscle relaxants, saying it was only a severe muscle spasm. After 1 day of being drugged out of my mind on Robaxin and Flexeril, I called him back. He recommended I see my dentist! My dentist told me to see my doctor when I called his office! Getting no place fast, I had my wife take me to the ER. After several sets of x-rays, it was determined that my jaw was dislocated. The ER physician that I saw doped me up, stood behind me, and put my head into a sleeper hold, popping my jaw back into place. I actually got a litle relief, but not a whole lot. 5 hours later, I awoke to the same pain, same symptoms as before. I got to thinking about something: What could make my jaw dislocate while I was asleep? I thought about this, and figured that something must have pulled it out of place (they don't just pop out for no reason). I went back to the ER, and after more x-rays, drugs, and sleeper holds, my jaw was back in place again. This time it lasted about until I was home. Dislocated again. I got to thinking about what the muscles attach to, starngely enough, one attachment is my jaw, the other is my spine. Hmmmm. I just decided that at this point I had nothing left to lose, so I called a local chiropractor. I went in, he felt around, said c2 and c3 were out of alignment, snapped my spine around, and popped my jaw back in place. I felt almost instant relief of most of my pain, and by the next day, I was 100% back to normal. \n \n I don't say this to endorse chiropractors, or say that they are a cure all. I think some chiropractors do play on the fact that humans are in general suckers, and will try anything once they are desperate enough. As a medical professional, I know chiropractors cannot cure asthma, kidney stones, cancer, or heart disease like some of them claim they can. There is just no possible connection that can be made. But I do know that the spine can come out of alignment, and this can cause pain, numbness, and even nerve damage. Chiropractors can and do help cases like this. Take it for what you will, but anyone who just totally writes it off, does not understand much about anatomy and kinesiology.",

   "You aught to take this info to your chiropractor and let the two of us debate. By the way, drugs are good when used correctly.\n In the meantime, here is where the ERROR arises. While I am sure I too would be very aggitated with someone who told me that something that helped me was a scam. But anytime anyone puts themselves out as having a solution for any problem and say they know why the problem exists and know how to eliminate it, and they cannot provide proof that there solution, when used, eliminated the problem, there is something wrong. In your case, your chiropractor had to (within the scope of his practice or that which his license provides) find something wrong or find \"a reason\" (chiropractic reason) you had the pain and upon finding that, (which he must have found to have gone ahead and treated you,) he provided for you \"a solution\" for your pain.\n The fact that you feel better is your proof. But if you were to have your spine re-examined, the problem he said you had, that he said was causing your pain, would still be there? HOW COULD THAT BE THE REASON FOR YOUR PAIN IF IT IS STILL THERE?\n This is where the scam plays out. What he said was wrong and the reason for your pain. It is not a scam when they admit the things they do are not PROVEN EFFECTIVE, that while they do help at times, there are times when they do not. Then it is still questionable, because while it has helped you there are many it has not helped who were told the same thibg you were told. Keep in mind the way a doctor of any kind practices has to be according to the law, so there are legal ways for them to practice as well as there are illegal ways.\n So again, this is something trained individuals in this area need to address. \n As for the public, they have been advised by the scientific community that chiropractic is based on an unscientific claim.",
