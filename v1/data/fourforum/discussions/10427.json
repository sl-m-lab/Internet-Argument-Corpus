   "Trait inherited without the gene? \n \n This is a little over a year old, but I guess I missed it at the time.\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12956292/\n \n  NEW YORK - In a startling exception to classical genetics, mice in a lab experiment have inherited an effect of an aberrant gene without inheriting the gene itself.\n \n DNA is the stuff of genes in mice and men. But the new study indicates DNA's chemical cousin, RNA, produced the odd-sounding result. In this case the result was mice with distinctive white tail tips.\n \n How many different ways can ToE be invalidated? In a scientific theory, there are NO exceptions -- exceptions mean holes -- holes mean trouble.\n \n And by the way, you know the informaton in the article is particularly damning to mainstream science when the writer of the article just flippantly adds off-topic dialog about diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Have you ever noticed how often the topic of diseases is brought up in these types of articles? If not, start taking notice.... It's such an obvious diversion.....first they drop the intellectual bomb...and then they attempt to diffuse/derail the bad news by telling us how close they are to curing/understanding cancer or diabetes. In this particular article they interrupt twice with this nonsense.",

Newtonian mechanics is a mental concept - that does not exclude its being a scientific theory. Who pray tell taught you to think?\n \n And yes TOE can in principle be falsified by empirical test. So far it has not been. When and if it ever is it will either be modified or dropped as a valid concept. And should TOE be falsified it will not impact materialism as an approach to knowledge. By the way do you have in the article you posted any indication that RNA is non-material or not subject to the processes of chemistry?\n \n There is so far as I know no evidence at all that mere thought etc can alter the heritable physical or physiological traits of a linage of organisms.
