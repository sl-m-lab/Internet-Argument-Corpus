   "Hi spacemonkey, \n \n I'm fairly new to the creation/evolution debate myself. I'm trying to get sea legs myself, but I think the question you ask contains two separate issues. Big Bang is one issue itself, evolution a whole different one. \n \n Maybe you could repost about the Big Bang in Science and Math, there's some sharp pencils in there. I'd be interested in following that thread.\n \n regards",

   "Hey everyone im new to the whole creation vs evolution thing. I don't really know where i stand but i have a question. In the theory of evolution, what did it all start with? Was it hydrodgen atoms that created the big bang? Sorry I'm just trying to learn more :).\n\n There is not one theory, but a great many to choose from.\n \n If you're talking about the origins of life, many evolutionists believe in abiogenesis - that life somehow just came about out of non-life.\n \n Some will say that evolution and abiogenesis are two distinct theories, but there's a lot of cross-over; begun with Charles Darwin himself who postulated a primordial soup.\n Miller-Urey did experiments to try to concoct how life began in a primordial soup of their own design. They failed in essence to demonstrate how life could emerge from non-life through natural means. (Many work on the philosophy that life came about and evolved through naturalistic, or materialistic processes)\n \n It leads people such as Nobel-winner Francis Crick to come up with certain strange notions; Panspermia, of which, his version just shifts the problem, rather than answers it. (see below under PANSPERMIA)\n \n Intelligent Design theorists suggest that some intelligence; possibly, but not exclusively a deity is behind nature; that nature seems to have an order. Some here too casually dismiss ID from science but the door's already open to science\n SETI looks for ID\n Cryptographers do to\n Forensic scientists do\n \n THEORIES OF LIFE...\n PANSPERMIA\n Panspermia is the idea that life came from outer space. As with all theories this too is not homogenous. There's a general panspermia theory, and a 'directed' panspermia theory. The former is a belief that life came here by random chance, such as on a meteor. The later is that life came here at the behest of an intelligence - such as aliens directing ships to earth laden with the molecules of life.\n \n One idea is that the building blocks of life \"...Bakes said nitrogenated aromatics exist throughout the Milky Way galaxy.\" http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-04zw.html\n \n \"Francis Crick also thinks that life on earth may have begun when aliens from another planet sent a rocket ship containing spores to seed the earth. This is no idle thought; Crick first proposed it with chemist Leslie Orgel in 1973 in an article entitled \"Directed Panspermia\" in a professional science journal called Icarus. A decade later Crick wrote a book, Life Itself, reiterating the theory; in a 1992 interview in Scientific American on the eve of the publication of his latest book, Crick reaffirmed that he things the theory is reasonable.\" (Behe, M, \"Darwin's Black Box\", p238) which as I said, simply moves the problem to 'where did the aliens come from?'\n \n \"COMPLEXITY THEORY \n Stuart Kauffman, a theoretical biologist at the Sante Fe Institute, has put forth the idea that when the necessary elements of the cell formed in the primordial soup (nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids), they were instantaneously integrated into a system, a system which we know as the cell (Cohen, 1996). Kauffman says this was not due to a miracle or chance, but was bound to occur. He rejects other scientists' need to find some sort of genetic carrier like RNA or DNA, or even an aperiodic solid, saying that the life forms may have had no need for them. (An aperiodic solid is one in which the atoms are arranged in some non-repeatable geometric pattern, such as a helix, that would allow for the variation within the structure that is necessary for genetic material). He believes that such genetic carriers could have evolved after the new life was already flourishing. Kauffman has even designed a computer model that shows that when a few organic molecules have developed some catalytic skills and reach the necessary level of diversity, then they spontaneously form an \"autocatalytic set\" (a life form). His theory is based on the general complexity theory, which states that when a system reaches some critical level of complexity, it will naturally produce a degree of complex order (4).\"\n http://www.lifesci.utexas.edu/cours...2/JENNIFER.html\n \n A. G. Cairns-Smith's Callisto Theory: That life began from a type of living-clay\n Richard Dawkins says of this \"Cairns-Smith believes that the original life on this planet was based on self-replicating inorganic crystals such as silicates. If this is true, organic replicators, and eventually DNA, must later have taken over or usurped the role.\"\n http://originoflife.net/cairns_smith/\n \n \"Other Theories\n In spite of the intense level of work on the RNA world in the last decade, there is no true consensus theory for precellular life. There are many theories. Here are some of the others ?\n A few scientists still say that DNA could succeed in starting life on its way (11). But even the shortest DNA strand needs proteins to help it replicate. This is the chicken-and-egg problem. \n There is a \"proteins first\" school. For example, Manfred Eigen of Germany's Max Planck Institute says, \"There is no doubt that proteins, which are more easily formed, were first on the scene\" (11.5). Of course, these first proteins must be much shorter than any used in life today, because of the sheer unlikelihood of forming useful long ones out of a soup of amino acids. \n Physicist Freeman Dyson proposes to solve the chicken-and-egg problem with a double origin, one for metabolism (proteins) and one for replication (strands of nucleotides) (12). \n In Seven Clues to the Origin of Life (13), A. G. Cairns-Smith says that clay crystals could have served as the scaffolding upon which the first short DNA or RNA genome was constructed. A new elaboration of this idea prompted one writer to wonder, \"Primordial soup or cr\u00eapes?\" (14). Even more recently, another tangent on this path leads to zeolite (14.5). \n Biologists Harold J. Morowitz (15), David Deamer (16), and others (17), advocate a theory that could be paraphrased as \"containers first.\" \n Jeffrey L. Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography holds the minority view that the early Earth was frozen and believes precellular life started in \"cold soup\" under the ice (18, 19). \n Chemists Claudia Huber and G\u00fcnter W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user say the soup where life originated was actually quite hot, probably, near undersea volcanic vents, where iron and nickel sulfides might catalyze some of the necessary reactions (19.5-19.7). \n Cornell Astronomer Thomas Gold wonders if life might have originated in a hot environment even deeper, in Earth's crust (19.8). \n Stuart Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute, says, \"...whenever a collection of molecules contains enough different kinds of molecules, a metabolism will crystallize from the broth\" (20). \n Another idea is the \"PNA world.\" Because starting the RNA world is so difficult, there probably needs to be a pre-RNA world. PNA, or peptide nucleic acid, might have some of the properties necessary to constitute that world (21). This would be pre-precellular life.\"\n http://www.panspermia.org/rnaworld.htm\n \n \n \n ADDENDUM\n \n If you're interested in aliens, check out \"The Science of Aliens\" by Clifford A. Pickover.

   "Hey everyone im new to the whole creation vs evolution thing. I don't really know where i stand but i have a question.\n\n Being new isn't a problem. Nor is uncertainty about a position. The way to learn is to ask questions in appropriate places. However, a problem with message boards is that, without experience, it may be difficult to tell who is speaking from knowledge and who is speaking from ignorance or faith.\n \nIn the theory of evolution, what did it all start with?\n\n In the theory of evolution, it all started with life. I know that you have been told that the big bang theory is part of evolution. It's not. The word evolution means change. In some situations it still has a meaning that it had back in Victorian times. It meant change in a particular direction, as in stelar evolution - stars \"evolve\" in predictable ways. It also sometimes carries the connotation of progress. But none of these meanings are applicable to theories of biological evolution. There is no concept of purpose or direction to the word when used in a biological context.\n \n Here is a more precise definition of evolution: evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population of living organisms over generations. When scientist or a knowledgable amateur speaks of the \"theory of evolution,\" it is this theory that is being discussed. Unmodified, the term has come to mean biological evolution. Those who include the big bang (cosmological evolution) or the formation, life and death of stars (stelar evolution) are either ignorant or dishonest. Even the question of the origin of life is irrelevant. One may postulate a magical, all powerful being that created the first life. The theories of evolution attempt to explain how life changes and has changed over time.\n \nWas it hydrodgen atoms that created the big bang?\n\n No. According to current cosmology, hydrogen atoms were able to form about 3 minutes after the big bang when the background radiation fell to a level below that of the binding energy of atomic nuclei. During this period the synthesis of several light nuclei occurred - hydrogen, deuterium (heavy hydrogen), helium, and lithium.\n \n In fact, we don't know what caused the big bang. Our physics doesn't seem to apply to conditions before about 10^-43 sec after the big bang. There is some speculation about quantum events, but nothing solid yet. When the big bang was first proposed by a Jesuit priest, Einstein rejected it. Einstein \"believed\" in a steady state universe. Only after Hubble demonstrated that the universe was expanding did Einstein accept the idea of a point origin for the universe. The Pope called the big bang the moment of creation.\n \nSorry I'm just trying to learn more.\n\n Me too. I just spent 2 1/2 hours a day in classes on Wed, Thurs, and Friday, and another 3 hours on Sat. Nothing wrong with learning. I have shelves and shelves of books, mostly about physics, cosmology, and biology. I've also got a lot of old computer books (that I need to throw out).\n \n But you need to understand that science isn't \"TRUTH.\" It is a process that tries to explain the physical world by observation, hypothesis, prediction and testing. Where we are still accumulating data there may be more than one hypothesis that adequately explains the data. That there are conflicting hypotheses on minor points isn't meaningful to the underlying theory. That's how science works. When someone enumerates conflicting hypotheses of science, you should doubt their motives, especially when they don't explain why it is meaningful. Be especially wary when they list debunked hypotheses as if they meant something.\n \n If you really want to learn about the topic, then check out Talk Origins. That site will tell you more than you can ever want to know about the topic.\n \n Good luck.",

   "Even talkorigins makes the odd mistakes, so be careful.\n \"Survival of the fittest\" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. This is not circular or tautologous. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified [Weiner 1994].\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA500.html\n \n \"The phrase 'survival of the fittest' was not even Darwin's. It was urged on him by Wallace, the codiscoverer of natural selection, who hated 'natural selection' because he thought it implied that something was doing the selecting. Darwin coined the term 'natural selection' because had made an analogy with 'artificial selection' as done by breeders, an analogy Wallace hadn't made when he developed his version of the theory. The phrase 'survival of the fittest' was originally due to Herbert Spencer some years before the Origin .\"\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.html\n \n The first states he never used it. The second implies he did, (and he did)* BUT after it was urged by Wallace.\n \n *&#8220;But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.&#8221; \n from the 6th edition of &#8220;Origin of the Species&#8221;\n http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species-6th-edition/chapter-03.html",
