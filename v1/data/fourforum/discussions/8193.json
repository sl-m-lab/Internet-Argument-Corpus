   "It's well-known that positive facts of cooperation between Georgian and NATO are next to none. And US 'friends' of our president decided to replace it by habitual advertising campaign.\n NATO info centers in Tbilisi and Batumi declared competition for Georgian journalists for the best article about this military block. The possibility to take part in two-day seminar about HATO history and work of military-political bloc will be given to candidates. \n I think that HATO officials hope to create positive reputation of NATO by those articles publishing among Georgia population. They are trying to hammer into our heads that Saakashvili's wish to entry into NATO will bring good for Georgia. But Saakashvili keeps silent that we will need to buy new weapons of NATO type out of our own pocket. Look, we need to change all weapons (we have now Soviet type weapons) and we will buy it form NATO members. And this is only scintilla of all. Do we have money for it? We can't feed our elderly people but we strive into new servitude. There's no reason for it.",
