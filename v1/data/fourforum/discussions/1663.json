   "Given how everyone is trying to jump on Dr. Kay as proof of some hyped intelligence or efforts by the administration to alter what we really knew, I think I need to make this post.\n \n A little backround... Dr. Kay knows of what he speaks. He worked under UNSCOM in Iraq beside people like Dr. David Kelly. He believes that the war was the right thing to do based on what he saw, not that we made a terrible judgement in getting into it.\n \n It looks, most simply, like we were victims to Iraq's secretive and unaccountable system. Example: we answered what happened to some of the VX nerve gas that Saddam had... it was burned in a traffic accident. Problem is no one wanted to be the one to tell Saddam or porduce any documents that would let him know. So we know it happened... but we don't know how much was burned off or anything.\n The Iraqi scientists were also fattening their wallets. This was reported back awhile ago by one of the magazines, and it looks like the case. Dr. Kay says that scientists were reporting progress or stock information that simply wasn't true. Once again, no one wanted to give Saddam the bad news... so no one did.\n \n The Iraqi capability was changed after Saddam's stepson defected to Jordan. He told the world about the stocks. So the Iraqis destroyed a lot of them. A new strategy was born. Instead of stocks, the Iraqis focused on capability to produce.\n \n And produce they could. We have already found their production equipment... bioreactors, seed strains, research, etc. We have all of that, it is fact that the Iraqi were capable of producing if asked to do so. \n \n And ask they did. We know for sure that several times in 200-. Saddam Hussein and his sons specifically asked about how long it would take to start back production of VX and mustard gas.\n \n Are there large stockpiles in Iraq? Maybe. Is there WMD in some quantity somewhere in Iraq? I would say that there most likely is. Dr. Kay would agree.",

He also said there was no attempt by the administration to steer the report in any direction.\n \n \n Because ricin isn't a weapon of mass destruction... and you can use WMD seed strains to make ice cream. emoticon_rolleyes That bioreactor flavor gives the beer a real kick too.",

   "Here's my take on Dr. Kay's report:\n 1) I agree, people are misquoting him when they say that it proves the Bush administration mislead us (though I'm not wholly dismissing that possibilty, more on that later). Kay clearly says that he thought the CIA was at fault, not the admistration.\n 2) Almost definitely, Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, and probably their capability to produce was overstated as well. The likely scenario was that Iraqi scientists, trying to line their own pockets and avoid being shot, gave Saddam wildly optimistic assessments about what they had/could do. Oh, and saying \"we're the victims\" of this intelligence failure is a bit rich I think, Broker.\n 3) While Dr. Kay is immensely qualified to comment on who had what WMDs, where, and whether they could make more, I don't see how he is qualified to comment on who's at fault for the mistaken intelligence in the first place. His placement of blame on the CIA might be entirely accurate, but unlike his WMD comments, he isn't an expert on the matter. I, for one, have read a very interesting New Republic article that tends to sway me the other way, that is, that the Bush administration did indeed put undue pressure on the CIA for the \"right\" intelligence which is, in the end, at fault. The point that other admins have viewed Iraq as a threat doesn't change this, TNR points out that few, even now, disagree that Iraq was a threat, they just disagreed on the scope and degree. The Bush admin committed a travesty of justice when they sought to influence the CIA to enhance the degree to make the case for war.\n \n Oh, and full disclosure, I supported the war at first. So I'm not sitting here as some hyper-liberal, \"i-told-u-so\" ambusher. My personal reasons for the war are still valid (removing evil dictators etc.). What disturbs me is how facts were stretched and international credibilty ruined by the manner in which we carried it out.",
