   "Seems a bit wooly to me. How do they define left and right wing causes? It's also a big assumption to assume that the legislature of a country is in the same position as its population. For example the UK parliament long ago abolished the death penalty, though opinion in the country is heavily in favour of it; and voted in favour of joining the invasion of Iraq, though most of the population was against it. Also, for most (all?) of the last 10 years surveyed, congress has been republican controlled to a far greater extent than presidential election votes, for example, would suggest. There is also the issue the politicians, once in power, have a natural tendency to become more conservative in civil liberties issues.",
