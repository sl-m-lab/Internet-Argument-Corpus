   "There are many theories emerging now, which point to the customers of the 'caricature' scandal. This was surely a well-pondered operation rather than sort of impromptu. Who forced Denmark to throw the first stone, which made waves spreading to nearly all European countries? I guess it must be some force interested in destabilization of Old Europe and perhaps much annoyed by its strong desire to get rid of all kinds of 'refugees'. In reality most of them turned out to be people with the criminal background with some of them being terrorists. The answer is America!\n And Denmark was not her sudden choice. The notorious \"Jylands Posten, the first to publish scandalous cartoons, is owned by the Danish oil mogul Alderp. And his wife is the chief editor of the newspaper. Alderp's company DONG has been on the slide in recent times. American 'friends' suggested a way out of the deadlock. Some people close to big fliers in oil sphere talk of some secret dealing. This was actually kind of a change. The Danes publishes cartoons to get American nod opening way for DONG's participation in Iraqi oil production. Definitely, it was worth it!",
