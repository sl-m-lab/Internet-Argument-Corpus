Trial, accusation evidence isn't required. Those possibly reinstate the person, otherwise they are immediatly under penalty.\n \n While in an emergency most agree any person can perform one of the sacraments as long as the intent was to do as the church does and recieve the rite. Some will have them done by the proper person when and if possible and some will not accept rites performed by any person other than the one permitted to do so. \n \n So if the intent is not present or if proper observation of the words or actions is not correct the sacrament is invalid. Certain actions that are Lat\u00e6 sententi\u00e6 carry the punishment of excommunication. The problem is the priest cannot effect the rites he is performing and since he has not been caught he is still performing them. Which means anybody he married, baptised, gave mass over or communion or anything else isn't valid. \n \n It has actually happened where a priest made notes in his journal wher of 125 people 80 had passed away and because od f this person those 80 are in the pit with no hop of salvation",
