   "Dear Sirs! I want to draw your attention to a most serious and complex situation that is in progress in Georgia nowadays. I am a journalist and I work in Georgia. Since the very beginning of Saakashvili's term, it has been very hard and dangerous to be a journalist here. People like me are simply hounded by the police and pro-Saakashvili services because Saakashvili realizes all right we know a lot that common people don't. So to say, we are advocates of true democracy (which has nothing in common with Saakashvili's style) and we have certain powers over him and have to pay for this. For example, two directors of independent TV Company \"202\" Shalva Ramishvili and David Kokhreidze are now serving a five-year term of imprisonment for alleged extorting money from former deputy of Georgia's parliament Koba Bekauri, though actually they smarted for criticism of Saakashvili's regime and letting out compromising information. \n \n Now we've got a new rung of Saakashvili's tyranny that local journalists have dubbed \"Cloak and dagger scandal\". On 28 March, people of Saakashvili arrested his personal adviser Simon Kilidze on suspicion of \"espionage activities\". After that Saakashvili addressed all alleged intelligencers within borders of Georgia to turn themselves in. \n \n But this is all rubbish! Spy scare is a new means Saakashvili is about to use for switching attention to from numerous urgent problems like low level of living, general unemployment, etc. Besides, this enables Saakashvili to wipe up his political enemies (including us - journalists) in a legal way.",
