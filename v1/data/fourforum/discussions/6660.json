This piece will focus on the curriculum that needs to be followed. \n\n I am a firm believer in privatization of schools as well. Uncle Sam has done a dismal job by maintaining an educational monopoly, run by unionized labor unaccountable to the ultimate \"customers\". \n \n \n Everytime I encounter someone in the workplace, I am reminded of just how much we have failed to properly educate United States citizens in the fundamentals of communication: reading, writing and speaking.

Training in mathematics should be limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Unless communication skills are fully mastered, there is no need to advance to high school.\n\n I totally disagree with that approach. Americans aren't getting their arses handed to them in communication, they're getting their brains beat out in mathematical-based sciences. China and Japan graduate 500,000 engineers/year; the US graduates 50-60k/year. Why? Because the mathematics involved in engineering curriculum is beyond the capabilities of most US HS graduates. It's much easier for them to go into fields that don't require a heavy background in math, precisely because of thinking such as yours above. \n \n \n For those who graduate to high school, the emphasis could evolve into a curriculum of philosophy, sociology, economics, psychology, science and religious studies. Books such as \"For Dummies\" and \"The Complete Idiot's Guide\" could be used to foster an understanding of different religions. \n\n And doing so would put US students even further behind their global competitors. The world runs on science, why handicap our kids further?\n \n\n Athletic activity would be strictly confined to cardio vascular exercises and all sports would be eliminated. \n\n Great, OBE sports. No winners, just \"participation trophies\". That really teaches kids how to compete in a competitive global marketplace. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n While there would still be an emphasis on communication skills, the focus would now be on developing a foundation of basic knowledge so as to be able to graduate to college.

Think of how different our society would be if our education system could just teach the fundamentals of reading, writing and speaking.\n\n \n Ah yes, the \"worker bee\" theory of education. Identify the worker bee early enough and you don't have to waste time educating him on such inane topics such as math and science. Just increase theyr dexterity to the point at which they can turn a wrench adroitly. No thanks. That's the way communist states think, not free ones.\n The fact is that, in today's world EVERYONE needs a college-level education. I live in the automotive capital of the world and as high priced manual labor jobs leave, the displaced workers aren't qualified to do anything that requires a brain. Is that the future that you want? Or do you think that these \"worker bees\" will be satisfied making Third World worker bee wages for the rest of their life?\n Ever wonder how a country devoid of natural resources, like Japan, can become a world economic power? They do it because their greatest natural resource is brain power. What is it that is bringing up India and several former USSR states economies? Brain power. Kiev, for example, is becoming a magnet for foreign investors wanting to do basic chemical research. India is a magnet for computer programming. \n \n The problem isn't that Americans can't communicate. The problem is that nobody is hiring bullshooters. They want workers with technical knowledge to help them solve real problems, such as how to generate more energy economically, how to move masses of people more efficiently, etc., The world isn't lining up at the doors of American orators, I can guarantee you that.",

This is why we have assembly line workers making $35 an hour, plumbers making more than doctors, and auto mechanics pulling down $100K per year. Skilled or semi skilled workers are hard to come by. business majors or even engineers are a dime a dozen. We cannot keep the ones we DO have employed. \n \n Our colleges have become an extension of high school. We are turning out more people with college degrees, sure, but the quality of their education is pathetic. Yet they get out of college and expect better than an assembly line job, so they join the ranks of middle management. Many companies who move their production offshore do so not only to save labor costs, but becuase there is an abundance of skiled workers available and they get better product. \n \n The absolute LAST thing we need is more colledge educated middle management drones running around. If nothing else, the layoffs we have sen in the last year should have taught us that you can remove a significant portion of your middle management and it makes your company more effective, not less. Lets face it, the middle management retards have built the buracracy int his country to the point that the cost of supporting it makes the price production labor look insignificant. THAT is where we need to start cutting. Cuts in production labor inevitably lead to local corrections in the labor market. People are out of work for a few months, which drives down labor prices, which creates jobs as companies take advantage of the lower labor rates to expand.\n \n Youar average blue collar worker that is unemplyed draws unemployment for 4 months and is then back in the workforce. Your average white collar worker who is unemplyed maxes out their unemployment, making it nearly impossible to accuratly gauge how long they remain unemployed (though most estimates put it at 9 month to a year).\n \n We need more indians, less chiefs.",

I have three kids in college as I write this and I can tell you that the one going to engineering school is about 3 years ahead of where I was when I got my bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1978. He surpassed my mathematic ability (which included 4 semesters of Calculus in college) by the end of his senior year in HS. Granted, he attended a gifted high school, but I've seen his college level mathematics courses and they're light-years ahead thanks to computers and the like.\n \n\n To expand that mediocrity by granting public funding to any entity thrown together that meets federal academic requirements will further dilute quality of education and greatly increase federal control of curriculum. While you obviously favor parochial schools, and they have done a fine job in the past, it would create an explosion of schools for profit with dubious academic intent. \n\n I'm surprised with that answer. What you are describing \" To expand that mediocrity by granting public funding to any entity thrown together that meets federal academic requirements will further dilute quality of education and greatly increase federal control of curriculum\" fits our current governmentally-controlled educational monopoly to a tee. Isn't it about time that we changed our paradigm on education?\n \n\n Those who champion a voucher program might as well be honest and state they desire fascist state schools. That would create absolute federal control over everything from dress codes to curriculum meeting the lowest possible academic standard to facilitate each and every student.\n\n How so? IMO, it would give flexibility to parents to send their kids to schools that meet their needs and desires. If the parents wanted a strict environment, that could be one option. If the parents wanted a more open school, they could choose that as well. How does absolute freedom promote fascism? Unles you're saying that the majority of Americans would become fascist by choice. emoticon_confused\n \n\n This is a constitutional republic. The general public has expressed apathy for quality education and encouraged fiscal irresponsibility by enabling and supporting leadership with all the qualities of banana belt dictators. Until that public proves itself capable of demanding and structuring positive change within the system it creates, I don't care to trust their obviously flawed, personal judgment on how to better spend my tax money.\n\n \n So, IYO, the public must first try to repair the irrepairable BEFORE they can do something different? And the only reason that there is a belief that the public is apathetic is because most have bought into the teacher union dogma that the way to cure a crappy educational system is to throw more money at it (and right into teachers' pockets). My days of being intimately involved in public education are waning. Three years from now, I probably won't have a single kid in any educational institutional institution anywhere. But, I stil want to see change because without change, we're getting our heads handed to us in the world arena of manufacturing and other science-based endeavors.",
