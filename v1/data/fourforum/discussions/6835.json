   "The deal is these \"evangelicals\" are also fundementalist christians. They are just as dangerous as fundementalist muslims or fundementalist anything. \n\n \n The Dangers of Liberal Fundamentalists\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines, that seeks to elevate the ways and \"wisdom\" of man above the wisdom and desires of God. It's principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are \"revisited\" through suspect liberal \"scholarship\" or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today's liberal elitists .\n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists were the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love\", illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat, and tears and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt.\n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice were foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong\", \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than it \"feels good, so let's do it\". The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their carnal minds was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. \n \n One of the most revered mantras of the liberal fundamentalists is \"equality\". The net effect of this experiment was to elevate women via the degradation of men; promote racial equality by instituting racial-based preferences and reverse-discrimination; engender class warfare against people of means via the redistribution of wealth (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than rely on one's own personal initiative and work ethic); and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, and other corrupt lifestyles) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance\".However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a corrupted partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant.\" \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom\", liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses which are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools, embrace a de-facto litmus test against possible pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, seek to squelch religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws, and generally engage in a whole range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values.\n \n Liberal fundamentalism undermines the basic effectiveness of the government, legislatures, and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.",

In fact, Jesus is the God of the Old Testament.\n \n Was Jesus a liberal? (And don't confuse political conservatism / liberalism with Biblical conservatism / liberalism). As God, Jesus is the one who gave Moses the Levitical law against gay sex to begin with; and he's the one who inspires all Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16), including Romans 1:26-27 and I Corinthians 6:9-10. He's the one who knits together babies in their mother's wombs (Psalm 139:13) that you liberals love to butcher. He's the one who said to the adulteress, \"Go and sin no more'. Liberals often say there is no sin, and they'll do whoever they want, any way they want, whenever they want, and will do them with pride. Jesus is the one who says a man shall reap what he sows, as opposed to the liberals' greedy \"redistribution of wealth\" scheme, which says that people should reap for a living what other people sow. And Jesus is the one in the Book of Revelation who judges wicked sinners and sends them to the Lake of Fire. Liberals would never cast judgments, unless they're talking to a conservative, and then they turn into Mr. Judgmental themselves. And if liberals could recognize evil at all they'd either show tolerance towards it, endlessly debate it at the U.N., or appease it until the cows came home. Jesus a liberal? Get real.\n \n And for the record, Jesus \"conserved\" the law of God in his day. It was the corrupt pharisees, etc., who took (liberal) \"liberties\" with it to begin with.",

You can't objectively ask yourself the hard questions like 'what reason do I have to believe in the Bible over the Space Monkey book?'. Thus any conversation with you is wasted, because when confronted with questions you can't answer, you simply ignore them or resort to thumping your bible even harder.\n \n However, I won't put you on ignore. Because ignoring biased, hateful and willfully ignorant people who, like yourself, seek refuge in religion is what leads to their growth in power and influence. You need to be confronted, your beliefs challenged, and the ignorance of your views exposed so that everyone who witnesses it can see for themselves how simply outrageous belief in the bible is.\n \n And so I will continue to badger you, every time you tell someone they are wrong or sinful because the bible says so. Every time you hold the bible up as a true document, I will ask \"What conclusive evidence do you have which indicates that the bible being wholly true and accurate is the most likely of all possible theories or explanations?\" And any answers you give me will be put through the wringer.\n\n \n Spoken like a true, anti-biblical bigot. Remember, we have an objective basis for our beliefs in the Bible. You don't even have that much. Like I've asked you before, what objective basis do you have for your failed, liberal beliefs? Do you just want to whine against Jesus and the Bible or do you have something better to offer up that isn't the invention of carnal men or whining, liberal women?",

People are not anti-Christian when you simply tell them exactly what Jesus said. They are anti-Christian when they are told lies and distortions about what he said - and that is exactly what you do. What you think the Bible says and what it actually says are very different. You are part of the problem. People speak out against others who speak in the tone you speak in, a tone replete with venom and bile. Jesus would speak out against it to. So those people who are speaking out against your words are really following Jesus' teachings and doing God's work.",
