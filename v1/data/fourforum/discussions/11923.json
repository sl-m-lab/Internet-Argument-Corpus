But you just love to jump on the bandwagon of blame and slander rather than seek out the truth behind the propaganda. \n Palin denounces anonymous critics as 'cowardly'\n \n By DAN JOLING, Associated Press Writer\n Sat Nov 8, 7:07 am ET\n ANCHORAGE, Alaska - Gov. Sarah Palin denounced anonymous criticisms leveled at her by former John McCain aides as lies, including allegations that Republican lawyers were traveling to Alaska to reclaim her high-priced wardrobe and that she didn't know Africa was a continent.\n \"Those accounts are not true,\" the former Republican vice presidential candidate said in her first public comments on the matter since the election Tuesday.\n Palin returned Friday to her Anchorage governor's office and said she had no immediate plans to build on her newfound national name-recognition and popularity with the Republican base for a possible 2012 presidential run.\n Instead, Palin said, she wanted only to get back to the governor's desk to advance a proposed pipeline tapping Alaska's vast North Slope natural gas reserves and to prepare Alaska's proposed 2010 budget.\n As for the vice presidential campaign, Palin denounced criticism from unidentified McCain campaign aides as \"cowardly.\" She said she found it frustrating trying to respond to false allegations when she didn't know who was making them.\n \"It's ridiculous,\" she told reporters. \"You guys report based on anonymous sources, so it's hard to have a defense.\"\n One report said she and her family went on a shopping spree, spending more than the $150,000 in clothing that the Republican National Committee had earlier reported.\n \"The RNC purchased clothes,\" Palin said.\n \"Those are the RNC's clothes. They're not my clothes. I never forced anybody to buy anything. I never asked for anything more than maybe a Diet Dr Pepper once in a while.\"\n The RNC will inventory clothing it purchased for her to account for dollars spent, she said. She scoffed at reports that the RNC was sending lawyers to take back clothes from her home.\n \"It's not happening. Nobody's told me that they're coming to my house to look through closets, to look through anything. The belly of the plane that had clothes in it, and those clothes being packed up and sent back by staffers, perhaps that's what they're talking about, but these aren't attorneys.\"\n She said she wasn't angry at the continued coverage of her clothing, but mostly disappointed.\n \"This is Barack Obama's time right now, and this is an historic moment in our nation and this can be a shining moment for America and our history, and look what we're talking about. Again, we're talking about my shoes and belts and skirts. It's ridiculous.\"\n She also denied a report that she didn't know Africa was a continent, not a country, and that she didn't know the members of the North American Free Trade Agreement - the United States, Canada and Mexico. She remembered discussing both Africa and Obama's stance on NAFTA with people preparing her for her debate, she said. Anything reported as a gaffe was taken out of context, she said.\n \"That's cruel. It's mean-spirited. It's immature. It's unprofessional and those guys are jerks if they came away with it, taking things out of context, and then tried to spread something on national news. It's not fair and it's not right.\"Palin denounces anonymous critics as 'cowardly' - Yahoo! News\n \n This woman has more class in her little finger than all of the critics of her combined, and that includes you Jo. And if you think her political career is dead then you're kidding yourself.

It's time to for the republican party to update itself a little. \n \n As for Palin, I would bet dollars to donuts that she will not be in the future of national politics.

And it also occurs to me that perhaps the ##### yelling \"kill him\" may have been thinking of Ayers. \n \n As far as Ayers, I would say that at least he once was a terrorist. Anyone who participates in bombing NYC Police HQ, the Capitol, and the Pentagon is a terrorist in my book. Personally, I could care less who Obama associates with. If he chooses to hang around with Ayers, it's his problem. As far as I am concerned, Ayers and the rest of his bomb happy cohorts should still be in prison. I'm not narrow minded enough to entertain the notion that Ayers actions of the past translate into Obama's actions of the future. Ayers is a loser, and if Obama want's to hang around with losers...so be it.",

It took place before you even composed your little rant. Spain sold their treasuries with a bid to cover ratio of 2.2 (which means they had 2.2 buyers for every bond they actually had for sale). They sold at a lower yield than their december issue did. Apparently the rest of the world is not nearly as concerned as you are.\n \n I'm going to let you in on a little secret here. The \"European debt crisis\" does not actually exist. The problem they are having in Euro zone nations is that they can not just directly monetarize their debt because limitations on debt and currency creation are part of the deal when you join the eurozone. They designed it that way on purpose, and did so because in the entire history of the planet earth there has never been a case where a nation monetizing their debt turned out well. It leads to inflation and then hyperinflation. \n \n Our central bank here in the US has fired up the printing presses and is printing money as fast as they possibly can. Even with interest rates at zero it has not (and will not) revived the economy. So they started their quantitative easing where they literally print money to buy US treasuries. Now we have QE2 (another round of quantitative easing) where they are directly monetizing the debt 100%. There has not been a single time in the history of the planet earth that a government has directly monetized their debt and the economy did not end up collapsing. Not once, not EVER.\n \n So, while European nations are tightening their belts and taking steps to bring their government spending under control, the US government is literally promising to decrease government spending by 2%, as soon as they finish raising it by 18%.\n \n That is why the Chinese and Japanese have both stated in the last 2 weeks that they will be heavy buyers or eurozone bonds, and that they would do it to the detriment of US bond purchases. It is because the US is LITERALLY insolvent and printing money to hide the fact, and everybody in the world knows it (present company excepted, of course). European nations are having a short term liquidity problem, but they WILL come out the other side stronger because of their self imposed fiscal restraint.",
