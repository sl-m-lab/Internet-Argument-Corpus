Ever hear tell of the \"one drop rule\"??? During as recent as the 1920's and 30's any person with any or a small percentage of black ancestry was classified as \"black\". (From Wiki):\n One-drop rule - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Jim Crow laws reached their greatest influence during the decades from 1910&#8211;1930. Among them were hypodescent laws, defining as black anyone with any black ancestry, or with a very small portion of black ancestry.[6] Tennessee adopted such a \"one-drop\" statute in 1910, and Louisiana soon followed. Then Texas and Arkansas in 1911, Mississippi in 1917, North Carolina in 1923, Virginia in 1924, Alabama and Georgia in 1927, and Oklahoma in 1931. During this same period, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Utah retained their old \"blood fraction\" statutes de jure, but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirtysecond) to be equivalent to one-drop de facto.[7]\n \n And it really doesn't matter what you think about it. On the last census, Barack Obama listed his race as \"African-American\", when he could have easily listed it as \"mixed\" or \"other\". You don't get to define people. People define themselves. Republicans treat him like a typical \"n-word\"....why wouldn't he identify as such? Stupid. \n I have a cousin whose mother is a great-grand niece of famed humorist Will Rogers. Her mother is white. She married my cousin, and produced my cousin, C.A., who could easily pass for white, but identifies as a black woman. Oddly enough, at the school she teaches at, her fellow teachers were unaware of her heritage and launched into some racist jokes....and when she revealed the fact that she was half-black, their faces were \"cracked\". I betcha they never told another racist joke in her presence. \n \n Davenport is a vile and vicious racist. In my opinion, so are you. Were you thinking you could twist my words?

   "All I could do was face palm when I read this poet. Something has seriously demented your mind. Look in your own mirror, you are a racist if you think that race affects individual character, value, or entitlement. That is what racism means.\n \n \n According to Dr. Ron Smothermon, author of \"Winning through Enlightenment\", he writes, \" Race is a false concept invented by the mind of man for the purpose of dominating and manipulating others. (Show me where blacks dominate whites, and you'll understand where \"true\" racism emanates from). The specific location of race within the mind is in that part known as \"belief systems\". A belief exists that there is a natural division of people. Resting on this belief is a system of justification making it OK to segregate some from others. Further justification makes it OK to think of the other race as naturally inferior, or \"whatever\". Both of these are positions or points of view (having no basis in reality) . So the structure goes something like this: the foundation stone is the belief called \"race is a natural condition\". This belief supports the justification \"there is a natural division of humankind\". This gives rise to the point of view \"they are naturally the way they are\". This point of view makes it possible to prepare people for mistreatment by segregation. At that point, the whole thing surfaces and mistreatment is called \"mistreatment\". The important thing to realize here is that mistreatment could not occur without its' supporting structure\". \n \n \n Thank you, but I'll accept Dr. Smothermon's definition of racism. Clearly, this is precisely why slavery in America, happened and thrived. And there is nothing in American History to compare white racism with racism from any other group. Nothing. Period. End of discussion.\n And you couldn't be more confused and wrong by asserting that I am remotely racist. You saying it, doesn't make it true, no matter how many times you repeat yourself.\n It doesn't it's a few off genes, there is tons of diversity in the human genome and you are (notice I don't say you are condoning) YOU ARE pretending that a tiny subset of this diversity is somehow more meaningful than the rest just because it's more visible.\n \n Are you having difficulty writing English, because your highlighted portion made no sense?\n Excuse me, but you are confused.

I was the first black cardiopulmonary tech in the Texas Medical Center. I've been a member of mixed bands, since high school. My readers group consists mainly of middle-aged white and Jewish women. I attended my white artist neighbor's open house, on yesterday, where he was singing my praises to anyone within earshot, for the video work my associate and I have done for him. Apparently, more projects are on the way.\n The white woman I met at the affair is bringing me a bottle of wine, as a thanks for fixing the hard drive of her computer. I have cousins who married and bore children of white men and women. Russian, Italian, Dutch, and who knows what else. So, all of this flies in the face of your allegations that I am a racist. Racists, tend not to socialize or interact, personally, with the objects of their hate. That, obviously, wouldn't be me. \n My partner is mistaken for white, all the time...but being European, he can't seem to get over the arrogance, the stupidity, and the square-mindedness of your average white American.

It ain't all that cute to be white. It's not as special as you'd like to believe. Oft times it comes with much baggage, and accompanying guilt, which many of you refuse to acknowledge much less deal with. When I mess up, I take responsibility, apologize and move on. That would be a novel and new concept for the likes of you and yours. In your eyes, you never ever do anything wrong...not even when it's captured on film ( Rodney King). Many of you would like to blame the slave trade and chattal slavery in American on the Africans, as if a collective gun were held to the heads of white slavers forcing them to take the human cargo to American shores. Nonsense like that. It's been offered up as viable on numerous forums to which I've frequented.

If you have been faking your racism as an interesting experiment than I would still be right that you have been speaking like a racist.\n \n I am defining a new variable Race X, poet is in race X. I would use a real one if I had any idea what he was. I will use race X as poet tries to use real races to make more apparent his racism as his attempts to stay and irritate me and others go on.\n \nI know that your reprobate mind and your 'white privilege\" dictates that you do so\n\n I know your retarded X mind dictates that you imagine things like that but please try not to.\n \n \n, but, in all honesty, what you think you know and what is, are two completely different things. \n\n I know what you've typed.\n \n \nYou claim a paradox exists, and indeed, it might. I consider myself to be anti-racist, as I don't believe any one race precludes another, on any level. I was raised that way, by my mother, who had every reason to be a hateful racist, but because of the Christ in her, loved and accepted everyone with the heart of Christ. I understand you probably don't know anything about that. But that's ok....imagine. \n\n I am familiar with such delusions, as I am with yours that makes you think you are actually fighting against racism when you constantly note people's races and give yourself a pat on the back when you find you don't hate someone. You are racist because you are even checking.\n \n \nWhat you fail to acknowledge is the extreme disgust Europeans feel when arrogant Americans (almost always \"white Americans\") go to Europe and show their behinds and their tackiness, and their disrespect for others. That sense of entitlement and privilege, which comes from who knows where, or why.\n\n The sense of entitlement that Americans have is due to their tradition of economic excellence. The sense of pride they have is from all the great things Americans have done.\n \n I agree it is totally misplaced in a lazy miscreant who believes in nothing our heroes have but just happened to be born here.\n \n \nThen you want to call me un-American for calling you out on your XXXX. \n\n You're un-american because you are a racist, racism is collectivism, which is incompatible with the vision of the free productive individual as the standard of society.\n \n \nWhat is more American than honest dissent?\n\n Being right, defining yourself and others by individual beliefs and actions.\n \n Mindless dissent is no more American than mindless agreement is like the U.S. pulling together to accomplish some great feat like defeating your philosophical pals in nazi germany and imperialist japan.\n \n \nI have a right to express how I feel, by way of the 1st amendment, that you often overlook in lieu of the 2nd amendment....your favorite...having to do with guns.\n\n I have a right to express how I feel, I feel your beliefs are diseased, wrong, and dangerous.\n \n \nYet, you'd call yourselves sane and reasonable.\n\n Addressing a plural again.... I think we just turned into a collective again, me. emoticon_xbouncer\n \n Would you like I/Us/Gaia to to use this pronoun from now on?\n \n \nYou can't even see yourselves as you really are. Tunnel vision blocks you. Which goes further to block you from seeing your own racism and feelings of natural superiority, founded in delusion. \n \n The thing is you don't like being told about yourself...but you have absolutely no qualms in telling me about me. I don't buy it.\n\n Ah I see you want to try the a racist name calling game. Problem is I have got 5 statements from you that are unmistakably racist. You don't have the same for me.\n \n \nHouse Caucasians????\n My partner, though often mistaken for being Caucasian, is not...and would find offense at being labeled as such.\n\n I see, then he is either quite enlightened and is offended by the existance of such labels as relevant or he is offended because he doesn't think he fits the bill in which case he is racist and delusional like you.\n \n \nIt ain't all that cute to be white.\n\n That's a matter of opinion. I think white people in red, black, or purple clothes give much better contrast to the color than darker skins. On the other hand dark skin goes great with very light colors, especially white and sky blue. I like either case because it attracts attention to the face.\n \n \nIt's not as special as you'd like to believe.\n\n It's overall a disadvantage if you live somewhere with a strong sun. Doesn't really matter much anymore though.\n \n \nOft times it comes with much baggage, and accompanying guilt, which many of you refuse to acknowledge much less deal with.\n\n No one inherits guilt or pride. The only way to properly gain pride from something great is by acknowledging that you value it just as it's creators did. Likewise the only way to properly gain guilt from something evil is by valuing it as the creators did even though you know it to be wrong.\n \n \nWhen I mess up, I take responsibility, apologize and move on. That would be a novel and new concept for the likes of you and yours.\n\n <sarcastic mocking<\n Ah well then there was this X who lived oh I don't know 10,000 years ago. He stole my ancestors two goats and a pomegranate. I want an apology!\n </sarcastic mocking<\n \n \nIn your eyes, you never ever do anything wrong...not even when it's captured on film ( Rodney King). \n\n <sarcastic mocking<\n Damn! I thought you would never find out I/We/Collective beat that poor kid senseless.... Well I/We/Collective are 23.5% sorry according to the latest poll.\n </sarcastic mocking<\n \n I my eyes, I have done wrong things; but never racism and certainly not beating someone up.\n \n \nMany of you would like to blame the slave trade and chattal slavery in American on the Africans\n\n The slave trade in America was the fault of Americans, the slave trade in the rest of the world isn't. Islamic race slavery is what introduced the idea to the Spanish in contrast to their feudalistic slavery. It is only the insane idea that slavery was an American invention or specifically a non-african thing that prompts people to point this out.\n \n If you were born in America you are as much subject to any national blame that you claim exists as everyone else here.\n \n \nNonsense like that. It's been offered up as viable on numerous forums to which I've frequented. No lie. \n\n You will find it much easier to argue with racist like yourself than me.\n \n \nAnd it's true...all the whites, claiming to be my friends, and all up in my face, could be lying too.\n\n ohh, got to add paranoia to the list of symptoms (scribbles on pad).\n \n \nI choose not to believe that, though. I hope they choose the same. I'd like to believe that we can gently put down the weapons of hate and mistrust, onto the ground, and extend our hands in friendship and unity for the collective good...but then, again, some say the moon is made of green cheese.

This isn't true and if you think it is, you're racist plan and simple. \n \n So you should proceed how you would any other poster on these forums...as if you know nothing about them, because you don't.\n\n \n Oh, darling, doesn't it? If you are, as I believe, \"black\", and conservative (heaven help you), to accept and embrace the Republican platform, you essentially have sold your birthright down the proverbial river, because Republicans care nothing for your black derriere, and would enslave you, all over again, if only they could. \n You completely overlook 'white privilege', which dictates that a white person could be homeless, dirty, uneducated, drug-addled, and or criminal, and he would get a pass before you would, simply because of the color of his skin. \n You've drunk the koolaid, and can't discern ca ca from truth. \n And so you've joined with the white racists and pointed fingers at me, because I upset the applecart, and the status quo, and refuse to bend or mind. \n Again i ask....are you white? Hispanic? Asian? or Black? Not a trick question.",

I rarely have trouble understanding the posts of other people even when it's apparent they do as little proof reading as me :p but you are right many have complained about it.

I very rarely get into an argument and then are convinced by the other that my position is wrong; but it used to happen much more often. When that happened I said so.\n \n I don't know why people are afraid to do that, they seem to have this delusion that a debate is a contest of wills or something and that it is dishonorable to lose one.

I think 90% of the debates people start with me are lost before they started because I have had dozens of extremely similar debates with others on other forums and real life that all ended with my current conclusion (which as I pointed is not necessarily always been my conclusion) has triumphed even if not both debaters would admit it.\n \n I get snide remarks basically along the lines of \"you're always right aren't you freedom\". I have said that is not true, but as to how often I am right what else can you expect if you are willing to accept the results of debates. If you people would do the same, the same thing would happen to you and you would start winning almost all the time too. It's like a grand session of flash cards, if you learn from your mistakes eventually you are going to get every card right.\n \n Among the phenomenon I find most annoying in other debaters is the mob flocking mentality that sometimes takes over, in which they become more irrationally arrogant exponentially with how many agree with them. It makes me upset because not only is it logically irrelevant but it gives an unpleasant insight into the thought processes of those involved, it is clear that they see it more as a power struggle than a search for truth; I feel like I am on a debate stage and they are a school yard gang. It makes me feel elevated and I'm sorry if that offends you.\n \n I am proud of my behavior on this and other forums, the dedication I give to individual debates is a favour others rarely give me; I work hard to maintain the formal science of logic in exchanges and you know that is sometimes near impossible. I also try very hard not to let emotions affect my posts and think I suceed at that as well as anyone I've seen.\n \n I remember how your name ended up in my signature.

Trebor and even accipiter spend most of their time with useless one line dismissals but I have seen them both come out of their absurd pointless shells every once and a while and really debate something, presumably when they care enough or think they can win.\n \n \nAsking why he does not want to debate with you in favour of trading insults with(lets face it) me and JP is giving him more credit than he deserves.\n\n Well since he's not going to answer that he won't mind a little speculation from me.\n \n He is more comfortable trading insults because his position is entirely emotional and regardless of his actual maturity level his presence here is entirely about self-justification of all that resentment he's got. Insulting people and being insulted in return fits the way he sees things and let's him feel like he's fighting back by letting his contempt and hatred for 'white privilege' known.\n \n It doesn't matter who's actually white or who actually thinks themselves entitled because of their race. He needs crackers to rage at.\n \n People like him also don't understand racism, they think it's narrowly hatred of another race where your race oppresses the other. Since he does not racism truly is he has become a racist and fallen into racist thought patterns, patterns which he assumes are universal.\n \n Racism as I have said before is the irrational recognition of values based on race. Aryan pride in a German is only the flip side of persecution of non-aryans. Black pride is only the shiny side of contempt for other races. There is no more reason to be proud that your skin is dark then there is to hold people in contempt for the same.\n \n The fact that he thinks of his friends and himself by race, as if it were a family name or nationality is undeniably racist. It does not matter that he allows himself to like some white people. It matters that he thinks of them in a significant way as white people.\n \n When I said 'people like you' comparing him to racist fascist he betrayed the way he thinks about humanity. He responded 'no people like you, europeans'\n \n It did not occur to him that I was delimiting behavior according to philosophical belief, he assumed it was race because that is how he thinks. If he was not racist and merely referencing racism in others he would not have said that. He would have said that race had nothing to do with why the Nazi's did what they did; that I was wrong for thinking that. Instead he accepted his own imaginary premise that race did have something to do with it and proceeded to take the opportunity to burden the similarly imaginary blame cart for the entire collective of white people.\n \n He is a racist, and he sees white people where there are none. Stalking 'white people' across the internet is his version of going to a bar to talk hate-speak with the good old southern boys.",

There is no more reason to be proud that your skin is dark then there is to hold people in contempt for the same.\n \n The fact that he thinks of his friends and himself by race, as if it were a family name or nationality is undeniably racist. It does not matter that he allows himself to like some white people. It matters that he thinks of them in a significant way as white people.\n \n When I said 'people like you' comparing him to racist fascist he betrayed the way he thinks about humanity. He responded 'no people like you, europeans'\n \n It did not occur to him that I was delimiting behavior according to philosophical belief, he assumed it was race because that is how he thinks. If he was not racist and merely referencing racism in others he would not have said that. He would have said that race had nothing to do with why the Nazi's did what they did; that I was wrong for thinking that. Instead he accepted his own imaginary premise that race did have something to do with it and proceeded to take the opportunity to burden the similarly imaginary blame cart for the entire collective of white people.\n \n He is a racist, and he sees white people where there are none. Stalking 'white people' across the internet is his version of going to a bar to talk hate-speak with the good old southern boys.\n\n \n I had nothing to admit Freedom but I dont particularly want to rake over the traces.\n \n I tend to argue in small frame. I have no intention to slice and dice a post into tiny bites of argument and will abandon most points to concentrate on one or two small ones.\n I believe that some people on this forum slice and dice the posts to distract and deviate from the point the previous poster made and I think you have been guilty of that on more than one occasion.\n \n I did not attempt to compliment you .",

   "Oh, darling, doesn't it? If you are, as I believe, \"black\", and conservative (heaven help you), to accept and embrace the Republican platform, you essentially have sold your birthright down the proverbial river, because Republicans care nothing for your black derriere, and would enslave you, all over again, if only they could. \nI haven't voted republican in years but I have to say you are pretty ignorant if you think the democrat party is doing much for the black community.
