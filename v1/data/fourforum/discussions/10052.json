The rope around his neck is five feet long and his feet are four feet off the ground. The walls are fifteen feet away. There is nothing else in the building, no ladders or boxes. How did the man manage to hang himself?\n Answer: He stood on a block of ice until it melted.\n \n 2. A stranger entered a bar and ordered a glass of water. The barmaid said nothing, but grabbed a gun and aimed it at his head. Why did the man simply smile, thank her, and then leave?\n Answer: The stranger was suffering from hiccups, which is why he asked for some water. The barman realised this and drew the gun in order to give the man a shock. This worked, the man was cured of his hiccups and, no longer needing the water, left.\n \n 3. A father and son were involved in a car accident and rushed to hospital. On seeing the unconscious young boy, the surgeon exclaimed, \"Oh no, that's my son\". How can this be true?\n Answer: The surgeon was the boy's mother\n \n 4. A train was speeding down the track towards a nun who had fallen asleep on the railway line after a particularly rowdy party. The train had no headlights on, there was no moonlight, and no overhead lighting. How was the driver able to stop the train before hitting her?\n Answer: It was midday, so the driver saw her.\n \n 5. A truck attempted to drive under a low bridge but got caught underneath it. People stopped and tried to help the driver free the vehicle, but they couldn't push it either forwards or backwards. How did they eventually free his vehicle?\n Answer: They let some air out of the tires, thus allowing them to push the vehicle free\n \n 6. Detective Smith finds Romeo and Juliet dead on the kitchen floor surrounded by broken glass. They were alone when they died. What killed them?\n Answer: Romeo and Juliet were goldfish whose bowl was knocked over by an intruding dog. They died from asphyxiation.\n \n 7. A man lives on the twelfth floor of an apartment building. Every morning he takes the elevator down to the lobby and leaves the building. In the evening, he gets into the elevator, and, if there is someone else in the elevator -- or if it was raining that day -- he goes back to his floor directly. Otherwise, he goes to the tenth floor and walks up two flights of stairs to his apartment.\n Answer: The man is a dwarf. He can't reach the upper elevator buttons, but he can ask people to push them for him. He can also push them with his umbrella.\n \n 8. A man is lying dead in a room. There is a large pile of gold and jewels on the floor, a chandelier attached to the ceiling, and a large open window.\n Answer: The room is the ballroom of an ocean liner which sank some time ago. The man ran out of air while diving in the wreck.\n \n 9. A man and his wife raced through the streets. They stopped, and the husband got out of the car. When he came back, his wife was dead, and there was a stranger in the car.\n Answer: The wife was about to have a baby. They drove to the hospital. The husband left to get a wheelchair, but the baby was born in the meantime, and the wife didn't survive the birth.\n \n 11. A body is discovered in a park in Chicago in the middle of summer. It has a fractured skull and many other broken bones, but the cause of death was hypothermia.\n Answer: A poor peasant from somewhere in Europe desperately wants to come to the United States. Lacking money for airfare, he stows away in the landing gear compartment of a jet. He dies of hypothermia in mid-flight and falls out when the compartment opens as the plane makes its final approach.\n \n 10, 12, 13 are still in play.",

   "Some people might think that he died from hypothermia during the fall, not while he was still in the plane. That is the detail I was looking for. You win your stuffed animal circus prize...\n \n Anyway, the official answer to #11 is:\n A poor peasant from somewhere in Europe desperately wants to come to the United States. Lacking money for airfare, he stows away in the landing gear compartment of a jet. He dies of hypothermia in mid-flight and falls out when the compartment opens as the plane makes its final approach.\n\n \n \n Actually, there have been case(s) where stowaways have died in the wheel wells of planes. No falling out of course.\n \n 10) the man in the scuba suit is a Noah's ark enthusiast. \n He built his ark in the woods, away from prying eyes. Being the ever prepared survivalist that he is, he possessed a scub suit and continued to wear it while collecting pairs of creatures for reseeding the earth after the next calamity.\n Having just climbed to the top of a tall tree in his scuba gear (you have to be prepared to swim to the ark should the flood come a few minuted early) to fetch a pair of spotted owls, a voracious woodpecker attacked him causing him to loose balance and plummet to his death.\n \n 13) The music always stops prior to a firing squad shooting. It's quite clear that she was a dastardly criminal...all women are.\n \n 12) See above. In this case, a highly stressed man who's worked for years without thanks (see also Al Bundy) is on his way to work selling shoes. Prior to becoming a hen pecked sop, he had early success as a musician. Whilst listening to the radio on his way to work one morning, the DJ's were playing old songs and pondering 'What ever happened to so and so.' This caused the man to finally snap.\n The rest is simple...it took a man hunt or 3 different law enforcement agencies and a hail of gun fire involving 317 shots being fired to bring the man down the following day.\n He died with a smile on his face...\n \n \n Oh, and Dragons do exist. Although, most don't have wings of their own and are carried by invisible Pixies when they need to fly.",

   "Actually, there have been case(s) where stowaways have died in the wheel wells of planes. No falling out of course.\n\n Indeed, I googled it and there have been several deaths of such stowaways:\n \nIn recent years, there have been several incidents of people climbing into the airplane wheel wells. Often the cases end in death -- extreme cold and lack of oxygen in the wheel wells make the odds of survival slim. Stowaways have also fallen from the wheel wells or been crushed by the landing gear. Only a few stowaways survived such trips, The Times reported. \n\n That was from http://cbs2.com/topstories/local_story_028231613.html\n \n As for your guesses for 10, 12 and 13 - nice stories but, as you well guessed, wrong answer.

When I had played this game with friends years back, one could tell the difficulty of the puzzle and the skill of the guesser by how many questions were needed before the correct answer was guessed.\n \n As for imaginative answers, that can be a fun direction to go through, and might be worth a thread in itself, but I would be worried that it would completely side-track this thread.

It's more fun to think up more outlandish answers.

Five strokes is trivial, four strokes is the classic solution, but there are solutions in three strokes and one stroke.\n \n Similarly, start with a chess board and two kings, one on an edge square, and the other two squares away in opposition. For example, Kc6 kc8, where K is the white king and k the black king. It is White's move.\n \n Mate in one half move.\n \n Mate in one third of a move.\n \n Mate in one quarter of a move.\n \n Mate in one fifth of a move.\n \n What other fractions are possible?",
