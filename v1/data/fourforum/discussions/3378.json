A customer at a nearby dry cleaning store noticed shattered glass on the sidewalk in front of the headquarters and informed an employee in the cleaner's, who then called police.\n\n \n And not to detract from Knoxville PD, but...\n \n\n In an unexpected twist, a bank directly across the street from the headquarters was robbed as KPD officers were busy investigating at the scene of the shooting.\n",
