But I don't see where steroids would help pitchers.\n Of course, I'm thinking American League mentality, not National League mentality.\n\n \n There was an article about that in last month's ESPN magazine actually. Basically it gives the pitcher a bigger advantage than a hitter. They are able to bounce back quicker, and recover. Basically your arm isn't meant for throwing 90 miles an hour for up to 90-100 pitches. So most pitchers take several days recovering (usually they have 4 or 5 man rotations), and if they don't take care of their arm they could ruin it for the season. Steroids helps their muscle recover from the strain on it that day and especially for closers who may have to throw 3-4 days in a row depending on the score of the games, it could help them so much. It can help them throw more pitches, bounce back quicker, and not feel like :xcensored the morning after. The article described it as \"pitcher's hangover\".",

There are still some out there who play it because it's fun. It's a very challenging sport, mentally as well as physically. In my opinion working at it is one of the most rewarding parts of the game. Now I understand these people still work at it, but there's a difference between stretching physical limitations in a healthy way rather than a way that can ruin your body. If steroids didn't do that, they would be legal. But people are willing to throw their future away for the present: money and fame.",
