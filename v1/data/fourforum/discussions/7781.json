   "Is the economy robust or doomed? I hear the bashers warming up to dispute the opinion of the new Federal Reserve guru.\n \n http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060321-094701-9035r\n \n U.S. economy strong - Ben Bernanke\n NEW YORK, March 21 (UPI) -- The new chairman of the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy is robust, despite fears the interest rate yield curve presages a recession.\n \n Ben Bernanke, in a New York speech late Monday, dismissed the idea that the low level of long-term interest rates meant investors were pricing in the likelihood of a sharp and imminent slowdown in the economy, the Financial Times reported.\n \n \"Although macroeconomic forecasting is fraught with hazards, I would not interpret the currently very flat yield curve as indicating a significant slowdown to come,\" Bernanke said. \n \n He also said that, unlike past episodes where a flat yield curve preceded a recession, both short and long-term interest rates remained low. Also, other financial indicators, including narrow corporate bond spreads, suggested that market participants did not harbor \"significant reservations\" about the economic outlook.\n \n Such optimism about the economy, however, does not mean the Fed necessarily will keep raising interest rates, he said. \n \n \"The bottom line for (Fed) policy appears ambiguous,\" Bernanke said.",

   "US inflation without food and energy simply isn't a problem. The fed reports inflation without food and energy.

What the general public fails to recognize is that the fed hasn't been raising interest rates to control inflation but to peddle bonds to cover the shortfall between tax revenue and out of control government spending. \n \n We (US) impose a tax on the rest of the oil consuming world due to the Petrodollar being the sole currency for purchasing oil.

   "OK, I've been following the petrodollar/Iran oil bourse situation pretty closely now, and I've been researching as many articles as I can find as I plan to write about the issue in my uni paper.\n \n I have found one (only one, mind) article which dismisses the oil bourse as a major issue, and while some of it seems to make sense I am not entirely convinced, and would greatly appreciate some feedback in order to more fully understand the issue before I commit myself to my own article.\n \n Here's the link:\n No, the Iran Oil Bourse is not a casus belli...\n \n \nThe argument by those who believe that the Teheran Oil Bourse would be the casus belli, the trigger pushing Washington down the road to potential thermonuclear annihilation of Iran, seems to rest on the claim that by openly trading oil to other nations or buyers in Euros, Teheran would set into motion a chain of events in which nation after nation, buyer after buyer, would line up to buy oil no longer in US dollars but in Euros. That in turn, so goes the argument, would lead to a panic selling of dollars on world foreign exchange markets and a collapse of the role of the dollar as reserve currency, one of the 'pillars of Empire.' Basta! There goes the American Century down the tubes with the onset of the Teheran Oil Bourse...Reality is a little different.\n \n Some background considerations\n \n That argument fails to convince for a number of reasons. First, in the case of at least one of the Oil Bourse theory writers, their argument is based on a misunderstanding of the process which I described in my book, A Century of War, regarding the creation in 1974 of 'petrodollar recycling' in the wake of the orchestrated 400% OPEC oil price hike, a process with which then-US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was deeply involved.\n \n The dollar then did not become a 'petrodollar' although Kissinger spoke about the process of 'recycling petrodollars.' Instead what he referred to was the initiation of a new phase of US global hegemony in which the 'petrodollar' export earnings of OPEC oil lands would be recycled into the hands of the major New York and London banks and re-lent in form of dollar loans to oil deficit countries like Brazil or Argentina, creating what soon came to be known as he Latin American Debt Crisis.\n\n \n \n Some of the points raised just don't seem to add up.\n \n \nThe dollar at that time had been a fiat currency since August 1971 when President Richard Nixon first abrogated the Bretton Woods Treaty and refused to redeem US dollars held by foreign central banks for gold bullion. The dollar floated against other major currencies, falling more or less until it was revived by the turbo change of the 1973-4 oil price shock.\n \n What the 1973 oil shock achieved for the sagging dollar was a sudden injection of global demand from nations confronted with 400% higher oil import bills. At that time, by postwar convention and convenience, as the dollar was the only reserve currency held around the world other than gold, oil was priced by all OPEC members in dollars as a practical exigency.\n \n With the 400% price rise, nations such as France, Germany, Japan and other importers suddenly found reason to try to buy their oil directly in their own currencies-French Franc, German Deutschemarks or Japanese Yen-in order to lessen the pressure on their rapidly declining reserves of trade dollars. The US Treasury and Pentagon made certain that did not happen, partly with some Kissinger secret diplomacy, bullying threats, and a whopping big US military agreement with the key OPEC producer, Saudi Arabia. At that time it helped that the late Shah of Iran was seen in Washington to be a vassal of Kissinger.\n\n \n OK, so other countries, in order to maintain their stockpile of dollars, started buying oil in their own currencies because of the 400% price hike imposed by OPEC.\n \n 1) I don't understand how, if the deal had already been made to only sell oil for dollars, countries could decide to buy oil with their own currencies\n \n 2) The author mentions that the dollar was taken off the gold standard, but does not mention the Saudi 'petrodollar' deal, admits that it was a fiat currency, and yet maintains that the dollar was \"by convention and convenience\" still the global reserve currency. Surely this makes no sense, economically and simply logically?\n \n 3) The author plainly states that the US did not allow countries to buy oil with their own currencies. Surely this supports, rather than refutes, the determination of the US to maintain the status of the dollar, and supports, rather than refutes, the idea of the Iran oil bourse as a 'casus belli'?\n \n \nThe point was not that the dollar became a 'petro' currency. The point was that the reserve status of the dollar, now a paper currency, was bolstered by the 400% increase in world demand for dollars to buy oil.\n\n \n Even if it was more to do with the US pressuring oil consumers rather than producers to only buy oil with dollars, does this not amount to the same thing? Does this not result in the US in fact reinforcing the dollar's status as a 'petro' currency, rather than proving that it wasn't?\n \n \n But that was only a part of the dollar story. In 1979, following the accession to power of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran, oil prices shot through the roof for the second time in six years. Yet, paradoxically, later that year the dollar began a precipitous free-fall, not rise. It was no 'petrodollar.'\n\n \n Surely this \"free-fall\" was caused by a case of economic heebie-jeebies; oil consumers didn't want to be the last to jump off the petrodollar bandwagon; when prices went up again they predicted the dollar wouldn't last, and started trying to dump dollars before everyone else did? \n \n \nForeign dollar holders began dumping their dollars as a protest to the foreign policies of the Jimmy Carter Administration.\n\n \n This just doesn't sound like a realistic scenario. Central banks making an economically dangerous political protest? I don't buy it.\n \n \n It was to deal with that dollar crisis that Carter was forced to bring in Paul Volcker to head the Federal Reserve in 1979. In October 1979 Volcker gave the dollar another turbo-charge by allowing interest rates in the US to rise some 300% in weeks, to well over 20%. That in turn forced global interest rates through the roof, triggered a global recession, mass unemployment and misery. It also 'saved' the dollar as sole reserve currency. The dollar was not a 'petrodollar.' It was the currency of issue of the greatest Superpower, a superpower determined to do what it needed to keep it that way.\n\n \n But this does not IMHO, amount to a refutation of the argument that the Iran oil bourse is a threat to the status of the dollar. Surely the dollars-backed-by-oil situation is the main economic reason that the dollar is the reserve currency, no matter how many times the author says \"The dollar was not a 'petrodollar' \". \n \n \nFor that reason, the status of the dollar as reserve currency depends on the status of the United States as the world's unchallenged military superpower. In a sense, since August 1971 the dollar is no longer backed by gold. Instead, it is backed by F-16's and MI Abrams battle tanks, operating in some 130 US bases around the world, defending liberty and the dollar.\n\n \n OK, this does make sense, but it still doesn't refute the threat to the dollar of an oil market priced in Euros. \n \n \nIn order for the Euro to begin to challenge the reserve role of the US dollar a virtual revolution in policy would have to take place in Euroland. First the European Central Bank, the institutionalized, undemocratic institution created by the Maastricht Treaty in order to maintain the power of creditor banks in collecting their debts, would have to surrender power to elected legislators. It would then have to turn on the Euro printing presses and print Euros like there was no tomorrow. That is because the current size of the publicly-traded Euroland government bond market is still tiny in comparison with the huge US Treasury market.\n\n \n OK, he calls this a 'revoultion', implying that it is unlikely, and also implying that this would have to be a pre-emptive move on the part of the EU. But surely, if OPEC countries opened a Euro oil market, it would only be a natural, and beneficial, and uncontroversial decision to \"turn on the Euro printing presses...like there was no tomorrow\"?\n \n I can only see this as one factor behind the UK's fence-sitting as regards the Euro. We are inextricably tied to the US economy, but the Euro looks like it might be a major player in the future (even if it is only a stop-gap between the dollar and the Yuan), and the Exchequer is waiting for the right time in order to continue to gain maximum benefit from the pound, until we can jump on the petroeuro bandwagon and gain maximum benefit from that.\n \n It would not be a 'revolution', it would be sound economic policy. Either I'm missing something in my knowledge of economics, until very recently very limited, or this article is just self-contradictory.\n \n \nA full challenge to the domination of the dollar as world central bank reserve currency entails a de facto declaration of war on the 'full spectrum dominance' of the United States today. The mighty members of the European Central Bank Council well know this. The heads of state of every EU country know that. The Chinese leadership as well as Japanese and Indian know that. So does Vladimir Putin.\n\n \n But surely the \"de facto declaration of war\" will not come from the oil consumers, it will come from the producers deciding to open a Euro oil market? Therefore the Iran oil bourse is indeed a \"casus belli\". \n \n \nUntil some combination of those Eurasian powers congeal in a cohesive challenge to the unbridled domination of the USA as sole superpower, there will be no Euro or Yen or even Chinese Yuan challenging the role of the dollar. The issue is of enormous importance, as it is vital to understand the true dynamics bringing the world to the brink of possible nuclear catastrophe today.\n\n \n But this isn't the way the world works, at least not as I see it. It's not about a currency actively \"challenging\" the dollar, no one would do that, it would be a blatant invitation to US aggression. It's about the dollar's overvaluation, inherent weakness, and possible replacement due to quite understandable economic pragmatism.\n \n I would love to hear some other views on this article, as I am somewhat out of my depth here; fascinated as I am by the petrodollar issue, which involves many factors of which I was previously ignorant, this article also goes into details that I find hard to follow. \n However I cannot see how any of the arguments put forth here refute the argument that the Iran oil bourse is a potential threat to the US$, enough of a threat that the US would go to war over it. Again I ask, am I missing something?",

Nixon probably iddn't have the foresight to plan that far in advanced. The dollar had been dropping ever since 1971. Most oil trades were already being carried out in dollars because previously the dollar had been the only currency reliably backed by gold. The dollar was the currency of ALL international trade because of this backing. \n \n Oil producers were sitting on a LOT of dollars. They were essentially doing with the dollar then what the chinese are doing now....trying to stabilize the dollar while quietly dumping their dollar assets. \n \n In 1973, nearly 80% of oil trades were still being performed in dollars. The price spiked increased demand for the dollar, raising its value. America essentially went \"Gee, this is nice...how could we make this last longer\"\n \n \n \nEven if it was more to do with the US pressuring oil consumers rather than producers to only buy oil with dollars, does this not amount to the same thing?

We flooded the market with dollars. At the time, we thought this was a pretty smart thing to do. After all, they were inflation free. As usual, we showed no restraint and ended up screwing ourselves.\n \n \nThis just doesn't sound like a realistic scenario. Central banks making an economically dangerous political protest? I don't buy it.\n\n \n That is becuase it didn't happen, and frankly the claim is idiotic. \n \n \nBut this does not IMHO, amount to a refutation of the argument that the Iran oil bourse is a threat to the status of the dollar.

Military actions are not generally big moneymakers. They tend to instead be a money pit. \n \n At one time there were 2 superpowers, and which would win the east vs west stuggle was a toss up. You did not see people holidng rubles as a reserve currency. Even the Russians held dollars in reserve becuase they needed them to buy their foreign oil.\n \n \n \nOK, he calls this a 'revoultion', implying that it is unlikely, and also implying that this would have to be a pre-emptive move on the part of the EU.

Therefore the Iran oil bourse is indeed a \"casus belli\". \n\n \n Yes. Those powers are counitng on the fact that America has become to weak and too broke to do anythign about it, and they are right. Already Russia is accepting Euro payments for oil.
