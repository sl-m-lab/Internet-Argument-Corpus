   "PORTLAND - Hundreds of same-sex couples lined up at courthouses across Oregon Monday, to register as domestic partners.\n \n In its last session, the Oregon Legislature had legalized the civil unions - a legal recognition and obligation which carries many of the rights and responsibilities of marriage. \n \n Gays and lesbians wasted no time taking advantage of the new law, some lining up at 4 a.m. outside the Multnomah County building. Although the legislature had made it legal, implementation was held up by a ballot petition which would have blocked the new law. After a court ruled [on Friday, Feb 1] that the ballot measure didn't have enough signatures, the doors were opened for the new Oregon civil unions.\n \n Ten other states, plus the District of Columbia, have similar laws.",
