It specifically was 'King NEb, not \"King Neb' and Alex. \n\n Not making it a prophecy, but it could easily be one.\n \n \nWe often find phrases that are metaphors that get twisted into 'prophecies' of end times. The writings of Ezk. are for his time, not others. \n \n\n You are just making a statement but not backing it up. I backed up what I said . You just blandly disputed it. I have plenty of scholars who read it as I do. \n \n \nWhat Matthew says about Jerusalem (after the fact of course), has nothing to do with what Ezk is writing about. That is trying to retrofit things into place.\n\n It was an ASIDE comment, you do know what an aside is?\n \n \nCan you please explain how it can be juxtaposed, or should be juxtaposed, or is correct to juxtapose, in these two passages to be speaking of the same person, ie, the ruler of Tyre, where in verses 1-10 we have a typical and literal description of a worldly ruler, whereas in the very next verses, it jumps over to an 'allegorical', 'metamorphic', description of that same person? Keep in mind that original scripture did not the verses, not chapters, thus this passage is as one. No, the passage is talking about a worldly king and the spiritual power behind that king.\n\n \n \n \nNope.. it certainly is not. It has nothing to do with a 'spiritual power' behind the kind at all. You have to infer it, rather than read what is written. \n \n\n \n Again, answer the question how can the two be juxtaposed?\n \n \nYes, it is a metaphor, It is describing the King Of Tyre, and how is he setting himself up as a God. It's all part of the same narrative. The point of the narrative is the King of Tyre is setting himself up as a God, but is yet a man.\n If you look at 28:9\n 9. Will you say, \"I am a god\" before your slayer? Indeed, you are a man and not a god in the hand of your slayer.\n\n I don't think you are getting it. Verses 1 through 10 refer to the RULER/PRINCE of Tyre. A MAN. Just as your are noting. after the fact I pointed it out above. HOWEVER, verses 11-19 are referring to the KING of TYRE, NOT THE SAME PERSON, the Greek's not the same. Did Tyre have TWO kings? If so, who were they?\n \n \n Let's look at the Rashi commentary for Ezk: 28:13. \n 13. In Eden, the garden of God you were; every precious stone was [set in] your covering; ruby, topaz, diamond, chrysolite, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, carbuncle, and crystal and gold; the work of your drums and your orifices is in you; on the day of your creation they were established. &#1497;&#1490;.\n In Eden, the garden of God: With much goodness and pleasure. You enjoy yourself as if you were dwelling in Eden, the garden of God. All wealth, pride, and honor are given to you: all precious stones are set on your raiment. :\n your covering: Your canopy. Another explanation: Your raiment. :\n the work of your drums and your orifices: Although I gave you all this honor, I knew that you would become haughty, and I made in you the work of the perforated drums that let out wind with an instrumental sound like a drum, and these are what you should have contemplated about.\n [/i]\n \n In other words, according to Rashi, a medieval Jewish commentator , he is setting himself up as a god, and, if you notice, no hint of a 'spiritual' king behind the king.\n \n\n \n Rashi is mistaken. Is he the only one you could find to support your premise? Jews don't believe there is a Satan, nor a Devil, thus naturally he would see it completely different. Jews also do not believe in the New Testament nor Jesus Christ, thus they pay no attention to what is stated in the NT regards Satan.",

They assume it, and then come up with a predetermined conclusion based on the assumption. \n \n Yes, I guess you can find conservative Christians with that interpretation. However, can you support your assertion with the context of Ezekiel 28 itself.\n Yes, it does use the Garden of Eden imagery, but it doesn't even mention the serpent in Eden. It is reading INTO the text, rather than looking at what the text says.\n \n The text of Ezekiel does not use the term \"Satan\", it does no use the term \"Devil\" , it does not use the term \"light bearer\", or any of the other names associated with Satan. There is no reference to 'the serpent' in eden, even though used imagery from the Garden of Eden.\n \n Your last link was a rant against Mormonism, and did not address the issue.\n \n Did you actually read any of these links?? Where did any of them use the actual text of Ezekiel to defend the concept that the 'true ruler' of Tyre was Satan? They all made the assumption and did some preaching from there. \n \n So, what I would like to see is \n 1) Justification from the text, rather than the assumption.\n 2) A point in the New Testament where Lucifer and Satan are actually mentioned as being the same. \n \n Remember, I never said that Christians didn't believe that Lucifer was Satan. My specific claim is that it is not biblical. \n \n Find me the scriptural reference that equates the name \"Lucifer\" with 'Satan' or the \"DEVIL\"\n\n \n 1: I have already told you previously that Lucifer does not occur in the New Testament.\n 2: I have asked you three times to answer a question that will emphasize what I am saying but you ignore it. You asked me to repeat it in my last post and you thoroughly ignored it again. \n \n One more time, LAST TIME:\n 2Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:\n \n 3Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:\n \n 4With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:\n \n 5By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:\n \n 6Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; \n \n That is the PRINCE/RULER of Tyre.

Yes, it is, because the concept of Satan in Judaism is much different the Christainity.
