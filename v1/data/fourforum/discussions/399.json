   "OK, your analysis on the current deficit is flawed on a couple of accounts. You say the war on terror requires money. Yes, you're right. But it doesn't require $3 trillion dollars in tax cuts, and that is what is creating most of the deficit, not wartime spending. In fact, the CBO projected 10 year deficit (which is a multi-trillion dollar figure) doesn't even take into account the cost of the war with Iraq. So it's clear that the entity that is causing the deficit is tax cuts, not war spending. In fact, Bush has been prioritizing tax cuts over defense spending. Let's examine how:\n Immediately after 9/11, congress approved 20 billion dollars to shore up our immediate security concerns. After that, House Appropriations committee chair Bill Young and ranking minority member David Obey examined where we were still vulnerable, and bipartisanly (remember, its one republican and one democrat) said that we needed $10 billion more to provide for \"computer upgrades for the FBI, improved security for ports and nuclear facilities, new customs agents, and other top homeland security priorities\" (New Republic 3/3/03). When they proposed this to Bush, he said that Mitch Daniels, his budget director said that the original $20 bil. was adequete, and he would VETO THE BILL if it contained more than 20 bil. in spending. Appealing to party discpline, the extra 10 bil. wasn't allowed to come to a vote by house republican leaders. The question that jumps immediately to mind is why his budget director was telling him what is and is not adequete for homeland security. but let's continue.\n The impact of Bush refusing to allow for the extra money and security is:\n \"President Bush vetoed several specific (and relatively cost-effective) measures proposed by Congress that would have addressed critical national vulnerabilities. As a result, the country remains more vulnerable than it should be today,\" February Report, Brookings Institution.\n A December 2002 report by the Council on Foreign Relations concurs: \"America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil.\" \n Moving further:\n Spencer Abraham, Bush's secratary of energy, was alarmed that his department didn't have enough funds to protect against a terrorist STEALING AND SETTING OFF A NUKE. He writes \"[T]he Department now is unable to meet the next round of critical security mission requirements. ... Failure to support these urgent security requirements is a risk that would be unwise,\" and requests 379.7 million dollars to defend against this. the administration gives him 26.4 million, 7% of the requested amount.\n The list of needed security issues that Bush refuses to fund are endless. The New Republic 3/3/03 outlines: \"The list of improvements Bush declined to fund included more secure barriers and fences, computer improvements to defend against hackers, equipment to detect explosives in packages and vehicles entering department sites, and a reduction in the overall number of sites that store bomb-grade plutonium and uranium.\"\n Nor is Bush's reluctance to spend money to defend America limited to domestic concerns. the NR on 9/16/02 writes that when the US sought to airlift out enriched uranium from Serbia (where it posed a definite security risk) it had to be funded BY PRIVATE DONATIONS! Does Bush allocate more funds to the program that handles this? Nope. Last year he tried to cut its funding by 5%.\n Bush promises more funding to local police and fire depts., specifically to the tune of $3.5 billion in new money. The amount he gets around to giving? 700 million dollars, 20% of the promised amount.\n port security is another matter. Of the containers that make their way through our ports, though, only one in 50 is ever searched. As Stephen Flynn, a former Coast Guard commander who directed the Council on Foreign Relations' homeland security report, told a TV interviewer last month, \"We have virtually no security there.\" The Coast Guard has estimated it would cost $1 billion immediately and another $4.5 billion over the next nine years to make domestic ports sufficiently secure. But, since September 11, they've received just $318 million.\n The INS requested a relatively paltry 52 mil. to hire new agents: turned down.\n (Thanks to the New Republic 3/3/03 for providing virtually all of the sources. The article \"the 9/10 president\" should be an essential read)\n So if Bush refuses to spend the money on homeland security, where is it going? Answer: Tax cuts. Bush cares more about his 3 trillion+ dollars in total tax cuts than he does about homeland security. This is the lie that needs to be refuted.\n \n Phew, that took awhile. And your statement that republicans never stopped clinton's appointees is blantantly false and you know it. Orrin Hatch took the judge confirmation fight to a whole new level. Clinton could barely push any of his judges through.",

The only problem that ever happened in a recount room was when the Republican thugs broke in.",
