   "I don't like Orhan Pamuk.He doesen't know anything about Turkey as a westrener.He thinks that Europe is golden land for Turks and Turks don't fit into it.He is too polemical than as a author.Like Salman Rushdie, he looks for fame and prestije.American circles like him, because he went American Robert Academy in Istanbul.This academy produced political nightmares like Bulent Ecevit and Tansu Ciller. \n \n \n Novels of Orhan Pamuk merely frauds, masonic plots in oriental sense.Turkish storeotypes are ugly and unfair and backward.There is a racsist tinge in them.He depicts Islam as backward religion. \n \n He is too narcist .He considers himself as the best writer of Turkey.Too many readers find his novels obscure and inconsistent.His Turkish is awfull.I think he has writer and correction team for his books.All his books are available in english now. \n \n \n His last declarations on Armeninas are baseless and biased.This week Turkish press and media divided on his trial.Orhan Pamuk trusts to the westren lobby behind him. \n \n \n Orhan Pamuk is not first writer insulting Turkish identity.Aziz Nesin, after his books translated into english,he said '60% percent of Turks are dumb.' \n \n That is main theme of prolific writers in Turkey: insult Turkish identity, gain fame, money and prestije world wide.",
