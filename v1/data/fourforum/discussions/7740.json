   "Both Martin and Chretien want Kofi Annan's job when it comes up for grabs later this year.\n \n Chretien signed Canada onto the UN Kyoto Agreement. Martin kept us there. Kofi Annan of the UN loved it. He was allowed to address parliament when he came to Canada.\n \n The Americans and Australians refused to go along with this idea. India and China are excused.\n \n But Kyoto is a disguised form of global taxation to help so called developing countries -- every dictator in Annan's Africa. Canadian taxation will go directly into their Swiss bank accounts.\n \n And now Stephen Harper seems to be stalling on the issue. He better have a good look at another Conservative Prime Minister's record -- Joe Clark -- 200 days -- if he think he can be just another Liberal and con us into global taxation.\n \n emoticon_xkill",
