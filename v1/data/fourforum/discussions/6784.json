I'll have to admit this is the first time I ever recall a US president being labeled a fascist.\n\n \n I don't understand. It is almost like they do not want their children to work for pennies a day in US owned factories. \n \n I think that this is simply another excellent indicator of how out of touch baby Bush is with the world. Any of those leaders who are foolish enough to sign such an agreement can be expected to be torn apart in the streets. \n \n I think the problem is one too many clever presidents (or presidents with clever advisors). All too often clever people make the mistake of believing that other people are stupid. People who are not clever are not inherintly stupid, it just takes them longer to figure things out. South Americans have seen American aid in Chile (in the form of Pinochet), El Salvador (death squads), Argentina (where we pushed like hell for economic reforms, then when their newly reformed economy collapsed, we walked away whistling and staring at the ceiling), Columbia (widespread use of defoliants), Panama (invaded for National Fruit), and a dozen other little S American countries.\n \n Bad news....THEY HAVE FIGURED IT OUT.",
