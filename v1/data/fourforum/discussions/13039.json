   "Supplying education to your comrades is a generous gesture, but probably wasted.\n What is the point of a law which is never enforced? ;)\n\n \n \n Gun Ownership - It's The\n Law In Kennesaw\n By Jonathan Hamilton and David Burch\n Marietta Daily Journal Staff Writers\n http://www.mdjonline.com/StoryDetail.cfm?id=10017128&Section=Home%20Page\n 3-14-1\n \n \n KENNESAW, Ga - Several Kennesaw officials attribute a drop in crime in the city over the past two decades to a law that requires residents to have a gun in the house.\n \n In 1982, the Kennesaw City Council unanimously passed a law requiring heads of households to own at least one firearm with ammunition.\n \n The ordinance states the gun law is needed to \"protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants.\"\n \n Then-councilman J.O. Stephenson said after the ordinance was passed, everyone \"went crazy.\"\n \n \"People all over the country said there would be shootings in the street and violence in homes,\" he said. \"Of course, that wasn't the case.\"\n \n In fact, according to Stephenson, it caused the crime rate in the city to plunge.\n \n Kennesaw Historical Society president Robert Jones said following the law's passage, the crime rate dropped 89 percent in the city, compared to the modest 10 percent drop statewide.\n \n \"It did drop after it was passed,\" he said. \"After it initially dropped, it has stayed at the same low level for the past 16 years.\"\n \n Mayor Leonard Church was not in office when the law was passed, but he said he is a staunch supporter of it.\n \n \"You can't argue with the fact that Kennesaw has the lowest crime rate of any city our size in the country,\" said Church, who owns a denture-making company in Kennesaw.\n \n The author of the ordinance, local attorney Fred Bentley Sr., attributes at least some of the decrease in crime to the bill.\n \n \"I am definitely in favor of what we did,\" he said. \"It may not be totally responsible for the decrease, [but] it is a part.\"\n \n Although he is pleased with the outcome, Bentley said he was originally opposed to drafting the law.\n \n \"I didn't think it could be written in a constitutional fashion,\" he said. \"Obviously, it was constitutional, because the American Civil Liberties Union challenged it in court and we won.\"\n \n Jones said the ACLU challenged the law in a federal court just after it was passed. In response, the city added a clause adding conscientious objectors to the list of those exempt.\n \n Although the law is now being credited with a drop in crime, Jones said that was not the law's original purpose. He also pointed out that Kennesaw did not have a big problem with crime before.\n \n \"The crime rate wasn't that high to start with. It was 11 burglaries per 1,000 residents in 1981,\" he said.\n \n According to the Kennesaw Police Department, the city's most recent crime statistics show 243 property crimes per 100,000 residents in 1998, or .243 per 1,000.\n \n The city's crime rate continues to be far below other metro Atlanta city's with similar populations, like Decatur. In 1998, Decatur recorded 4,049 property crimes per 100,000 residents.\n \n Jones said one motivation for the council passing the ordinance had to do with publicity.\n \n \"It was done in response to a law passed by Morton Grove, Ill., outlawing gun ownership within the city limits,\" he said. \"Several council members were upset Morton Grove had gotten a lot of attention with their ordinance so they decided to top them.\n \n \"They figured the gun ownership ordinance would knock that city right off the front pages. They were right.\"\n \n Jones said the ensuing publicity surrounding the law has given Kennesaw worldwide name recognition.\n \n \"I have been to Australia and Europe and when I tell people I am from Kennesaw they recognize the name as the place that requires everyone to own a gun,\" he said.\n \n But Stephenson said the issue was not publicity-driven but issue-driven.\n \n \"We believed in the right of people to own guns,\" he said.\n \n Jones said he has sold 550 copies of a 1994 book about the first-of-its-kind law, \"The Law Heard 'Round the World.\"\n \n He said the law in its final form has many loopholes, so not everyone is required to own a gun.\n \n \"There are many outs,\" he said. \"When you look at it, almost anyone could fit into one of the exempted groups.\"\n \n Kennesaw Police Chief Dwaine Wilson said no one has ever been prosecuted under the ordinance.\n \n Among those exempt are residents \"who conscientiously oppose maintaining firearms as a result of beliefs or religious doctrine.\" Others exempt include the physically and mentally disabled, paupers and those convicted of a felony.\n \n The law contains no clause addressing punishment for violating the law. If convicted, City Clerk Diane Coker said punishment would be determined by the general penalty clause of the Kennesaw Code Ordinance - probably a fine of about $100.\n \n Jones said the unusual law has not deterred anyone from moving to Kennesaw.\n \n \"Our population has increased just like everyone's in Georgia in the past 20 years,\" he said. \"The law really hasn't done any harm to the city's growth.\"\n \n The city's population in 1998 was recorded at 14,493 - a sharp increase over the 8,936 residents recorded in the 1990 census.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/images/smilies/xkill.gif\n emoticon_xkill",

Gandhi: \"Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle classes render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn.\" Mohandas K. Gandhi, Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth, Chapter XXVII, Recruiting Campaign, Page 403, Dover paperback edition, 1983.\n \n Admiral Yamamoto: \"You cannot invade mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind each blade of grass.\" Advising Japan's military leaders of the futility of an invasion of the mainland United States because of the widespread availability of guns. It has been theorized that this was a major contributing factor in Japan's decision not to land on North America early in the war when they had vastly superior military strength. This delay gave our industrial infrastructure time to gear up for the conflict and was decisive in our later victory.\n \n Adolf Hitler: \"The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing.\" Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 425-426. Translated by Norman Cameron and R. H. Stevens.\n \n John F. Kennedy: \"Today, we need a nation of Minutemen, citizens who are not only prepared to take arms, but citizens who regard the preservation of freedom as the basic purpose of their daily life and who are willing to consciously work and sacrifice for that freedom.\"\n \n The Dalai Lama: \"If someone has a gun and is trying to kill you, it would be reasonable to shoot back with your own gun.\" (May 15, 2001, The Seattle Times)\n \n James Earl Jones: \"The world is filled with violence. Because criminals carry guns, we decent law-abiding citizens should also have guns. Otherwise they will win and the decent people will lose.\"\n \n Sigmund Freud: \"A fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity.\" (\"General Introduction to Psychoanalysis,\" S. Freud)\n \"Has the war against drugs been successful? It has for criminals.

Suppose some people were robbing a bank and customers at the bank pull out their guns to defend themselves against the robbers. You arrive at the bank a moment later and see a bunch of people with their guns drawn. You don't know who the bad guys and good guys are. You pull out your gun. The good guys don't know if you're also a robber or just pulling out your gun in reaction to the sight of other guns withdrawn. The situation escalates and too many people end up dying.

Doc, what is it that you object to so loudly on your godly pedestal?\n\n \n \nDoc, what is it that you object to so loudly on your godly pedestal?\n\n \n Well son, I ain't on no pedestal right now, I got 10 lbs. of chili cooking on the stovetop, a ham baking in the oven and a turkey smoking on the grill outside. I put on my pants both legs at the same time just like you do and don't harbour thoughts like I once might have at 16 but I never had a thought like you just expressed. I have seen it about all and I have never seen spray and pray by anyone more than cops who I posted a link about this week firing over 250 rounds with about 17 hits at a very nominal range. I have trained cops and federal agents in concealed carry since 1995 and have competed in matches with them and military since 1984 so I probably got a better handle on things than you do? You ought to see how the hit to shot ratio is for the military during combat situations (google it) which has been going down since the little skirmish of 1778 on to this current war. The fact is, normal people have an aversion to shooting someone in the first place and only about 17% of the military make good combat soldiers. At one match, we had a group of FBI re-qualifying while we were shooting an outdoor bullseye match. That is one hand unsupported at 50 yards and 25 yards both slow, timed and rapid fire. The FBI was shooting two handed at 15 yards at a full silhoute and were amazed that everyone on the line had miniscule groups at 25 yards while their targets were wildly scattered and quite a few misses of the whole thing.\n \n Shooting when someone else is shooting back is a whole different story. You are shooting to live that is why they call it self-defense and usually at 7 yards or arms length. You don't get the chance to decide when you shoot in self-defense, the criminal chooses time and place. Anyone who survives an encounter is either damn good, lucky or both. I have never heard anyone brag much less talk about taking a perps life nor a soldier from war talk about it much unless they knew you real well or recognized a kindred spirit. It is easy to sit back and make judgements but then again you are not there!!!! Being *nice* will get you killed! If you don't have enough problems getting down on those sights you aren't worrying about the right things. You must have some romantic ideas about this self-defense thing but If you spent even 10 minutes with a good instructor, those ideas would vanish in a hurry.\n \n Citizens who are not cops get as much training in concealed carry class as cops do to qualify to carry a gun. Ditto for a level III licensed security guard. The type and amount of training for either and for concealed carry is set by the State. You might not realize it but we already got \"hoards\" of trained folks carrying guns for the simple reason it is too hard to pack a cop and he isn't going to be there when the SHTF, you are all by your lonesome. There isn't anything romantic about it, you live or you die. I doubt many folks are concerned at that point where the shot may go after it passes through the perp. You shoot until the target dissapears or is no longer a threat and don't forget his buddies ...\n \n You can look up some of the better expert firearm trainers and get their reaction, like Clint Smith who runs Thunder Ranch amoung numerous other firearm experts and trainers. Do you good to go to their class and absorb some of that training before you decide to strap on that gun you think will save you. It ain't the gun, it is what is between those ears and you will always revert to your training.\n \n If you think there is something mystical about it, there isn't. Nor romantic about it either. It is a choice only you can make and your active imagination won't cut it in a life and death situation. There isn't nothing glorious about it in personal life nor in war. It is simply a struggle between surviving or dying.\n \n You have never seen \"hoards of concealed carry folks\" shooting everyone around them. What you have read about is perps involved in mass shootings because there isn't anyone around with a gun to stop them, that is where the rubber meets the road. You got an itch you can't scratch and bitching about a non-event isn't helpful to yourself nor anyone else. A self-defense situation happens over 2.5 million times a year, many resoved with nary a shot fired and you don't read about that or get to see it on the boob tube because it just ain't sensational.\n \n Your sack ought to be dropping pretty soon and you just might be able to get some of that training others have before you run into that situation you worry about that you think can be solved by pepper spray. Keeping good company with older folks just might save your life? I object mainly to your fantasy world that is so real to you. You have a lot of living to do if you get all that education you can as soon as you can. Just don't go to trying out your fantasy world in real life and death situations and because you post on the board don't assume that there ain't a heck of a lot of folks that done rode that trail and made it out alive. You are a little young to be straddling that fence because all you will get is a sore crotch. Now I usually don't waste my time with folks who should know better but since you are just 16 I thought I would give you something to think about. You are a bit young to be lecturing to your elders, military, cops and concealed carry folks. My advice to you is to listen and learn, you will find out who has been down the river and who hasn't and the bunch you are throwing in with haven't or they wouldn't be here now with the way they think and wild speculations.",

The youngest daughter is about 40, about my daughter's age and is quite a looker.

   "Well son, I ain't on no pedestal right now, I got 10 lbs. of chili cooking on the stovetop, a ham baking in the oven and a turkey smoking on the grill outside.\n\n \n Ugh, don't mention food. I just got up at 3:00am to catch a flight.\n \n \n \nI put on my pants both legs at the same time just like you do and don't harbour thoughts like I once might have at 16 but I never had a thought like you just expressed. I have seen it about all and I have never seen spray and pray by anyone more than cops who I posted a link about this week firing over 250 rounds with about 17 hits at a very nominal range. I have trained cops and federal agents in concealed carry since 1995 and have competed in matches with them and military since 1984 so I probably got a better handle on things than you do?\n\n \n That you do, but you have not made clear what you object to yet.\n \n \nYou ought to see how the hit to shot ratio is for the military during combat situations (google it) which has been going down since the little skirmish of 1778 on to this current war.\n\n \n Military combat situations? I'm no military expert, but doesn't a \"military situation\" involve groups of people hunkering down behind barricades, sandbags, and bunkers while wearing kevlar helmets? No way you're going to hit someone on the first shot.\n \n \nThe fact is, normal people have an aversion to shooting someone in the first place and only about 17% of the military make good combat soldiers. At one match, we had a group of FBI re-qualifying while we were shooting an outdoor bullseye match. That is one hand unsupported at 50 yards and 25 yards both slow, timed and rapid fire. The FBI was shooting two handed at 15 yards at a full silhoute and were amazed that everyone on the line had miniscule groups at 25 yards while their targets were wildly scattered and quite a few misses of the whole thing.\n\n \n I have absolutely no experience with pistols, but after some decent practice I reached the classification of \"Sharpshooter\" with the NRA in about a week, which is fairly decent. But, I was in the prone position with a .22LR. Although I imagine that other positions and weapons just means more practice.\n \n \nShooting when someone else is shooting back is a whole different story. You are shooting to live that is why they call it self-defense and usually at 7 yards or arms length. You don't get the chance to decide when you shoot in self-defense, the criminal chooses time and place. Anyone who survives an encounter is either damn good, lucky or both. I have never heard anyone brag much less talk about taking a perps life nor a soldier from war talk about it much unless they knew you real well or recognized a kindred spirit. It is easy to sit back and make judgements but then again you are not there!!!! Being *nice* will get you killed! If you don't have enough problems getting down on those sights you aren't worrying about the right things. You must have some romantic ideas about this self-defense thing but If you spent even 10 minutes with a good instructor, those ideas would vanish in a hurry.\n\n \n I've trained for two years under a Kung Fu Grandmaster who also trained our city's police force. He has these classes he calls \"combat classes\" which teach combat in real life situations (what to do if someone tries to stab you, what to do if you get stabbed etc.). So to answer your question, I've spent two and a half years with a \"good instructor.\"\n \n \n \nYou can look up some of the better expert firearm trainers and get their reaction, like Clint Smith who runs Thunder Ranch amoung numerous other firearm experts and trainers. Do you good to go to their class and absorb some of that training before you decide to strap on that gun you think will save you. It ain't the gun, it is what is between those ears and you will always revert to your training.\n\n \n I would like to. Although like I said, I've already spent about a week with a firearms trainer, so I'm not a total noob. The again I imagine the response to this being something like \"you think you're so good because you spent a week with some crappy instructor?! Why, back in...\" Just to let you know I don't think I'm good at all.\n \n \n \nYou have never seen \"hoards of concealed carry folks\" shooting everyone around them. What you have read about is perps involved in mass shootings because there isn't anyone around with a gun to stop them, that is where the rubber meets the road. You got an itch you can't scratch and bitching about a non-event isn't helpful to yourself nor anyone else. A self-defense situation happens over 2.5 million times a year, many resoved with nary a shot fired and you don't read about that or get to see it on the boob tube because it just ain't sensational.\n\n \n Look, I get your point and I agree with you. But what is it that you object to?\n \n \nYour sack ought to be dropping pretty soon and you just might be able to get some of that training others have before you run into that situation you worry about that you think can be solved by pepper spray.\n\n \n Like I said, I have been getting \"that training\" for the past two years. I know you're a FBI trainer bad@$$ or whatever but I'm not some untrained kid who wants to prove himself by taking another down, so stop the assumptions.\n \n \n Now I usually don't waste my time with folks who should know better but since you are just 16 I thought I would give you something to think about. You are a bit young to be lecturing to your elders, military, cops and concealed carry folks. My advice to you is to listen and learn, you will find out who has been down the river and who hasn't and the bunch you are throwing in with haven't or they wouldn't be here now with the way they think and wild speculations.\n\n \n I'm not lecturing anyone, I'm stating my opinion as my good country allows. I have both experience with firearms and in self defense training. Your average old white politician who is making these laws probably doesn't even have that. Age has nothing to do with it, experience does. I won't pretend to be a cop or a soldier, and I won't pretend to have experience in real life situations, but I have said nothing unreasonable. Hell, I even agree with you. I fully respect and agree with all of your views. But, you're starting to sound a bit like a stereotypical grandpa due to your dedicating an entire post to lecturing me about the \"real world\" and that I should get some \"real training\". While I might not have experience, I have some of the best \"real training\" money can buy.

   "I didn't make up that story nor do I think it is reasonable.\n \n I didn't say you made up the story, I questioned how you responded.\n \n You can believe me as much as I can believe you. For all I know you're an articulate 12 year old. The fact of the matter is, why would I lie? I'm trying to have an intelligent debate here and challenging each other's backgrounds is going to get us nowhere. I would honestly like to prove it to you but giving out details over the internet is an unsafe practice, especially for a minor.\n \n No need to expose any personal info here or otherwise, it doesn't make a hill of beans worth of difference. You might look and see how others are reacting to your comments though?\n \n It was a camp. They had a rifle range. 50 yards (or 50 feet, I can't remember) prone with a qualified instructor.\n \n Yeah, I figure it was the NSSF, they used to and probably still do, issue medals to first time shooters to encourage them to shoot more. I coached the 4-H and FFA teams for over 25 years and that was standard proceedure. That is not competition where you get a class designation from the NRA however. It is informal and no time limit and the application of the instructor to certify the score.\n \n Here is where we are, these are some of you past posts and how you have responded. One thing that sticks in my mind is that you make the contention that your instructor is a \"white, ex-cop\". What exactly is this supposed to convey?\n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n This is the story you responded to below the quote from Ethmi, your reaction with all of your \"experience\"!\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Ethmi \n I trust the average citizen with a firearm. If you're a law-abiding, sane, drug-free citizen, you have done nothing to prove that you can't be trusted with means of self-defense, and therefore you should be allowed to have a firearm.\n \n However, if it's required that everyone is armed, there's several problems. First off, isn't that shopping spree that some people call an economic stimulus package wasting enough tax money? Second, some people out there are crazy enough, desperate enough for drugs, or just plain bold enough that they don't fear the consequences of shooting people in a fully armed society.\n \n So pretend like Johnny is driving home from work one day when he gets in a car accident, has to walk ten miles to get home, finds his house in flames and a note lying on the ground from his wife that says \"I don't love you, I'm having sex with another man right now, I'm never coming back, I hate your guts, and I wrote this right before I shot the dog and lit the house on fire just for the fun of making you homeless. I locked the kids in the basement, they must be ash by now.\" \n \n Now Johnny snaps and goes to the alley, buys PCP, uses it, getting him high off his XXX and immune to pain, then goes on a shooting spree. Could you imagine a guy with a gun in each hand, walking down the street shooting everyone who walks by and immune to pain? That's not a situation I'd like to be in. \n \n Of course, this is just a random scenario but I wouldn't want to live in a society where all criminals, drug addicts, and lunatics are required to have firearms. Yes they'd have to be bold to commit crimes, but strength lies in numbers. This could cause all-out war in Ghetto neighborhoods. I believe in the second amendment, but if you prove that you can't be trusted with firearms, then you shouldn't be allowed to have them. \n \n \n \n Shooterandproud \n Registered Euzer Join Date: Sep 2006\n Posts: 2,110 \n \n Use your brain, people. No matter how nice an armed person is, if they cant shoot straight they're going to hurt someone who they don't intend to hurt. [B]Hordes of untrained people with guns is a very bad idea.{/B] Israel currently requires this kind of training for every citizen and is wildly successful because of it. The only problem I can see is money. Doc, what is it that you object to so loudly on your godly pedestal?\n \n \n [U}Here comes your lecture from your vast extrapolated experience and imagination on this subject[U/U]\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Shooterandproud \n An armed society is unquestionably a good thing, but only requiring everyone to be armed would be stupid. First, drug testing, a psychological profile, etc to make sure they're responsible, sane, and drug free would be in order. Secondly, military style training in martial arts and shooting to make sure everyone can shoot straight and not go straight for their gun at the first sign of trouble. Thirdly, conflict resolution training. Training that resembles both police academy and the military, to make everyone that is armed as trained as a cop would be.\n \n \n And that is why you can't have pepper spray in your case at 16 with thinking like that, and you don't peresume to 'lecture'? Read your other posts\n \n You ignored this post here: http://www.4forums.com/political/364583-post105.html and all you took away from it was a smart a** immature comeback like who the h*** am I to try to give you advice when I outlined the qualifications and the point that THE STATE set the guidelines. We don't need your instruction to exercise our 2A rights!!\n \n You got p***** off here: http://www.4forums.com/political/364583-post105.html and out of hand dismissed over 6 decades of experience and teaching and real life experience. You don't know the classifications and shot a .22 rifle ONCE at camp probably that was sponsored by the NSSF which sponsors things like this and awards medals to encourage the shooting sports for adolescents?\n If you did indeed shoot 'sharpshooter' that is good, real good for the first time but is not sanctioned competition by the NRA. You do realize that NRA is the lead trainer for LEOs do you not?\n \n It is usually after claims like this the person will claim that their minds were not made up and take umbrage at others' comments and join the camp of the gun grabbers. *Note, you got counted on the lead page poll as being one who says \"crime will go up if everyone is armed. That alone puts you in the 'enemy camp'! I am impressed that you have shot a rifle once and have trained 'extensively' by a monk in kung fu about knife fighting.

   "Well he apparently think he knows my instructor more than I do without even meeting him, and is desperately trying to discredit me in any way possible by dishonest means.\n \n I don't think he is trying to \"discredit you\" any more than I am. Exactly what do you think is dishonest about an opinion?\n \n Tell me, Doc. What \"truth\" is that?\n\n \n Ok, fair question if you can handle it. The truth is that some of the incidents I have personally been in that involved life and death situations resulted in a hell of a lot of luck on my part that was more common sense and bad training by people I had trusted to prevail and survive. Each one was a learning experience even though I had training from folks that should have known better...I am talking about the government here teaching the politically correct version than the actual facts about the use of deadly force. I learned teaching from rote is wrong(no misspell here) and I learned to teach the ghastly facts about use of force to save my life or someone else's life. I learned to fight as a team with a plan and learned how to plan and have contingency plans and avoid situations by the threat of force(gun in hand and sights aligned) but be prepared to use deadly force as a first reaction and not as a response. Responces come from the head and require thought, reactions come from physical actions instantaneous reaction that is sure to come if you try running your mouth instead of your weapon. You can't talk and react at the same time.\n \n You mentioned conflict resolution. Do you even know what it is? Some call it non-violent conflict de-escalation. The bad guys know what they are going to do, you don't and what you don't know will get you dead! In a real life situation you tell the perp to put up his hands, if he doesn't pass the first test of compliance, you shoot. Plain and simple. Some trainers focus more on the politically correct choices which will make you dead. One instance stands out in my mind, a BIG deputy sheriff in East Texas(name was Deputy Lund as I recall) had 3 scrawny perps outside the car. He was waiting for a tag report. One grabbed his legs and took him down, the other two swarmed him, took his gun and shot him with it and drove off, stole another car and made it all the way to the border. If they hadn't of hung around they would never have been caught. He was so sure of himself, his size training vs. their size that he was unaware and assumed they were afraid of him or he was more than a match for all 3. That mouth may lie but the body doesn't. When they didn't comply and just the driver out, he should have either been shooting, reloading or moving. He wasn't taught that and had never been in an experience like that and it cost him his life as well as endangering the general populace.\n \n Now I am not going to share any of my episodes with you but it took a couple and lots of luck to survive. I would never try to disarm a knife wielding suspect cause he will kill you with monotonous regularity ever time and it works like ex-lax. Gansao tried to make a point of it and I thought he did rather well. You took offense because you thought you had pride to defend; pride will get you killed too and it just ain't worth it. The Good Book tells you pride goeth before the fall; do you not believe that? Gansao told you it was foolish and child's play and he was telling you that TRUTH you asked for. Some folks have to learn it the hard way at risk of life and limb but the smarter ones catch on real fast.\n \n Now there, I laid it out as plain as rat sign in the sugar bowl and for what it is worth you can take it or leave it. My personal opinion, and it don't count, is that you would be buzzard bait if you really believe what you profess and had an encounter of the worst kind. I told you what Clint Smith of Thunder Ranch said, \"if it is a fair fight, your tactics suck\". He is right!\n \n The gun grabbers live in a dream world and they don't give a dam if you live or not, you are but a statistic and statistics are useful to them and that is all the use they have for you personally. Now if you wanna be a hero you better have on lots and lots of kevlar, and a double heaping of luck. Right now you are a victim waiting to happen. Criminals love people like you because you are easy pickins waiting to happen. Now shooting don't bother them much either, most of 'em already been shot before and they aren't going to be too impressed by your compassion and a tale of your formidable training...nor is anyone else who has been down that trail.\n \n Now there is another story woven in amidst all this other plain talk and when you figger it out use it wisely.",

These organizations are notorious for presenting highly anti-gun positions and concepts, as well as intentionally misleading the American people with misinformation.\n \n The fact that the group who wrote this article, are the same people who gave us the lying Brady Campaign and MMM, casts serious doubt on the validity and objectivity of the \"findings\".

Anytime somebody posts a well written and thought out article that details how gun control has failed and made everyone less safe, you criticize the author if they can be connected to a pro-gun organization. Rather than address the points that're raised, like how gun registries cost billions of taxpayer dollars that could put more police on the streets or build more prisons, and how criminals aren't legally required to register their guns in the first place, or how DC had the highest crime rates during the period of their handgun ban, instead you attack the author and talk about how they have an agenda and don't care about the consequences of their positions.\n \n I don't need to disprove the article of this Brady Campaign splinter cell, their own affiliation reveals the truth. It's guilt by association really. Ever since their creation the Brady Campaign has been closely affiliated with the group known as the National Coalition to Ban Handguns. Since their creation the Brady Campaign has supported each and every member that would make guns harder to own, afford and legally use, they've supported the position of reducing the Second Amendment to a privilege that would be accessible only to the rich, and they've done nothing but lie through their teeth to the American public.",
