Canada is not exactly known as a land of freedom--one only needs to look at their gun control laws to see that. Luckily, nations that do what Canada has done are rare--we just happen to have one bordering us. Let's hope the U.S. never follows their lead any more than they have on the right to free speech (canada has no 1st Amendment), making it near impossible to own a firearm, no avenue to seek better medical treatment than their socialist health care system provides, etc.\n\n \n A little tutorial for the ill informed amongst us.\n \n The \"institution of marriage\" -\n \n Divorce rates of all countries, compared to U.S.: \n Country Divorce Rate Rate as % of US Rate\n (Per 1000 population\n per year)\n Sri Lanka 0.15 3.03%\n Brazil 0.26 5.25%\n Italy 0.27 5.45%\n Mexico 0.33 6.67%\n Turkey 0.37 7.47%\n Mongolia 0.37 7.47%\n Chile 0.38 7.68%\n Jamaica 0.38 7.68%\n Cyprus 0.39 7.88%\n El Salvador 0.41 8.28%\n Ecuador 0.42 8.48%\n Mauritius 0.47 9.49%\n Thailand 0.58 11.72%\n Syria 0.65 13.13%\n Panama 0.68 13.74%\n Brunei 0.72 14.55%\n Greece 0.76 15.35%\n China 0.79 15.96%\n Singapore 0.80 16.16%\n Tunisia 0.82 16.57%\n Albania 0.83 16.77%\n Portugal 0.88 17.78%\n Korea 0.88 17.78%\n Trinidad 0.97 19.60%\n Qatar 0.97 19.60%\n Guadeloupe 1.18 23.84%\n Barbados 1.21 24.44%\n Finland 1.85 37.37%\n Canada 2.46 49.70% Australia 2.52 50.91%\n New Zealand 2.63 53.13%\n Denmark 2.81 56.77%\n United Kingdom 3.08 62.22%\n Russia 3.36 67.88%\n Puerto Rico 4.47 90.30%\n US 4.95 100.00%\n [Statistics provided by \"Fathers' Manifesto\" <fathers9@idt.liberty.com< in posting to familylaw-l@lawlib.wuacc.edu, I believe their source was a World Almanac or something similar from 1994 or thereabouts]\n \n \n \n Free Speech in Canada  - http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html#2\n \n Firearm ownership - true they have to be registered, technically anyway, but there are no restrictions on gun ownership, if it were impossible, I wouldn't be able to own approximately 20 of them. Getting a premit to own to purchase certain guns, handguns and \"assault rifles\" for lack of a better term can be difficult, and you certainly can't carry them concealed, but it is not illegal to purchase or own them, provided the right paperwork is in place.\n http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/F-11.6/text.html\n \n Healthcare - I grow extremely weary of the issue. You might as well remain uniformed and leave it to us commie pinko Canadians to deal with.\n \n As for gay marriage - we've simply allowed our citizens a greater deal of freedom, equality, and protection under the law. Simply put, we recognized their right life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. \n \n Waxy",
