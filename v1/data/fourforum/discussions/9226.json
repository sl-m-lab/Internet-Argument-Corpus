Legislative Action on Proposed\n Constitutional Amendments. I see nothing there that says that amendments can't die just like any other piece of legislation. There's nothing that says everything that comes in front of the legilature must recieve a stand up vote, at least not that I can see. But of course it's much more PC to say that you're \"pro democracy\" rather than pro stripping rights from gays. They even go out of their way to say (lie) that it isn't about gays anymore. \n \n \"This is no longer just about gay marriage,\" Fehrnstrom said. \"It's about the right of the people to participate in their own government.\"\n \n If anyone is buying that, I've got this great bridge in the New York area that I could let go cheap! emoticon_xgood",

   "I read the Amendment process in the Massachusetts constitution. I agree with Kronus that the relevant part is IV. Legislative Action on Proposed\n Constitutional Amendments. From what I gather from the article, I think the question posed is as follows: Does the Massachusetts constitution require the legislature to vote on constitutional amendments that have been appropriately brought before the legislature? I think the Governor has a strong argument for his conclusion.\n \n The key, I think, to this specific situation is that the Amendment is proposed through an initiative petition. Sections 2 (as amended) and 4. Section 2 says that the amendment should be considered by a joint session of the legislature. It further provides:\n \n \n...if the two houses fail to agree upon a time for holding any joint session hereby required, or fail to continue the same from time to time until final action has been taken upon all amendments pending, the governor shall call such joint session or continuance thereof.\n\n \n This provision appears to me to require the legislature to proceed until \"final action has been taken upon all amendments pending.\" In short, it appears the constitution requires the legislature to reach \"final action\" on constitutional amendments proposed through the initiative petition (via the Governor's request for the continuance of a special session). The question remains, then, is what does \"final action\" mean? This is where section 4 is relevant.\n \n \nFinal legislative action in the joint session upon any amendment shall be taken only by call of the yeas and nays, which shall be entered upon the journals of the two houses...\n\n \n According to section 4, final action can only occur by a roll call vote.\n \n So, in summary:\n \n The legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken.\n \n Final action can only occur through a roll call vote.\n \n Adjourning before taking final action on the amendment is therefore acting in violation of the constitution.\n \n An interesting thin to note in this is that the legislature only went into recess, it did not adjourn. From what I have read, there is still one day for them to vote on this measure after the recess.",

In particular, I'm not sure about your conclusion here:\n \"The legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken.\"\n My reading is simply that if they don't reach a conclustion in one session, they have to take it up again in the next one.

And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it.

It seems to me that one of the most glaring differences between proponents of SCS today and the founding fathers is that even the founding fathers who didn't necessarily believe in God at least were not hostile toward religion being a part of life and society--they respected it and recognized that because it's a normal part of human life and society, there are going to be references to it in human things--such as government. As long as there are people, religion isn't going to go away. It's always going to be in parts of culture in SOME form, even in terms of government.

Don't mistake dislike for those trying to force their own religion into the workings of the government with dislike for religion in general.\n\n \n Let's be very clear here--you are referring to protecting religion from govt (which IS a part of SCS), but what I see much more often in its proponents is the over-emphasis of protecting govt. from religion (also a part of SCS). It's an imbalanced perspective. Your post, just now, is one of the few times I have ever seen anyone here indicate a desire to protect religion rather than emphsizing protection FROM religion. And I have to admit, it's a bit refreshing.\n \n IMO, this only further illustrates the difference between the modern SCS proponent and the founding fathers: they held what I consider to be a very balanced perspetive on the matter, realizing that references to religion in govt. (such as \"so help me God\") are not dangerous, and that such is not in and of itself an imposition. \n \n \nNot that has even a little bit to do with the topic at hand, of course. \n\n \n You'll have to take that up with Matthew; I was responding to HIS post.",
