   "The Hamilton College \"Hot Button Issues\" poll found that 75 percent of high school seniors back the legalization of same-sex \"marriage\" or civil unions. \n \n <snip<\n \n Dr. Gilbert notes that on another \"hot button\" issue -- homosexual relationships -- the strong support shown by the seniors differs greatly from the sentiments of the general adult population. The educator thinks he knows why.\n \n \"On the gay issue, I just think they've just grown up in a different time. There's a lot more openness about being gay, and I don't think it's something that bothers most high school seniors,\" the Cornell graduate says. \"There's a minority of maybe 20 percent who are quite resistant to this.\"\n \n The survey also found that three in four seniors oppose a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, and 63 percent support adoption by homosexual couples.\n http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/1/122006b.asp",
