   "Here's a recap of the contraversy:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_In_Action\n \nLove In Action and The Zach Scandal\n In June 2005, a 16-year-old Tennessee male, Zach (last name omitted for privacy reasons), posted a blog entry on his myspace site, part of which includes:\n \n \"Somewhat recently, as many of you know, I told my parents I was gay... Well today, my mother, father, and I had a very long \"talk\" in my room where they let me know I am to apply for a fundamentalist christian program for gays. They tell me that there is something psychologically wrong with me, and they \"raised me wrong.\" I'm a big screw up to them, who isn't on the path God wants me to be on. So I'm sitting here in tears, joing (sic) the rest of those kids who complain about their parents on blogs - and I can't help it.\" \n The program Zach noted is a Love In Action-run camp known as Refuge (the combination of which quickly earned the camp the nickname LIA/R). The subsequent protests drew both extensive local media attention and international interest, with individuals from Europe, America and elsewhere getting involved. Particular attention was given to a quote attributed to the man running the program, John Smid:\n \n \"I would rather you commit suicide than have you leave Love In Action wanting to return to the gay lifestyle. In a physical death you could still have a spiritual resurrection; whereas, returning to homosexuality you are yielding yourself to a spiritual death from which there is no recovery.\"  Attention has also focused on the rules of Love In Action which like most Christian camps includes dress codes, bans on several forms of communication with the outside world, and a ban on television. In a May 30 entry on Zach's blog he posted the rules of the Refuge Program. Under a heading called Hygiene, it says, \"1. All clients must maintain appropriate hygiene, including daily showering, use of deodorant, and brushing teeth twice daily.\"\n \n In addition to the nature of the rules themselves, opposition to the course focused on Zach being sent to the camp against his wishes and against a background of existing concerns over ex-gay ministries such as Love In Action.\n \n Zach's original two-week stay in the Love in Action program was extended to eight weeks. On August 1, Zach deleted his old material and began a new blog, which began with the following paragraph:\n \n \"This isn't going to become my life. I won't let it. There's more to me than this. I've erased the original blogs. I know they're still out there somewhere, but the originals aren't. I haven't been able to see all of the news, newspaper, magazine, etc. articles and such, so I don't know exactly what to say. Currently I feel annoyed towards a lot of things. Love In Action has been misrepresented and what I have posted in my blogs has been taken out of perspective and context. I don't take back the things I've said, nor am I going to pretend like it never happened. It did. I refuse to deal with people who are only focused on their one-sided (biased) agendas. It isn't fair to anyone. I'm very frustrated with the things going on in my life now, but everyone has their issues. Homosexuality is still a factor in my life--- it's not who I am, it never has been. Those of you who really know me, know that homosexuality was always there but it didn't run my life, and it will not now.\" \n On August 14, Zach updated his blog, stating that LIA had not pressured him into doing anything and he got along well with most of the clients  there. He said his parents no longer let him hang out with girls as friends because it was unhealthy, and that his father had asked him to stop blogging.\n \n \n Allegations and investigation\n A Tennessee investigation against the camp began shortly after \"Zach\"'s story appeared online. As of June 28, 2005, the investigation has been dropped, with Tennessee officials citing a lack of evidence of child abuse at the facilities. \"Department of Children's Services dispatched its special investigations unit to the facility, and after conducting a full investigation, determined that the child abuse allegations were unfounded,\" Rob Johnson, an agency spokesman, told the Associated Press. [2] \"Free Zach\" campaigners, who aim to have LIA/R close down, have made allegations of corruption. Another investigation by the Tennessee Department of Health resulted in their telling the unlicensed group  they may have been operating illegally. Love in Action said they would change their policy in order to comply with the state, but as of late July 2005 the Department of Health had not heard back from them.\n\n \n There is more there on that link about the hisroty of \"Love In Action\". Not very pretty.",

   "Actually, it is all quite simple. Claims of the ability for an individual to change their sexual orientation through either \"reparative\" (see note 1 below) therapy or trandformational \"ministires\" (see note 2 below) are grossly exagerated by the anti-gay lobby and are, in fact, \"insignificant\" and \"isolated incidents\" with no factual backing.\n \n How do I conclude this? Why, it is very simple!!!!!!!! I follow the same logic jyoshu uses on reports of hate crimes against gay people: IT ISN'T REPORTED AS NEWS IN THE MAJOR MEDIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Therefore, it doesn't exist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! QED. Voila!!!!!!!! emoticon_idea :) \n \n Note1: I don't understand the use of the term \"reparitive\" What is to be repaired?\n \n Note 2: I think jyoshu has already admitted the these so-called \"transformational ministries\" don't really \"transform\" ANYTHING!!! They just try to force the individual to deny their true identity and live a lie. OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A \"lie\"?????  And jyosho isn't all over them??? Hmmm. emoticon_frazzled",

   "From the Associated Press:\n \n (Nashville, Tennessee) The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities has ordered the closing of what it calls two unlicensed personal care facilities run by a Christian group that claims to counsel gays to give up homosexuality.\n \n The state inspected two facilities in Memphis on Aug. 19 and determined Love In Action International Inc. was providing housing, meals and personal care for mentally ill patients without a license, according to a subsequent letter to the organization from the Department of Mental Health. \n The department gave Love In Action until Sept. 23 to cease operation of the facilities and apply for a state license. \n \n Love In Action spokesman Gerard Wellman declined to answer questions about the state's allegations. \n \n \"We will be commenting when the time is right,\" or when the case is past its initial stage, Wellman said. \n \n Lawyer Nathan Kellum responded to the state on Sept. 14 with a letter acknowledging Love In Action had received the state's notice and promising to respond fully by Sept. 23. \n \n \"The issue is these being supportive care facilities,\" state spokeswoman Lola Potter said Monday. \"Supportive care must be licensed.\" \n \n Former Love In Action client Peterson Toscano said Monday that a house manager for the program told him one of the manager's responsibilities was dispensing drugs that had been prescribed for participants. \n \n \"He told me that it was to keep people from misusing the drugs,\" said Toscano, who is now a writer and performer living in Hartford, Conn. \n \n Under state regulations, facilities that dispense medication to patients require a license. \n \n The Love In Action facilities were still in operation Monday, Potter said. \n \n If the organization were to continue operating the facilities past the Sept. 23 deadline, it would face criminal penalties that include fines of up to $500 and six months in jail for each day the facilities are determined to be in violation of state laws, Potter said. \n \n The Department of Mental Health's current action is not the first time Love In Action has drawn the state's attention. \n \n Earlier this year the Department of Children's Services investigated a child abuse complaint against Love In Action that was found to be unsubstantiated. (story) The complaint stemmed from a Web logger going by the name of \"Zach\" who said his parents were sending him to a religious organization that would try to convert him to heterosexuality. (story) \n \n The teen identified himself as a 16-year-old from Bartlett, Tenn., and said his parents \"tell me that there is something psychologically wrong with me. ... I'm a big screwup to them, who isn't on the path God wants me to be on. So I'm sitting here in tears ... and I can't help it.\"\n \n In August the Department of Health determined the group did not need to be licensed as a drug and alcohol treatment program. John Smid, Love In Action's executive director, said then that his group does not provide psychological, drug or alcohol counseling, but seeks to help people overcome sexual problems through a stronger Christian faith. \n \n Counseling that would be regulated by the state is \"really not our focus,\" he said. \n \n Love In Action's work, particularly with teenagers, has drawn protests from gay rights advocates. \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/09/092005exGay.htm",

The mainstream press doesn't care about gay issues unless it is going to sell papers or airtime....this is small time to them.\n \n I am upset they consider homosexuality a mental illness, I am a mental health community organizer....but I think the issue of practive treatment without a license is bigger than their views....There Views are so outside the mainstream of real mental health work....they are nothing mroe than a hate group and now they will be treated as such.....if they want to continue this practice, then they need a license, which they are unlikely to get because they are going against the mainstream....",
