What is more dangerous is that people hear a 30 second blurb of news followed by 30 minutes of bloviation explaining why they should view it as a positive or a negative.

   "If you don't like it, don't watch it. Works for me. I think it is perfectly ok for people to be on TV speaking their mind though. Calling for people to get locked up for speaking is just lunacy.\n\n \n I wouldn't actually support \"locking them up\", it was meant facetiously. I am not against them expressing their opinions either, as it is their right as Americans to do so. I find censorship, in most cases, to be destructive to both individual rights and the common good.\n \n In all seriousness however, I do believe that network news presents an overall problem for America. I strongly believe that network news has vastly contributed to the partisanship that has gripped our nation. Too many people in our country have grown content with simply listening to one side of the story, and again, thanks to the spin doctors who bloviate continuously, people have grown comfortable with allowing others to do their thinking for them. It is often much more difficult to solve a problem when you only have half the equation. Many Americans are too lazy to investigate matters for themselves, and consequently they are ill informed about the issues. Sadly, many of these same people vote. If our country required a basic political knowledge test prior to voting, how many people do you think would have voted in '08? I would be willing to be we would have eliminated at least 25% of those who did. I find it very disheartening when I see people holding signs that say \"keep you government hands off my medicare\", or when I hear people being interviewed for the Howard Stern show saying that 'Palin was a great choice to be Obama's running mate'. \n \n It's great that we have the right to vote for our leaders, but that right comes with the great responsibility of being informed and educated.",

   "In all seriousness however, I do believe that network news presents an overall problem for America. I strongly believe that network news has vastly contributed to the partisanship that has gripped our nation.\nI don't think so. We've always have partisanship in our nation. In fact, at times, it has been much worse. \n \n Who knows, perhaps the increase in communication means has helped keep tempers down instead of resorting to dueling each other. \n \n \nIt's great that we have the right to vote for our leaders, but that right comes with the great responsibility of being informed and educated.\nI agree. I don't think cable news necessarily kills this either. If you aren't smart enough to know it is just an opinion than you aren't smart enough to make an informed decision even if cable news did not exist. Personally, I listen to some talk radio when I travel (normally Glenn Beck is on at that time) and I read Paul Krugman's column and I go to see Al Sharpton speak. Sometimes they make a very good point. Hell, I've been praising Glenn Beck's book \"Broke\". If you are smart enough you can check the facts ,see if it makes sense logically, and then see if it fits into your worldview. \n \n For those that can't, cable news makes no difference...sadly :(",
