   "Well, as I see more and more people believe in 1 May 2004 and EU. They hope that it will change everything in their lives. And Saakashvili sincerely believes in the nearest entry into EU. I understand that his optimism was warmed up by Washington. He is sure that Georgia will be part of European structure and plans. It happened because US promised to help him. Saakashvili doesn't understand that Washington never does anything without bearing tricky plans. They want to stick to Europe one more Grecian horse. Well, I think that the Europeans have had enough of Poland. Moreover Gunter Verhoigen, EU commissar for the EU enlargement, warned that widening of EU is no panacea! I think that Georgia will not be a part of Europe. Unfortunately some EU officials say that our country is doomed to be the backyard of European Union. As for me I think that we must find our own way of development with the regional partners. By that we will raise up.",

   "It should happen. Did you hear that Saakashvili declared that we need Americans in security problems? He thought that we live because of US support. ****, you write that we must find our own way of development but I think that its illusion only. Well during Saakashvili have power we will not do what we want. He is a puppet in Washington hands. Look, do you see what he tried to do in Adjaria. We stayed on threshold of civil war. I think that man who depends on somebody can annihilate his own nation. And Saakashvili does it by Americans' offer.",
