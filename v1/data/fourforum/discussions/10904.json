   "Five years after a gay advocacy group was told that it could no longer use the e-mail, bulletin boards and meeting rooms at the Justice Department, Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey has reversed that decision and issued a revised equal-employment-opportunity policy barring discrimination against any group. \n \n Mukasey informed leaders of DOJ Pride last week that the department would give it the same rights as all other DOJ employee organizations, said the group's president, Chris Hook. In a statement, Mukasey said the department will \"foster an environment in which diversity is valued, understood and sought\" and maintain \"an environment that's free of discrimination.\" \n \n DOJ Pride and its 110 members had been barred from holding an annual Gay and Lesbian Pride Month celebration since 2003, when then-Attorney General John D. Ashcroft told the group that the Bush administration observed an unwritten policy of not sponsoring events without a presidential proclamation, Hook said. The group also was told it could not post notices of general meetings and events on department bulletin boards, he said. \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/04/AR2008020402761.html?hpid=sec-politics\n \n emoticon_xgood \n Better late than never...\n \n < begin sarcasm <\n It's too bad that the left-handed group which was also barred has remained silent and is still barred to this day...\n < end sarcasm <",

   "Interesting that Ashcroft barred the group (and no other employee groups were treated similarly) that had been allowed under the previous administration. Gonzales was likely not to change this position but the group appealed to Mukasey, who sounds like a decent fellow.\n \n \"He has gone out of his way to ensure that the department has a new air of inclusiveness and an open and welcoming environment for all employees,\" Hook [the group's president] said. \n \n Imagine, having a leader of the Department of Justice that cares about justice. Thank goodness this odious administration will soon be gone.",
