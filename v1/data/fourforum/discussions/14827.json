   "Your ignorance is profound in its never ending consistency. You still don't get it that jj never turned away from anything real. He was never a believer in the first place or else we would have agreed with ME on what it means to be a believer in Christ. \n \n I didn't turn him from anything at all, all I did was continually warn Him that he was heading down a dangerous road by denying Gods truths about homosexuality when he claimed to accept Christ as His savior. Remember when Jesus said, \"You are either for Me or against Me? You either love Me or you hate Me!\" Our God doesn't compromise His Righteousness and His Holiness with fallen Man. So you, jj and all the rest of your fallen cohorts here are just deluding yourselves as you attempt to blame me and Easy for your decisions to reject God and His Truths. \n \n You are so incapable of defending your loser belief system, you must blame us for opposing you with the truths we tell because our truths expose the darkness you represent. And you are so blind, you take our warnings and the harsh realities we share as words of hatred rather than the saving truths they are if you would only accept them and finally introspectively consider your eternal condition. Because, remember this; no matter how much my words hurt, they don't compare at all with the pain you'll feel when the living God whom you reject condemns you to an eternity apart from Him.\n\n \n \nLet me ask you this?... Did you ever warn anyone not to eat Pork?... did you ever say \" Hey, don't eat shellfish because it is an Abomination and you will surely burn in hell?... No you didn't, and you didn't because all you are concerned with is spewing bigotry and hate towards gay people and anyone who doesn't believe YOUR view of Christianity....\n\n \n Its ignorant drivel like this that reminds me why I don't bother debating you twerps, but just give my opinions and let you rant away with your misrepresentations of Gods word. \n \n Here you are comparing/confusing the seriousness of Gods moral standards which His condemnation of homosexuality was based upon with His dietary standards which were based upon health issues of the time. Are you unaware of a disease called Trichinosis from eating Pork? And are you aware that shellfish are bottom feeders that live off of the waste of all the life in the sea? While the rest of the WORLD was getting sick and dying from the consumption of these foods due to their ignorance of the dangers they posed for another 2000 years or more, the Israelites were safe from them due to their dietary laws. \n \n \nPAALLEEEESSSEE!! tell me what evidence you have to support your GOD?...\n\n \n Every time I respond to one of your ignorant attacks on the bible and reveal the truth of the matter being discussed, (which you never accept or admit to) just like this argument above in this very post about dietary laws, I show you a truth about God and some advance insights the Jews had that the unbelieving gentile world didn't have because of their paganism and unbelief. And even now, 2000 years after Christ walked among us you are still too ignorant and uninformed to understand the simple truth that Jews appreciated 3500 years ago about pork and why God forbade it. \n \n Not to mention your inaccurate comparison of dietary laws to moral laws. Almost every opinion you share about the scriptures are founded in bigotry, ignorance, hatred and blatant misrepresentations of not only reality, but the TRUTH the bible represents. That's why debating you is a waste of time. I would first have to get you to understand reality as compared to the atheist lies and propaganda you promote around here. \n \n But I have debated enough atheists to know you consider this sport rather than a sincere journey to learn and grow as a human being. But as someone who considers himself descended from lower animals, it doesn't surprise me that you are closed minded & unteachable.\n \n \n I'm perfectly capable of defending my position and have so on numerous occasions against both YOU and EasyRider. When you can't fight back you run like a scalded dog, change the subject, or go to a different topic and spout off a few hate posts against someone whom you think can't stand up to your nonsense.\n\n \n Arguing for the sake of argument when nothing you say is correct IS NOT DEFENDING YOUR POSITION. It is just ranting with lies and misinformation that will never sustain the test of time. The only thing you have ever proven to me is that you are a godless heathen who hates the truth and loves the darkness. PERIOD!!!\n \n \n I've challenged you before to DEBATE me on the subject of religion without the use of scripture, and you refuse to take that challenge because YOU know deep in your own mind that you can't defend your position with fairy tales. \n\n \n See this paragraph? It's a perfect example of the irrational nonsense you constantly spew as you rant your ignorant drivel. Just read it and see that first you want to debate me without allowing me the use of scripture, but if scripture is such a fairytale that I can't defend my position with, then why do you want me to debate you without using it? Can you see how completely irrational the argument in that paragraph is? That type of logic defines your whole world view.\n \n \nSee, one thing you should know about me Zorba, I am NOT scared of you or YOUR GOD. I am 100% confident in my own Mortality that I don't need to worry about an afterlife. I KNOW when I die I am simply dead, gone, and hopefully not Forgotten. A mans only purpose in life other than to be happy should be to leave a legacy for others to remember.\n\n \n As for being scared of me, that is ridiculous. I mean you no harm nor am I capable of harming you in any way in this venue. But only a complete fool would boast that he doesn't fear the living God so thanks for proving you have less understanding than every animal on earth because you can bet your bottom dollar they believe in God.\n \n \nSo you can say whatever you think will make YOU feel better. If you think you bother me then you need to think again, I don't care what you think of me. I know who I am, and I know I am not a bad person. Read the first quote in my signature, that will tell you exactly where I stand when it comes to people like you.\n\n \n If I didn't bother you, you guys wouldn't get so fired up and irrational in your responses to my arguments. You all attempt to come up with any wisdom at all to respond to me with, but just end up spewing venomous and hateful invectives as you accuse me of being hateful when the very worst thing that would happen to any of you if you took my words to heart is that you would find eternal life and eternal security in the arms of our loving Father in Heaven, from a savior who took flesh upon Himself, lived a perfect life and then died as an acceptable sacrificial lamb for the sins of humanity to redeem us once and for all time. \n \n You people so hate the truth that you label me a hater because I dare to define sin and point it out to you. I declare absolute truth exists for all of us and exempt myself from nothing I share with you. And yet you accuse me of self righteously sharing these truths as if they don't apply to me also. You're a pathetic empty vessel and will remain so until you submit to the living God and receive the free gift of salvation that only comes through Christ our Lord. To deny that simple truth is to condemn yourself so don't ever say it is God who condemns you. After all, it is He who died to take your sins upon Himself as the perfect sacrificial lamb of God.\n \n Now come on back and accuse me of being self righteous and hateful as I condemned you to hell just for telling you once again how to be saved forever and a day.

   "Congratulations on your final abandonment of righteousness and truth jj, you have finally accepted the depravity which is your unnatural nature of homosexuality. \n\n \n See there is just so many holes in the rant you threw together Archie. First off I never abandoned righteousness because I never claimed to be righteous. \n \n Secondly truth is what the person makes of it. Truth is based upon point of view and inherent guidelines we as people set for ourselves. I never abandoned my virtues as a man when I stopped rationalizing the shackles that bound my mind to religion, I increased my virtue.\n \n See I cannot blame a god or a demon or Satan for my actions. Like so many other Christians you make excuses you say you were \"tempted\" or something to that nature.\n \n I do not have that ability nor would I seek to use it as a crutch. My nature is human Archie. My nature has been seen in over 1200 species of the animal kingdom. Homosexuality is in our nature as a species and is perfectly normal. \n \n I know you do not believe this because you are bound by the shackles of dogma and smoke and mirrors but clearly I can see I've touched a nerve to see you once again spout off in such an irrational way.\n \n \nYou have always hated Gods TRUTHS and have loved the darkness which you have embraced since accepting homosexuality as a preferred lifestyle, now that you have finally accepted atheism as your new belief system you can finally quit the charade that you possess even a semblance of righteousness or a love of the eternal truths which I so readily accept as absolute and unchanging.\n\n \n See how can i hate something that does not exist? How can I despise that which is a concept? A Myth. How am I one to embrace darkness when I have actually just embraced light. The light of reason. You see if anything you embrace the darkness Archie.\n \n You embrace the darkness of ignorance, the darkness of truths, the darkness of the rational mind. We are not speaking on a moral plain however I can see your attempting to twist it into so but it is not morality that binds thought.\n \n If anything thought binds morality. The mind binds the virtues we hold ourselves to not the fear of a being we cannot see, hear, nor touch. Rather the primal instinct is emotion. Emotion propagated by those who control the ignorance, control the fearful, control those who wish to not accept death as it is at face value.\n \n That is the core of religion Archie. The core is control and blindness. To keep the mind in darkness. You cannot embrace righteousness because you are not righteous to begin with. Righteousness does not exist for Atheists because we know were human. We know virtue exists because our minds strive for it. We strive for positive good. For a greater plain of reason and thought through science, through philosophy, through learning.\n \n Not by fear or hurt, or lies and cheap tricks. or emotion. If anything Archie you are still bound by darkness while I now have truly embraced light.\n \n \nNow you can openly fellowship with all of the children of darkness who have been corresponding with you on this thread before I posted but who have always openly accepted you in spite of your claims that you were a christian because let's face it, they knew very well that you were as big a degenerate as they are, all along. \n\n \n And here we see more anger. More bitterness to those who are not bound by the same delusional fear you are. You insult, you rant, you attempt to rationalize through a filter of ignorance at others whom disagree and hold other views.\n \n Not just of Atheists Archie but anyone else. Such is the pitfall of religion. Even when I was bound by the fears of the spiritual I still remained respectful and open to others. I only now am even more thankful I was for it opened my mind to freedom.\n \n \nWhy do you think they never attacked your christianity as they did and do mine and Easy's? Don't you get it jj?\n\n \n I do get it. Because I respected others Archie. Because even then even though I gripped the last shred of fear and doubt in my mind indoctrinated and burned into me since I was young, I still had a relative mind of reason.\n \n Your Christianity and mine were very different. And it is very clear in your response as to why.\n \n \n The darkness hates the light and you have just proven for all to see that it is as I have always said it is with you.\n\n \n I am not bound by darkness anymore Archie. You have the terms confused. Your are bound by utter darkness shut out from reason. shackled to the perceptions and tricks of the masses. I thankfully am not.\n \n \n You were always lying about your faith in Christ just as I always said you were.\n\n \n No Archie. I wanted to believe I truly truly did. I searched in vain to try to make such a belief plausible when I knew in my heart of hearts it wasn't so.\n \n \n You have been given over to a reprobate mind and have just now accepted it yourself and embraced it, FINALLY!!! \n\n \n Archie. I pity you. I pity you because you simply are like a blind man claiming to see because he stares at the sun.... \n \n \nSo once again, congratulations on finally accepting what you are.\n\n \n Thank you. You have not a clue the peace in my life at this moment. Perhaps one day you too can experience it.\n \n \n \n I've been telling you this for a couple of years now. emoticon_xbye bye bye my lost friend, you have just completed the final process of condemning yourself forever as you gave in to your reprobate mind.\n\n \n You never were a friend Archie. if you were you'd question in respect. You'd ask with a clear mind and with unbiased desire and thought. You never did these things nor will you ever I assume.\n \n It is quite sad to realize just how lost you truly truly are.",

You'd have more credibility calling yourself an agnostic.\n\n \n I know exactly what I am doing. I've freed my mind. Rationale controls now not fear, not shackles of fantasy. It's pitiable that you are still bound by them Easy.\n \n \nAtheism says there is no god. Do you know everything there is to know in the universe? No way. So your claim is shallow and spiritually bankrupt as well. \n\n \n I claim nothing. I however cannot look at the world, the universe with logic, with reason, with clear mind and say there is god because there is no proof. The organized religions are just like the old pagan gods, the old sun gods, the old Bronze Age gods.\n \n Their all propagated by control. To keep the masses blinded by fear and by delusion of an afterlife. Conform to us they say and you will have heaven. Discriminate against these men and you will have riches.\n \n Murder these villagers in the name of our god and you will have honor and reward. Blame our gods enemies. And you will have justification for your actions.\n \n \nOn the other hand, it's a fairly good choice in that there's no moral guidelines in atheism, so you can be as morally deficient as you'd like.\n\n \n Quite the opposite. See as I told Archie earlier I cannot blame a demon. Or Satan, or something out of the spiritual fantasy world to say my actions were caused or influenced by them. I was not tempted because such a thing simply does not exist.\n \n The one person I do fear is myself. Everyday I must look in the mirror. Everyday I must judge my own virtue and good upon my own merits. Everyday I must be critical of myself and responsible because I cannot blame any longer an imaginary being such as you do.\n \n If anything Atheists are more moral because our morals are bound by thought. And thought created the very concept of morals.\n \n \nEXCEPT - we'll still be around to set you straight and keep your ego in check.\n \n Romans 1:26-27\n\n \n You are not. Your religion does not give you clairvoyance to influence my life. You cannot scare me with hellfire because fire needs oxygen and a fuel source to exist. \n \n You cannot tempt me with heaven, because I look up at the sky and see it with my own eyes. And you cannot threaten me. Because the western world as we know it is slowly emerging as one of enlightenment.\n \n People one by one are waking up from the slumber, shattering the shackles that bound them and seeing a new dawn emerge.

Your evidence is flawed. And the way you present it with prejudice invokes a label of hatred because of the manner in which you scapegoat and criticize others without merit.\n \n Once again it's about presentation.

What is your evidence? Why is this a war in your mind? What substantial argument? You've never posted credible evidence relevant to a subject in a positive manner Archie...\n \n it's always been half baked links leading to some fringe or skewed religious opinion that throws the scientific method out the window.\n \n \n If anyone lays claim to wishful thinking it is you. Wishing things will get better when your sick so you pray (wish) for a miracle. You wish for your marriage to be stronger or to be saved. You wish you'll get to heaven by devoting your life to a fantasy and a concept that has no basis in literal reality whatsoever...\n \n You see Archie instead of wishing for a miracle Atheists use science and technology to combat the sickness. Instead of wishing for a marriage to get better we use our minds in a rational manner to seek counseling and analyze the problems in the relationship.\n \n Instead of wasting our lives in fear chained to the delusions held by the masses, we are free to not fear the imaginary and live healthy happy lives.\n \n \n \n \n All that will matter in the end is which of us is correct according to the opinion of God, our Creator and the author of all life.\n\n \n god has no opinion Archie.

But, a person who has study biotic origins will note that life did not begin as a single assembly of molecules, but rather the gradual combination of parts. Scientist have been able to prove that protobionts can form within the laws of physics and chemistry. You should study the formation of protobionts and the gradual move towards life before you begin spouting off about \"spontaneous generation\", which is not a valid scientific theory, and one which is not supported by scientists.\n \n So, before you continue to misquote and take statements out of context, do yourself a favor and study up on evolution and the beginning of life.

   "I know who your post was for, but when you use words like \" All You Haters\" then it is directed to all of us is it not?...\n Well I was once as Blind as you are to the truth of reality, does that make any difference now?. I honestly can't say if God exists or not, it would be absurd to do so. However, when I look at the world around me, the history of religion and How it came to be, the countless other \"Gods\" who were tossed aside when your God was created, and most of all the inconsistency and utter confusion of the only Evidence your God does exist, well I can feel comfortable enough in my assumption that God does not Exist . You may say that is Absurd, but no less Absurd than you stating that GOD does exist as if you know it for a fact. \n \n \n \n And I know without Doubt that my own personal belief is correct , that doesn't put you on some higher ground . Your Bible tells you to Witness to others to help bring more sheep into the Flock, but what you are doing is not Witnessing. You blatantly put yourself in \"Gods\" place and Condemn people to Hell for YOU personal belief. You Assume that because someone is an Atheist that they are automatically a bad, Immoral person, but you will not admit how wrong you are . \n \n If you won't debate then I ask, why do you even bother?. You won't change my mind, I can tell you that with absolutely NO doubt . As for others, well if you're trying to save people then you should find a new strategy. What you and Ez did to jj and how you constantly berated him seems to have driven him in the opposite direction hasn't it. Peace...emoticon_xagree\n\n \n Regarding the bolded, let me correct your assessment of my opinion of ALL atheists. One of the finest and most morally correct men I have ever known was a committed atheist who believed because no eternal soul existed, all life was precious here and now no matter how simple the organism. \n \n My arguments with him had nothing at all to do with the quality of his life in the here and now though, I made it clear that I wished that every human being on earth had his love for and respect for all life as he does. But as long as he could admit to and agree that according to the bible, if he has sinned even one time in life according to Gods standard of perfection, then he could never make it to heaven on his own merits as a sinner and fallen man.\n \n So we agreed to disagree on Gods existence but even he agreed that if I am right and God truly does exist, then he is in big trouble because he wasted a complete life attempting to futilely be a perfect man when no such pinnacle of perfection is possible for Man since we can never reach Gods level of perfect holiness which is why Jesus had to come and die for us as propitiation for our sins.\n \n So once again I must repeat that I don't condemn anyone or assume that you are all evil people with no redeeming qualities at all. It is just that no matter how good you are, you fall into the same trap as any unbelieving person in that you are still lost at the end of your life if I am right about who my God is as a personal loving Father who created us for fellowship and died for our sins as the perfect lamb of God.\n \n As redundant as you think this oft repeated sentiment is by me, the day will come when you will repeat it to yourself as you condemn yourself for not believing it when it could have changed your eternal condition.",

And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD. He said, \"If you give me victory over the Ammonites, I will give to the LORD the first thing coming out of my house to greet me when I return in triumph. I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.\" \n \n \"So Jephthah led his army against the Ammonites, and the LORD gave him victory. He thoroughly defeated the Ammonites from Aroer to an area near Minnith - twenty towns - and as far away as Abel-keramim. Thus Israel subdued the Ammonites. When Jephthah returned home to Mizpah, his daughter - his only child - ran out to meet him, playing on a tambourine and dancing for joy. When he saw her, he tore his clothes in anguish. \"My daughter!\" he cried out. \"My heart is breaking! What a tragedy that you came out to greet me. For I have made a vow to the LORD and cannot take it back.\" And she said, \"Father, you have made a promise to the LORD. You must do to me what you have promised, for the LORD has given you a great victory over your enemies, the Ammonites. But first let me go up and roam in the hills and weep with my friends for two months, because I will die a virgin.\" \"You may go,\" Jephthah said. And he let her go away for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never have children. When she returned home, her father kept his vow, and she died a virgin. So it has become a custom in Israel for young Israelite women to go away for four days each year to lament the fate of Jephthah's daughter.\" (Judges 11:29-40 NLT)\n \n \n Commands Burning Humans\n \n [The Lord speaking] \"The one who has stolen what was set apart for destruction will himself be burned with fire, along with everything he has, for he has broken the covenant of the LORD and has done a horrible thing in Israel.\" (Joshua 7:15 NLT)\n \n \n Josiah and Human Sacrifice\n \n At the LORD's command, a man of God from Judah went to Bethel, and he arrived there just as Jeroboam was approaching the altar to offer a sacrifice. Then at the LORD's command, he shouted, \"O altar, altar! This is what the LORD says: A child named Josiah will be born into the dynasty of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests from the pagan shrines who come here to burn incense, and human bones will be burned on you.\" (1 Kings 13:1-2 NLT)\n \n He [Josiah] executed the priests of the pagan shrines on their own altars, and he burned human bones on the altars to desecrate them. Finally, he returned to Jerusalem. King Josiah then issued this order to all the people: \"You must celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in the Book of the Covenant.\" There had not been a Passover celebration like that since the time when the judges ruled in Israel, throughout all the years of the kings of Israel and Judah. This Passover was celebrated to the LORD in Jerusalem during the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign. Josiah also exterminated the mediums and psychics, the household gods, and every other kind of idol worship, both in Jerusalem and throughout the land of Judah. He did this in obedience to all the laws written in the scroll that Hilkiah the priest had found in the LORD's Temple. Never before had there been a king like Josiah, who turned to the LORD with all his heart and soul and strength, obeying all the laws of Moses. And there has never been a king like him since. (2 Kings 23:20-25 NLT)\n \n Human Sacrifice\n \n Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed, because God tried them and found them worthy of himself. As gold in the furnace, he proved them, and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself. In the time of their visitation they shall shine, and shall dart about as sparks through stubble; (Wisdom 3:5-7 NAB The Book of The Wisdom of Solomon is mostly in Catholic versions of the Bible.)\n \n \n Child Sacrifice\n \n And this became a hidden trap for mankind, because men, in bondage to misfortune or to royal authority, bestowed on objects of stone or wood the name that ought not to be shared. Afterward it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of God, but they live in great strife due to ignorance, and they call such great evils peace. For whether they kill children in their initiations, or celebrate secret mysteries, or hold frenzied revels with strange customs... (Wisdom 14:21-23 RSV) The Book of The Wisdom of Solomon is mostly in Catholic versions of the Bible. This passage condemns human sacrifice but acknowledges that it did happen by early God worshipers.\n \n \n \n Humans are Fuel for Fire\n \n As for you, son of man, prophesy: Thus says the Lord GOD against the Ammonites and their insults: A sword, a sword is drawn for slaughter, burnished to consume and to flash lightning, because you planned with false visions and lying divinations to lay it on the necks of depraved and wicked men whose day has come when their crimes are at an end. Return it to its sheath! In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you. I will pour out my indignation upon you, breathing my fiery wrath upon you, I will hand you over to ravaging men, artisans of destruction. You shall be fuel for the fire, your blood shall flow throughout the land. You shall not be remembered, for I, the LORD, have spoken. (Ezekiel 21:33-37 NAB)\n \n \n \n Burn Nonbelievers\n \n \"Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods. In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock. Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it. Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God. That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt. Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you. He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors. \"The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him.\" (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)\n \n \n \n \n \n So the next time some Christian tells you about the \"love of God\", show them this page and ask them \"Why does God want me to burn animals and humans?\"\n \n Kill People Who Don't Listen to Priests\n \n Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death. Such evil must be purged from Israel. (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)\n \n \n \n Kill Witches\n \n You should not let a sorceress live. (Exodus 22:17 NAB)\n \n \n \n Kill Homosexuals\n \"If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives.\" (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)\n \n \n \n Kill Fortunetellers\n \n A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death. (Leviticus 20:27 NAB)\n \n \n \n Death for Hitting Dad\n \n Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death. (Exodus 21:15 NAB)\n \n \n \n Death for Cursing Parents\n \n 1) If one curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out at the coming of darkness. (Proverbs 20:20 NAB)\n \n 2) All who curse their father or mother must be put to death. They are guilty of a capital offense. (Leviticus 20:9 NLT)\n \n \n \n Death for Adultery\n \n If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death. (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)\n \n \n \n Death for Fornication\n \n A priest's daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death. (Leviticus 21:9 NAB)\n \n \n \n Death to Followers of Other Religions\n \n Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed. (Exodus 22:19 NAB)\n \n \n \n Kill Nonbelievers\n \n They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB)\n \n \n \n Kill False Prophets\n \n If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, \"You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.\" When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through. (Zechariah 13:3 NAB)\n \n \n \n Kill the Entire Town if One Person Worships Another God\n \n Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods. In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock. Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it. Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God. That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt. Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you. He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors. \"The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him.\" (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)\n \n \n \n Kill Women Who Are Not Virgins On Their Wedding Night\n \n But if this charge is true (that she wasn't a virgin on her wedding night), and evidence of the girls virginity is not found, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father's house. Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst. (Deuteronomy 22:20-21 NAB)\n \n \n \n Kill Followers of Other Religions.\n \n 1) If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or you intimate friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: do not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, but kill him. Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you. You shall stone him to death, because he sought to lead you astray from the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery. And all Israel, hearing of this, shall fear and never do such evil as this in your midst. (Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB)\n \n \n \n 2) Suppose a man or woman among you, in one of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, has done evil in the sight of the LORD your God and has violated the covenant by serving other gods or by worshiping the sun, the moon, or any of the forces of heaven, which I have strictly forbidden. When you hear about it, investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, then that man or woman must be taken to the gates of the town and stoned to death. (Deuteronomy 17:2-5 NLT)\n \n \n \n Death for Blasphemy\n \n One day a man who had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father got into a fight with one of the Israelite men. During the fight, this son of an Israelite woman blasphemed the LORD's name. So the man was brought to Moses for judgment. His mother's name was Shelomith. She was the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan. They put the man in custody until the LORD's will in the matter should become clear. Then the LORD said to Moses, \"Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and tell all those who heard him to lay their hands on his head. Then let the entire community stone him to death. Say to the people of Israel: Those who blaspheme God will suffer the consequences of their guilt and be punished. Anyone who blasphemes the LORD's name must be stoned to death by the whole community of Israel. Any Israelite or foreigner among you who blasphemes the LORD's name will surely die. (Leviticus 24:10-16 NLT)\n \n \n \n Kill False Prophets\n \n 1) Suppose there are prophets among you, or those who have dreams about the future, and they promise you signs or miracles, and the predicted signs or miracles take place. If the prophets then say, 'Come, let us worship the gods of foreign nations,' do not listen to them. The LORD your God is testing you to see if you love him with all your heart and soul. Serve only the LORD your God and fear him alone. Obey his commands, listen to his voice, and cling to him. The false prophets or dreamers who try to lead you astray must be put to death, for they encourage rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of slavery in the land of Egypt. Since they try to keep you from following the LORD your God, you must execute them to remove the evil from among you. (Deuteronomy 13:1-5 NLT)\n \n \n \n 2) But any prophet who claims to give a message from another god or who falsely claims to speak for me must die.' You may wonder, 'How will we know whether the prophecy is from the LORD or not?' If the prophet predicts something in the LORD's name and it does not happen, the LORD did not give the message. That prophet has spoken on his own and need not be feared. (Deuteronomy 18:20-22 NLT)\n \n \n \n Infidels and Gays Should Die\n \n So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies. Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies. So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever. Amen. That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other. And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly deserved. When they refused to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their evil minds and let them do things that should never be done. Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, fighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip. They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They are forever inventing new ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents. They refuse to understand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving. They are fully aware of God's death penalty for those who do these things, yet they go right ahead and do them anyway. And, worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too. (Romans 1:24-32 NLT)\n \n \n \n Kill Anyone who Approaches the Tabernacle\n \n For the LORD had said to Moses, 'Exempt the tribe of Levi from the census; do not include them when you count the rest of the Israelites. You must put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, along with its furnishings and equipment. They must carry the Tabernacle and its equipment as you travel, and they must care for it and camp around it. Whenever the Tabernacle is moved, the Levites will take it down and set it up again. Anyone else who goes too near the Tabernacle will be executed.' (Numbers 1:48-51 NLT)\n \n \n \n Kill People for Working on the Sabbath\n \n The LORD then gave these further instructions to Moses: 'Tell the people of Israel to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you forever. It helps you to remember that I am the LORD, who makes you holy. Yes, keep the Sabbath day, for it is holy. Anyone who desecrates it must die; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community. Work six days only, but the seventh day must be a day of total rest. I repeat: Because the LORD considers it a holy day, anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death.' (Exodus 31:12-15 NLT)\n \n \n \n \n \n 2) God's Murders for Stupid Reasons:\n \n \n \n Kill Brats\n \n From there Elisha went up to Bethel. While he was on his way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him. \"Go up baldhead,\" they shouted, \"go up baldhead!\" The prophet turned and saw them, and he cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two shebears came out of the woods and tore forty two of the children to pieces. (2 Kings 2:23-24 NAB)\n \n \n \n God Kills the Curious \n \n And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah, he smote of the people seventy men, `and' fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter. And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us? (1Samuel 6:19-20 ASV)\n \n \n \n Killed by a Lion\n \n Meanwhile, the LORD instructed one of the group of prophets to say to another man, \"Strike me!\" But the man refused to strike the prophet. Then the prophet told him, \"Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, a lion will kill you as soon as you leave me.\" And sure enough, when he had gone, a lion attacked and killed him. (1 Kings 20:35-36 NLT)\n \n \n \n Killing the Good Samaritan\n \n The ark of God was placed on a new cart and taken away from the house of Abinadab on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab guided the cart, with Ahio walking before it, while David and all the Israelites made merry before the Lord with all their strength, with singing and with citharas, harps, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.\n \n When they came to the threshing floor of Nodan, Uzzah reached out his hand to the ark of God to steady it, for the oxen were making it tip. But the Lord was angry with Uzzah; God struck him on that spot, and he died there before God. (2 Samuel 6:3-7 NAB)\n \n \n \n \n \n 3) Murdering Children\n \n \n \n Kill Sons of Sinners\n \n Make ready to slaughter his sons for the guilt of their fathers; Lest they rise and posses the earth, and fill the breadth of the world with tyrants. (Isaiah 14:21 NAB)\n \n \n \n God Will Kill Children\n \n The glory of Israel will fly away like a bird, for your children will die at birth or perish in the womb or never even be conceived. Even if your children do survive to grow up, I will take them from you. It will be a terrible day when I turn away and leave you alone. I have watched Israel become as beautiful and pleasant as Tyre. But now Israel will bring out her children to be slaughtered.\" O LORD, what should I request for your people? I will ask for wombs that don't give birth and breasts that give no milk. The LORD says, \"All their wickedness began at Gilgal; there I began to hate them. I will drive them from my land because of their evil actions. I will love them no more because all their leaders are rebels. The people of Israel are stricken. Their roots are dried up; they will bear no more fruit. And if they give birth, I will slaughter their beloved children.\" (Hosea 9:11-16 NLT)\n \n \n \n Kill Men, Women, and Children\n \n \"Then I heard the LORD say to the other men, \"Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked. Show no mercy; have no pity! Kill them all - old and young, girls and women and little children. But do not touch anyone with the mark. Begin your task right here at the Temple.\" So they began by killing the seventy leaders. \"Defile the Temple!\" the LORD commanded. \"Fill its courtyards with the bodies of those you kill! Go!\" So they went throughout the city and did as they were told.\" (Ezekiel 9:5-7 NLT)\n \n \n \n God Kills all the First Born of Egypt\n \n And at midnight the LORD killed all the firstborn sons in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn son of the captive in the dungeon. Even the firstborn of their livestock were killed. Pharaoh and his officials and all the people of Egypt woke up during the night, and loud wailing was heard throughout the land of Egypt. There was not a single house where someone had not died. (Exodus 12:29-30 NLT)\n \n \n \n Kill Old Men and Young Women\n \n \"You are my battle-ax and sword,\" says the LORD. \"With you I will shatter nations and destroy many kingdoms. With you I will shatter armies, destroying the horse and rider, the chariot and charioteer. With you I will shatter men and women, old people and children, young men and maidens. With you I will shatter shepherds and flocks, farmers and oxen, captains and rulers. \"As you watch, I will repay Babylon and the people of Babylonia for all the wrong they have done to my people in Jerusalem,\" says the LORD. \"Look, O mighty mountain, destroyer of the earth! I am your enemy,\" says the LORD. \"I will raise my fist against you, to roll you down from the heights. When I am finished, you will be nothing but a heap of rubble. You will be desolate forever. Even your stones will never again be used for building. You will be completely wiped out,\" says the LORD. (Jeremiah 51:20-26)\n \n (Note that after God promises the Israelites a victory against Babylon, the Israelites actually get their butts kicked by them in the next chapter. So much for an all-knowing and all-powerful God.)\n \n \n \n God Will Kill the Children of Sinners\n \n If even then you remain hostile toward me and refuse to obey, I will inflict you with seven more disasters for your sins. I will release wild animals that will kill your children and destroy your cattle, so your numbers will dwindle and your roads will be deserted. (Leviticus 26:21-22 NLT)\n \n \n \n More Rape and Baby Killing\n \n Anyone who is captured will be run through with a sword. Their little children will be dashed to death right before their eyes. Their homes will be sacked and their wives raped by the attacking hordes. For I will stir up the Medes against Babylon, and no amount of silver or gold will buy them off. The attacking armies will shoot down the young people with arrows. They will have no mercy on helpless babies and will show no compassion for the children. (Isaiah 13:15-18 NLT)\n \n \n \n \n \n 4) Miscellaneous Murders\n \n \n \n More of Samson's Murders\n \n (The Lord saves Sampson from standing trial for 30 murders and arson by allowing him to kill 1000 more men.) When he reached Lehi, and the Philistines came shouting to meet him, the spirit of the Lord came upon him: the ropes around his arms become as flax that is consumed by fire and the bonds melted away from his hands. Near him was the fresh jawbone of an XXX; he reached out, grasped it, and with it killed a thousand men. (Judges 15:14-15 NAB)\n \n \n \n Peter Kills Two People\n \n There was also a man named Ananias who, with his wife, Sapphira, sold some property. He brought part of the money to the apostles, but he claimed it was the full amount. His wife had agreed to this deception. Then Peter said, \"Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart? You lied to the Holy Spirit, and you kept some of the money for yourself. The property was yours to sell or not sell, as you wished. And after selling it, the money was yours to give away. How could you do a thing like this? You weren't lying to us but to God.\" As soon as Ananias heard these words, he fell to the floor and died. Everyone who heard about it was terrified. Then some young men wrapped him in a sheet and took him out and buried him. About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. Peter asked her, \"Was this the price you and your husband received for your land?\" \"Yes,\" she replied, \"that was the price.\" And Peter said, \"How could the two of you even think of doing a thing like this - conspiring together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Just outside that door are the young men who buried your husband, and they will carry you out, too.\" Instantly, she fell to the floor and died. When the young men came in and saw that she was dead, they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. Great fear gripped the entire church and all others who heard what had happened. (Acts 5:1-11 NLT)\n \n \n \n Mass Murder\n \n This is what the Lord of hosts has to say: 'I will punish what Amalek did to Israel when he barred his way as he was coming up from Egypt. Go, now, attack Amalek, and deal with him and all that he has under the ban. Do not spare him, but kill men and women, children and infants, oxen and sheep, camels and asses.' (1 Samuel 15:2-3 NAB)\n \n \n \n You Have to Kill\n \n Cursed be he who does the Lords work remissly, cursed he who holds back his sword from blood. (Jeremiah 48:10 NAB)\n \n \n \n The Danites Kill the Next Town\n \n But the territory of the Danites was too small for them; so the Danites marched up and attacked Leshem, which they captured and put to the sword. Once they had taken possession of Lesham, they renamed the settlement after their ancestor Dan. (Joshua 19:47 NAB)\n \n \n \n God Kills Some More\n \n Then the LORD said to me, \"Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me pleading for these people, I wouldn't help them. Away with them! Get them out of my sight! And if they say to you, 'But where can we go?' tell them, 'This is what the LORD says: Those who are destined for death, to death; those who are destined for war, to war; those who are destined for famine, to famine; those who are destined for captivity, to captivity.' \"I will send four kinds of destroyers against them,\" says the LORD. \"I will send the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, the vultures to devour, and the wild animals to finish up what is left. Because of the wicked things Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem, I will make my people an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.\" (Jeremiah 15:1-4 NLT)\n \n \n \n God Promises More Killing \n \n I will make Mount Seir utterly desolate, killing off all who try to escape and any who return. I will fill your mountains with the dead. Your hills, your valleys, and your streams will be filled with people slaughtered by the sword. I will make you desolate forever. Your cities will never be rebuilt. Then you will know that I am the LORD. (Ezekiel 35:7-9 NLT)\n \n \n \n The Angel of Death\n \n My angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites; and I will wipe them out. (Exodus 23:23 NAB)\n \n \n \n Destruction of Ai\n \n Then the LORD said to Joshua, \"Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take the entire army and attack Ai, for I have given to you the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land. You will destroy them as you destroyed Jericho and its king. But this time you may keep the captured goods and the cattle for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.\" So Joshua and the army of Israel set out to attack Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand fighting men and sent them out at night with these orders: \"Hide in ambush close behind the city and be ready for action. When our main army attacks, the men of Ai will come out to fight as they did before, and we will run away from them. We will let them chase us until they have all left the city. For they will say, 'The Israelites are running away from us as they did before.' Then you will jump up from your ambush and take possession of the city, for the LORD your God will give it to you. Set the city on fire, as the LORD has commanded. You have your orders.\" So they left that night and lay in ambush between Bethel and the west side of Ai. But Joshua remained among the people in the camp that night. \n \n Early the next morning Joshua roused his men and started toward Ai, accompanied by the leaders of Israel. They camped on the north side of Ai, with a valley between them and the city. That night Joshua sent five thousand men to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. So they stationed the main army north of the city and the ambush west of the city. Joshua himself spent that night in the valley. When the king of Ai saw the Israelites across the valley, he and all his army hurriedly went out early the next morning and attacked the Israelites at a place overlooking the Jordan Valley. But he didn't realize there was an ambush behind the city. Joshua and the Israelite army fled toward the wilderness as though they were badly beaten, and all the men in the city were called out to chase after them. In this way, they were lured away from the city. There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who did not chase after the Israelites, and the city was left wide open. \n \n Then the LORD said to Joshua, \"Point your spear toward Ai, for I will give you the city.\" Joshua did as he was commanded. As soon as Joshua gave the signal, the men in ambush jumped up and poured into the city. They quickly captured it and set it on fire. When the men of Ai looked behind them, smoke from the city was filling the sky, and they had nowhere to go. For the Israelites who had fled in the direction of the wilderness now turned on their pursuers. When Joshua and the other Israelites saw that the ambush had succeeded and that smoke was rising from the city, they turned and attacked the men of Ai. Then the Israelites who were inside the city came out and started killing the enemy from the rear. So the men of Ai were caught in a trap, and all of them died. Not a single person survived or escaped. Only the king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.\n \n When the Israelite army finished killing all the men outside the city, they went back and finished off everyone inside. So the entire population of Ai was wiped out that day - twelve thousand in all. For Joshua kept holding out his spear until everyone who had lived in Ai was completely destroyed. Only the cattle and the treasures of the city were not destroyed, for the Israelites kept these for themselves, as the LORD had commanded Joshua. So Ai became a permanent mound of ruins, desolate to this very day. Joshua hung the king of Ai on a tree and left him there until evening. At sunset the Israelites took down the body and threw it in front of the city gate. They piled a great heap of stones over him that can still be seen today. (Joshua 8:1-29 NLT)\n \n \n \n Killing at Jericho\n \n When the people heard the sound of the horns, they shouted as loud as they could. Suddenly, the walls of Jericho collapsed, and the Israelites charged straight into the city from every side and captured it. They completely destroyed everything in it - men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, donkeys - everything. (Joshua 6:20-21 NLT)\n \n \n \n God Kills an Extended Family\n \n \"You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made other gods and have made me furious with your gold calves. And since you have turned your back on me, I will bring disaster on your dynasty and kill all your sons, slave or free alike. I will burn up your royal dynasty as one burns up trash until it is all gone. I, the LORD, vow that the members of your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by vultures.'\" Then Ahijah said to Jeroboam's wife, \"Go on home, and when you enter the city, the child will die. All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only member of your family who will have a proper burial, for this child is the only good thing that the LORD, the God of Israel, sees in the entire family of Jeroboam. And the LORD will raise up a king over Israel who will destroy the family of Jeroboam. This will happen today, even now! Then the LORD will shake Israel like a reed whipped about in a stream. He will uproot the people of Israel from this good land that he gave their ancestors and will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, for they have angered the LORD by worshiping Asherah poles. He will abandon Israel because Jeroboam sinned and made all of Israel sin along with him.\" (1 Kings 14:9-16 NLT)\n \n \n \n Mass Murder\n \n The men of Israel withdrew through the territory of the Benjaminites, putting to the sword the inhabitants of the city, the livestock, and all they chanced upon. Moreover they destroyed by fire all the cities they came upon. (Judges 20:48 NAB)\n \n \n \n The Angel of Death\n \n That night the angel of the Lord went forth and struck down one hundred and eighty five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. Early the next morning, there they were, all the corpuses of the dead. (2 Kings 19:35 NAB)\n \n \n \n Kill Your Neighbors\n \n (Moses) stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, \"All of you who are on the LORD's side, come over here and join me.\" And all the Levites came. He told them, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Strap on your swords! Go back and forth from one end of the camp to the other, killing even your brothers, friends, and neighbors.\" The Levites obeyed Moses, and about three thousand people died that day. Then Moses told the Levites, \"Today you have been ordained for the service of the LORD, for you obeyed him even though it meant killing your own sons and brothers. Because of this, he will now give you a great blessing.\" (Exodus 32:26-29 NLT)\n \n \n \n Kill the Family of Sinners\n \n And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what thou hast done, hide it not from me. And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done. When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them, and behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.\" [Note that the sin is not looting, but failing to give the loot to the treasury of the Lord.] \"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD. And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor. And Joshua said, why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger: wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of Achor to this day. (Joshua 7:19-26 Webster's Bible)\n \n \n \n Kill Followers of Other Religions\n \n While the Israelites were camped at Acacia, some of the men defiled themselves by sleeping with the local Moabite women. These women invited them to attend sacrifices to their gods, and soon the Israelites were feasting with them and worshiping the gods of Moab. Before long Israel was joining in the worship of Baal of Peor, causing the LORD's anger to blaze against his people. The LORD issued the following command to Moses: \"Seize all the ringleaders and execute them before the LORD in broad daylight, so his fierce anger will turn away from the people of Israel.\" So Moses ordered Israel's judges to execute everyone who had joined in worshiping Baal of Peor. Just then one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman into the camp, right before the eyes of Moses and all the people, as they were weeping at the entrance of the Tabernacle. When Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest saw this, he jumped up and left the assembly. Then he took a spear and rushed after the man into his tent. Phinehas thrust the spear all the way through the man's body and into the woman's stomach. So the plague against the Israelites was stopped, but not before 24,000 people had died. (Numbers 25:1-9 NLT)\n \n \n \n Murder\n \n At the customary time for offering the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet walked up to the altar and prayed, \"O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, prove today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant. Prove that I have done all this at your command. O LORD, answer me! Answer me so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God and that you have brought them back to yourself.\" Immediately the fire of the LORD flashed down from heaven and burned up the young bull, the wood, the stones, and the dust. It even licked up all the water in the ditch! And when the people saw it, they fell on their faces and cried out, \"The LORD is God! The LORD is God!\" Then Elijah commanded, \"Seize all the prophets of Baal. Don't let a single one escape!\" So the people seized them all, and Elijah took them down to the Kishon Valley and killed them there. (1 Kings 18:36-40 NLT)\n \n \n \n Kill All of Babylon\n \n \"Go up, my warriors, against the land of Merathaim and against the people of Pekod. Yes, march against Babylon, the land of rebels, a land that I will judge! Pursue, kill, and completely destroy them, as I have commanded you,\" says the LORD. \"Let the battle cry be heard in the land, a shout of great destruction\". (Jeremiah 50:21-22 NLT)\n \n \n \n Micah Kills a Whole Town \n \n Then, with Micah's idols and his priest, the men of Dan came to the town of Laish, whose people were peaceful and secure. They attacked and killed all the people and burned the town to the ground. There was no one to rescue the residents of the town, for they lived a great distance from Sidon and had no allies nearby. This happened in the valley near Beth-rehob.Then the people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the town and lived there. They renamed the town Dan after their ancestor, Israel's son, but it had originally been called Laish. (Judges 18:27-29 NLT) (Note that God approves of this slaughter in verse 6.)\n \n \n \n Rape In The Bible\n \n \n \n Rape is one of the most heinous crimes imaginable. Yet few people know that the Bible often condones and even approves of rape. How anyone can get their moral guidance from a book that allows rape escapes me. Perhaps they have been lied to about the Bible and carefully detoured around all the nasty stuff in the Bible.\n \n \n \n So grab your Bibles and follow along as I show you all the nasty rapes that your priests and preachers don't want to tell you about. Note that in many places in the Bible there are references to \"taking a wife\". Don't be fooled into thinking that these were voluntary marriages. This first quote clearly shows that murder and force were used to \"take\" these wives. \n \n \n \n 1) Murder, rape, and pillage at Jabesh-gilead (Judges 21:10-24 NLT)\n \n \n \n So they sent twelve thousand warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and children. \"This is what you are to do,\" they said. \"Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a virgin.\" Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.\n \n \n \n The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the little remnant of Benjamin who were living at the rock of Rimmon. Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes, and the four hundred women of Jabesh-gilead who were spared were given to them as wives. But there were not enough women for all of them. The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had left this gap in the tribes of Israel. So the Israelite leaders asked, \"How can we find wives for the few who remain, since all the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead? There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel will not be lost forever. But we cannot give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this will fall under God's curse.\"\n \n \n \n Then they thought of the annual festival of the LORD held in Shiloh, between Lebonah and Bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem. They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives, \"Go and hide in the vineyards. When the women of Shiloh come out for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can take one of them home to be your wife! And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, 'Please be understanding. Let them have your daughters, for we didn't find enough wives for them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not give your daughters in marriage to them.'\" So the men of Benjamin did as they were told. They kidnapped the women who took part in the celebration and carried them off to the land of their own inheritance. Then they rebuilt their towns and lived in them. So the assembly of Israel departed by tribes and families, and they returned to their own homes.\n \n \n \n Obviously these women were repeatedly raped. These sick bastards killed and raped an entire town and then wanted more virgins, so they hid beside the road to kidnap and rape some more. How can anyone see this as anything but evil?\n \n \n \n 2) Murder, rape and pillage of the Midianites (Numbers 31:7-18 NLT)\n \n \n \n They attacked Midian just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed all the men. All five of the Midianite kings - Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba - died in the battle. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their wealth as plunder. They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived. After they had gathered the plunder and captives, both people and animals, they brought them all to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the whole community of Israel, which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho.\n \n \n \n Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people went to meet them outside the camp. But Moses was furious with all the military commanders who had returned from the battle. \"Why have you let all the women live?\" he demanded. \"These are the very ones who followed Balaam's advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the LORD at Mount Peor. They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the LORD's people. Now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man. Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves.\n \n \n \n Clearly Moses and God approves of rape of virgins.\n \n \n \n 3) More Murder Rape and Pillage (Deuteronomy 20:10-14)\n \n \n \n As you approach a town to attack it, first offer its people terms for peace. If they accept your terms and open the gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor. But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must attack the town. When the LORD your God hands it over to you, kill every man in the town. But you may keep for yourselves all the women, children, livestock, and other plunder. You may enjoy the spoils of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you.\n \n \n \n What kind of God approves of murder, rape, and slavery?\n \n \n \n 4) Laws of Rape (Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NLT)\n \n \n \n If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.\n \n \n \n What kind of lunatic would make a rape victim marry her attacker? Answer: God.\n \n 5) Death to the Rape Victim (Deuteronomy 22:23-24 NAB)\n \n If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.\n \n 6) David's Punishment - Polygamy, Rape, Baby Killing, and God's \"Forgiveness\" (2 Samuel 12:11-14 NAB)\n \n \n \n Thus says the Lord: 'I will bring evil upon you out of your own house. I will take your wives [plural] while you live to see it, and will give them to your neighbor. He shall lie with your wives in broad daylight. You have done this deed in secret, but I will bring it about in the presence of all Israel, and with the sun looking down.'\n \n Then David said to Nathan, \"I have sinned against the Lord.\" Nathan answered David: \"The Lord on his part has forgiven your sin: you shall not die. But since you have utterly spurned the Lord by this deed, the child born to you must surely die.\" [The child dies seven days later.]\n \n \n \n This has got to be one of the sickest quotes of the Bible. God himself brings the completely innocent rape victims to the rapist. What kind of pathetic loser would do something so evil? And then he kills a child! This is sick, really sick!\n \n \n \n 7) Rape of Female Captives (Deuteronomy 21:10-14 NAB)\n \n \n \n \"When you go out to war against your enemies and the LORD, your God, delivers them into your hand, so that you take captives, if you see a comely woman among the captives and become so enamored of her that you wish to have her as wife, you may take her home to your house. But before she may live there, she must shave her head and pare her nails and lay aside her captive's garb. After she has mourned her father and mother for a full month, you may have relations with her, and you shall be her husband and she shall be your wife. However, if later on you lose your liking for her, you shall give her her freedom, if she wishes it; but you shall not sell her or enslave her, since she was married to you under compulsion.\"\n \n \n Once again God approves of forcible rape.\n \n \n \n 8) Rape and the Spoils of War (Judges 5:30 NAB)\n \n \n \n They must be dividing the spoils they took: there must be a damsel or two for each man, Spoils of dyed cloth as Sisera's spoil, an ornate shawl or two for me in the spoil. (Judges 5:30 NAB)\n \n \n \n 9) Sex Slaves (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)\n \n \n \n When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter. If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife. If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment. (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)\n \n \n \n 10) God Assists Rape and Plunder (Zechariah 14:1-2 NAB)\n \n \n \n Lo, a day shall come for the Lord when the spoils shall be divided in your midst. And I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem for battle: the city shall be taken, houses plundered, women ravished; half of the city shall go into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be removed from the city. (Zechariah 14:1-2 NAB)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Yes a god of love Archie.... a god of love....",

   "Lets see if they can keep ignoring evidence everyone. The Bible is infallible yes? The Bible commands us as heathens and unworthy people because we are bound and need to be saved right? This is even more laws in order to be worthy in the eyes of the biblical god....\n \n Slavery in the Bible\n \n \n Slavery in the Bible\n \n \n \n Except for murder, slavery has got to be one of the most immoral things a person can do. Yet slavery is rampant throughout the Bible in both the Old and New Testaments. The Bible clearly approves of slavery in many passages, and it goes so far as to tell how to obtain slaves, how hard you can beat them, and when you can have sex with the female slaves.\n \n \n \n Many Jews and Christians will try to ignore the moral problems of slavery by saying that these slaves were actually servants or indentured servants. Many translations of the Bible use the word \"servant\", \"bondservant\", or \"manservant\" instead of \"slave\" to make the Bible seem less immoral than it really is. While many slaves may have worked as household servants, that doesn't mean that they were not slaves who were bought, sold, and treated worse than livestock.\n \n \n \n The following passage shows that slaves are clearly property to be bought and sold like livestock.\n \n \n \n However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way. (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)\n \n \n \n The following passage describes how the Hebrew slaves are to be treated.\n \n \n \n If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years. Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom. If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year. But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him. If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master. But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his master must present him before God. Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will belong to his master forever. (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)\n \n \n \n Notice how they can get a male Hebrew slave to become a permanent slave by keeping his wife and children hostage until he says he wants to become a permanent slave. What kind of family values are these?\n \n \n \n The following passage describes the sickening practice of sex slavery. How can anyone think it is moral to sell your own daughter as a sex slave?\n \n \n \n When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter. If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife. If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment. (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)\n \n \n \n So these are the Bible family values! A man can buy as many sex slaves as he wants as long as he feeds them, clothes them, and screws them!\n \n \n \n What does the Bible say about beating slaves? It says you can beat both male and female slaves with a rod so hard that as long as they don't die right away you are cleared of any wrong doing.\n \n \n \n When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property. (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)\n \n \n \n You would think that Jesus and the New Testament would have a different view of slavery, but slavery is still approved of in the New Testament, as the following passages show.\n \n \n \n Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)\n \n \n \n Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed. If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts. Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them. (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)\n \n \n \n In the following parable, Jesus clearly approves of beating slaves even if they didn't know they were doing anything wrong.\n \n \n \n The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it. \"But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly. Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is given.\" (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)\n \n Jesus Lied\n \n \n \n \n \n Jesus Lied About Prayer\n \n \n \n Jesus is quoted many times in the Bible saying that a believer can ask for anything through prayer and receive it. He even goes so far as to say that mountains and trees can be thrown into the sea simply by praying for it. This is clearly a lie, and can be proven to be a lie by any believer. Simply pray for me to be converted to Christianity right away. Or better yet ask God to move the mountains behind my house. He could make a lot of converts that way. If I'm converted today, I'll post a public apology on my web site and devote my life to kissing God's XXX. If I'm not converted it would only be fair for you to apologize and devote your life to kissing my butt.\n \n \n \n Here are the quotes from Jesus that proves that he lied:\n \n \n \n 1) And Jesus answered and said to them, \"Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, `Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will happen. \"And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.\" (Matthew 21:21-22 NAS)\n \n \n \n 2) Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks, receives; and the one who seeks, finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. (Matthew 7:7-8 NAB)\n \n \n \n 3) Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven. For where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst. (Matthew 18:19-20 NAS)\n \n \n \n 4) Amen, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it shall be done for him. Therefore I tell you, all that you ask for in prayer, believe that you will receive it and it shall be yours. (Mark 11:24-25 NAB)\n \n \n \n 5) And I tell you, ask and you will receive; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks, receives; and the one who seeks, finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. (Luke 11:9-13 NAB)\n \n \n \n 6) And whatever you ask in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything of me in my name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14 NAB)\n \n \n \n 7) If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you. (John 15:7 NAB)\n \n \n \n 8) It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you. (John 15:16 NAB)\n \n \n \n 9) On that day you will not question me about anything. Amen, amen, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you. Until now you have not asked anything in my name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete. (John 16:23-24 NAB)\n \n \n \n A lot of Christians ignore what Jesus actually says in the Bible. They also tend to add things to the actual words to make them say something else. If you honestly and truthfully read these quotes, without adding to them, it is very easy to see that Jesus is not saying that God will think about your prayers. He says God will grant all your prayers. Clearly, God doesn't grant all prayers and this proves that Jesus was a habitual liar.\n \n \n Here is a short and incomplete list of Biblical contradictions which were obtained from postings in internet newsgroups.

   "Here's a little Quote I found for you to Chew on .. Makes perfect sense to me and it comes from a religious man. Of Course according to our resident Zealots even this man must not be \" Really\" religious....\n \n  \"Religion is primarily a search for security and not a search for truth. Religion is what we so often use to bank the fires of our anxiety. That is why religion tends toward becoming excessive, neurotic, controlling and even evil. That is why a religious government is always a cruel government. People need to understand that questioning and doubting are healthy, human activities to be encouraged not to be feared. Certainty is a vice not a virtue. Insecurity is something to be grasped and treasured. A true and healthy religious system will encourage each of these activities. A sick and fearful religious system will seek to remove them.\"\n \n John Shelby Spong, retired bishop of the Episcopal Church",

Seleh...\n\n \n Like that really makes a difference? Even when used in context giving consideration to cultural and language practices of the time there is nothing but a complete unwillingness to accept the fact. \n \n If the Bible was ever the word of God it has been corrupted by man's failure to properly take care of it. To what extent is unknown, but to yet so many are willing to offer up anything as long as it is favorable to the story as a whole while others blindly accept some of the most asinine ideas. \n \n What is pathetic about the whole thing is the publishers edit new words and entire verses in and out every year based on what particular combination sells best. Your bible is a product of human opinion on what it should say. From the formation of The Canon until the most recent publication it has always been subject to people determining what will be printed and what will not.\n \n Why do think Christianity has lost so much credibility? Because people like you sit there and try to tell people the sky is yellow and when the disagree it's because they have not received the Spirit. \n \n Did you ever think that was the Spirit trying to tell your stubborn Azz that something is wrong? Short of God coming down and smacking you with a Bible is there anything that would convince you that at least portions of the Bible have been altered? It doesn't have to be something significant like the ending of Mark it can also be subtle giving emphasis here or there making something specific instead of generalized or vice versa. Or even how the misunderstanding of certain words became tradition like Paul's statements about women in authority. How about the one man one woman concept of marriage that seemed not applicable to almost every significant figure in the OT.\n \n Pull your head out of the sand you know it is possible for God to exist and not one word of the Bible be true.",

   "Religion was created thousands of years before the Biblical account of Creation was even a thought. Historians believe the first actual religion was the worship of the Goddess of Fertility, even before written language existed. In that time religion was spread by word of mouth and changed with each telling from one tribe to another. Generations went by and many religions had come and gone before humans began to form written languages. Christianity , or rather The monotheistic religion that Christianity was based on was borrowed from the land of Egypt, and this is proven through scripture when it's read with open eyes...\n \n Hosea 13:4 Quotes..\n \"Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no savior beside me.\"\n \n Some versions of the Bible translate this differently to attempt to hide the fact that the religion is borrowed from Egyptian myths by changing the word from to Since.. \" Since the land of Egypt. However this would actually be more damaging because this would appear to prove that The \" God\" of the Bible only came into existence after the Hebrews left Egypt. Either way, the Entire religion is based on re-told Fairy tales from Egyptian and Babylonian societies.\n \n Once man began to use written language and began recording these Myths on Paper/scrolls or whatever they were writing on at the time, the religions became much harder to Change by word of mouth. It is believed that this is the reason many religions that existed thousands of years ago did not last . The religions that were recorded in writing were much easier to establish and through the years each religion has been added to as necessary to keep the \" Flock\" in check. \n \n Most religions of Modern day have one thing in common, they suppress free thinking and do not encourage questions concerning their religion. Early Christians would Move into an area and FORCE people to practice their religion with threats of death. \n \n Men created Gods as an answer to the many questions they had about the strange world around them. Human Kind has existed on this planet for at least a couple hundred thousand years. Early man had no need for God or religion. It was only when faced with their own Mortality that they began to seek answers. Modern Humans fear their own Mortality, and the thought that we simply Live and Die is beyond their scope of thinking. So they turn to imaginary Deities to sooth their fragile egos , what better way to live life than to spend it building their afterlife. \n \n Religion sadly will never go away, but One can hope that Man will open his eyes to the truth of what we are and why we are here. Only then will mankind progress into the next age. Only then will the world be at peace . Only then will mankind survive. As long as religion is here I feel it is my Duty as a free thinking Atheist to assert my Atheism and thwart religion every chance I can. For years I've had religion forced down my throat by some self Righteous religious fanatic, and it's time for all Atheists to take a stand against this tyranny.",

   "How is it out of context? Their the EXACT scriptures Archie.\n\n \n The problem with you is you obviously don't understand what \"out of context\" means. And since I already pointed out that historical and cultural context matters in properly interpreting those passages in a theologically correct way, attempting to debate such a lengthy list of examples is a waste of time. Especially since you are beyond seeking an honest understanding of anything spiritual these days. \n \n \n Come on. I knew you'd bury your head in the sand and say such blatant commands were \"interpretation\" or that there is some gray area.\n\n \n They weren't commands, they were laws based on the cultural sins of the day. They were also in force only in Israel to protect her from the social unrest and chaos that existed in the countries around her at the time. Israel avoided diseases, crimes, lawlessness, and injustices that ran rampant in an otherwise lawless ancient world with these legal limitations on its citizens. \n \n But these very real and valid distinctions are lost on you haters of truth and good. You never look past the words themselves in order to look at the actual conditions that existed in the world of that time period. A world with no laws, no civil rights, no local police forces, except for in Israel that is, and no medicines such as antibiotics to defeat an outbreak of diseases which ran rampant in the countries surrounding Israel.\n \n \nIt's the only lame excuse you can give! And one I already predicted. Also you may want to refrain calling me wicked when your god commands you to do wicked acts....\n\n \n It should also be pointed out that these OLD TESTAMENT MORAL LAWS existed in the AGE OF THE LAW rather than in THE AGE OF GRACE which Jesus ushered in, so you are attempting to incorrectly hold the modern church responsible for that which no longer applies in so far as carrying out the punishments called for in these OT moral laws. \n \n Thus, as I said before, you are completely ripping these verses out of context without considering the time and social circumstances that existed when these laws were enforced by the jewish community, not by individuals for personal revenge as your cut and past implies. \n \n For just one quick example since I'm not interested in wasting a lot of time explaining these obvious truths to a reprobate who will reject them anyway, but here's one quote from your C&P.\n The following passage describes how the Hebrew slaves are to be treated.\n \n If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years. Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom. If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year. But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him. If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master. But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his master must present him before God. Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will belong to his master forever. (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)\n \n Notice how they can get a male Hebrew slave to become a permanent slave by keeping his wife and children hostage until he says he wants to become a permanent slave. What kind of family values are these?\n The underlined summation is a typical lie and complete distortion of the truth as it existed in the ancient world. The HISTORICAL FACT is that no other country at that time in history had such fair treatment of slaves as Israel did at all. Laws that required free release of slaves after only 6 years of servitude was unheard of anywhere else in the ancient world. And allowing male slaves to freely marry the woman of their choice, or even supplying them wives was also unheard of everywhere else where slaves were treated purely as property to be owned with no individual rights at all. Also, nowhere else could slaves have children with any expectation of keeping and raising them at all as Israeli slaves enjoyed at that time in history. \n \n The fact is that Jewish owned slaves were treated as extended members of the family and willingly chose to remain with their families for generations since their quality of life was better and more secure than in the outside world. Their housing was supplied as they and their growing families lived independently from their masters in their own homes on the Masters property. They had responsible jobs with pay and no fear or threat of physical abuse from their masters. This treatment existed nowhere else in the ancient world where slaves were treated as property with no civil or human rights at all in those other countries. ONLY ISRAELI SLAVES ENJOYED FAIR TREATMENT AND THE HOPE THAT THEIR SERVITUDE WOULD DEFINITELY END AT A SPECIFIC TIME IN THEIR FUTURE LIVES IF THEY CHOSE TO END IT. The fact is though, many slaves preferred servitude to freedom in such a harsh and lawless world as the ancient world was outside of Israel.\n \n Every single out of context example your cut and paste reveals is equally dishonest when shown in the light of a dark and lawless time in the worlds history, outside of Israel that is. Because these so called unfair and barbaric laws insured that the weak and defenseless received protections in Jewish society, protections that existed in no other countries on earth at the time.",

   "Religion was created thousands of years before the Biblical account of Creation was even a thought. Historians believe the first actual religion was the worship of the Goddess of Fertility, even before written language existed. In that time religion was spread by word of mouth and changed with each telling from one tribe to another. Generations went by and many religions had come and gone before humans began to form written languages. Christianity , or rather The monotheistic religion that Christianity was based on was borrowed from the land of Egypt, and this is proven through scripture when it's read with open eyes...\n\n \n The first evidence of religion comes from the Neanderthal's use of ochre and flowers in burials.\n With Cro-Magnon man you get rock art which is often interpreted as being part of a religious belief system.\n Judaism is believed to be an offshoot of Zoroastrianism which was widespread throughout Persia.",

And many such things you do.\"\n Mark 7:9-13\n \n And here we have Jesus actually CHANGING the laws of his Father.. which he later says cannot be done..lol...\n \n  27 &#8220;You have heard that it was said, &#8216;You shall not commit adultery.28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.\n Matthew 5:27-31\n \n And here he decides to contradict his Father Again and re-define the LAW...\n \n  31 &#8220;It has been said, &#8216;Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.&#8217; 32 But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\n \n Matthew 5:32\n \n Isn't it great.. Using Scripture from the Bible to Fight Scripture in the Bible..lol.. Just proves another point about your Book not being all too consistent....",

   "Slavery was a common and accepted fact of life in the ancient world, but only in Israel did slaves actually have human and civil rights in an otherwise lawless and barbaric world.\n\n \n Your equating Slavery to civil rights Archie.... You are just sugar coating it saying it \"less\" evil to make the facts on you easier to bear... That much is painfully clear here.\n \n \n I realize it is beyond you to appreciate, but it speaks volumes about our God who didn't take away humanities free will by forcing the heathens to abolish something He hated. But He did impose laws upon the practice with the people who recognized His authority as their God.\n\n \n Oh no it is not beyond me quite the opposite. It DOES speak volumes about your god Archie. The black texts clear as day and what they command as law speak volumes upon volumes about the utter dangers of religion.\n \n And you equate slavery, raping pillaging and the like to appeasing god to keep free will??? Are you freaking serious?\n \n Archie... man you really are utterly delusional and your just proving to people here just how deep you've fallen down the rabbit hole.\n \n \nBut you go ahead and rant away all you like about how evil you perceive God to be. \n\n \n First of all I'm not ranting Archie. Maybe in your mind I am because you cannot stand simple evidence screaming at you. I am pointing out the huge amounts of flaws in your argument and the crazy lengths you will go to justify what any normal human being can plainly see as crimes and atrocities in the name of god.\n \n \n \nDon't even consider that Israel was millennia ahead of the REST OF THE ANCIENT WORLD regarding the civil and human rights that the weak and defenseless received going back 4,000 and 5,000 years ago in a lawless and barbaric world.\n\n \n Even if that crazed concept were true it still gives no justification for what they did. And it certainly shows even more how your infallible book is now fallible and that you will pick and choose what sections you will promote and others you will ignore to fit your views.\n \n \n Continue to be ruled by your irrational hatred for what is holy and good as you defend what is evil with every post you write. \n\n \n Archie please... I don't hate the bible. I don't hate your crazy religion. What I do find about it is that it is sad. It is utterly pitiable because I used to be just like you. I used to rationalize every little flaw as it ate away inside me...\n \n Your playing a desperate game trying to persuade yourself this is real or the bible's texts were circumstantial. And instead of being able to prove this you in turn call me a hater, and cry out I am Irrational or I am a hater when all it is is you ignoring simple fact.\n \n \nYou are condemned jj, and you will ultimately learn that you condemned yourself wholly and completely.\n\n \n Again idle threats. You keep feeding yourself this lard of stupidity and it's sad! It's utterly sad and pitiable and it just shows how conflicted you are as a person deep down inside.\n \n \n You will continue to get more angry and bitter against God day by day, but you will never get that God is doing nothing against you to provoke your anger. \n\n \n How am I angry? I am peaceful Archie. There is calm in my life for the first time in years. I do not hate god in any fashion because how can I hate a myth? Your myth.\n \n I don't even hate his followers who are nothing more but sad ignorant hypocrites worthy of the deepest of pity. You pain me as the monster here. When the monster is that book you claim to be infallible eating away at you day by day.\n \n \n \nYou will never grasp that the spirit of rebellion that's growing within you is founded in the enemy of God who has an ever tightening hold on your soul and will be squeezing that hatred out of you like water from a sponge until the day that it kills you and you finally learn the truth of the life you squandered away by hating the very Creator who made you in love in His image for fellowship. \n\n \n Spirit of rebellion? What spirit? Again spirituality Archie. Smoke and Mirrors. You say that I am now possessed by a demon or something and is making me type frothing at the mouth as he scribbles 666 on my forehead?\n \n Archie you will clearly go to ANY length to put it in your mind that everyone else is wrong and you are right. Even to the point to where you claim I am possessed by a demon..... Just wow..\n \n \n \n \nAnd what will haunt you the most when you find yourself in your eternal cell apart from God for eternity will be these very memories and posts that are handing you the keys to the kingdom, the eternal truths and the greatest gift you could receive in this life which you threw away like trash in favor of the very enemy who is frothing at the mouth in his desire to consume your soul over and over in the coming pit. \n\n \n Nothing will haunt me Archie. What actually will haunt me is the experiences I've gone through, the utter time and energy wasted in my life on this struggle. The fact that I almost killed myself over such utter nonsense is infuriating toward myself that yes that part does haunt me.\n \n You keep spouting off something about gifts of life and such when you so called followers of this god, this entity shout out homosexuals are heathens. That your very scriptures say I am to be put to death. How is the hell is this a gift from god Archie???\n \n Oh and nice little \"pit\" there. Easy help you with that one?\n \n \n \n \n You are so depraved at this point that with every day you live you come that much closer to eternal judgement, yet you hate me for trying to warn you away from it.\n\n \n Archie truth be told I don't hate you. Am I frustrated that you are so blind and so utterly ignorant like an ostrich yes. Yes I certainly am. Because how wonderful would it be if you broke free from the bonds of religion!?\n \n How wonderful would it be if you came to the revelations I have through utter experience to come to such absolute peace in my life.\n \n I know you are deep down inside suffering Archie that much is painfully clear here. You are shouting so loud, waving your arms so much saying I am right I am right!!\n \n When actually your crying out for help. Deep down because I HAVE been there you are crying out for someone, anyone to set you free....\n \n \n That is the definition of a reprobate mind jj. That is the state of mind that rules your life. emoticon_cry\n\n \n Archie I am sorry. I am truly utterly sorry that deep down your struggling. You yourself are feeling doubt and guilt flood your mind. I am not a reprobate. And if there is any testament to me as a person it is that I truly love people.\n \n And I see your state of mind as a cry for help. And as one person who stood in the same shoes you did at one time I can tell you it is OK...",

   "The problem with you is you obviously don't understand what \"out of context\" means. And since I already pointed out that historical and cultural context matters in properly interpreting those passages in a theologically correct way, attempting to debate such a lengthy list of examples is a waste of time. Especially since you are beyond seeking an honest understanding of anything spiritual these days. \n \n \n \n They weren't commands, they were laws based on the cultural sins of the day. They were also in force only in Israel to protect her from the social unrest and chaos that existed in the countries around her at the time. Israel avoided diseases, crimes, lawlessness, and injustices that ran rampant in an otherwise lawless ancient world with these legal limitations on its citizens. \n \n But these very real and valid distinctions are lost on you haters of truth and good. You never look past the words themselves in order to look at the actual conditions that existed in the world of that time period. A world with no laws, no civil rights, no local police forces, except for in Israel that is, and no medicines such as antibiotics to defeat an outbreak of diseases which ran rampant in the countries surrounding Israel.\n \n \n \n It should also be pointed out that these OLD TESTAMENT MORAL LAWS existed in the AGE OF THE LAW rather than in THE AGE OF GRACE which Jesus ushered in, so you are attempting to incorrectly hold the modern church responsible for that which no longer applies in so far as carrying out the punishments called for in these OT moral laws. \n \n Thus, as I said before, you are completely ripping these verses out of context without considering the time and social circumstances that existed when these laws were enforced by the jewish community, not by individuals for personal revenge as your cut and past implies. \n \n For just one quick example since I'm not interested in wasting a lot of time explaining these obvious truths to a reprobate who will reject them anyway, but here's one quote from your C&P.\n The following passage describes how the Hebrew slaves are to be treated.\n \n If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years. Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom. If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year. But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him. If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master. But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his master must present him before God. Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will belong to his master forever. (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)\n \n Notice how they can get a male Hebrew slave to become a permanent slave by keeping his wife and children hostage until he says he wants to become a permanent slave. What kind of family values are these?\n The underlined summation is a typical lie and complete distortion of the truth as it existed in the ancient world. The HISTORICAL FACT is that no other country at that time in history had such fair treatment of slaves as Israel did at all. Laws that required free release of slaves after only 6 years of servitude was unheard of anywhere else in the ancient world. And allowing male slaves to freely marry the woman of their choice, or even supplying them wives was also unheard of everywhere else where slaves were treated purely as property to be owned with no individual rights at all. Also, nowhere else could slaves have children with any expectation of keeping and raising them at all as Israeli slaves enjoyed at that time in history. \n \n The fact is that Jewish owned slaves were treated as extended members of the family and willingly chose to remain with their families for generations since their quality of life was better and more secure than in the outside world. Their housing was supplied as they and their growing families lived independently from their masters in their own homes on the Masters property. They had responsible jobs with pay and no fear or threat of physical abuse from their masters. This treatment existed nowhere else in the ancient world where slaves were treated as property with no civil or human rights at all in those other countries. ONLY ISRAELI SLAVES ENJOYED FAIR TREATMENT AND THE HOPE THAT THEIR SERVITUDE WOULD DEFINITELY END AT A SPECIFIC TIME IN THEIR FUTURE LIVES IF THEY CHOSE TO END IT. The fact is though, many slaves preferred servitude to freedom in such a harsh and lawless world as the ancient world was outside of Israel.\n \n Every single out of context example your cut and paste reveals is equally dishonest when shown in the light of a dark and lawless time in the worlds history, outside of Israel that is. Because these so called unfair and barbaric laws insured that the weak and defenseless received protections in Jewish society, protections that existed in no other countries on earth at the time.\n\n \n Wow. So many lies and half truths in one post...\n \n First of all, where do you get that there were no laws outside of Israel? Ever hear of the Code of Hammurabi (an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth)? That was the Babylonian Law around 1700 BCE, before Moses was supposedly born (around 1525 BCE from what I have read). Even ancient Egypt had laws, and that was before 2000 BC. \n \n Now onto the fun topic of slavery:\n \n Exodus 21:20-21 refutes your claim of a slave being like an 'extended family' member. \n \n \"20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.\n \n 21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.\"\n \n Is beating an extended family member to within an inch of their life an acceptable godly practice? It says right there as long as they don't die within 'a day or two,' you won't be punished, because the slave is your money (property). How is that moral?\n \n You are also refuted by your own book in your claims of the 6 years thing. That is only if the slave is Hebrew. If the slave was from anywhere else, that rule didn't apply. \n \n \"2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. \"\n \n The whole notion that historical and cultural context is necessary is ridiculous. This is supposed to be an eternal god, who is all loving and all good and moral. The customs of the times should have no effect. If slavery is wrong, it has always been wrong, and there is no excuse for Yahweh to have supported it in any way, shape or form. Christians are all the time claiming absolute moral truths, but you can't have it both ways. If something is immoral today, it was immoral back then. This is a god advocated stoning an unruly child; surely if he thought slavery was wrong he could have made a law forbidding it. Since when did Yahweh care about other cultures, anyway?\n \n I also think your idea of 'human and civil rights' is horribly barbaric. The only rights that the slaves had in Israel were that they couldn't be murdered (technically, you could murder them as long as they died 'a day or two' after the initial injury, but whatever), and that if they were Hebrew slaves, they had to be released after 6 years (as long as they were okay with abandoning their family). I guess you must think American slavery was just peachy. \n \n And as others have said, the killing of women and children is unjustifiable, no matter what excuses you try to make. So often I hear Christians claim an 'age of accountability,' but in the Old Testament, children are often killed for even the slightest offense (I can already hear the 'Oh, but that's the Old Testament, so it doesn't count' excuses).",

(please excuse any math errors).\n \n Saavy? God SAVES!!\n \n emoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n \nFirst, we must recognize that the Bible does not say God supports slavery. In fact, the slavery described in the Old Testament was quite different from the kind of slavery we think of today - in which people are captured and sold as slaves. According to Old Testament law, anyone caught selling another person into slavery was to be executed:\n\n \n It then goes on to quote Exodus 21:16 (\"He who kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his possession, shall surely be put to death.\")\n \n This is no different than anywhere else. I don't think too many slave holding nations allowed kidnapping or enslaved their own citizens by way of kidnapping. Israel got their slaves mainly from foreign nations that they ransacked (just as the US got theirs from Africa and from Native American tribes). The Hebrew slaves came from selling family into slavery (Exodus 21:7 describes selling daughters into slavery). \n \n \n \n This link has a lot of information on slavery in the New Testament, including how Paul sent an escaped slave back to his owner. It also shows the famous verse that tells slaves to \"obey your earthly masters with respect and fear.\" It also shows that some priests in the New Testament still owned slaves. \n \n What the New Testament says about slavery\n \n Listen, I don't care if Israel/early Christians treated their slaves like royalty (which obviously wasn't the case, since I've even shown the verse detailing how hard you can beat them). It is inherently immoral to enslave another human being. Humans are NOT property. \n \n You can give as many apologist websites as you want describing how Yahweh wanted slaves to be treated well as if that makes it okay. It doesn't change the fact that he allowed humans to be enslaved as the property of others. Whether you think he 'approved' of slavery or not, you have to be able to see that he ALLOWED, REGULATED, and did NOT disapprove this evil deed. Apparently he cared more about circumcision and shellfish than slavery (and I don't want to hear about cleanliness and disease prevention. A simple mention of washing food or washing hands in the bible could have saved millions of lives. Maybe he should have made man with the knowledge of germ theory from the beginning and he would have never had to mention any of it.)\n \n \n I'd just like to ask you if you think that slavery is wrong? I'm not asking about beating slaves; I'm asking if you would agree that the idea of owning another human is wrong. \n \n \n The rest of your post is just hypothetical, rambling nonsense that still doesn't explain why women and children or non-murderers were killed. I also don't see how hell is relevant in your post. Hell saves no one, and no Christian should be happy that anyone would go to hell, no matter how evil. \n \n Also, if God was okay with intervening to kill evil people, why did he make them evil in the first place? And why didn't he kill Hitler or Stalin and physically 'save' all these people in modern times? \n \n You would also think that a merciful god would at least allow a chance for these foreigners to repent and follow Israel instead of just being killed and immediately sent to hell with no chance to be saved (as seemed to be the case in the OT). \n \n I'm also not of the belief that any amount of crimes or evil done in a finite time deserve an infinite punishment (especially a fiery torture).",

   "The problem with you is you obviously don't understand what \"out of context\" means. And since I already pointed out that historical and cultural context matters in properly interpreting those passages in a theologically correct way, attempting to debate such a lengthy list of examples is a waste of time. Especially since you are beyond seeking an honest understanding of anything spiritual these days. \n\n \n And here I say the same thing about you. How do you chastise someone for doing what your doing? And they are not doing it any where near as often or with a purposeful intent to misrepresent the facts.\n \n \nThey weren't commands, they were laws based on the cultural sins of the day. They were also in force only in Israel to protect her from the social unrest and chaos that existed in the countries around her at the time. Israel avoided diseases, crimes, lawlessness, and injustices that ran rampant in an otherwise lawless ancient world with these legal limitations on its citizens. \n\n \n Read your Bible they are referred to as statutes, judgments and commandments.\n \n The rest of the known world was utter lawless chaos? Only Israel disease, crime and injustice free? Where do you get your history from? With the exception of a few wars spread out over a few hundred years, there were several civilized nations that had law and order. Most of the Jewish laws were not unique or first addressed by the Hebrews. \n \n \nBut these very real and valid distinctions are lost on you haters of truth and good. You never look past the words themselves in order to look at the actual conditions that existed in the world of that time period. A world with no laws, no civil rights, no local police forces, except for in Israel that is, and no medicines such as antibiotics to defeat an outbreak of diseases which ran rampant in the countries surrounding Israel.\n\n \n Can you please go to a credible source and do a little research on Ancient civilizations. What is the point of distinctions when you are making them up? \n \n \nIt should also be pointed out that these OLD TESTAMENT MORAL LAWS existed in the AGE OF THE LAW rather than in THE AGE OF GRACE which Jesus ushered in, so you are attempting to incorrectly hold the modern church responsible for that which no longer applies in so far as carrying out the punishments called for in these OT moral laws. \n\n \n This is a blatant misrepresentation. Nowhere is this concept found in the Bible. This is a man made idea to justify and cover up Christians need to separate from Judaism and gain converts by easing the far more restrictive Jewish laws.\n \n \nThus, as I said before, you are completely ripping these verses out of context without considering the time and social circumstances that existed when these laws were enforced by the jewish community, not by individuals for personal revenge as your cut and past implies. \n\n \n May as well your making it up as you go along\n \n \nFor just one quick example since I'm not interested in wasting a lot of time explaining these obvious truths to a reprobate who will reject them anyway, but here's one quote from your C&P.\n\n \n I think it has more to do with you not wanting to get caught\n \n \n \nThe following passage describes how the Hebrew slaves are to be treated.\n \n If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years. Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom. If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year. But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him. If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master. But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his master must present him before God. Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will belong to his master forever. (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)\n\n \n First a Hebrew could not buy another Hebrew. He could take one or more persons as compensation for debts, but since debts are forgiven he couldn't really hold him after that now could he. Foreigners were fair game and there was no requirement to release them. If they had children the kids were slaves that belonged to the Master. Where do you get your information? This is all about bonded Hebrews who would have been considered slaves but got a bunch of perks.\n \n \n \nNotice how they can get a male Hebrew slave to become a permanent slave by keeping his wife and children hostage until he says he wants to become a permanent slave. What kind of family values are these?\n The underlined summation is a typical lie and complete distortion of the truth as it existed in the ancient world. \n\n \n But that is what God says when he outlines how slaves are to be handled. Read your Bible.\n \n \n \nThe HISTORICAL FACT is that no other country at that time in history had such fair treatment of slaves as Israel did at all. Laws that required free release of slaves after only 6 years of servitude was unheard of anywhere else in the ancient world. And allowing male slaves to freely marry the woman of their choice, or even supplying them wives was also unheard of everywhere else where slaves were treated purely as property to be owned with no individual rights at all. Also, nowhere else could slaves have children with any expectation of keeping and raising them at all as Israeli slaves enjoyed at that time in history. \n\n \n You are only partially correct, again you are not giving all the facts.\n \n \nThe fact is that Jewish owned slaves were treated as extended members of the family and willingly chose to remain with their families for generations since their quality of life was better and more secure than in the outside world. \n\n \n Sometimes they were family. Sometimes they had been conquered and had no place else to go. Sometimes they were born into slavery and didn't know anything else\n \n \n \nTheir housing was supplied as they and their growing families lived independently from their masters in their own homes on the Masters property. They had responsible jobs with pay and no fear or threat of physical abuse from their masters. \n\n \n God said Master may beat his slaves and would only be punished if they died that day. The next day and Master was not in any trouble. \n \n \nThis treatment existed nowhere else in the ancient world where slaves were treated as property with no civil or human rights at all in those other countries. ONLY ISRAELI SLAVES ENJOYED FAIR TREATMENT AND THE HOPE THAT THEIR SERVITUDE WOULD DEFINITELY END AT A SPECIFIC TIME IN THEIR FUTURE LIVES IF THEY CHOSE TO END IT. The fact is though, many slaves preferred servitude to freedom in such a harsh and lawless world as the ancient world was outside of Israel.\n\n \n Look at some other sources for information. If you can't find any let me know and I will give you some. \n \n \n \nEvery single out of context example your cut and paste reveals is equally dishonest when shown in the light of a dark and lawless time in the worlds history, outside of Israel that is. Because these so called unfair and barbaric laws insured that the weak and defenseless received protections in Jewish society, protections that existed in no other countries on earth at the time.\n\n \n The worst most inaccurate and intentionally false post I have ever seen.\n \n Why is making stuff up the way to go for Christians?",

And even though Jason has given up on God and now sides with atheism, God still hasn't given up on him yet. As long as life remains, so does hope that he will awaken to the truth. The real question is, if Jason understood the truth at one time as he claims, how does he miss the warning in Romans 1 as posted here?\n God&#8217;s Wrath Against Sinful Humanity\n \n Romans 1:18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 19 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20 For since the creation of the world God&#8217;s invisible qualities&#8212;his eternal power and divine nature&#8212;have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.\n \n 21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.\n \n 24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator&#8212;who is forever praised. Amen.\n \n 26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.\n \n 28 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. 29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31 they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. 32 Although they know God&#8217;s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.",

   "you could start by posting your personal prophecies, in hopes that they dont contradict anyone elses personal religious experiences; people who claim exactly what you claim, that theyve had a personal visit from God himself.\n \n the reason why i scoff off some of the things you say is because the things you say are RIDICULOUS. prove me wrong! show me something i can trust. ive asked a few people for their religious prophecies, and similar ones almost always contradict each other. this shows me that these people have not had a spiritual encounter, but are delusional. i need to see something that i can trust, otherwise you have absolutely nothing. why should i instantly trust that youve had a personal prophecy told to you by God, and take that as evidence for his existence? you lay this massive expectation on very very loose sand and expect me to buy it right away? no. show me.\n \n i await patiently your response.\n\n \n Here's the rub, Ben, and my frustration lies in the fact that I have said this a hundred times on this forum. But my prior post stands in its proposition that no matter what is said by us you will interpret it as contradictory to something else you have been told, so my assertion that no matter what is said will be rejected stands.\n \n Now, here's the real issue which has been oft repeated by me. NO MAN will ever give you acceptable evidence for our invisible Gods existence, or His desire to have a personal relationship with you. Only God Himself can do that and then only if you seek Him with an open and sincere heart. That is the only undeniable evidence for God that will ever break through that hard heart of yours. \n \n Your repeated demand that I prove God to you is a bogus and impossible demand to fulfill, especially when you readily admit that you don't believe He exists at all. You come into it not having an open mind or heart nor a sincere desire to know Him.",

This school of thought is typified by legally trained scholars applying the canons of proof and argument to the defense of Christian belief. Greenleaf's Testimony of the Evangelists set the model for many subsequent works by legal apologists. He is distinguished as one who applied the canons of the ancient document rule to establish the authenticity of the gospel accounts, as well as cross-examination principles in assessing the testimony of those who bore witness to the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. His style of reasoning is reflected in the apologetic works by John Warwick Montgomery, Josh McDowell and Ross Clifford.\n \n \n\n Royal Professor of Law at Harvard University\n\n \n Hogwash.

   "see, if we did as Zorba says, to forget about evidence and just have faith, \n\n \n Perfect example of the \"Zorba\" rule would be one of the most recent atrocities committed by a Modern day World Leader.. George W. Bush.\n \n It has been Documented that George W.Bush only ran for President in the first place because he claimed that \"GOD\" came to him and told him that he should run... \n We all know that the religious far outnumber the sane people in this country, so it was fairly easy for Bush to Convince the majority that he was the right choice to take office after Clinton. People could see the evidence right in front of them that Bush is as dumb as a rock, yet they kept the \" Faith\" and voted him in anyway. Well maybe not , but they got him close enough to steel his way into office.\n \n Fast Forward to 9/11...\n \n Just after we invaded Afghanistan based on Lies from Bush, he decided it was time to take revenge on old Saddam For threatening his daddy. \n The U.N. inspectors reported that there were NO weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq, not only once, but three or four times they told Bush there were no weapons. Anyone with a Brain knows that Saddam and Bin Laden are Mortal enemies, simply based on their different religious views. \n Yet Bush stood before the American People and Convinced them that Saddam was involved in 9/11, and that he had deadly weapons which he planned to use against Americans.\n \n All the evidence to the contrary was tossed aside, and the people kept the faith in Bush that he was right. \n \n Well we all know where that led us. \n \n So yeah, I'm not taking the word of a ancient book written by primitive sheep herders for anything other than what it is..",

   "\n Just after we invaded Afghanistan based on Lies from Bush, \n\n \n <Flush<\n \n What lie was that? Al Qaeda was in Afghanistan. That's where we had to go to kick their butts. Duh.\n \n You know, I really loved that one comment from that Williams guy I once referenced, which went:\n \n \"Their (the liberal's) inability to grasp the obvious leads them into that corner every time and once there, once diplomacy has run its course without results, they are out of business.\" \n \n In other words, \"After the appeasing liberals are done with their seemingly endless, hot-air, wind-jamming sessions at the inept and corrupt U.N. - after clinging desperately to the coat tails of Jacques Chirac and Rosie O'Donnell; after all their sophomoric Jane Fonda and Cindy Sheehan surrender rallies and Neville Chamberlain pseudo-peace ploys; and with the bad guys still refusing to budge one iota - they're done. Finis. Game over. That's all there is from the libs, there isn't any more. Not even a lethal dose of Viagra can possibly get them to stand up now. All that&#8217;s left for them is to go home, wring their hands, and wait for the WMD&#8217;s to come crashing down on their Greenpeace-utopian fantasyland. \n \n I'm also reminded of the John Kerry appeasers, who wouldn't even stand up to Saddam Hussein in the first Gulf War. If they had their way then, Saddam would not only still be raping and murdering people in Kuwait, but probably in Saudi Arabia as well. And, of course, I also recall the appeasement liberals protesting against going to war in Afghanistan to root out the Taliban and Al Queda. They'd still be there too, with their Jihad terrorist camps pumping out new bad guys, had not one courageous President blown them away.",

   "One of my favorite arguments... \"You were never a real Christian or else you'd still be one.\" It makes it easier if you pretend a real Christian can't deconvert.\n\n \n The \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy, plain and simple.\n \n \nIts almost the same argument as the \"God didn't reveal himself to you because you weren't sincere enough\" argument.\n\n \n Only this one makes even less sense. Human sincerity will not cause anything according to the Calvinist theology underlying most Christians as conservative as Archie and Easy. You could sincerely seek God your whole life, but unless he decides to visit you with his grace, you're still screwed. Alternatively, you could be the vilest of criminals your whole life, but if God graces you in your final days, then you will see and understand and be saved. Sincerity ain't worth jack.\n \n I think the only thing capable of motivating people to believe in such a deity, much less to deem him good, is abject cosmological terror.",
