   "Sue Lowden, the front-running Republican challenger to Sen. Harry Reid, yesterday doubled down on her idea that health care could be paid for using the barter system.\n \n Last week, when Lowden suggested \"that bartering is really good,\" it seemed that she may have been talking about haggling prices and just had her vocab mixed up. It happens to everyone....\n \n \"Let's change the system and talk about what the possibilities are. I'm telling you that this works. You know, before we all started having health care, in the olden days, our grandparents, they would bring a chicken to the doctor. They would say I'll paint your house,\" she said. \"[That's] what people would do to get health care with their doctors. Doctors are very sympathetic people.\"\n \n Lowden Doubles Down On Health-Care-By-Barter: 'Bring A Chicken To The Doctor' (VIDEO) | TPMDC\n \n My word! I've been around for a while and I'm from a rural community ... and by golly I don't remember any docs bartering medical care for chickens and such.\n \n Of course, you kinda wonder if Lowden slabbed off all her makeup, maybe she's centuries older than moi and she does remember a time when docs took chickens from their patients to pay their staff and utility bills, not to mention their college loan payments.",
