   " Zionists Pay Back Nader For Anti-Zionist Statements\n \n Ever since Ralph Nader named the Zionists as the string-pullers of US foreign policy, his supposed allies on the far left have done everything in their power to derail his presidential campaign.\n \n On August 1, the Peace and Freedom Party, a conglomerate coalition of aging Jewish Marxoids, rejected Ralph Nader as their presidential nominee, with the majority voting for imprisoned Indian Leonard Peltier! Long ago the Green Party handed their nomination to an unknown, dumping Nader, their standard-bearer in 2000, in the wake of his anti-Zionist comments.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=3458\n \n \n Prominent Jewish Leftist Denounces Nader\n \n A leading leftist Jew, Bill Weinberg, of the ostensibly anti-war World War Three Report has issed a hysterical and profane assault on the former Green Party standard-bearer for Nader's affiliation with unpersons such as Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani.\n \n Weinberg gets to the point when he shrieks \"[Nader] also happily spews the Buchananite Jew-baiting wag-the-dog theory that US foreign policy is secretly controlled from Tel Aviv, decrying the \"congressional and White House puppets to Israeli military policy.\" Ugly stuff indeed.\" We agree. It IS ugly that US foreign policy is Zionist-controlled, and even uglier that the supposed opposition to the war on Iraq is as much a puppet of the Zionists as is the White House.\n \n One thing is for sure: no matter how much the Jews on the left attempt to spin the conflict as a 'war for oil', or sideline dissent into their pet projects, the genie is out of the bottle and millions upon millions of people are waking up to the the real issues.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=3462\n \n \n Related Thread:\n \n Pat Buchanan Interviews Ralph Nader\n \n \n \n .",

As a matter of fact the extreme left, today, has a very strong Anti- Isreal/ Anti-Zionist zeal. Just read some of the posts of Liberals on this board.\n \n The extreme Liberals want to destroy this country. The best way to do that, they figure, is to elect John Kerry. They think Ralph Nader will \"pull votes away\" from Kerry and help elect George Bush.",

   "ADL of B'nai B'rith Disappoves of Nader's Anti-Zionist Comments\n \n \"What he said smacks of bigotry\" -- ADL boss Abraham Foxman\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58007-2004Aug11?language=printer\n \n \n Nader Responds, Challenges Foxman on Israel\n \n Dear Mr. Foxman:\n \n As you know there is far more freedom in the media, in town squares and among citizens, soldiers, elected representatives and academicians in Israel to debate and discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict than there is in the United States. Israelis of all backgrounds have made this point.\n \n Do you agree and if so, what is your explanation for such a difference?\n \n Enclosed is the \"Courage to Refuse - Combatant's Letter\" signed by hundreds of reserve combat officials and soldiers of the Israeli Defense Forces. It is posted on their web at: seruv.org.il/defaulteng.asp . One highlight of their statement needs careful consideration: \"We shall not continue to fight beyond the 1967 borders in order to dominate, expel, starve and humiliate an entire people. We hereby declare that we shall continue serving in the Israel Defense Forces in any mission that serves Israel's defense. The missions of occupation and oppression do not serve this purpose - and we shall take no part in them\" (Emphasis in original). Do you agree with these patriotic, front line soldiers' observation that Israel is dominating, expelling, starving and humiliating an entire people - the Palestinian people - and that in their words \"the Territories are not Israel?\"\n \n Do you share the views in the open letter signed by 400 rabbis, including leaders of some of the largest congregations in our country, sent this March by Rabbis for Human Rights of North America to Ariel Sharon protesting Israel's house-demolition policy?\n \n Full letter:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=3564\n \n \n \n \n .",

   "You support Israel? \n \n Then you are aganist America and her interests. \n \n Israel has sucked billions of American dollars from our economy with virtually nothing to show for it. It has constantly sold US secrets and technology to our polential enemies, even giving them ways to upgrade it aganist the US. It has placed much of the blame of it's own atrocities upon America, earning the US the firey hate of the world for their actions. Many of the terrorists out to kill Americans are doing so because of American support for Israel. We lose money, we lose technological superority, and we are repaid in hate. Israel is a leech upon America that needs to be burned off. \n \n Supporting Israel is detracting from America.",
