   "We're in the process of preparing for a relocation (by choice) and I've been taking a look at local tax structures (state/county) in a couple of Western states by specific counties. The big shocker wasn't so much the taxes, but what they went for and why. The average big economic contribution (jobs) to each county is government, at an average of 22% of all jobs, with retail and maufacturing lagging far behind. That means when you remove retired, wealthy living off of investments, children and other non-employed, almost one of every four employees in an economic sense is some type of government entity employee. And since the federal government is in record expansion mode, that means locals can't be far behind.",
