   "The Trouble with Conservatism\n \n Conservatives are correct, of course, in viewing communism as a serious danger, an evil which should be opposed. But - and this is the essence of the matter - conservatives oppose communism for the wrong reasons. They see it, first and foremost, as a threat to free enterprise: a threat to their bank accounts. What they really hate about communism is that it is collectivist (i.e., that it subordinates the welfare of the individual to the welfare of the community - at least, in theory) and that it is statist (i.e., that it vests ultimate authority in a highly centralized party-government apparatus instead of in more-or-less autonomous local governments).\n \n But if collectivism and statism were the only aspects of communism we had to worry about, I, for one, would welcome it with open arms, as an infinitely superior alternative to the Jew-ridden, minority-coddling, culture-defiling, soul-stifling, filth-wallowing, corruption-breeding, decadence-producing, race-destroying monstrosity of a System which now squats so unwholesomely in the power centers of our nation (and which, of course, is also collectivist and statist, in the worst sense of the words, even if not so forthrightly as the Kremlin).\n \n No, the real evils of communism are that it, like capitalism, is alien to us in origin and essence; and it, also like capitalism, is racially destructive. The doctrine of communism was born in the alien mind of Karl Marx (ne Levi); and it, as a doctrine which interprets history and all social phenomena solely in economic terms, predicates the primacy of gold over blood.\n \n It is true that a perceptive minority of conservatives has awakened to the fact that big capitalism, private monopoly capitalism, is by no means antithetical to communism (state capitalism). They have finally reached a vague understanding, after years of observing the backslapping camaraderie between Western capitalists, like the Rockefellers, and the masters of the Kremlin, that the fundamental values of the two systems have certain similarities - that they are merely variations on the same economic materialist theme.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=3776\n \n \n .",

However, on this one I agree. What is a Republican Administration doing spending money like a drunken sailor? President Ronald Reagan stated in his 1981 Inaugaural address: Government is not the solution to the problem, government is the problem. \n As sad as it is for me to say this, I'm very disappointed in the current admin. Not to say I'd rather have Gore or Kerry, I don't! But I wish the GOP would not espouse this \"neoconservative\" philosophy. We need another Reagan Conservative in office.

By the beginning of 1981, the national debt had fallen to 32.5% of GDP. Then, Reagan took office and the national debt took off. It rose non-stop for 12 years to 66.3% at the end of Bush's term, erasing 25 years of progress in paying down the national debt. The \"better shape\" you speak of was purchased with debt.
