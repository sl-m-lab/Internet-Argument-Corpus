When one looks at losses sustained by Russia, Germany and other European nations, US losses pale in comparison.

Official records on these subjects are misleading, although instructive. According to the Defense Department's annual \"Base Structure Report\" for fiscal year 2003, which itemizes foreign and domestic U.S. military real estate, the Pentagon currently owns or rents 702 overseas bases in about 130 countries and HAS another 6,000 bases in the United States and its territories. Pentagon bureaucrats calculate that it would require at least $113.2 billion to replace just the foreign bases -- surely far too low a figure but still larger than the gross domestic product of most countries -- and an estimated $591,519.8 million to replace all of them. The military high command deploys to our overseas bases some 253,288 uniformed personnel, plus an equal number of dependents and Department of Defense civilian officials, and employs an additional 44,446 locally hired foreigners. The Pentagon claims that these bases contain 44,870 barracks, hangars, hospitals, and other buildings, which it owns, and that it leases 4,844 more.\n \n These numbers, although staggeringly large, do not begin to cover all the actual bases we occupy globally. The 2003 Base Status Report fails to mention, for instance, any garrisons in Kosovo -- even though it is the site of the huge Camp Bondsteel, built in 1999 and maintained ever since by Kellogg, Brown & Root. The Report similarly omits bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Qatar, and Uzbekistan, although the U.S. military has established colossal base structures throughout the so-called arc of instability in the two-and-a-half years since 9/11. \n\n \n He he, they use the word Empirical totally wrong.\n It's IMPERIAL you dumbasses! :)\n \n That settles it, they must be lying. :)",

Isolationism means non-aggression in military affairs; imperialism means aggression in military affairs. So if a nation is not isolationist, then that means it does not follow a non-aggression policy - hence, it is imperialist.\n\n \n Militarism is not the defining nature of Imperialism.\n Sorry. It just isn't. Control is.\n \n By the very nature of imperialism, all nations are imperialistic in one form or another. Most economicly.\n And, if you tie in military to the definition of imperialism, then it means the acquisition of territory by force. Something the US really hasn't done. And, if they are militarily imperialistic, then they sux.\n \n \nImperialism, Noun\n 1. The policy of extending a nation's authority by territorial acquisition or by the establishment of economic and political hegemony over other nations. 2. The system, policies, or practices of such a government.\n\n \n Also, Isolationism doesn't have to be passive. I could be an isolationist who responded militarily to any 'threat' and call it defense.\n So, while I see myself as sitting back minding my own business and responding with force to any 'attack' upon my nation; be it economic, military, social or other wise, you might see my response to the 'intrusion' as aggression or at the very least unjustified. Like is not always responded to with like. If I'm unable to turn your economic dominance aside through the use of economic force, I may resort to useing violence. Heck, it may be my only option to defend myself.\n \n For example, I design a anti-pest virus that also happens to kill off the food supplies the pest feds upon. I also design a fertalizer that protects my food supplies from the virus. I'm prepared to release the virus in a very uncontrolled manner that may spread world wide. I dispise this pest locally because it cause illness in my citizens and I have a duty to my citizens. Being isolationistic, I refuse to deal with other nations so they don't get the fertalizer nor access to the virus. Nor am I interested in an alternative solution to my problems. Just bugger off an leave me alone...or I'll nuke you.\n \n Now, how do you respond. I am not intentionally targeting you with the virus. I'm just being careless (according to you) with my applications. I also don't really care about you. You could fall off the world for all I care.\n Do you view my wreckless behavior as aggression? Do you become the aggressor if you respond militarily to my behavior?\n \n In WWII, was Japan an aggressor? OR, were they responding to agression since they were forced onto the world stage via gun boat diplomacy several decades back.\n Heck, according to Hitler, the poor germans were responding to imperialistic aggression by the Zionists and were forced to take military action due to economic factors forced upon them by external groups. Military action is nothing more than an aspect of political interaction.\n \n I know I'm pretty tired of Frances and Belgiums naked aggression. I'd also like to see various religious organizations brought before the ICC on charges. Vatican city should be stopped in it Imperialistic encroachments of religious hegemony upon the world. Religious control is political control as far as I'm concearned. The EU should be defended against due to their economic imperialism attempts.\n \n \n \nAny nation that is not militarily isolationist is imperialist.\n\n Is simply not a true statement. Thus, it is false.\n A nation that is militarily isolationistic can still be imperialistic in the realms of politics and economics.\n \n A nation is imperialistic if it's practices are imperialistic. Be it militarily, economically, culturally, politically or otherwise. It's all about control.\n \n And with that, the US is merely responding to naked aggression by the rest of the world. Yep, they threw the first stone in my book. The peace loving peoples of America would be quite content to be left alone. But, the world refuses to comply. \n \n I'd like to mention that I was paid, in gold, the sum of $237.00 USD by The MAN to say this. I was offered 200. but, with the rising price of gas, I negotiated in the cost of travel expenses at the inflated levels currently seen in todays market. I blame this increase upon imperialistic forces seeking to economically enslave me. The funds recieved by me coupled with my eco-terrorism training will allow me to take the fight to their shores. Once the flames arise over their petro-pollution storage facilities, they will know I'm not one to be triffled with. Thick black smoke will usher in a newer, cleaner world.\n Now accepting donations to 'International Reduction of Oil, Natural-gas and Yeast.' PM me for donation information.",

Two, democracy may be a better system, but that doesn't mean that everyone in the world is ready for it, I can assure you the Iraqis certainly were not ready for the sudden transition. For the people of the Western world, Democracy has been present in one form or another, but for a lot of the other parts in the world, there hasn't been anything remotely resembling a democracy even on the local government level. Yes it seems like a simple concept to understand, but the difficulty of a democracy does not like in its being understood, but in its execution. If you've never had to shoot a gun before, how well do you think you would do? The basic premises of it are simple, point and shoot. However to shoot accurately, its more complex, and it takes time to learn, than after learning to adapt, then to refine. Often times this process takes a long time.

True, we had some \"possessions\" and we made a state out of Hawaii, but we don't invade and take over countries like those you mentioned.\n\n \n \n I wonder how the native american population feels about this? esp \"We're not marching out taking over countries and claiming them as \"ours\" as the armies you mentioned did.\" American history is full of just such examples.

   "I glanced over the points you made and the most prominent point in my mind is that you feel that democracy is better than authoritarianism, and therefore should replace it. I would like to point out the following, one the attempt to spread democracy has been used before as an excuse to make a nation into something similiar to a colony or otherwise take advantage of a nation. Two, democracy may be a better system, but that doesn't mean that everyone in the world is ready for it, I can assure you the Iraqis certainly were not ready for the sudden transition. For the people of the Western world, Democracy has been present in one form or another, but for a lot of the other parts in the world, there hasn't been anything remotely resembling a democracy even on the local government level. Yes it seems like a simple concept to understand, but the difficulty of a democracy does not like in its being understood, but in its execution. If you've never had to shoot a gun before, how well do you think you would do? The basic premises of it are simple, point and shoot. However to shoot accurately, its more complex, and it takes time to learn, than after learning to adapt, then to refine. Often times this process takes a long time. Three, democracy isn't the only option of government in the world, and nor should it be the only one the world is limited to.\n\n you spread democracy by giving them the opportunity to take it up, work it out, make some mistakes, argue about, settle to issue, and move on to the next issue. ours is not the perfect democracy, why should we expect that of a new democracy?\n and if not democracy, and not authoritarianism, what is the other option?\n please refrain from offering utopia to this troubled world of humans.",

As for meaning, that's up to each listener, some would find meaning in the phone book put to music. Here's a few published country songs that have little meaning:\n 1. I Liked You Better Before I Knew You So Well\n 2. I Still Miss You Baby, But My Aim's Gettin' Better\n 3. I Wouldn't Take Her To A Dog Fight, Cause I'm Afraid She'd Win\n 4. I'll Marry You Tomorrow But Let's Honeymoon Tonight\n 5. I'm So miserable Without You, It's Like Having You Here\n 6. Mama Get A Hammer (There's A Fly On Papa's Head)\n 7. My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink, And I Love Rovers\n 8. Please Bypass this Heart\n 9. She Got The Ring and I Got The Finger\n 10. You're the Reason Our Kids Are So Ugly\n Dono",
