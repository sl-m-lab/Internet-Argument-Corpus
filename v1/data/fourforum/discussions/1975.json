   "Hi,\n I've read an argument from a Jewish person that said that there are no religious relation between Judaism and Christianity. However he also stated the Christianity could not exist without Judaism. That is Judeo-Christian values are only secular, not religious. This sounds contradictory.\n \n \n Can a syllogism be made for this case?\n \n Thanks.",
