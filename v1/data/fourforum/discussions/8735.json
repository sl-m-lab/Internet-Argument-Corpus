In short, this prohibits women from teaching men.\n \n \"I was astonished, absolutely astonished to pick up and read that kind of a letter without being talked to ahead of time about the possibility,\" said Mary Lambert.\n \n The letter Lambert received says, \"A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became sinner.\"\n \n The letter was signed, \"Thank you for your anticipated cooperation. Very truly yours, Kendra LaBouf.\" Kendra is the wife of City Council Member and Pastor Tim LaBouf.\n \n \"I've had a number of calls from people within the church being as astonished at the letter as I was, and the community at large seems to be at various sides that this could happen,\" said Lambert.\n \n \"And she is a woman, and when we women fought for equal rights for a long time, since 1929 hasn't it been? And anytime a pastor, or somebody who's led by god, they should know Christ in their heart,\" said Watertown resident Linda Norquest.\n \n News 10 Now did put in calls to both Tim LaBouf and the church for comment, but those calls were not returned. As for Lambert, she said although she's upset, she's not giving up on her church.\n \n Lambert said she feels there's more to her dismissal than the scriptual qualifications. Last month, Lambert and two others were kicked off the Diaconate Board. They were told they were being removed for attendance issues.\n \n Lambert said things started to slowly change at the church two years ago when LaBouf became the pastor.",

However, if this kind of behavior from the minister continues, and he is not asked to leave, a number of people just might decieded to leave. Maybe not. Maybe the minister will have an epiphany, and back down. Maybe he'll leave. Maybe people will get fed up and leave if all else fails. \n \n It's a shame that this kind of conflict will happen in this day and age. The best word I can think of it is 'STUPID'.\n \n That minister should find a flock in the deep south.",
