A national geographic special is reality TV. A news report is reality TV. \"Reality\" TV is mindless entertainment and a cheap alternative to hiring actors and screen writers. The thing of it is it has a sizeable audience which is why this genre of TV is being fruitful and multiplying. It is very profitable for it's creators and as long as it continues to be we will be stuck with it.",

   "The stupidest show ever:\n \n Forget the name but basically it was a contest where people do stupid things such as eat bugs, other stuff that no one would want to do and stupid people like watching. They were all not American citizens and the winner won not a green card, but a lawyer to try to get them a green card. Not only that but if they were caught (they were on TV) they could get deported back to their own country. Why do people enjoy watching other people suffer, that's the premise of a lot of reality shows. That big fat annoying fiance show the whole premise was that the daughter would have a fiance and the whole good part of it was that he would try to make them suffer.\n \n \n On the topic the geico comercial is funny. It talks about 2 people having to live in a tiny house (6 feet high or something) and it actually sounds real and then it goes into something about car insurance. Pretty funny.",

   "There is in my mind only one reality TV show worth watching and it was only on for one season...Joe Schmo 2. I enjoied it because it was a spoof. I remember some movies a while back. The Truman Show and a movie called Ed TV were two different kinds reality shows put in the movies. I saw the preview to Ed TV and said, \"That guy is on camera 24/7 and he knows about it. That's stupid. Why would any one want to see a show where the person (who is not an actor) knows they are on television?\" Also on this subject, thanks to the huge response from viewers on real(annoying)aty television that's what they started showing on channels MTV and VH1. (MTV is music Television, so where's the music? Oh wait, that's right, VH1 Classic.) Channels like these have to start adding spin-off channels to show what the main station doesn't show anymore. Which would you rather see on MTV; videos for Bowling For Soup or Green Day or U2 (or what ever else is newer) or would you rather see \"Pimp My Ride\" or \"Punked\" (Is that still on?) I use to like to watch Pop-Up Video on VH1. Instead now I wait for I Love the 90's Reduxed and I Love the 80's 3: So Why Don't I Marry The 80's. Okay that's not the real title, I'm joking about that. Ofcourse, those aren't the same as reality TV because they have Actors and Singers giving a commintary that's actually funny, but it seems we are going too much into the reality realm. And that's my take on that. :xbanghead",
