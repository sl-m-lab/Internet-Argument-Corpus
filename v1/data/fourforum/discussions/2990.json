Admittedly, I'm a democrat, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be objective.\n\n \n Thank you. I am a die hard fiscal conservative with a liberal streak when it comes to domestic and social programs (I figure as long as the top 20% of america is screwing the other 80%, they can at least make sure nobody is starving and everybody has a roof over their head).\n \n \nTaxation: The Kerry campaign wishes to repeal the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and use the money to pay for comprehensive health insurance. Approx. 45% of Bush's 1st (2001) tax cut goes to this income bracket, so a repeal here would bring in significant government revenue. The Bush campaign obviously opposes the repeal of one its signature domestic achievements, and still proclaims the virtue of tax cuts as the best method of economic stimulus\n\n \n From the John Kerry web page:\n \n \nCut Middle-Class Taxes To Raise Middle-Class Incomes\n When John Kerry is president, middle-class taxes will go down. Ninety-eight percent of all Americans and 99 percent of American businesses will get a tax cut under the Kerry-Edwards plan. \n \n \n It appears that Kerry would like to repeal the tax cuts (at least partially) for the upper class and then give the middle class more tax cuts. Looking at some of the literature at http://www.johnkerry.com/index.html , it appears that the cut in taxes for the iddle class will pretty much balance out the tax increase for the rich, leaving little or no money for a comprohensive health insurance plan. As far as I am concerned, the tax increases he suggests for the wealth are not enoguh to really make a difference at a personal level, and the tax decreases for the middle class are also not enoguh to make a difference at a personal level, so I see this as a non issue.\n \n As far as the comprehensive health insurance plan, I view this with great skepticism. I think that IF they did manage to get such a measure passed, it would likely be similar to Bush and companies prescription drug plan, an unfunded measure that doesn't really do much to help Americans. \n \n As far as I can tell, Bush and Kerry are basically the same in this issue. They both favor tax cuts, they just differ in who they think should get them. Neither is really proposing radical cuts that are likely to make a huge difference at the individual level.\n \n \n \nForeign Policy: There actually isn't all that much difference here, save multilateral vs. unilateral. Both Kerry and Bush wish to conduct aggressive wars on terror (far more aggressive then say, a Howard Dean might like). The main difference is that Kerry would put considerably more effort into wooing allies and gaining international support. However, Sen. Kerry has specifically DENIED that lack of international support would prevent him from going after clear threat to the US.\n\n \n Yes, they both seem to have the same plan here. I think that Bush's plan was also to woo foreign governments and intel agencies (like the billion dollars promised to turkey in exchange for support in the Iraq war). \n \n \nDomestic Security: Mr. Kerry has made this a centerpiece of his campaign. He's pushed hard for more port security, and has also spoken of the need for greater funding for nuclear/chemical plant security. I am honestly unaware of the Bush administration's positions on this subjects. I have not yet heard a Bush plan on this matter that has gone beyond mere political rhetoric and translated into action. The Bush admin opposed the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, opposed increased funding for Nuclear/Chemical plant security, has dragged his heels on port security, cut funding to Nunn/Lugar (a program to secure loose nuclear material around the world), opposed the creation of the 9/11 commission, and has been ambivilant at best about increased funding for \"first responders.\"\n\n \n The bush administration has provided over 100 billion for domestic security issues, including 19 billion in direct grants to state and local agencies for training first responders and equipping them with better gear. I am on our local volunteer fire department, and we were AMAZED at how fast grant proposals were available and accepted following the 9/11 attacks. Compared to things like the NFA (national fire act, which provides funding to fire departments), the new homeland security money arrived jackrabbit quick.\n \n The biggest differnce I can see in their plans as far as things like port security si a differnce in opinion as to how it should be implemented. Kerry advocates tighter security in the ports. Bush has been a strong advocate for the coast guard stopping ships before they reach the ports. \n \n Bush's stand is available at http://www.georgewbush.com/HomelandSecurity/Brief.aspx\n \n Kerrys can be found at http://www.johnkerry.com/issues/homeland_security/\n \n Again, I am not seeing a huge difference in their ideals here. Both seem to agree that we need first responders who are actually prepared to respond to attacks, tighter border security, hardened targets, etc....\n \n \n \n \nSocial Issues: President Bush opposes Gay Marriage and civil unions, is pro-life, and supports the use and government support of faith-based charities. Mr. Kerry is pro-choice, opposes Gay Marriage but supports civil unions, and opposes government support of faithbased charities.\n\n \n There does seem to be some difference in the social issues category, though bush supporting partial birth abortions to my mind takes him out of the \"pro life\" column. \n \n Bush also supports civil unions\n \n I know nothing about the faith based charities issue, but if you have a link where I could learn more I would be interested in seeing it (if not, no big deal, I can google it).\n \n \nEducation: President Bush is an aggressive supporter of school vouchers (which give federal funding to poor families in underperforming schools to help them pay for private school). His central education achievement was the passage of the No Child Left Behind act, which focuses on increased testing to enhance school accountabilty, and more choices for students in perinially failing schools. Mr. Kerry has attacked the President for perinially underfunding NCLB, and has forwarded his own plan to give major bonuses and salary increases to teachers who consistently perform above-average in terms of student passage/success rates on standardized tests. (more on that here, here and here.\n\n \n This is an issue that is near and dear to my heart (I am on the local school board) and I can honestly say that after talking to teachers, consultants, and administrators, none of these plans is going to work. The NCLB plan is an utter failure. It has led to large spending increases, bickering and infighting in the schools, and has not yet ensured that no child has been left behind. \n \n As far as Kerrys plan for raises/bonuses to teachers, I don't think that is worth a damn either. I have seen several studies that show pretty conclusively that teacher pay has little or nothing to do with student performance. As far as I am concerned, teachers who are not giving it 100%, regardless of pay, should be fired. If you are hired to do a job and agree to do that job to the best of your abilities for a given salary, you need to DO the job FOR that salary, not whine and complain that you aren't making enough money and therefore are not bothering to do the job. \n \n I have my own plan in this area. Last year, a high school student here graduated, and I happen to know the kid is illiterate. The teachers passed him year after year becuase it was easier to pass him on and make him somebody elses problem. My idea is to fire every teacher this kid has had since the 6th grade, since they obvioulsy are not doing their job. There is no way that this kid should have been able to pass ANY class if he can't even read a stop sign.\n \n While the two canidates views on this are different, they are both dumb and neither deserves consideration.\n \n \nFree Trade: Both candidates are in favor of free trade. Mr. Kerry has spoken of \"benedict arnold\" corporations who outsource american jobs to foreign nations, though what action he'd take against them is unclear.\n\n \n Ditto on bush.\n \n Thanks for the info. I am still not sure there is enough difference between the canidates to actually run a race, but there are some small differences I was previously unaware of. \n \n I would still rather have clinton (who I didn't like,m but at least we had entertaining news to watch) or Reagan (and yes, I know he is dead, I would STILL rather have him) than either of these two wankers running the country.\n \n It is amazing to me how low the election process in this country has sunken. When bush Sr ran against clinton, most democrats that I know were not particularly impressed with Clinton, but there was an \"Anybody but Bush\" mentality. Perot came along, split the republican party, and Clinton took the election. Most republicans I know were not especially impressed with Dole, but still voted fro him under an \"anybody but clinton\" mentality. Now, we are seeing another \"Anybody but Bush\" election. \n \n Are we really so pathetic a society that we cannot run two good guys against each other? It seems that in years past, there were a lot fo win/win elections, where whoever was elected was likely to do a good job, there were simply questions about minor policy differences. Now we seem to be running a loose, loose election. The conservatives I knwo are mostly not really impressed with Bush, and most of the liberals I have spoken to are not really impressed with Kerry. It seems that we are in a lose/lose election. Neither of these guys is likely to really be good for the country, we are being forced to try to ferret out the lesser of two evils.",

   "You're certainly not going to get an argument from me about both candidates being lame :). However, a few things need to be said.\n \n I honestly think Kerry's plan for tax cuts for the middle class is political cover to prevent him being labeled a tax hiker. As I said, 45% of the 1st Bush tax cut went to the wealthiest Americans, so repealing that gives us a spare $607.5 billion (.45 x 1.35 trillion, I know some of that money has already been spent, but that dollar figure assumes that the cuts are going to sunset, which everyone knows Republicans will never let happen, so it balances out). Is that enough to pay from some middle class cuts and healthcare? I don't know. But it definitely more than \"balances out.\"\n \n Bush did make efforts to bribe foreign governments for their support (failed efforts mostly, look at Turkey!). The defining difference is that Kerry's more general multilateral approach means that we'd be able to call in a favor if it was necessary. The reason that all these countries have adopted an \"oppose the US at everyturn\" mentality is because Bush has consistently rejected numerous global priorities important to other nations (Kyoto, ICC protocol, ABM limits etc). This isn't to pass judgment on any of those treaties (I think the ICC is fatally flawed, for instance). However, the point is that the US hasn't contributed to constructive dialogue on these very important issues, and that has angered the world.\n \n Homeland Security: Glancing over Bush's accomplishments, I was stunned to see how many either are based off of profiling/civil liberties violations (USA PATRIOT act for example) or are the brainchild of programs he opposed (anything that has \"Department of Homeland Security\" next to it). Frankly, I'm not impressed. This (obviously) overlooks the fact that President Bush has chronically underfunded the very programs he claims are necessary for our security. TNR 8/1/03\n \n[T]he Department of Homeland Security recently asked Congress for permission to cut $104 million from the program that puts federal air marshals on critical flights. As part of this effort, the department already had plans in the works to pull federal marshals from long-haul routes in order to save the expense of putting them up in hotels. It seems the TSA is facing a $900-million budget gap that arose from higher-than-anticipated costs for buying luggage-screening equipment and hiring human screeners. \n \n Now, far be it from me to suggest that someone might have accounted for the occasional unanticipated homeland security cost back when the administration was running around pushing its trillions of dollars in tax cuts. It's all well and good to rail against the excesses of Big Government and congressional pork and irresponsible spending. But surely Karl Rove and Company realized that trying to run a giant, brand spanking new Homeland Security Department really couldn't be done on the cheap--at least, not if they're interested in having more than just a lovely, ineffectual bureaucracy to point to come election time. \n\n \n The New Republic article \"The 9/10 President\" (3/3/03) comes up with a far more damning list of necessary homeland security reforms Bush has opposed since 9/11 (all quotes below are from this article unless otherwise noted). Among them:\n -Computer upgrades for the FBI\n -Improved Security for Ports/Nuclear Plants\n -New Customs Agents for border defense\n All of these were part of a bipartisan proposal by the ranking members of the House appropriation commitee (Obey (D-WI) and Young (R-CA). The total priorities (which included more than what was on this list) cost about $10 billion. Bush threatened a veto if it ever came to the floor of the house. A few weeks later, Republican House Leaders buried it. This was at the end of 2001, just a few months after 9/11.\n More Bush opposition (terrorism insurance):\n \nConsider, for instance, the problem of protecting the private sector--power plants, chemical facilities, trucking, office buildings, you name it. Terrorists, of course, have not limited their attacks to government property--the World Trade Center was attacked twice. A Brookings Institution study suggested that some combination of mandatory safety standards and terrorism insurance would give the private sector the needed impetus to impose basic protections. The administration, though, has done nothing--literally nothing--to require this. (And, therefore, as The Washington Post reported this week, \"Most U.S. businesses are electing not to buy terrorism insurance.\")\n\n Chemical Security:\n \n Just in case the consciences of chemical-plant owners proved insufficiently reliable to entrust with public safety, Senator Jon Corzine sponsored a bill toughening security standards at chemical plants. Last summer, the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works approved it by a 19-to-zero vote. But...the chemical industry lobbied Republicans to turn against the bill, and the White House stood by while they killed it. As a result, the chemical industry remains a ripe target. Last year, an investigation of 60 chemical plants by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review found a pattern of lax security, including problems at four plants in Houston and Chicago that could endanger more than one million people each. A July article in the New York Daily News revealed that at the Matheson Tri-Gas facility in East Rutherford, New Jersey--where a chemical release could endanger up to 7.3 million people--there was virtually no security at all: Gates were left open, tanks were exposed, and no security personnel were present on site. \n\n chemical plant security is a HUGE concern(TNR 1/21/03)\n \n Next to nuclear facilities, chemical plants pose the greatest danger in the case of a terrorist attack. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified 123 facilities where an attack could injure or kill more than one million people and 750 other facilities where more than 100,000 people would be threatened. A refinery near Philadelphia, for instance, has 400,000 pounds of hydrogen fluoride on hand, which, if released into the air, can cause blindness; kidney, liver, or lung damage; and even death. Terrorists know this. In the spring of 2001, a pilot landed a single-engine Cessna at the airport at Copperhill, Tennessee, and asked a local businessman what type of chemicals were stored at the nearby Boliden Intertrade chemical plant. After September 11, the businessman recognized the pilot as Mohammed Atta. \n\n Nuclear Security\n \n More dangerous even than the prospect of a chemical attack is the potential for terrorists to capture, or set off, a nuclear weapon. The risk sufficiently alarmed Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham--a conservative Bush appointee--that he requested $379.7 million to protect various Energy Department facilities where nuclear weapons are designed, manufactured, and stockpiled. On March 14, 2002, Abraham wrote to Daniels pleading his case. \"[W]e are storing vast amounts of materials that remain highly volatile and subject to unthinkable consequences if placed in the wrong hands,\" Abraham implored. \"[T]he Department now is unable to meet the next round of critical security mission requirements. ... Failure to support these urgent security requirements is a risk that would be unwise.\" \n \n Apparently this warning failed to move the White House, which approved just $26.4 million for Energy Department security--7 percent of Abraham's request. The list of improvements Bush declined to fund included more secure barriers and fences, computer improvements to defend against hackers, equipment to detect explosives in packages and vehicles entering department sites, and a reduction in the overall number of sites that store bomb-grade plutonium and uranium.\n\n Loose Nuke Containment\n [/quote] Nor is the administration's disregard for safety against nuclear terrorism limited to our own shores. The disintegration of the former Soviet Union left behind a landscape littered with unemployed nuclear scientists and poorly guarded weapons facilities. Because of this, the $1 billion the United States devotes to locking down unsecured nuclear material and scientists in Russia and elsewhere is perhaps the most cost-effective money in the entire federal budget. But it is still not nearly enough. In order to airlift enriched uranium out of Serbia last summer--a needed safety measure by any reasonable calculation-- the administration was forced to rely upon private donations. A bipartisan Energy Department study in January 2001 urged raising the budget for such programs to $3 billion--still less than 0.15 percent of the federal budget. Bush, by contrast, last year proposed to cut overseas nuclear security funding by 5 percent and this year proposes less than $100 million of additional funds. [/quote]\n Bioterror Response\n \n Bush's stinginess extends even to his own signature initiatives. Last December, the White House unveiled plans to vaccinate 500,000 health care workers against smallpox so they could safely treat a terrorist-induced outbreak. The administration set a 30-day deadline to complete the job, but, after a month, only 4,200--less than 1 percent--have taken the vaccine. One reason for the low take-up rate is potential side effects: For every one million people inoculated, an estimated 15 or more will suffer blindness, swelling of the brain, or other severe reactions. This has made health care workers particularly reluctant because most of them lack proper insurance to cover the risk of disability or lost wages from such side effects. Hospitals, doctors, and unions have asked the administration to create a compensation fund to cover such contingencies--a notion members of Congress in both parties support. But the administration has refused, with the result that few health care workers have been inoculated. This means that, in the event of a terrorist smallpox attack, many may have second thoughts about treating the victims. Imagine you're an uninoculated nurse, and there's a smallpox attack causing hundreds of patients to be rushed to your hospital. Do you care for them--or flee to your home and get out the duct tape? \n\n First Responders:\n \nIn his many photo-ops with police officers and firefighters, President Bush has also promised $3.5 billion in new funding for \"first responders.\" Everyone who studies homeland security agrees that firefighters and police officers need better training, protective gear, and communications equipment when they rush to the scene of a terrorist attack. (On September 11, 2001, police helicopters saw that the South World Trade Center Tower had collapsed but could not warn the firefighters in the remaining tower because their radio frequencies are not compatible.) But, in fact, Bush only provides $800 million in new money--he merely shifts the other $2.7 billion from other, existing grants to police and firefighters. As Congressional Quarterly reported last month, \"The fact is, according to the administration's own budget documents, the Bush plan for funding first responders amounts to double-entry bookkeeping: changes in the ledger that would result in no net increase in the amount of federal funding flowing to cities, counties, and states.\" \n\n Now it seems like your personal experience belies this. I'm very glad to hear that, as I'd greatly prefer for America to be safer and me to lose a few debaters points than the reverse. However, this has been reported on amply by the media, (especially the shortchanging of big cities), and I fear that at best there is a mix of aid and footdragging, and at worst your experience is an anomoly.\n Port Security\n \n Or consider port security. Ninety-five percent of America's imports get here via sea. Of the containers that make their way through our ports, though, only one in 50 is ever searched. As Stephen Flynn, a former Coast Guard commander who directed the Council on Foreign Relations' homeland security report, told a TV interviewer last month, \"We have virtually no security there.\" The Coast Guard has estimated it would cost $1 billion immediately and another $4.5 billion over the next nine years to make domestic ports sufficiently secure. But, since September 11, they've received just $318 million. One program, the Container Security Initiative, which would screen cargo at foreign ports, was specifically endorsed by Bush last June. \"The Customs Service,\" he told an audience in Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, \"is working with overseas ports and shippers to improve its knowledge of container shipments, assessing risk so that we have a better feel of who we ought to look at, what we ought to worry about.\" And yet Bush's budget provides not one new penny of funding for the program. \n\n INS/Border Security\n \nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), to cite one more example, has just 14 agents to track down 1,200 illegal immigrants from countries where Al Qaeda has been active. \"They just have nowhere near enough people,\" James Kallstrom, a former assistant director for the FBI and current security adviser to New York Governor George Pataki, told The New York Times last May. \"They need a geometric increase.\" INS requested $52 million to hire more agents but was turned down by Bush.\n\n Misc. Funding\n \nSince Obey's meeting with the White House in 2001, Democrats have kept trying to bolster homeland security spending, and Bush has kept stymieing them. Last summer, Congress overwhelmingly approved a $5.1 billion spending bill, half of which consisted of desperately needed homeland security funding. Bush theatrically declared a pocket veto. \"I understand their position. And today, they're going to learn mine. We'll spend none of it,\" he announced at his economic forum in Waco, Texas, where the handpicked crowd burst into applause. Later, in the fall of 2002, the Senate and the House couldn't agree on how to meet Bush's spending limits and left town before the elections without appropriating any new funding for homeland security. Denied funds they had been counting on, the Energy Department, Customs Service, and other frontline fighters against terrorism had to freeze planned improvements. The administration actually celebrated this development. \"There's a new sheriff in town, and he's dedicated to fiscal discipline,\" crowed White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer last October.\n\n The list goes on and on, and represents why I am an ABB voter. I agree with you that being in that position is generally bad for American politics. But I cannot FATHOM why Bush would oppose these measures, aside from using them later as political clubs to bash democrats with (eg, the dept. of homeland security and Max Cleland).\n \n Woo...ok calm down. Moving to social issues. Bush opposes partial-birth abortion (and signed the bill banning it into law earlier this year). He also opposes Civil Unions (the language of the Federal Marriage Amendment, which he endorsed, almost certainly would prohibit civil unions).\n \n Education: I'm skeptical of the studies you cite (at least in terms of their applicabilty to the Kerry proposal) and am a bit more optimistic about its ability to work for several reasons. First of all, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think those studies reverse the causation of the Kerry plan. IE, they first raised teacher salaries, and then checked to see if student achivement rose with it (and it didnt). The Kerry proposal does the reverse: It first measures achivement, and then it hands out bonuses to teachers who do well. The difference is that the second situation gives incentive, while the first doesn't, and that's a significant difference. Second of all, even with salary increases, a teacher's salary is one of the lowest that is given for an occupation that generally requires graduate work. I think its simply ethical to give these hardworking professionals more money. You're problem with teachers who simply pass students without checking to see if they're actually learning is legitimate, theoretically a mixture of carrot and stick would be the best to help motivate teachers. However, as I'm sure you're aware (serving on the BOE), the teacher's union makes the \"stick\" part all but impossible. So we might as well work with the carrot.\n \n Finally, the best I could come up with for faithbased charities is this very poor CBS issue brief [URL=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/19/eveningnews/main630504.shtml[/URL]\n I get most of my info from The New Republic (incredible magazine, everyone should subscribe), but most of its articles are subscription only so I can't link to them.\n \n Hope this helps!",
