Speaking of these senseless, I mean sensible gun laws, when does the taking stop? \n \n I mean considering that this is the Constitution we are talking about. \n \n So far, we have the   22,000 and 30,000 gun laws already on the books.  Now we hear that The Special Interest Anti-2nd Amendment groups now require even more of our Constitution. What are they currently pushing? I think the list is a semi auto gun bans, the ability to sue gun dealers out of business, closing the Phony, non existent gun show loophole, and singin says we need storage laws and jail homeowners if they have not discovered their firearm has been stolen by a specific set time, and a 50 caliber ban. \n \n Lets say we give you all of this, will that enough to satisfy the lust for the destruction of part of our Constitution that drives these Anti-Constitutional Special Interest groups?
