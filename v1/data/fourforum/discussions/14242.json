   "Christian conservatives target seated judges\n \n By JULIE WATSON - AP\n updated 2:10 p.m. CT, Sun., May 30, 2010\n \n SAN DIEGO - A group of conservative attorneys say they are on a mission from God to unseat four California judges in a rare challenge that is turning a traditionally snooze-button election into what both sides call a battle for the integrity of U.S. courts.\n \n Vowing to be God's ambassadors on the bench, the four San Diego Superior Court candidates are backed by pastors, gun enthusiasts, and opponents of abortion and same-sex marriages.\n \n \"We believe our country is under assault and needs Christian values,\" said Craig Candelore, a family law attorney who is one of the group's candidates. \"Unfortunately, God has called upon us to do this only with the judiciary.\"\n \n The challenge is unheard of in California, one of 33 states to directly elect judges. Critics say the campaign is aimed at packing the courts with judges who adhere to the religious right's moral agenda and threatens both the impartiality of the court system and the separation of church and state.\n \n More in the link.\n \n Christian conservatives target seated judges - Politics- msnbc.com\n \n What was that from the AP report - threatens the \"impartiality\" of the court system? The radical, liberal courts in California are \"impartial\"? LOL!! Kick their liberal butts off the bench. Obama and the liberals are ruining America.",
