   "The general answer is yes, the specific answer is no.\n \n Science is a system used to narrow down answers to questions about the universe. It is pretty much the opposite of faith. However, most people today don't really understand what it means to do science. Real science is counter-intutive for humans, and it takes great effort and care to do ti properly.\n \n Scientists often stay off track, that is why other scientists are so critical of each others work. It is an attempt to keep everyone focused.\n \n Science based method: narrow down possible answers with complete confidence. The best working theory is only \"correct\" to a certain resolution or threshold, past which predictions should not be made. This means that you can never really know the \"perfect\" truth with science, but you can get PRETTY DAM CLOSE. Advances are made by disproving competing ideas to narrow down the possibilities.\n \n Most of our \"theories\" are really only generalizations that work under specific conditions.\n \n Here is the best example: Newtons theory of Gravity. Works fantastic for everyday objects. Good enough to launch objects into orbit, predict motion of plants, moon etc.\n \n But, at a certain point you have to admit that is it really just an approximation. It was right, but only up to a point, beyond which you have to use General Relativity to make accurate predictions.\n \n But, General Relativity has its own limit of use... beyond which we have to use something else... something that we currently don't know about...\n \n So, think about the scientific approach to truth like ripping a piece of paper. You start with a blank sheet open to all possibilities, but through careful testing you can narrow the answer down to a small area of the sheet, by ripping away the false parts (disproving competing ideas). Eventually you have a tiny scrap that you know contains the truth, but you really don't have the exact truth since the sheet still has a small finite size. You may continue to rip away pieces by disproving the false parts forever... you may never actually have the perfect truth just like 0.9999999~ is never really = 1, but it is close enough to generalize it to 1. That tiny scrap always has a threshold (size) beyond which is a small unknown area.\n \n So, no technically you can never find perfect truth with science, but you can narrow it down to whatever threshold you want given enough work and time.\n \n You want a black and white answer, unfortunately, the universe is not black and white.",

Treating women like second-class citizens is bad according to our and many other cultures, but to some fundamental religious cultures, is not only acceptable but the correct thing to do. When you look into another culture and say they are doing something wrong, it is your culture - that you are unconsciously seeing things through - that has you make that judgment call. Relative to your culture's values, what they are doing is wrong. But it works the other way around too. When others look into OUR general US culture and say that we are doing something wrong - like selling pornography - they are seeing our actions through their culture and judging them relative to that.\n \n Here's a bit from a book I am reading. The author goes into much more detail than this, but even this much should be useful.\n \n \n\"Relativism is rejected usually for one or both of two reasons - that it advocates an 'anything goes, all things are equal' attitide or that it abandons 'absolute' morality or truth. The first charge is wrong, but the second is right. Relativism does noy maintain that 'anything goes' but merely reports that this goes here and that goes there. It does not say everything is acceptable or everything is good; in fact, 'everything is good' is a value judgment too. Rather, it instructs us that every judgment of value and morality is made from some point of view. If someone asks, 'Is polygamy good?\" the only possible sensible answer is 'According to whom?'\n (Natural Atheism, David Eller, American Atheist Press, 2004, p109)\n\n \n \n\"Relativism has been criticized, and mischaracterized, but as we recently saw in essenece it is a simple and unimpeachable idea: vaules, morals, and beliefs are relative to a particular social context, to a particular society, such that what is moral in one society may be immoral in another.

   "As for morality, you are both right and wrong. Relativism leaves no room for absolutes, but it accepts something else: choice.\n \n Let us take the classic prohibition of killing and stealing. In our current meta society, killing humans is prohibited except in certain circumstances, and so is stealing things that belong to humans. \n \n However, from a point of absolutes, this is inconsistent. Killing an animal is as such not prohibited (when it is, it is in other contexts, usually because it belongs either to some other human or there are regulations about how humans are to go about killing animals), because we don't grant animals the status of a person before the law. Vegetarians and vegans feel differently, and feel the majority is acting immorally.\n \n But even these do not maintain complete honesty. What about plants? All heterotrophic organisms either kill other lifeforms, or at least steal from them. I'm sure carrots would have very firm views about vegetarianism if it had a brain capable of considering this.\n \n \n \n Relativism is best explained when one observes nature. Predators kill their prey, herbivores devour plants, but no one is inherently evil because of it. A wolf killing and eating a rabbit is evil from the point of the rabbit, but good from the vievpoint of the flies who will lay their eggs in the remains.\n \n What about the animals? They simply act in their own interest. If they do moralize, it's simply: I am good. \"Wolf will eat me, thus evil.\" \"Bunny beat me in spring when we fought over who will mate with Fluffy, thus evil.\" \"Farmer places wire fence around the cabbages, thus evil.\" \"Farmer throws rotting but edible cabbages away that I can eat, thus good.\" More likely though, they don't think in these terms, but rather think in terms of \"resource\" and \"danger\".\n \n \n \n However, this is not where relativism stops. This is just the world description. Relativism does not exclude decisions but rather relies upon them. Under relativism, murder is not considered an act of evil, but rather it observes that a choice has been made by humans that killing other humans be prohibited. It may then also observe that this is good from the viewpoint of humans, but neutral to non-humans.\n \n It must be noted, however, that relativism does not force you to look from other viewpoints. It does not mean that choices can be disregarded. It does not mean that some choices can be observed as counterproductive. It can observe that going around killing makes others avoid you, generates extra opponents and is detrimental to the growth of your species and thus a bad choice from your own viewpoint.\n \n You can even enter god into the relativism. Except that relativism would observe that you have the choice of either behaving according to the deity's wishes or facing that deity's wrath, without describing the deity as good or as bad.",

You may, however, consider the issue of growing pears or buying pears in regard to invested work and resources.\n Animals' viewpoint is a bit more complex, but unless a specific pear in the claws of a hungry bear is the object of the analysis, the result is an analysis of how stron a fence you'd need to grow a pear.\n Other humans' viewpoints get real complex. Some may have taboos about pear eating, and according to their expected reactions you decide whether or not you cang et away with eating pears. The owners of pears viewpoint is usually that of one pear grower (who is interested in growing a pear to sell and may demand the value of a ripe pear for an immature pear), pear seller (who is interested in selling the pear in exchange for its price) or a hungry guy who just bought a pear (and is really looking forward to eating the pear and no bloody idiot is going to take it away from him, no, he's not selling it, let'em buy their own pears, thank you very much). It will generally depend on how much money you have and what odds there are you can get away with stealing it, and other circumstances, which include inhibitions implanted into you by the society.

But, the new theory \"General Relativity\" still generalizes to Newtonian Mechanics under constrained conditions... conditions we experience every day, the same conditions that Newton designed the original theory to work under.\n \n So, the old theories are not really \"falsified\", as they are shown to be generalizations that only work within a certain domain/set of conditions. Advances usually involve a new theory that passes all the tests the old ones did, as well as new tests that the old one failed to pass.\n \n Most people just want the \"truth\" plain and simple... they don't like approximations that work only under certain conditions. But that is their conceptual problem.\n\n Science must always leave room for doubt in order to advance: no scientific understanding whatever exists in which all doubt is obiliterated, making it immune to disproof .",

Also, it goes against aggressive \"might is right\" behaviour, which is good as people are then stimulated to cooperate, and that is our main strenght.

   "Ok here's another question.\n \n Here's a quote from Wikipedia: Scientific method \n \nScientific methods or processes are considered fundamental to the scientific investigation and acquisition of new knowledge based upon physical evidence by scientific communities. Scientists use observations and reasoning to develop technologies and propose explanations for natural phenomena in the form of hypotheses. Predictions from these hypotheses are tested by experiment and further technologies developed. Any hypothesis which is cogent enough to make predictions can then be tested reproducibly in this way. Once it has been established that a hypothesis is sound (by use of the above methods), it becomes a theory. Sometimes scientific development takes place differently with a theory first being developed gaining support on the basis of its logic and principles.\n\n Generally we believe that science should be consistent with logical principles. \n Here's another quote from Wikipedia:\n \nScience refers to either:\n \n * Reasoned investigation or study of nature, aimed at finding out the truth. Such an investigation is normally felt to be necessarily methodical, or according to scientific method - a process for evaluating empirical knowledge;\n\n The object of science is nature. But scientific method is based (or is in cosistence with) logic (as well as math), which being a part of philosophy, is abstract. Even though logic is coherent, it can not be found in nature because it is not physical. Task of logic is to distinguish good and bad arguments. But in a possible world without physical matter or energy, and without presence of any kind of mind activity, logic would not be able to exist as it would have no object. \n How then can science base itself on anything of not material nature? \n Can science exist in a universe with no presence of mind? If not, then science is not essential in describing the universe.",
