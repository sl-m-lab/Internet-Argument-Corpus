   "I think none of that was an establishment of religion. If you think it is which religion was established, and when was this particular religion passed and endorsed by Congress? \n \n I think folks confuse an acknowledgment of God (which the Founding Fathers did often in government) with an establishment of religion.\n\n Who said religion was established by these acts? All I said was that Congress passed laws showing a preference for religious belief. \n \n Consider the Pledge of Allegiance. Prior to an act of Congress, the Pledge of Allegiance was secular in that it showed no preference or respect for any religious belief. The addition of the words \"under God\" is a specific endorsement for theist belief and a preference for a religious establishment. \n \n Would it be OK for Congress to pass any laws that favor any religion over another? Say for instance that Congress changed the words \"under God\" to \"with Christ\", effectively endorsing Christianity over Judaism or Islam? This would be \"respecting an establishment of religion\" as opposed to \"establishing a religion\". Christianity is already a religious establishment in the same way that your bank is a business establishment. \n \n A secular government shows no preference for any of the existing religious establishments because doing so is effectively an endorsement. By using an act of Congress to add the words \"under God\" to the official state pledge, the government endorsed a preference for a belief in a deity and that is not a secular act. \n \n It is also important to remember why this was done. In 1954, after a campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Knights of Columbus, Congress amended the pledge to include the words under God, to distinguish the U.S. from the officially atheist Soviet Union. In doing so Congress made a law that respects an establishment of religion, theism.",

   "Old Allah must be schizophrenic in real life then not to know Jesus is divine and the only way of salvation (John 14:6, Acts, 4:12, etc.). \n \n Someone posted the following some time ago for more on this general subject:\n \n Mohammed v. Jesus\n \n Mohammed's Tomb: OCCUPIED! Christ's tomb: EMPTY!\n \n Islam must be received, or you can be killed for rejecting it:\n \n The Faith offered by Jesus Christ is for \"whosoever will\" to receive, and all men are permitted to reject it. (Revelation 22:17, John 3:16).\n \n Those who leave Islam are killed in most Islamic nations; Those who leave the true Church of Jesus Christ are allowed to do so with no revenge.\n\n To compare Jesus with Mohammedto see who is (supposedly) better is like comparing Fred Flinstone to George Jetson. It cannot be viewed that way.:) \n \n If you read about the history of the life of Mohhammed then you will realize why mohammed is more harsh than Jesus. He was born in a time where the middle east was torn apart. Different tribes roamed all around the dessert and they all hated each other. The only way for Mohommed to spread the word of allah was to unite all of the middle east. It was utterly neccissary and so he was harsh in having people convert for that reason. Yet when they were all united and everything settled the middle east was one of the most prosperous places in the whole world. The reason why he was a coonquerer was that he couldnt freely walk around all of europe and the middle east spreading the word of allah. Unlike Jesus who, during the time of the romans, could walk around the whole known world because he was under the protection (for most of his life) of the greatest army the world has ever seen. If mohammed preached about peace and and non violence, his united kingdom under allah would fall and crumble by the enemies that surrounded him. He was thinking about the prosparity of his people...not being a cruel conquerer.\n Just like trying to compare who is better Fred, who is in the stoneage and is much more rugged from it. To george who is always peaceful with all the luxuries of robots and briefcase spaceships. If he looked back into the stone age (and not the movie version but theoretically) he would view their ways as barbaric and strange.\n \n so for some recap: you cannot compare two major prophets who lived in different time periods and even more so if they were in completely different places in the world.\n \n (oh yea about comapring burials...as of my knowing right now we arnt sure where mohammed was buried so for all we know..he could be)",

   "Old Allah must be schizophrenic in real life then not to know Jesus is divine and the only way of salvation (John 14:6, Acts, 4:12, etc.).\nHe was identified as the same God but the scriptures of the Jews and Christians were considered somewhat corrupted and imperfect. The Qu'ran was the final, authoritative revelation \n \n \nSomeone posted the following some time ago for more on this general subject:\n \n Mohammed v. Jesus\nI'm not going to go through all of these, mainly because most of them refer to hearsay, unsubstantiated claims and the actions of people who claim to be Muslim against the claims of perfection for Christ himself. The flaws of Muslims can't be thrown onto Mohammed without blaming Christ for the Inquisition.\n \n One thing though: several focus on the idea that the Qu'ran supports forcible conversion: The Qu'ran (2:256) states: \"There is no compulsion in religion\". This must always be borne in mind. Now a few specifics.\n \n \n Mohammed said to the masses, \"Convert or die!\"; Christ said, \"Believe and live!\" (John 6:47; 11:25-26).\n1) Your sort of Christian say that Christ's exhortation to believe and live means those who do not convert will suffer a fate worse than death. So what's the difference?\n 2) Mohammed did not actually say you had to accept his teaching: virtuous people, particularly 'of the Book', which means at least Jews, Christians and Zorastrians, and could be wider.\n \n \nMohammed said the witness of a woman was half the value of the witness of a man; and Muhammed said a woman goes to Paradise because she satisfies her husband sexually; The Bible teaches that a husband is to love his wife and be willing to die for her. (Ephesians 5:25).\nIslam also teaches that a man should be devoted to his wife, and the Bible teaches women to remain silent in Church and to serve and obey their husbands.\n \n \nMohammed ordered death to the Jews (see A. Guillaume, The Life of Muhammad, Oxford University Press [1975], p. 369); Christ ordered that the gospel be preached \"to the Jew first\" (Romans 1:16).\nMohammed drove out and fought against certain tribes of Jews who allied with the armies of Mecca against him. He accepted the Jews as a whole, and often learnt from them.\n \n \nThe Koran says, \"I will inspire terror into the hearts of unbelievers\" (Qu'ran 8.12); God inspires His terror into the hearts of believers (Isaiah 8:13).\nBoth Allah and God inspire terror into both believer and unbeliever at various points",
