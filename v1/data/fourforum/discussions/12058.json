   "The actual issue in Texas is the wording of the proposed science standards. The draft standards contain language that would require that in teaching the theories of evolution that both the \"strengths and weaknesses\" be taught. There is no indication as to what these weaknesses might be. It is also curious that the Texas standards do not require that the weaknesses of the theories of gravity, electricity, relativity, tectonics, chemical valence, nuclear theory, germ theory or any other field of science be taught.\n \n It is also interesting to note that in an open meeting, the overwhelming majority of speakers opposed the \"weakness\" wording in the standards. After listening to hour after hour of educated opponents, one board member commented that the meeting had been \"unfairly\" loaded with opponents and that supporters of the wording were being somehow excluded. Is he talking about how the creationists conducted their \"open\" meetings in Kansas? Well, that's not how it happened in Texas. In Texas, the meetings were actually publicized and all views were invited. Somehow this is loading the opinion against religion.",

Your implication is that those who respect the supernatural are just ignorant sheeple who lack the brains to care about the world we live in.\n\n I actually agree with AA here. The genuinely disinterested don't give a damn how or why anything is the way it is, and if one craves to be spoon-fed answers as a way to avoid having to think for oneself, science has them in as ready a supply as religion. A career in science, yes, that does mandate an inquisitive, questioning, analytical mindset - but that does not preclude religious beliefs, and one can equally well direct the same energy toward philosophical endeavours.\n \nThe questions are the same for both schools of thought; only the source of the answers differs.

The originator of that idea, as well as being devout, was exceedingly inquisitive and curious - as I said at the time, he deserved to be applauded for trying to make sense of the world in the absence of any kind of education. His translator, on the other hand, exhibited a catastrophically obstinate refusal to think analytically. It's difficult to avoid thinking ill of someone under those circumstances.",
