   "1 ABBA - ABBA from Sweden sold 400 million records and had 9 number ones in the UK. They recorded 110 songs in English 1972-82. Dancing Queen, Take A Chance On Me & The Winner Takes It All are among their hits. All 4 members of ABBA have had successful solo careers: Agnetha Faltskog, Frida Lyngstad, Benny Andersson & Bjorn Ulvaeus. Benny & Bjorn went into musical theatre with Chess & Kristina. Mamma Mia!, based on ABBA songs, is the biggest musical of the century and will be a movie in 2008. \n \n 2 THE GUESS WHO - This Canadian group should be in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. Their string of hits includes These Eyes, American Woman & No Time. The Guess Who proved to be a prolific album band. Lead singer Burton Cummings may have the best voice in rock. Guitarist Randy Bachman founded Bachman-Turner Overdrive and recorded the classic Takin' Care Of Business. \n \n 3 STEPPENWOLF - John Kay and Steppenwolf achieved immortality with their multi-generational anthem Born To Be Wild. They were one of the first heavy metal groups and went on to produce albums of social and political substance. Kay and his mother escaped from Germany after World War II, and his background has played a role in his songwriting.",

   "R.E.M. was inducted. That's kinda weird. Even though I'm not a huge fan, I would say Metallica. And one of my favorite bands, Sublime. Their fusion of reggae and punk rock makes the best sound I've ever heard. Another band is The Misfits, for their innovative and influential music.",
