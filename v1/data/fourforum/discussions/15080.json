Long Island is part of New York state and subject to New York's laws. I was under the impression that the sale, possession, and ownership of \"assault rifles\" and other guns like the Tec-9 were either strictly controlled or outright forbidden. So how exactly did this man come to be in possession of them while in New York territory if they aren't available locally?\n \n Furthermore what are the important details regarding this individual? Did he have any sort of criminal record that would prohibit him from legal gun ownership? Were his weapons properly registered and documented with the state? Did he obey the law and limit his rampage to the state mandated limit of 10 rounds per magazine?\n \n \nThat was the same weapon used in the Columbine mass shooting and the magazine looks like it can hold way too many rounds.\n TEC-9 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n \n Oh I'm so glad you brought up Columbine again Brady. You mentioned it way back in January and I asked you about it but I never did get an answer from you. So this gives me the perfect opportunity to ask you again and hopefully get an answer this time around.\n \n The Columbine High School Massacre, carried out by students Eric Harris and Dylan Kleboid, was carried out in 1999, five years after the enactment of the ban on so-called \"assault weapons\" and \"high capacity ammunition magazines\". And yet you cite Columbine as an example of mass shootings that involve these supposedly prohibited items. Isn't that a contradictory statement you're making? How would Columbine take place if supposedly these \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" were banned during this time?\n \n I think you've just shot yourself in the foot with this one. I see no option other than admitting the law you cite as effective simply wasn't effective at preventing one of the most famous acts of mass murder ever to take place on school grounds. That means a rebuttal from you is going to need to include the fact that you and the VPC lied.\n \n And since we're on the subject of Columbine, let's look at what other weapons were used by Eric Harris and Dylan Kleboid during their killing spree, just so we're comprehensive.\n \n http://www.acolumbinesite.com/weapon.html\n \n Dylan -- Intratec TEC-DC9 (9-mm semi-automatic handgun) attached to a strap slung over his shoulder (under coat), Savage 311-D 12-gauge double-barrel shotgun (barrel sawed down to approximately 23 inches, initially half-hidden in Dylan's cargos).\n \n Eric -- 10-shot Hi-Point model 995 carbine rifle on a strap (under coat), Savage-Springfield 67H 12-gauge pump shotgun he called 'Arlene' (named after a Doom character - initially in one of the duffels carried to the top of the grassy knoll -- stock and barrel sawed off, reducing the entire gun to 26 inches).\n \n Bomb tally:\n 48 -- Carbon Dioxide bombs\n 27 -- Pipe bombs\n 11 -- 1.5 gallon propane bombs\n 7 -- gas or napalm bombs\n 2 -- 20 pound propane bombs\n \n So in addition to Dylan having a weapon and magazines that were supposedly banned and made unavailable, both individuals had sawed off shotguns, a total of 95 bombs between them, and one ten shot rifle that supposedly is unsuitable for instances of what you refer to as mass shootings.\n \n Now with all of this information one has to ask some obvious questions. If the 1994 law was so effective at outlawing \"assault weapons\" and \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" how is it that it wasn't effective enough to keep Dylan from acquiring an Intratec TEC-DC9 pistol? And why exactly did Eric go with a Hi-Point carbine that can only hold 10 round at a time before it has to be reloaded? If Eric Harris felt that such a gun was suitable for their acts of mass killing, what would prevent somebody else from deciding the same? After all 12 people were killed, twice as many dead bodies when compared to the Tuscon shooting.\n \n Furthermore, why was Dylan in possession of a double barreled shotgun? The way the message is sold to us it makes it sound like anything holding ten rounds or less wouldn't be suitable for mass shootings and killings, but he went ahead and used it anyway. Apparently two shots wasn't a hindrance for him in his mission of killing as many classmates as he could.",
