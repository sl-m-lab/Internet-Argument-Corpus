   "I would say agnosticism is logical if you have exhausted the alternatives and truly made an effort to find if God (or gods) exists. Now, while you cannot live even a month in each religion the world has to offer (or even America, good grief) I think you could spend a month or two practicing the more major religions-Judaism, Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism (yes, I'm separating those two), Hinduism and Buddhism. I would say, not only ought you to study each of these, but actually practice them: ie following Jewish dietary laws, fasting in both the Islam and Catholic fashions, prayer in all, and moral guidelines as well. Yeah, a tall order, but if you aren't willing to put in a little time to find out if a God exists (considering that if He does, and you don't find Him, it could be bad for you), then I would say you are a lazy fence sitter! emoticon_wow emoticon_wow \n Make your search for the truth a real quest, not simply a passing hobby.

   "To me, the term atheist means someone who is convinced that there is no God (or gods) - ie the Richard Dawkins types. \n\n \n I would venture to refine that a little further, and propose that an atheist is one who is sufficiently convinced by the absence of evidence.\n \n Moreover, the willingness to change one's mind in the face of new evidence does not make one an agnostic. Consider the alternative: maintaining a belief despite evidence to the contrary is precisely the sort of behaviour that atheism rejects. No: an agnostic is one who judges that he has insufficient evidence to reach a decision. That judgement can, of course, be based on an inadequate understanding of what evidence there is, which brings me to:\n \n \n I would say that agnosticism is the only rational position, based on verifiable evidence.\n\n \n When making that evaluation, one should consider what kinds of evidence it is possible to find in support of or to contradict a hypothesis. \n \n Consider the question: \"Are there any car keys in my kitchen?\", a question I confess to be dear to my heart at this precise moment. Right now you have no information upon which to base an answer. You should rightly be agnostic. But imagine you came to my house and ransacked the kitchen, turning out every drawer, emptying every cupboard, opening all the packets - even the sealed ones - sieving the flour, looking in all the cups and pots and pans, peering (though I don't recommend it) under the fridge, and still found absolutely no sign of any car keys - would you still consider yourself a car-key-kitchen agnostic? \n \n The moral of the story is that the significance of an absence of evidence very much depends upon how much effort one has expended looking for some. It also depends upon the amount of potential evidence that isn't there.\n \n Returning to our original conundrum, there is no conceivable evidence we could ever find that would definitively prove a creator god does not exist, because a creator god, the way we define it, would be eminently capable of concealing his actions. So although there's no evidence that god does not exist, nor could there be, which rather takes the shine off the observation that there isn't any.\n \n On the other hand, we can imagine endless ways in which a god (faith-specific or otherwise) could be proved to exist. In biology, we would just need to find one organism with a unique amino acid, or that had something other than the common four nucleotides, or a non-vascular plant with seeds or flowers - the evidence we could find to disprove common descent is limitless. Yet we don't; Nature's kitchen has been forensically inspected for car keys, and they're nowhere to be found. In geology or astrophysics, we could find consistent evidence of a young earth, yet we don't. We could verify the efficacy of prayer - yet we don't.\n \n In other words, there's an absolute mountain of potential evidence to support the existence of a god (Christian or otherwise) and none of it's there, despite us looking really, really hard.\n \n As you've probably guessed by now, I don't agree that the only rational position is agnosticism.",

   "This whole topic gets muddled, perhaps because of a difference in definitions. \n \n I don't think there is a God. More correctly stated, I can think of no reason at this time why I would consider a belief in God as rational. I could never possibly state emphatically that I am completely certain there is no God, because that could never be proven. But neither could an infinite number of other things be proven not to exist. Thus I can see no possible reason to believe in a God any more than I would in Thor or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. There is no more evidence for these deities than the big Abrahamic kahuna. Does that make me an agnostic? \n \n What is an agnostic then? Big Bear's reference to the Wikipedia article listed 9 subtypes. Isn't that putting too fine a point on things?\n \n PS. Jo B stated that the \"Richard Dawkins type\" of atheist means someone who is convinced that there is no God. I don't think that is correct. I believe his position is that the existence of God seems so unlikely that belief makes no sense. (He \"almost certainly does not exist\" to use his words.)",
