   "This is inspired by the Pepsi VS Coke poll.\n This is a poll for fast food joints.\n Before we begin, this is fun. Yes I know too much fast food is not good for you. Yes I know frechfries are bad. Oh, gosh I know they're bad for you. That said, let me know what would be your fast food place of choice. There should also be a poll. And remember, keep it fun.\n With that...I like Arbey's. I can get a thinly sliced rost beef sandwich or a Market Fresh Chicken Salad Sandwich (both without any greese at all. The meat is not fired.) I also get a fruit punch drink with no caffine, no carbonation, and contains 100% juice (or at least vitamin C) so there. It's possible to eat something healthy. emoticon_xhoho",

There are no chemicals added to any of the fruit.\n\n \n And the fruit is grown without chemicals? We pay a premium for fruit and vegetables grown organically, often a substantial premium depending on season, but taste is far, far superior to most commercial offerings. I'd think logistics and the motivation behind consumption at their facilities will prevent fast food joints from ever becoming icons of healthy eating. \n \n I ate some fast food while working at a regular job, but my wife, probably one of the few Americans who has never eaten at a McDonald's and a superior cook, makes sure there's always something at home denying even consideration of going to a fast food joint for anything other than a deli piled high hot pastrami with swiss on dill rye.",
