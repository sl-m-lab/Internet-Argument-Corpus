   "i believe in natural evolution. i also believe evidence of \"GOD\" is: All that u touch All that u see All that u taste All u feel All that u love All that u hate All u distrust All u save All that u give All that u deal All that u buy, beg, borrow or steal All u create All u destroy All that u do All that u say All that u eat Everyone u meet All that u slight and Everyone u fight All that is now All that is gone All that's to come and Everything under the sun,,,,,,,,,,,Roger Waters 1972 \n \n amino acids have been created during different experiments in the 1900s, which proves to me life could be created by perhaps lighning striking a rock in a shallow pool of prehistoric goop. \n \n how did the lightning and the goop get there? maybe stephen hawking will be able to tell us soon.\n \n for those of u who don't believe in god, you don't have to believe in what organized religion tells u god is, just get comfortable and look up on a clear night.",
