   "An alternate view point is not a lie.\n\n \n \n \n You're right, an alternate view point is not a lie. But hardly anything Michael Moore produces id true. The basis of it is true, but he takes bits and pieces of stuff and puts it together to make things look the way he wants them to, not the way the truly are. He takes everything way out of context. \n \n \n For instance, look at Charlton Heston's piece in Bowling for Columbine. He claims that Heston had the NRA meeting right after Columbine and \"refused\" to change it. In reality, he couldn't change it. It was too close to the meeting. And when he shows Heston in the movie, he cropped some of his words from different speeches and combined them into one (even though the speeches were at different times). He edits the film and has Heston saying \"out of my cold, dead hands\" and portrays it as him saying it right after Columbine, when in reality, he said it in a totally different interview that was months after Columbine, and referred to a gift that was given to him.\n \n \n Moore also tries to tie Bush to Bin Laden. There was a large international investing firm in Texas called Carlyle. Bush had money invested there, and so did the Bin Ladens (who actually had denounced Osama and cut off ties with im). However, Moore seems to think this makes Osama and Bush friends.\n \n \n And Moore said the Saudi Air Force was responsible for 9/11, not Bin Laden. His reasoning is that normal people couldn't fly a plane into a building. And he then accuses the Saudi Air Force of doing it. Isn't that a lie?\n \n \n He also accused Bush of supporting the Taliban. His reasoning is absolutely poor. In the late 1990s, they were trying to build an oil pipeline in the Middle East. There were 2 optionals, the Unocal idea and the Enron idea. Clinton backed the Unocal idea, which would have called for a pipeline to be built through Afghanistan, which would have put more money in the Taliban's wallet. Bush supported the Enron idea, which would have built a pipeline through the Caspian Sea, and wouldn't put more money in the Taliban's pockets. Remember, Clinton was President at the time. But he somehow claims that Bush supported the Unocal deal and supported Bin Laden.\n \n \n Moore also accused Bush of letting Bin Laden's relatives, who were living in the US, to leave the US a day after 9/11 while the rest of the country still couldn't fly. He also said they left without being interrogated by anyone. However, they left weeks after 9/11 and after being screened by the FBI. Another lie.\n \n \n Here are just some of the vile comments and actions Moore has made and done: \n \n He offered a private screening for Bowling for Columbine for those directly effected by the shooting (parents of victims, students who were friends with victims, etc). And he charged them $7 to see this \"special screening\". How pathetic! \n \n A Congressman, Joe Scarborough, in Florida once opposed some of Moore's ideas, and to get back at him, Moore dug for some dirt. He found out that the man's secretary had died in his office. So before even checking to see why she died, he made a website www.joescarboroughkilledhisintern.com. It was later found out that she had a heart attack. When asked why he lied, he simply makes this obscene statement, \"I was just joking. Wasn't it strange that a 28 year old girl who went running regularly should drop dead of a heart condition?\". What a loser.\n \n And when asked about the people on the planes that went down on 9/11, he simply says, \"The passengers were scaredy-cats because they were mostly whites. If the passengers had included black men, those killers, with their puny bodies and unimpressive small knives, would have been crushed by the dudes, who as we all know take no disrespect from anybody.\" \n \n \n \n \nIs it funny?\n \n \n \n \n Is what funny? The book Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man is not funny at all. Unless you think a liar is funny. It flat out shows all the instances where he has lied.\n \n \n \n \nI am reading Moore's book presently and I do want to read the book you mention after. I love FUNNY political writing - either side of the fence. Moore certainly is to the left what Limbaugh is to the right, however Moore is more creative and funnier (than Limbaugh).\n\n \n \n \n So you just read Moore's book. Do you believe what he says in it? I hope not, because it's mostly a lie. It may be funny, but it is all blatant lies that he is using to assassinate people's characters. I think that should be illegal. If it wasn't, then we could make up ads for anybody and put whatever lie we wanted to in there. I could take some of John Kerry's comment, and find a sentence where he used the words Osama Bin Laden, and put those into a speech where he said \"I will do everything I can to help every child\", thus making it say \"I will do everything I can to help Osama Bin Laden\". That is exactly what Moore is doing.",

And what he is saying is that the Bin Ladens left while the rest of the US still wasn't allowed to fly (which had to be between Septmber 11th and September 13th).\n \n In an INTERVIEW in 2002, Moore said, \"Bush said, no you're not to interrogate any of the Bin Ladens. They get a free pass out of the country. 280 million Americans, and the only people who flew on those three days were people named Bin Laden.\"\n \n So those are Moore's assumptions, which he tries to portray as facts. However, he was lying. The Bin Ladens did not leave until September 22. Actually, Moore was lying. They did not fly out on Septmber 13th, they flew out almost 2 weeks after 9/11.
