   "In the abortion forum, GodIsDead and I have been having a pretty good debate. In the course of the debate, he posted a question referring to action and inaction. I responded with a question:\n \n \nIf a person chooses not to do something, isn't this an action? Is there really such thing as \"inaction\"? \n\n \n This was an interesting concept that I would like to explore further and I figured Philosophy was a good place to start a new forum.",

If a person 'appears' to make what 'appears' as a 'choice', isn't this what 'appears' to be an 'action'?\n \n Actually, there Really is no such 'thing' as 'action'! It is illusion, like at the movies.\n \n These 'appearances' are just that; 'illusions', 'appearances', and when 'believed', 'delusions'.\n Neither is there, nor can there be (at the deeper levels of understanding of 'existence') 'choice' of 'action', because neither is there, nor can there be 'action' (doing) and subsequently can be no 'choice' (free-will of what to 'do').\n \n These are 'illusions' of the senses. Once upon a time, the 'senses' were all we had to 'determine the nature of 'existence'. As it turns out, our perceptions were all incorrect and illusory.
