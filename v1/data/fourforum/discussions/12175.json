   "Simone, Hello there...... I do not like Bush either and agree that he has taken this country and economy and flushed it down the crapper, but on that note I do not like Obama either and nor do I think that he is the supposed media implied \"savior\" for this country. That being said, I think this country is headed for a massive depression worse than the great depression unless we totally get rid of the current monitary system of printing money out of thin air and sticking the bill to the taxpayers who cant afford to pay it back, and go back to the one our forefathers gave us. Coincidentally, Obama is not the answer we needed for this country, and quite true neither was McCain! There really was only one candidate who had a chance to fix the mess the Bush admin. (and Prior admins.) put us in, you remember him, Mr.:xcensored but he got laughed all the way out of the limelight, quite predictably though, America is so controlled in so many ways, many people have no clue......",

It has a magic 8 ball in the head too so you can personally get instant answers to all of your pressing questions.\n \n *The Sweat Shop Sweeties is the copyrighted name for the group of indentured servents under my record lable (Pwned) when they tour Eastern Europe and SE Asia for me as a boy band. They also do lap dances in Thailand for lunch money.\n Now, if that ain't exploitation...I don't think I could be a self-respecting rightie. \n But, we don't need to have self respect when we can pay someone to respect us for ourselves...hmmm, that sounds like what Obama did and is doing.\n \n I bet you can't say 'Sweat Shop Sweeties' 4 times real fast.",
