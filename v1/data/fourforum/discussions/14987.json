It might give the impression that gay pride is merely some 'family-friendly' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it.\n\n \n I will agree that there is a dark side to the gay pride movement.

Does that mean we should not have moved towards a more equal and unified union?

Moreover, sexual orientation of parents does not affect the upbringing of a child. The argument that a same-sex marriage is a detrimental environment for children is unsubstantiated. The fact that indecent homosexuals may conduct indecent acts does not change that. Indecent heterosexuals may conduct indecent acts as well. Should we ban all marriages? Would indecent heterosexuals be less detrimental to children than indecent homosexuals?",

   "I'm simply saying that it's politics as usual and is not solely a quality of the left.\n\n \n Alright, fair enough.\n \n \nI will agree that there is a dark side to the gay pride movement. As there are and werein many other movements. During the civil rights movement many of the Black Panther factions were not only pro-black but anti-white. Does that mean we should not have moved towards equal and unified union? Or course not.\n\n \n Civil rights would have happened without the Black Panthers. Gay rights will or will not happen regardless of anything the gay pride movement does. The problem with the Gay pride movement is two-fold: a.)it makes a point of pride out of a sexual-based issue; b.) it is a form of social rebellion and therefore tends to champion unseedy things, as indicated in the photos, and a lot of the elements we see at gay pride parades. That would at least be live-and-let-live fine, except they DEMAND to be seen as everyday-family-friendly Norman Rockwellesque, rather than by those unseedy elements. They are not only fighting peoples' sense of normalcy by the very fact it's about same-sex, but due to these unseedy elements (and using the term 'unseedy' is being rather kind) they are fighting peoples' sense of modesty. Therefore you are having to fight on two fronts, one of those your own movement's making. \n \n Therefore your gay pride movement is wholly unnecessary. If anything it is counter-productive. You are doing your critics a favor every time you march in the streets wearing leather or engaging in the San Francisco shock-scene. Often this junk is even waved off as just 'celebrating differences' or 'diversity', or even worse, alternative families. (Give me a break. emoticon_rolleyes)\n \n The Black Panthers were not demanding people see their behavior as normal. They were not demanding violence to be given legitimacy, as gays demand sexual-vice to be elevated to a point of pride. So there is little in common there. \n \n \nWhen discussing gay marriage it's important not to simply look at whether the proponents paint a completely honest picture of the movement. But to examine whether denying gay marriage will have an adverse affect on the negative side of the movement.\n\n \n I don't follow. What do you mean by 'denying gay marriage will have an adverse effect on the negative side of the movement'? The unseedy side? Why should we care what happens to the unseedy side of your movement? \n \n \nI do not believe it will. Yes, the people in the picture are part of the movement and yes, they more than likely support gay marriage. However, their motivations to conduct lewd acts in public are not indicative of their sexual orientation nor their stance on gay marriage.\n\n \n I have to disagree on the second part there; I would say their actions certainly ARE indicative on their stance on gay marriage, or any gay-related political issue. \n \n \nThis problem will not be resolved by denying gay marriage. And therefore pointing out that it exists is not a legitimate argument against the movement. If you want to stop people from blowing eachother on a street corner you ought to push for federal decency legislation and not pretend that it is relevant to the topic at hand.\n\n \n Look dude, you only have gays to blame foe these antics in the political debate. If you're going to have \"dykes on bikes\" in a parade that intends to champion gay rights, you can't rightly complain when OTHERS point it out. \n \n \nOn the contrary, Zach Wahl's testimony is relevant. The point of the video was to show that heterosexual marriages are not soley responsible for the fostering of successful children. Moreover, sexual orientation of parents does not affect the upbringing of a child. The argument that a same-sex marriage is a detrimental environment for children is unsubstantiated. The fact that indecent homosexuals may conduct indecent acts does not change that. Indecent heterosexuals may conduct indecent acts as well. Should we ban all marriages? Would indecent heterosexuals be less detrimental to children than indecent homosexuals?\n\n \n Except one is the norm and others are examples of sexual minorities and other exception-arrangements. Sure, ANY sort of group of people can manage to raise a child if it's the only alternative. But there is NO way a same-gender set of parents, a single parent, an extended-family member, etc. can give as normal a life for a kid as compared to the kid having a father and mother who loves the kid and ea. other. That said, I do support the legality of gay adoption, simply because there are so many orphans out there that they'd be better off. \n \n And re. your last point, I have never seen heteros doing things in public as bad as those photos of gays showed. Let's call it how it is here.\n \n At any rate, I simply think its important to point out that when gay pride tries to portray its movement as something innocent and family-friendly, there's a much darker reality going on behind it.

But accepting homosexuality as normal does not require accepting unseedy behavior as normal. You can easily grant them marital rights but deny them the right to XXXX in the streets.\n \n \nTherefore you are having to fight on two fronts, one of those your own movement's making.\n\n \n Agreed. The individuals and groups that engage in the depraved acts in your link cast a negative light on the movement and blur what the fight is about.\n \n \nTherefore your gay pride movement is wholly unnecessary. \n\n \n But the gay rights movement is necessary. People are being treated as 2nd class citizens by doing nothing but breathing.\n \n \nIf anything it is counter-productive.

I also do not care to see many of the outfits that are worn during the marches. But we do have the right to peacefully assemble. So, as long as you remove any sexual acts and indecent exposure, they can wear whatever they like. Regardless of my feelings towards it.\n \n \nI don't follow.

Why should we care what happens to the unseedy side of your movement?\n\n \n My apologies. Allow me to clarify. What I meant was that you need to examine whether denying gay marriage will rid us of the problems associated with the negative side of the movement. I hope that's clearer.\n \n \n \n \nI have to disagree on the second part there; I would say their actions certainly ARE indicative on their stance on gay marriage, or any gay-related political issue. \n\n \n Not all people who are part of the movement engage in these acts. Therefore you cannot assume that these members are the authority on the mindset of the movement.\n \n \nLook dude, you only have gays to blame foe these antics in the political debate. If you're going to have \"dykes on bikes\" in a parade that intends to champion gay rights, you can't rightly complain when OTHERS point it out.\n\n \n I make no complaint. I am simply saying that to point out that there are bad seeds within a movement is not a legitimate argument against said movement. Two men filating in the street is no reason to deny homosexuals marital rights.\n \n \nExcept one is the norm and others are examples of sexual minorities and other exception-arrangements. Sure, ANY sort of group of people can manage to raise a child if it's the only alternative.

It doesn't matter how many parents are in the household or their genders. If the home is safe and full of love the child can come out alright. As I said before it is good parenting and luck that will make a child successful.\n \n \nThat said, I do support the legality of gay adoption, simply because there are so many orphans out there that they'd be better off.\n\n \n Agreed. I would also add that two gay parents that want you are better than two straight parents that don't.\n \n \nAnd re. your last point, I have never seen heteros doing things in public as bad as those photos of gays showed. Let's call it how it is here.\n\n \n Apparently you've never ridden the bus. ;) I need not defend this last point as you have already said you agree with gay adoption. So you support same-sex families but those two parents being wed is inappropriate? I'm curious, if a young straight couple got pregnant would you suggest that they would be better off getting married?\n \n \nAt any rate, I simply think its important to point out that when gay pride tries to portray its movement as something innocent and family-friendly, there's a much darker reality going on behind it. People aren't going to let you all off the hook that easily.\n\n \n There's a darker side to most movements and philosophies. Pointing them out does nothing but advert attention from the truth of the issue. You need to explain why the existence of those darker sides is reason enough to dismiss said movement. If you fail to do so you didn't make an argument you made a statement and have not garnered yourself any grounds for debate.",

Their means may have been different but that doesn't suggest that we should have not have civil rights because one part of the movement was violent and destructive.\n\n \n I disagree that ML King associated with idea of 'black pride'. He was about non-violent protest and civil rights. In fact, in this way I would say the gay pride movement is much closer to the black panthers than ML King, in terms of ideology. King was more about rights than pride and identity.\n \n \nTo correlate with gay rights. Just because some members of the movement are depraved and obscene does not equate to dismissing the entire movement and deny gay rights.\n\n \n The movement started out from elements of depravity and obscenity. It's a known fact that the early gay pride movement had Nambla march with them. Obviously the gay pride movement today wants a family-friendly image, but they can't sweep their past under a rug, esp. when there are very clear elements of it still around. The media gives you all a pass on it by not showing it. It's analogous to southern 'confederate-flag' groups pretending they are just about benignly \"preserving history\" when in fact their movement came out of hate and still represents it in many ways.\n \n \nWrong. It makes a point of pride in tolerating and being yourself.\n\n \n If that were true, we would have straight pride groups, and white pride groups. Obviously there's something more to it than just mere \"tolerating\" and being oneself.\n \n \nIt's important to understand that sex and sexuality are two separate things. One is the act; the other is the desire.\n\n \n Do you REALLY think human identity should be wrapped up in either one?? I'm not sure the distinction you're making means much considering it's pretty sad that anyone would want their identity defined by such shallow things.\n \n \nGay sex is not part of gay rights.\n\n \n Puhlease. Yes it is. It wouldn't even be an issue if not for gay sex. You can't separate the issue of gay rights from gay sex. The topics can't be discussed without it being part of the conversation. Gay pride violates many peoples' sense of MODESTY. IMO gay pride is a trashy movement attempting to dress itself up to be family friendly--that's based on observation. (Notice I never call it \"gay rights movement\" because that's a different thing, IMO.) From its downright seedy past associations, to the San Francisco nasty junk pointed out earlier, to the fact gays have the highest HIV rates in the country--the gay pride movement has nothing good going for it. Call a spade and spade and let the chips fall where they may. You may not like it being pointed out because it's not politically correct to do so, but it is what it is.\n \n \nThe images displayed in your link are examples of unseedy behavior but I do not see the correlation between social rebellion and acts of depravity. Can you please explain this further?\n\n \n Of course you don't! Both are examples of social rebellion. The gay pride movement rebels against standards of cultural modesty, not just cultural norms. When your pride parades don't require people putting their hands over their children's eyes or changing the channel, you'll have a point. But I don't think that can ever happen because the rebellion against modesty is part and parcel of the movement. It all came out of the sexual revolution.\n \n \n1) The acts depicted do not represent all of them. Why should someone whom is not involved in those acts be associated with them?\n\n \n When the gay pride movement roundly and publicly condemns this, then that will carry some weight. Right now, it's more likely that the more vocal people in the gay pride movement ARE people that engage in the sort of behavior documented at that link. \n \n \n2) They are demanding to be accepted as they are and not have to be belittled by our society everyday and treated as if they are somehow less than human simply because they are gay.\n\n \n JWilliam, there are certain code phrases that are dead giveaways to the gay pride political movement. One is what you just used: \"less than human\". Phrases like that do nothing to help public discourse over these issues, and rather hurt your cause. Everyone knows gays are human. Don't be silly.\n \n \nTrue. But accepting homosexuality as normal does not require accepting unseedy behavior as normal. You can easily grant them marital rights but deny them the right to XXXX in the streets.\n\n \n Why should we give marital rights or redefine marriage over an unseedy way of living, to begin with?\n \n \nBut the gay rights movement is necessary. People are being treated as 2nd class citizens by doing nothing but breathing.\n\n \n Another example of a gay pride movement talking points code phrase. \"2nd class citizens\".\n \n \nI do not condone acts such as the ones shown in the link. And I believe that many of the acts should be done in the privacy of one's own home. I also do not care to see many of the outfits that are worn during the marches. \n\n \n But therein lies the problem you see. You are one of the few examples I've ever seen that tries to draw a distinction between the gay pride movement and the 'outfits' and so forth worn during marches. \n \n Those defending these parade often justify these things by saying they 'celebrate diversity' or some other silly justification of that sort. But it's called a gay pride parade. It wouldn't be happening if not for gay pride. It's ABOUT gays. Yet we see all the garbage and immodesty. If the movement doesn't want that reputation, then don't let them march. It's not that complicated, really. \n The real problem here gays have is that the biggest and loudest proponents of their rights ARE the immodest people. They can't afford to give them the boot, because the gay pride movement wouldn't EXIST without them. They ARE the gay pride movement. \n \n \nMy apologies. Allow me to clarify. What I meant was that you need to examine whether denying gay marriage will rid us of the problems associated with the negative side of the movement. I hope that's clearer.\n\n \n I think the more important question is whether marriage should be redefined to accommodate any form of vice that comes along wanting to qualify as marriage.\n \n \nBS! It doesn't matter how many parents are in the household or their genders. If the home is safe and full of love the child can come out alright. As I said before it is good parenting and luck that will make a child successful.\n\n \n Sorry, but you are never going to convince me that limited perspective is better than broader perspective. Two men could never identify with the challenges of being a girl growing up and two women could never identify with the challenges of being a boy growing up. The natural thing is for a child to be raised by a mother and father. Surely you can find it within yourself to look past social liberalism for a moment and agree with such a basic common-sense ideal. You really can do that. It's ok. \n \n \nApparently you've never ridden the bus. ;) I need not defend this last point as you have already said you agree with gay adoption. So you support same-sex families but those two parents being wed is inappropriate?\n\n \n The problem with the marriage issue is that it's a case of broadening marriage, or rather making it a 'broadenable' institution. Rather than trying to piggyback off a heterosexual institution (that can't be rightly separated from heterosexuality), couples' benefits should be granted by some other means. \n \n \nThere's a darker side to most movements and philosophies. \n\n \n That's like justifying the 'Sons of the Confederacy' by saying that there's a darker side to most movements. Sometimes movements themselves ARE what's dark, or they emerge from things that are dark, in society. I think it's important not to sweep these things under the rug.",
