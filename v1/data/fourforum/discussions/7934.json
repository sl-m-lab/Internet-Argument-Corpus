   "The Thursday before Easter Sunday is called Maundy Thursday. The significance of this day is that it was the occurrence of the Last Supper. Back in New Testament times, prior to the meal a servant was to wash the guests' feet, but since no servants were on hand, Jesus himself washed the disciples' feet, making them all feel very, very bad, especially considering what happened the next day. Not only that, but they all passed on the mashed potatoes when they noticed Jesus had his thumb in it. But anyway, since Monday is traditionally wash day, one can see how the name 'Maundy Thursday' derived.\n \n Maundy Thursday should not be confused with Fry Day Wednesday, the traditional fish fry and chips feast prior to the full moon, after Jupiter leaves Sagittarius and Venus is ascending through Virgo.\n \n Sun Day Tuesday is a pleasant centuries-old tradition, with outdoor activities, and comes after the much anticipated Thirsty Saturday, a day of mirth and revelry, and outright debauchery. At least I believe Sunday Tuesday comes before Thirsty Saturday, but it's sometimes hard to keep these dates straight. \n \n Anyway, that's some information you might like to know about this upcoming holiday season. Ain't religion great?:)",

Demands for 'proof' are wholly unreasonable. I considered several times butting in to this exchange to say so, but didn't - after all, ez's a grown man and can look after himself.\n \n \nAnd when you do, then the evidence for Jesus Christ and the New Testament becomes compelling, and the preponderance of the evidence weighs in his favor.\n\n \n Ah, now this is a different matter. Requests for evidence are wholly reasonable. So, excluding the bible itself, what have you got, ez?",

   "Skeptics want \"proof,\" and often they want it scientifically-speaking, which is normally absurd when investigating historic events and personalities from antiquity. Science cannot replicate historical events or individuals. But what NORMAL historical investigators look at is the preponderance of the evidence, which should also be the same framework under which Biblical events and personalities are judged (unless you want to impose an unfair double standard). So you need to get off your \"proof\" high horses and get reasonable for a change. And when you do, then the evidence for Jesus Christ and the New Testament becomes compelling, and the preponderance of the evidence weighs in his favor.\n\n \n There is evidence for a historical Jesus, sure. But I think the relevant question is, is there evidence for a Divine Jesus? That's the real issue after all. Whether or not there was some guy called Jesus 2000 years ago isn't that intersting. Was Jesus the son of God is the $64,000 question. I think that's what people want evidence for.",

It was the inferior textual form of the Textus Receptus that stood at the base of the earliest English translations, including the King James Bible, and other editions until near the end of the nineteenth century.\n (Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why, Bart D. Ehrman, HarperSanFrancisco, 2005, p82-83)\n \n\n \n Now go trade your inferior KJV Bible in for a real one. emoticon_xangel",
