   "I trust that everyone here recognizes that the practice of slavery in our nation's past was immoral. Yet did you know that in making this point abolitionists argued the RKBA recognized by the 2nd. A. was an individual right?\n \n The pre-eminent scholar amongst abolitionists was a man named Lysander Spooner. In 1845 he published a work entitled the \"Unconstitutionality of Slavery.\" Abolitionists deemed this work so important that the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society provided a copy of it to every member of Congress. In that work, Spooner argued that the words of the amendment:\n \n \"obviously recognize the natural right of all men \"to keep and bear arms\" for their personal defense: and prohibit both Congress and the State governments from infringing the right of \"the people\"--that is, any of the people--to do so. . . .This right of man \"to keep and bear arms,\" is a right palpably inconsistent with the idea of being a slave. Yet the right is secured as effectively to those whom the States presume to call slaves, as to any whom the States condescend to acknowledge free. Under this provision any man has a right either to give or sell arms to those persons whom the States call slaves; and there is no constitutional power, in either the national or State governments, that can punish him for so doing; or that can take those arms from the slaves; or that can make it criminal for the slaves to use them, if, from the inefficiency of the laws, it should become necessary for them to do so, in defense of their own lives or liberties; for this constitutional right to keep arms implies the constitutional right to use them, if need be, for the defense of one's liberty or life.\"   Lysander Spooner, The Unconstitutionality of Slavery, p. 98 (1860 edition) [bold emphasis added]\n \n Did the abolition of slavery in the 13th. Amendment put an end to racist gun control measures in the reconstructed south? No. Remember, the BoR has always been held to be a check only upon the power of the federal government, not the states, and Congress quickly heard how the southern states were creating a system of de facto slavery by disenfranchising blacks, which included denying them the RKBA. See, for example, the following comments:\n \n [concerning the State of Kentucky] \"the civil law prohibits the colored man from bearing arms. . .their arms are taken from them by the civil authorities. . . .Thus, the right of the people to keep and bear arms as provided in the Constitution is infringed. . .\"  Executive Document #30, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, pp. 233 and 236 (1866) [from the Report of the Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau]. [bold emphasis added]\n \n [from Mississippi's \"Act to Regulate the Relation of Master and Apprentice Relative to Freedmen, Free Negroes, and Mulattoes.\"] \"That no freedman, free negro or mulatto. . .not licensed to do so by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie knife. . .\" Laws of Mississippi, 1865, p. 165 (November 29, 1865).\n \n How were laws like this viewed by Congress? \"Northern Republicans professed to see this new legislation at the South the virtual re-enslavement of the Negroes.\"  J. Burgess, Reconstruction and the Constitution, 1866-1876, p. 51-52 (1902).\n \n The complaints were not limited to the mere passage of laws, however:\n \n \"In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages on them. . . .\"  Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 40 (December 13, 1865) [Speech of Senator Henry Wilson (Republican-Massachusetts)]\n \n Yet another Senator complained that the Mississippi state militia would roam throughout the state and habitually \"hang some freedmen or search negro houses for arms.\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, Senate Report Number 30, p. 813 (February 13, 1866) [Speech of Senator Lyman Trumball (Republican-Illinois)]\n \n Throughout all of this it was understood that the BoR was powerless to stop this state-sponsored oppression of the black man's RKBA, his right to vote, his right of free speech and assembly, etc. So what then was the response from Congress? The 14th. Amendment:\n \n All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. United States Constitution, 14th. Amendment, Section 1. \n \n This amendment was drafted for the express purpose of requiring the states to respect the individual citizen's rights contained within the BoR:\n \n \"This immortal bill of rights embodied in the Constitution, rested for its execution and enforcement hitherto upon the fidelity of the States. . . .The proposition pending before the House is simply a proposition to arm Congress. . .with the power to enforce this bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution today.\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 1033-34 (February 26, 1866) and p. 1088 (February 28, 1966) [Speeches by Congressman John A. Bingham (Republican-Ohio)]\n \n The RKBA was one of those individual rights which the House of Representatives intended to be protected by the 14th. Amendment:\n \n \"Sir, I find in the Constitution of the United States an article which declares that \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" For myself, I shall insist that the reconstructed rebels of Mississippi respect the Constitution in their local laws. . .  .\"Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, p. 1838 (April 7, 1866) [Speech of congressman Sindey Clarke (Republican-Kansas)]. [bold emphasis added]\n \n \"The Constitution clearly describes that to be a republican form of government for which it was expressly framed. A government. . .where \"no law shall be made prohibiting a free exercise of religion;\". . .where \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed;\"\".  . . Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 2, p. 1266 (March 24, 1866) [Speech of congressman Roswell Hart (Republican-New York)] [bold emphasis added]\n \n \"Make the colored man a citizen of the United States and he has every right which you or I have as citizens of the United States under the laws and Constitution of the United States. . . .He has a defined status; he has a country and a home; a right to defend himself and his wife and children; a right to bear arms. . . .\"   Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 2, p. 1266 (March 8, 1866) [Speech of congressman Henry J. Raymond (Republican-New York)] [bold emphasis added]\n \n In the Senate, the 14th. A. was introduced by its sponsor, Senator Jacob Howard. Concerning its purpose, he said the following:\n \n \"To these privileges and immunities should be added the personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution; such as the freedom of speech and of the press; the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances, a right appertaining to each and all the people; the right to keep and to bear arms; the right to be exempted from the quartering of soldiers in a house without the consent of the owner; the right to be exempt from unreasonable searches and seizures, and from any search or seizure except by virtue of a warrant issued upon a formal oath or affidavit; the right of an accused person to be informed of the nature of the accusation against him, and his right to be tried by an impartial jury of the vicinage; and also the right to be secure against excessive bail and against cruel and unusual punishments.. . .[A]ll these immunities, privileges, rights, thus guarantied by the Constitution or recognized by it, are secured to the citizens solely as a citizen of the United States and as a party in their courts. They do not operate in the slightest degree as a restraint or prohibition upon State legislation. . . .The great object of the first section of this amendment is, therefore, to restrain the power of the States and compel them at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees...\"Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 3, p. 2765 (May 23, 1866) [Speech of Senator Jacob M. Howard (Republican-Michigan)] [bold emphasis added] Note this quote was also cited by Justices Black and Duncan in their concurring opinion in Duncan v. LOUISIANA, 391 U.S. 145, 167 (1968), which held that the 14th. Amendment required the states to honor a defendant's 6th. Amendment right to trial by jury in criminal cases.\n \n How did the Senate react to Senator Howard's description of the Amendment? \"In the entire Senate debate on the Fourteenth Amendment, running from May 23 to June 8, not a single senator challenged Senator Howard's declaration that Section 1 made the first eight amendments enforceable against the states.\" Irving Bryant, The Bill of Rights, p. 337 (1965). [bold emphasis added]\n \n See also how the black community viewed the RKBA and the 2nd. A, as illustrated by the following excerpts from editorials published in a major southern black newspaper of the time:\n \n Editor Loyal Georgian: Have colored persons a right to own and carry firearms?--A Colored Citizen\n Almost every day we are asked questions similar to the above. We answer certainly you have the same right to own and carry arms that other citizens have. You are not only free but citizens of the United States and as such entitled to the same privileges granted to other citizens by the Constitution. . . .\n [and]\n Article II, of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States, gives the people the right to bear arms, and states that this right shall not be infringed. Any person, white or black, may be disarmed if convicted of making an improper or dangerous use of weapons, but no military or civil officer has the right or authority to disarm any class of people, thereby placing them at the mercy of others. All men, without distinction of color, have the right to keep and bear arms to defend their homes, families or themselves. From issues of the Loyal Georgian, January 20, 27 and February 3, 1866. [bold emphasis added]\n \n Does not this history clearly show that the RKBA in the 2nd. A was viewed as an individual right?\n \n Now I know that some people fear this right, and they find the 2nd. A uncomfortable and embarrassing. They consider it to be the ugly red-headed step-child of the Constitution, which must be kept locked in the basement and ignored lest it frighten the enlightened guest who may be visiting us from another country-a country where people have already grown comfortable with the abolition of this right. They don't forget the right, however. After the guest leaves they will go downstairs and kick the amendment around a bit. They yell at it and tell it things like: \"You're nothing more than a 'collective' right. You don't guarantee any individual RKBA. You only recognize a right of the states to be free of federal interference with how they arm their militias. We could enact a complete ban on the private ownership of any firearm, and there is nothing you could do to stop us.\" Oh how completely fraudulent is that argument for ignoring history! The 14th. Amendment is arguably the most important civil rights amendment of all time, and it is responsible today for requiring your local police to honor your right of worship, free speech and assembly, your right to remain silent, your right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures, your right to trial by jury and due process, your right to counsel, and your right to be free of cruel and unusual punishments. Yet this essential bulwark of our liberty interests is likewise a nuisance for gun prohibitionists-one which must also be hidden and/or ignored because both its history and stated objective are irreconcilable with their attacks on the 2nd. Amendment. Well then, my advice for those who want to continue to go back into that basement to put the \"beat-down\" on the 2nd. Amendment is this: Be careful! You might just trip and fall over that other amendment you seek to hide down there in the dark with the RKBA.",
