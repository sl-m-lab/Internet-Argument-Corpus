   "I just wanted to share this.\n \n Although gays were also targeted by Nazis, I'm not sure they used the same type of propaganda against them.\n \n http://www.hatecrime.org/subpages/hitler/hitler.html\n \n\n NAZI ANTI-JEWISH SPEECH\n VS. RELIGIOUS RIGHT ANTI-GAY SPEECH:\n Are They Similar?\n\n \n The first example:\n \n\n Jews 1% of population: control politics, world opinion, NYC, & have lots of money\n \"At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Jews sit at the junction of the world financial markets. They are an international power. Although only one per cent of the world's population, with the help of their capital, they terrorize the world stock exchanges, world opinion, and world politics. New York is today the center of Jewish power.\" - Nazi propaganda film, \"The Eternal Jew,\" http://www.holocaust-history.org/der-ewige-jude/stills.shtml\n \n Gays 1% of population: control politics, have lots of money\n \"Homosexuals display political control far beyond their numbers. A tiny fraction of the population (about 1 percent), homosexuals have one of the largest and fastest growing Political Action Committees in the country (The Human Rights Campaign) and give millions of dollars to candidates\". - Robert Knight, Family Research Council, testifying before the US Senate Labor Committee hearings on S.2238, July 29, 1994.\n \n The gays control television & radio, Hollywood\n \"You know, the gays are in control in Hollywood; they are in control of television; they are in key positions at the Washington Post now; and they watch everything that is coming into the newspaper or television and radio, and they are editing it out.\" - Anthony Falzarano, Parents & Friends of 'Ex-Gays', http://www.frc.org/net/st95l1.html\n \n Gays more politically powerful than other Americans\n \"On average, they [gays] are far wealthier, more educated, and more politically powerful than other Americans.\" - WHY SCHOOLS ARE TEACHING YOUR KIDS ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY, Steve Schwalm, Family Research Council, May 14, 1998, http://www.frc.org/podium/pd98i1hs.html \n\n \n Whaddaya think?",

Another would be that that Nazis were using the Jews as a scapegoat, the fear and hatred of which would be a rallying point to draw the German people together. Likewise, gays are a convienent target to use a as rallying point to draw conservatives together.\n \n The level of violence being advocated isn't nearly as bad, thank goodness, but I still see alot of parallels between the Nazi's hate speech and the rhetoric leveled against gays today.",
