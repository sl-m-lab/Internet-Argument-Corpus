   "The teabaggers are getting ready for the next round of wingnuttery against the Obama administration. It sure looks like they lost on health-care reform, but they have already been organized for a long time around the issue of immigration, so they are ready and rarin' to go careening off the far-right cliff.\n \n This weekend, the nativist right-wingers at ALIPAC and the National Policy Institute organized a series of \"Tea Parties Against Amnesty.\n \n However, at the rally in Minneapolis, the demonstrators got punk'd by a young man who called himself \"Robert Erickson\".\n \n \"Erickson\" got up and delivered a rant against European immigration. At first the crowd was whooping and hollering as he talked about the rights of \"real Americans\" -- but then it gradually tapered off as he went on and they realized they'd been had.\n \n Here's the speech:\n  Hi, my name is Robert Erickson and I'm really excited to be here. Its people like all of you, and events like this that make our country great! Give yourselves a round of applause!\n \n I just want to talk about a couple themes this afternoon because I love this country and I want to see America be the best place it can be.\n \n Mr. Gutierrez is getting ready to propose an immigration bill in just a few short days, and we have to make sure he knows that we want a bill that's tough on immigration. Now is the time for us to stand up and make our voices heard!\n \n In Minneapolis, where I'm from, we have a huge immigrant population that's been causing a number of problems. With the economy in recession, and so many people getting laid off, and unable to find work, immigrants should not be competing for the few jobs that are out there. It's just not fair to the folks who have a claim to this land and the right to be here. All across America, they are contributing to the flooding of our job markets making it hard for Americans to find jobs. Well, I'm fed up, and it's time to let our politicians know that enough is enough, and we're not gonna take it any more!\n \n We need to secure our borders to protect our country. We need to restore order and put an end to the anarchy that's sweeping the nation. We need tougher immigration laws to make sure that we send these people back where they came from. We need to protect the sovereignty of the real Americans. We need to hold our politicians accountable.\n \n It's no secret that with an invasion of immigrants comes waves of crime. We see them involved in massive theft, in murder, and bringing diseases like smallpox, which is responsible for the death of millions of Americans. These aren't new problems, though -- they have been going on for hundreds of years, and continue to this day.\n \n I say it's time for us to say enough is enough! Are you with me? Are you with me? Let's send these European immigrants back where they came from! I don't care if they are Polish, Irish, English, Italian, or Norwegian! European immigrants are responsible for the most violent and heinous crimes in the history of the world, including genocide and slavery! It's time to restore the sovereignty of people native to this land!\n \n I want more workplace raids, starting with the big banks downtown. There are thousands of illegals working in those buildings, hiding in their offices, and taking Dakota jobs. Let's round them up and ship them out. Then we need to hit them at home where they sleep. I don't care if we separate families, they should have known better when they came here illegally!\n \n If we aren't able to stand up to these European immigrants, who can we stand up to? We need to send every one of them back home, right now.\n \n Thank you very much, and we'll see you in the streets!\n \n Columbus Go Home! Columbus Go Home! Columbus Go Home!\n Not surprisingly, the organizers were XXXXXX. Sally Jo Sorensen at BlueStemPrairie was there to watch, and she reported that some of the nativists started getting violent:\n  Most of the MINN-SIR supporters were slow to catch the satire, and so the cheering from that side of the crowd took a while to subside. As they realized they'd been punked, they stood in a cold, stunned silence, while the 30 or so counter-protesters urged Columbus to go home.\n \n Unfortunately, some of the pro-MINN-SIR audience made up for what they lacked in humor through the use of violence. Both Danielson and I saw middle-aged men attack young protesters, knocking one off a bike before he started throwing punches at the young man.\n \n Just as shocking was the reaction of the state police working the rally, who pushed back those being attacked, rather than those attacking the counter protesters.\n \n Neither of us have ever witnessed violence at rallies and events we've attended in the past. The attacks formed a sharp counterpoint to Hendrycks' shrieked claims from the podium that MINN-SIR \"patriots\" had \"respect\" while the young protesters were rude. \n \n I've been warning for awhile that there is a violent element already involved in the immigration debate, and when they become empowered by the \"tea party\" types, it's going to get ugly. Looks like the debate hasn't even started yet, and it already is.\n\n Teabaggers punk'd by anti-racists who get them to cheer rant against European-American immigrants | Crooks and Liars\n \n I've said it before.\n I'll say it again...\n \n People keep trying to paint a nice rosey, coherent message for the Tea Partiers, but that is pure junk.\n The Tea Parties are being brought together by a mish-mash of people, some of whose ideologies are thoroughly unsavory. Like elements of racism.\n \n But those people want you to believe it's just about THEIR message, while they ignore the REAL voices of the crowd... :xbanghead\n \n This story shows how some people demonstrated their racist ideologies on \"immigration\" by getting angry when their DESIRED targets (non-white people) was not the focus of the speaker's tirade, and rather WHITE people were the target...",

   "The tea partiers are as you say a diverse cross-section of america.\n \n I would say about 25% of them are small-government ron-paul supporters\n 50% are the \"mainstream\" republicans who likely voted for mccain and probably supported bush (although it's likely doubts continue to grow in this group about his presidency, the further behind it gets).\n 25% are probably single issue supporters brought in by their opposition to obama.\n \n some oppose immigration, some gun control, some abortion, gay marriage, or some other facet of policy.\n \n It would be a mistake to lump these all into one group and ignorant to depict one group as \"the REAL voices of the crowd... \".\n \n All the voices are real. Opinions are united on some issues, divided on others. \n \n None of these people are as dangerous as the fascists like yourself who call dissent from government wingnuttery and use homophobic rhetoric to vilify these people as \"teabaggers\". \n \n Presumably the Americans who took part in the Boston Tea Party were also \"teabaggers\" to be vilified as sexual deviants by the ruling elite.\n \n Don't worry about the message when you can just call them \"nuts\" and sexual deviants, right? Sorry but as far as the american public has fallen, abusive language wins few friends. The more fascists like yourself focus on insult instead of argument, the more you will lose.",

   "None of these people are as dangerous as the fascists like yourself who call dissent from government wingnuttery and use homophobic rhetoric to vilify these people as \"teabaggers\". \n\n \n \"vilify\"???\n \"homophobic rhetoric\"???\n \n I seem to remember a whole thing where TEA BAGS were sent to Congress People as a sign of protest...\n A tea bag to e-mail to anyone who needs to see a Tea Bag\n :cool\n \n And then we got this web-site...\n GOP.com: Tea Party\n Good ol' GOP will send a tea-bag postcard to either Obama, Biden, Pelosi, or Reid.\n I'm hoping that maybe Symbiote can express his anger to the GOP over such an insinuation... :rolls\n I ain't going to hold my breath...\n \n \n And how the heck am I fascist?\n How the heck is a tea-bag \"homophobic\"???\n \n You have a serious problem with reading comprehension.\n \n \n \nPresumably the Americans who took part in the Boston Tea Party were also \"teabaggers\" to be vilified as sexual deviants by the ruling elite.\n\n \"ruling elite\"???\n ROFLMAO!\n Obama was POPULARLY ELECTED, as he EXPLICITLY STATED in his campaign that he wanted national healthcare.\n \n What we have with the \"tea baggers\" are a bunch of whiny minority-opinion-politicists who are crying loudly cause their way isn't being followed.\n \n It's not \"fascism\" when something you don't like happens.\n It's not \"ruling elite\" when the people were properly elected into office, after campaigning that they were going to do what they are NOW TRYING to do...\n \n \n \nDon't worry about the message when you can just call them \"nuts\" and sexual deviants, right?\n\n As I have previously stated in my above comments, the tea partiers are a diverse group.\n Some of them are nuts.\n \n I can show you a long list of pictures PROVING that statement true, if you want to contest it.\n \n \n \nSorry but as far as the american public has fallen, abusive language wins few friends.\n\n This coming from the guy who called me a fascist?\n And is taking offense over the term \"tea-bag\", which directly references something THE TEA PARTIERS THEMSELVES do???\n \n You've got your head screwed on backwards\n \n \n \nThe more fascists like yourself focus on insult instead of argument, the more you will lose.\n\n The funny thing is that you try to call me a \"fascist\" after saying \"abusive language wins few friends\".\n \n If you have any capability to explain why you think I'm a fascist, please do so.\n Otherwise, your post is once again riddled by your own confusion and unwillingness to listen to what I actually said.",
