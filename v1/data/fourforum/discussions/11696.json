   "Americans' losses in Iraq force Pentagon to change the conception of military operation. Well, I think that regular protest actions and discontent of American citizens have become big irritant for US officials and pushed them to the decision.\n Pentagon is going to enlarge the role of US Air Forces in Iraq for using it if need be as a Rapid Response Forces. In fact this is attempt to avoid further loss of life. But imo that is also a confession of US military command weakness! Look, its clear that too easy to bomb f*cking Iraqi rebels than try to look into the problem 'on the ground'! As a result of new Pentagon's idea the number of Iraqi civil population losses will grow! But Pentagon doesn't care about it! I think that new ides directs to frighten of some unruly countries and realization of military operations against it. And Iran is the leader of this list! More interesting that in time of the worst financial crisis America is unable to abandon hopes to unleash war against Iran!",
