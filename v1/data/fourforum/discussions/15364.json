   "\"\"Are gays discriminated against? Sometimes. But they are protected by laws, not because they are gay, but because they are humans. That is why I am fundamentally against the \"gay rights\" movement. Being gay is not and should not be a protected class, being human is. If you are assaulted, there are laws on the books that punish the perpetrator-not for hitting a gay person, but for hitting a person. Gays who feel the need to have these public confessionals are not so much concerned about equality; but rather acceptance. We know that the media is very liberal, thus they are trying to make heroes out of these gays who have gone public. They are not heroes, they are regular people. Would the media react the same way to someone who publically admitted they had a drug problem, alcohol problem, or a stealing problem? Should they be portrayed as heroes too? These are all about personal choices and the fear that public knowledge of these behaviors, in their thinking, might cause them to be frowned upon by society-thus be discriminated against.\"\n More at Raynard Jackson; Enough!! \"I'm Gay Don Lemon, Will Sheridan, and Rick Welts\" : ThyBlackMan.com",

You should be careful where you gain your pride from, because if you are deriving it from incorrect sources you are probably opening up the path for shame too. In fact it is probably the fact that they saw pride as the only alternative to shame that caused the pride. The rational thing to do would be to note it doesn't really matter to others.",

I was saying that whether it changes or not is a function of what everyone decides, and I can only speak for myself.\n \n \nWhich ones?\n\n The right to one's person and the right to one's product are the two direct derivatives of the right to liberty (the primary right). The right to liberty is a condensed concept produced from the derivation of social morality from individual values and the axiomatic value which defines good and evil. As I'm sure you know because you were the only one who made an serious effort to respond to the volitional society thread.\n \n \nThat was my question how does one know and just as important how does everyone else know?\n\n Everyone else are 'ones' so the way one knows is the same way everyone else should know. One knows by correctly deriving the concept of rights from a rational contemplation of morality. Morality does not spring from instincts as subjectivist would claim it does, it must be defined and refined like any other scientific model.\n \n You can't just say 'go find morality' you must first have the premises which define the concept. Namely good and evil. If you want to start you must start there.\n \n \nIf it pops up it exists.\n\n No, someone thinks it exists.

Whether 30 centuries + should be considered 'not that long' is another discussion. Man did discover the truth, but then; despite that knowledge reverted to a falsehood. Why? Next answer.\n \n \nSo what is the hold up on the rights? \n\n Faith, subjectivism, fear, tradition, and sloth. All of these are forces that fight against the progression of truth, science; and objective knowledge. If none or few care to think about something; and especially if other societal forces are spreading ignorance it is quite possible to halt or even reverse the progress of human knowledge.\n \n \nThis sounds good, but really they aren't comparable. Physics will exist with or without people, rights need people. Physics are not subject to being violated because someone just feels like it, people and their rights are. \n \n They are comparable, but the differences you noted do exist. What is it about morality as opposed to physics that means everyone is always going to treat it as rationally accessible absolute knowledge?\n \n \nI agree I didn't say there weren't. What I wanted to point out was that in civil litigation a person can be 10% responsible to be made liable. So in an all or none type setting either all those of less than 100% will become so or won't which will either crowd the court or leave it unintended\n\n You misunderstood, I was saying that when the law refers to a person; it should not include irrelevant attributes like gender, race, wealth, etc.. only whether they are guilty or not. If you say someone is 10% guilty for something they are still guilty.",

   "The media does make heroes out of people who have overcome problems, whether substance abuse and addiction or the severely over-weight. In the case of gays, the problem isn't being gay, it's social prejudice.\n \n Much of that prejudice comes from a lack of visibility. People who are aware that they know someone who is gay, are more likely to not be bigoted and to support equal rights. There's power in putting a human face to an otherwise abstract concept. We can look out at a society where gay youth are being ostracized, bullied, beaten and committing suicide. It's a society that hasn't achieved equal rights. I guess in that reasoning, some gay public figures have taken on a sense of social responsibility, whether or not they have personally experienced prejudice.\n \n When Ellen Degeneres came out of the closet more than a decade ago, it made the cover of Time magazine. That wouldn't happen today. In Canada, which has achieved greater equality, there are high-ranking officials in government who are gay, and it hasn't made headlines(other than in specifically gay publications). Now, it would have been big news a couple decades ago. With more social acceptance, it becomes less of a story for the media.

He was apparently of the opinion that if you failed to give consent to pay for something, that you validate in and consent to it if you then use it.\n \n I disagree, by definition without your original consent no moral contract was established, therefore any return of the wealth that was stolen from you is essentially recovery as your concerned. If a criminal steals your wallet then leaves half the money at your door; and you use it, that doesn't mean you gave consent for him to get the other half. You in no way moralize his theft by recovering any portion of your wealth even in excess of your original loss.\n \n Therefore, it is no ones fault that they don't know exactly what their taxes pay for nor can they reasonably check to see how much of it they recover through benefits given how indirect many are. If people in marriages getting benefits then accept the wealth it cannot be sanely alleged that they aren't merely recovering funds that were taken from them.\n \n The only solution is to cut off the head of the snake and be happy the future will be more just with wealth, stop the insanity of taxes and forget about everything that was done under them; we have no hope of sorting where the wealth flowed when it was ripped out of millions of hands by incredibly complex rules and combined and allocated dozens of times over centuries.

If you want to marry your brother then more power to you I am not the one to stand in the way of your liberty and personall choices.\n\n Interesting, may I have your comments on this?\n \n \nThere are different degrees of change. There is changing one element of the wheel, without having to throw the entire wheel out, and start over.\n\n And there is blaming the wheel for the rickety ride when the axle is rotted. No matter how many changes or fixes you make to the wheel it will not fix the problem. The problem you see is a consequence of the problem I see. I see that people are not given the choice as to what they pay for but they are given the right to vote for what everyone will pay for. A better plan for strife and political mayhem could not be devised.\n \n Many many so called issues argued over by the right and left are to me non-issues including marriage benefits. Regardless of who thinks what it is the premise that we all need to decide the same thing that must be thrown out. A company doesn't only sell when the whole country will buy their product nor should social action require the coercion of the minority.\n \n I wouldn't pay for hetero or homo marriage benefits, I don't really see the point. That is my opinion and my money; you can line up 90,000 people who say otherwise and I will tell you \"Impressive, I am sure 90,000 people don't need me to fund their program.\"\n \n Likewise there may be some programs that I would support that you would not. Don't pay for it.\n \n You can try to convince me and I can try to convince you but neither has the right to force the other to submit.\n \n If issue after issue seems to be caused by people disagreeing about how their money (which they never explicitly agreed to give but was taken from them) is used. If objective morality holds that this legalized theft (taxation) is immoral. Of course the problem is that. I can create for you a whole slew of problems if I implement some immoral action, would you really sit there and try to treat the symptoms and not the disease. If for instance I just started taking over parts of a city, demanding people pay me for protection. Do you really think the issue is whether or not I am giving money out 'equally'? It is clear in this situation that my opinion as it stands in coercive power over others is the problem not the opinion itself. The same is true of any individual or group of individuals including the two groups majority and minority. \n \n \nRight. Well you see government authority as being immoral.\n\n I see immorality as being immoral. Define government authority please.\n \n \nIn fact, sometimes it is, and other times it's good. Sometimes private enterprise is also immoral. Neither are wholly good or wholly evil.\n\n That is true, but what is also true is that private enterprise is not given legal powers which don't exist in reality. A private enterprise can act immorally, but it would be illegal if they did. A government can act immorally, and it can be legal; and people will treat it like some shallow political contest instead of the unacceptable situation it is. If Microsoft could take my money without my consent, could order me to buy their products, could condemn my home, and stop me from buying things or working places then I would have just as much of an issue with Microsoft. \n \n \nA private business discriminating against a black person or a gay couple is evil.\n\n It's irrational (which means 'evil' in a sense to my philosophical brethren), but it's within their rights.\n \n \nGovernment authority coming in and forbidding this is a force for good.\n\n The violation of rights is never a force for good.\n \n \nA private medical insurer refusing to insure a poor, elderly person because of a pre-existing condition is evil.\n\n Why?\n \n \nGovernment action through medicare is good.\n\n I may agree or disagree with any particular government action (and I am glad you called it an action for that is what it is), but that disagreement doesn't make it immoral. It only becomes immoral if it requires or sanctions the violation of rights.\n \n \nYes, that's exactly what I'm saying. This is why heterosexual couples choose marriage. Gays don't have that choice, because they are gay.\n\n That's absurd, standard contracts have existed for centuries. Next up we won't be able to take out a loan for a car because it would cost too much money for people to draft the document.\n \n \nExactly. Because they are heterosexual.\n\n Yes.\n \n \nThen it's discrimination, just like the whites-only lunch counter. \n\n It's discrimination for sure but the reason I don't care is because it is only the inherently damaged machinery of government that is preventing homosexuals from establishing a system of marriage benefits of their own.\n \n \nPeople do have the right to not be discriminated against.\n\n No they don't, even when the discrimination is patently irrational.\n \n \nDiscrimination is a statement of social evil whether it is coming privately or from government.\n\n I care about discrimination only so far as it is used as an excuse to deny rights.\n \n \nPrivate enterprise hasn't given people access to the benefits they need. Therefore, government has stepped in.\n\n By definition there is no duty applicable to every private enterprise so you can't say they have failed to give people access to the benefits they 'need' because that is not necessarily a function of a private enterprise.

While we've seen a large number of never-married women as childless, those who are married tend to have children. Women are delaying both marriage and childbearing for the same reason.

Among never-married women, 56 percent were childfree in 2008, compared with 71 percent in 1994.\n \n Interestingly enough, being childless is correlated with increased rate of divorce.

From here:\n The report found that 13 percent of the women who currently held a married status or were married at some point in the past had no children of their own in 2008, which was just a small increase from 11 percent in 1994. Among never-married women, 56 percent were childfree in 2008, compared with 71 percent in 1994.\n \n Interestingly enough, being childless is correlated with increased rate of divorce. At least from a cursory look around.\n If you have a childless marriage. The absence of children leads to loneliness, and at least 66 percent of divorced couples in the United States are childless\n \n \n \n The purpose of marriage, in this country and beyond, as been rooted in our biology (though there is additional meaning on top of that). The prohibition on incestuous marriage, on underage marriage and even on polygamous marriages have been rooted in evolutionary sound logic of procreation (to say nothing of interspecies relationships). To separate marriage from biology would reduce the meaning of marriage to an arbitrary cultural custom with no more significance beyond that.\n \n \n \n Certainly we can extend benefits to homosexual couples or cohabitating couples or incestuous couples or any pairing we would wish, but then those benefits would have no clear purpose and no justification for existing. Currently, preferential support for heterosexual couples discourages reproduction outside a stable relationship since that relationship can, either intentionally or unintentionally, produce children.\n \n In a homosexual relationship, reproduction is never unintended because it requires third party intervention for reproduction to take place.\n\n \n First, I was way off by saying that most married couples are childless - not true, you are right, sorry. I was thinking of households, just saw an article about that and the factoid jumped into my head. I was wrong.\n \n My main point is that there are lots of legitimate reasons people get married - not just for the children. You have somehow decided that having children, or the ability to have children, or the possible potential to have children, etc. is the deal breaker. You have de facto decided therefore that only male/female marriages are OK. \n \n Having a stable situation for children is not the only reason people get married today. Not by a longshot.",

To change the club to include women strips the club of the meaning it used to have to the members. It is no longer a 'Men's Club', so why would you keep calling it that?\n\n Well I just read up on it. It seems that people think it started out as a system of exclusive sexual access. Marriage has included more than one person in pretty much every combination you can think of (even though 1 man 1 woman is by far most common even in cultures that permit other permutations), however the relations in these permutations have always been man-woman even though everyone in the 'group marriage' treated each other with intimate trust. Therefore the assertion that all marriages defined by any culture at the very least provide for the possibility of children, but in any realism are built around it as the other common theme is mode of living. i.e. every culture holds that people can run about and do things as they must but that the natural state for a family (everyone married and their children) is living together and sharing responsibilities. A state of affairs which does not make much sense unless there were clearly joint duties besides having a 'good time'.\n \n My official conclusion after 40 minutes of research is that marriage is traditionally defined by the societal framework which is appropriate to raise children in. That such homosexual couples that have defined themselves as married simply mean that they are in a loving trusting sexual stable relationship and feel they could take care of children, that does not mean the institution ever acknowledged them as indicated by the lack of homosexual activity even when sexual peers were in the same family unit.\n \n I, however; still don't see a very serious reason why we can't just expand the definition as homosexuals have almost all the criteria, and considering adoption you can pretty much fit. If anything my research indicates that marriage is a post hoc identification of a emergent property of human sexual attraction and social mechanisms; meaning we can't really change it by expanding the definition. Emotionally and socially two partners seem to be the most stable, and the properly functioning sexual attraction mechanism will have opposite sexes.\n \n In the event people can't agree, and since homosexuals have already commandeered a word which has nothing to do with them (gay), I suggest simply union as defining all the attributes of marriage except child bearing, such that a marriage is a union but a union is not a marriage.",

   "You'd have to ask non-reproducing heterosexual couples the same questions. Actually, I've said all along that it is morally determined. Incest can reproduce. Whether or not we judge everything it reproduces as good, is a moral point. It's also a moral point if it does not reproduce. I've made appeals as to why supporting equal marriage and rights for gays is morally sound. I needn't necessarily argue for every issue.\n\n \n Why would I have to ask any heterosexual why anomalous relationships are restricted? That's a bizarre reply. Anything other than heterosexuality has sound reasons to be restricted. It is only when you want to remove some or all of those restrictions that the question must be posed, and the standard assessed. Since you are in favor of removing at least some restrictions (yet seem reluctant to elaborate on which ones you wish to keep and what the justification is), I am posing the question to you. Since I am not making the judgment that \"reproducing is good\", I am not making a moral argument.\n \n I am simply skipping over the responses that seemed to have no point. I am judging that you agree that physical and emotional maturity is a biological reality rather than culturally determined since you gave no clear response on that point.\n \n \nLike non-naturally reproducing heterosexual couples(I've given other reasons in the case of gays).\n [...]\n So gays and straights are not excluded? Sorry, just because you are a couple which has a penis and a vagina, does not mean that it's working or workable for the purpose of reproduction. Reproduction isn't the definition of marriage anyway.\n\n \n Whether or not any particular heterosexual couple reproduces is immaterial to the point, however. Heterosexuality can be defined, as a species is, by theoretical reproduction which includes every heterosexual couple. Homosexual couples cannot reproduce, even theoretically. They require third party intervention. Thus your point about non-reproducting heterosexual couples (which appears to be your only counterpoint) is refuted. Heterosexuality is intrinsically linked to reproduction (since that is the only natural method), and anything other than heterosexuality was restricted, so the meaning of marriage is linked to reproduction.\n \n \nWe don't always want unintentional reproduction. You're still operating on the premise that the purpose of marriage is reproduction. Even if that's true in the majority of cases, that's not it's sole definition.\n\n \n Yes, there is cultural meaning as well as the biological meaning in marriage. To remove biology from the purpose and meaning of marriage renders marriage an arbitrary cultural custom with no significance beyond that.\n \n Whether or not we as a society want unintentional reproduction is part of the point. It is to our benefit, and the child's benefit, if any natural reproduction (read: heterosexual relationship), intentional or unintentional, occurs in a stable relationship with legal obligations to each other. This gives the State (who does not know the fertility of it's citizens) justification to encourage any heterosexual couple to marry by giving marriage benefits that they could not otherwise gain. The same justification does not extend to homosexual couples because reproduction is never unintentional since they require third party intervention.\n \n \nWell of course it's a statement of fact that most heterosexuals are able to reproduce. Simply because the majority of married heterosexual couples do reproduce, does not make it the only meaning of marriage. Obviously the meaning of marriage isn't rooted in reproduction for those who don't reproduce, whether gay or straight.\n\n \n The meaning of marriage is rooted in biology whether or not any particular heterosexual couple reproduces, just as 'love' being part of the meaning isn't suddenly gone if any particular couple marries but don't love each other. \n \n \n\n Special status, just because you reproduced, or even if you don't, just because you are heterosexual? Wouldn't the more reproduction equal better status? Unless by special you don't mean better? The heterosexual isn't tied to reproduction if it doesn't reproduce.\n\n \n Heterosexuality, itself, is linked with reproduction whether any particular heterosexual reproduces just as you are a member of this species whether or not you reproduce.\n \n \nIt's already been separated though.\n\n \n Then there would be no reason to have restrictions on marriage that mirror evolutionary restrictions on valid mates. If it has already been separated, please elaborate on the reasons there are restrictions on incestuous, interspecies, pre-pubescent, polygamous and homosexual relationships?",

   "Well I just read up on it. It seems that people think it started out as a system of exclusive sexual access.\n\n \n Simplistically, yes.\n \n We are mammals, so a woman's minimum parental investment is much larger than a man's. She contributes nine months of pregnancy and, in a natural environment, two to four years of nursing. He contributes a few minutes of sex and a teaspoon of semen. Men are about 1.15x as large as women, which tells us that they have competed in our evolutionary history, with some men mating with several women and some men mating with none. We are gregarious with men and women living together in large groups and constantly facing opportunites to couple. Men have smaller testicles for their body size than chimps but bigger ones than gorillas, suggesting that ancestral women were not wantonly promiscuous but were not always monogamous either. Children are born helpless, so they need parental investment and men, because they get meat from hunting and other resources, have something to invest. \n \n Men invest more than their anatomy would let them get away with, which means that cuckoldry is a concern to men and a man's willingness to invest in children is a concern to women. Because men and women live together in large groups like chimps but the males invest in their offspring like birds, we developed marriage in which the man and women form a reproductive alliance that is meant to limit demands from a third party for sexual access and parental investment\n \n \nMarriage has included more than one person in pretty much every combination you can think of\n\n \n Polyandry is rare enough that it can be dismissed as a peculiarity of a particular region/economic condition.\n \n \nI, however; still don't see a very serious reason why we can't just expand the definition as homosexuals have almost all the criteria, and considering adoption you can pretty much fit. If anything my research indicates that marriage is a post hoc identification of a emergent property of human sexual attraction and social mechanisms; meaning we can't really change it by expanding the definition. Emotionally and socially two partners seem to be the most stable, and the properly functioning sexual attraction mechanism will have opposite sexes.\n\n \n Other than philosophically, the justification for extending marriage benefits seems to rest on that definition, however. There is a rational and identifiable purpose to discourage reproduction outside of a stable relationship without legal obligations to each other. However, this discouragement breaks down in a homosexual relationship since reproduction is never unintentional (since they require third party intervention). Thus the discouragement is meaningless in that case. \n \n However, the issue is very real in a heterosexual relationship. Extending marriage benefits has the effect of discouraging reproduction outside of that stable relationship with legal obligations to each other. This serves the dual purpose of creating the ideal situation for children (biological parents are the ideal situation, as I've shown) and for discouraging undesired side effects such as abortion, infanticide and abandoned children. Extending marriage benefits to homosexuals renders that encouragement meaningless, and the government no longer has justification to be involved. It's a self-defeating proposition.\n \n On a more philosophical level, in order to include homosexual couples the biological history and meaning must be stripped from marriage. Thus, by being included they've changed the very respect they're trying to acquire. This is also self-defeating.\n \n Your question here betrays a deeper truth, I think. Even if marriage is a post hoc rationalization of what we instinctually feel this implies there is a rational explanation and purpose behind it, just as catching a thief implies there was something there to steal. We value biological relationships and natural reproduction in part because of our instincts as well, and marriage is one way to express that value.

   "You're arguing dishonestly because you're trying to apply two different standards at the same time.\n\n \n I could say the same thing to you. There are different standards. Some will reproduce, some will not.\n \n \nThe meaning behind marriage and what we legally allow are different, even if they are related to one another.\n\n \n LOL! Which is it? \n \n \nPart of the meaning of marriage is love between two people, yet we do not bar people who hate each other from marriage. Does that mean that love is not part of the meaning? No. Love is still part of the meaning of marriage.\n \n Part of the meaning of marriage is sex. Does that mean we legally require sex in marriage? No, we do not. Yet there is still the unspoken expectation that married couples will have sex (at least once in a while).\n\n \n Thanks for obvious information. You know, maple syrup contains sugars.\n \n \nPart of the meaning of marriage is having children. Does that mean we legally bar infertile couples or legally require children? No, we do not. However, the reason that these exceptions do not alter the meaning of marriage is that they are theoretical exceptions.\n\n \n How very conveniently you apply \"theoretical exceptions\", to only different sex couples. Why can't gay couples be theoretical exceptions to the norm? Because of their genitals, because they are gay? \n \n \nFurther, all of these things that marriage means has an evolutionary purpose when applied to heterosexual people, so exceptions are just exceptions to something nearly universal.\n\n \n Then that's not the meaning for everybody. Then it's not universal. You are judging by outward physical appearances, the genitals, or due to a heterosexual identity. Either judging the book by it's cover, or identity, are being used to include one group and exclude another.\n \n There are a lot of meanings to marriage. I'd hate to think one's purpose in getting married was to breed. We are full, and very thoughtful human beings. Adults form relationships. Adults can be great parents regardless of whether or not the couple put a penis in a vagina in 30 seconds of passion. \n \n \nIf restrictions based on biological realities is fiction,\n\n \n It is.\n \n \nthen why do we restrict incestuous, polygamous, homosexual, prepubescent and interspecies marriage?\n\n \n Polygamy can reproduce. Yes, you said it's not required for reproduction(another very convenient argument), but it can. It's traditional. Social morals are what it's based on. These have been changing when it comes to homosexuality. It's not based on reproduction or ability to reproduce. Where are all these incest and inter-species marriages? How has our understanding changed on these subjects? It's a moot point, and a false dilemma. It shouldn't prevent us from recognizing same-sex marriages. \n \n \nAnd it is better if biological parents are happy and stable, rather than any other combination. If the desire is to encourage better situations over lesser, then there needs to be more encouragement for potential biological parents.\n\n \n Encouragement based on their ability to pop the babies out? I should hope not.\n \n \nThe meanings are linked, actually. There is no legal obligation to love one another just as there is no legal obligation to have children. It is a cultural expectation. However, this battle over homosexual marriage (as you've attempted to do in your post, as well) has gotten to the point of: \"well we don't legally bar people who don't fulfill the cultural meaning so the meaning obviously isn't there\".\n\n \n That may be your meaning, your culture, your tradition, when it comes to marriage. You're welcome to it. It's not everyone's. \n \n \nHomosexual advocates are trying to strip marriage of its cultural (read: historical) meaning in order to be included in that custom. So, yes, the meaning could very well be gone for heterosexual couples as well since if you have your way there will be no distinctions between any sort of relationship at all.\n\n \n There will be no distinctions based on sexual orientation or the sexes of the couple. That's all. Yes, that exclusion is historical, cultural, traditional. These things change.",

I think it's an agreement, a kind of contract that allows people to have the confidence to build their lives counting on the relationship. I find it easy to differentiate love from lust, but I have never been able to isolate a 'in between' emotion that some people seem to identify. As far as I can tell romantic love is simply love + lust. I know lust is supposed to be a dirty word and all but I think people have the feeling that their love validates and 'purifies' lust. We all know emotions can blend together to create an near infinite variety, I think romantic love is a particular blend not a fundamental building block.\n \n Love in objectivism is the emotional response to great value. That analysis seems to fit all cases. Love of family, self, spouse, work, knowledge it all fits beautifully into the tapestry that is a man's value system. A man does not however lust after everything he loves, that is why I think the other element which can only be described as lust is unique to spouse or sexual partner.",
