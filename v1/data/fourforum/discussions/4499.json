Oh well - before I bought the thing I was still using cassettes. (Won't use cd walkmans - they wreck my cds).\n \n But this has room for lots of songs - I could pretty much put my whole music collection on it. It is a very fun toy.",

I own upwards of 500 CDs, am at live shows at least once a week and I play bass (badly :) ) myself. I don't like portable CD players as they are a hassle and wreck CDs (no amount of anti-skip protection can prevent scratching). I used to use a cassette walkman - which required making tapes and hauling them around, remembering what was on them, etc. Regular batteries cost money and need to be replaced, too (even the rechargable ones - which I do use in my other portable electronics). My iPod can hold my entire music collection (with room to spare), I can call up any song I want at any time, I don't have to haul any portion of my music collection with me, it will never wreck a cd and it is smaller than a pack of cigarettes. I LOVE IT. That kind of convenience is worth the occasional additional cost to me.",

   "The reason they freeze is because their firmware sucks (helo updates apople?) Anyways I ahve an Iriver H-10 20 gog. The battery lasts 2000 charges so uh 20hrs times 2000. You can also buy an additional litium ion batter for the 10gig ( yes duo I remember your posts lol). This little number holds 5000 songs, has a didgital FM tuner in output stereo (it comes in as stereo). A digital FM recorder so you can record off the radio in MP3 format directly and saves into your playlists, very simple. A voice recorder in MP3 format with line imput. a photo album, a text viewer in PDF format (I have Lord OF The Rings trilolgy on it and the entire Wheel Of Time Series by Robert Jordan.) It has SRS WOW EQ, 40 preset Eq's and a custom equalizer. Lasts 20 hrs non stop, requires NO software and comes in red,silver,blue, and black. Also with itunes it deverts a ripped Cd or track into itunes format (compression). Which means faster streaming, lower quality. With the Iriver it's pure MP3 format no screwing with it. The ipod earbuds have a metal screen which reverbs on certain tracks and distorts the sound. Iriver earbuds are plastice with insolation. This player goes for $200 for the 10gig, for the 20 gig, and $350-400 for the 40 gig. Trust me I have been through seven MP3 players and I must say this is the best. Oh and I use Sony earbuds which go into the ear canal ($40). They are 10 times more powerful than standard earbuds, and I must say with the iRiver and these SOny earbuds, it is the most rewarding listening experience I have ever had. Go to iriveramerica.com or bestbuy.com to see reviews and info.",
