Nonetheless, I did find the following link inside one of them.\n \n http://www.johnkerry.com/pdf/jkmilservice/Honorable_Discharge_From_Reserve.pdf\n says Kerry was honorably discharged from the Naval Reserves. Does that mean he&#8217;s really not a Navy man?\n \n All this attention to the 30 year old service records is brought about by John Kerry's camp. He touts himself as a great war hero and he gets shot down. He slams Bush as a gutless homeboy and gets shot down. \n \n He can't afford to talk about what he's done in the Senate for the past 19 years because he's the most liberal voter up there. He doesn't want to talk about his anti-war, anti-American cuddling with the enemy after he took his early leave from Vietnam because it exposes the true John Kerry. (You can't find a copy of his post-war book denegrating the American soldier because the Dems have bought them all up to keep them from the general public.) \n \n So he picks on George's honorable service in the ANG by comparing it to his \"great acts of courage\" in Vietnam.\n \n I have yet to understand why any American voter with any sense of character-evaluation could possibly vote for John Forbes Kerry. He's in the same bag with the likes of Micheal Moore...puke walking.\n \n ...",
