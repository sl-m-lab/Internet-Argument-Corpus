   "Hello Everybody,\n I am suffering from acne. As I have oily face so this problem is not new for me. I have consulted many doctors but nothing affected me. One day my friend told me regarding Dalacin T solution. I want to know that can I use this medicine while I am pregnant or during breastfeeding? As I am expecting child by the end of this month I want to be on the safe side. I will not use this drug if it has any effect on the child.",

Other medicine may be safely used provided benefited to the unborn baby. Always inform your doctor before using any medicine.The safety to use during pregnancy is not been recommended unless and until recommended by your doctor.
