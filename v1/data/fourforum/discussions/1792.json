   "15 Myths about Gun control\n \n Firearms are used to commit as many as 650,000 crimes each year. But firearms are also used to prevent crimes as many as 2.5 million times each year. In fact, criminals are three times more likely to be killed by armed victims who resist them than by the police. Would tougher gun control laws make our lives safer? Fair appraisal of the issue requires us to put aside some common myths. \n \n Myth No. 1: Guns cause crime. A careful review of 18 academic studies shows that there is no relationship between the number of guns and the amount of crime in the United States. International evidence tells a similar story. \n \n Myth No. 2: Gun control laws reduce crime. The nation already has 20,000 gun control laws, and the police arrest 220,000 people a year on weapons violations. Yet the violent crime rate is at an all-time high. Moreover, considering that fewer than 1 percent of all guns are involved in a crime and only 12 percent of all violent crimes involve a gun, gun control laws could have only a modest effect on crime - even if they worked exactly as intended, which they don't. For example, New Jersey, Hawaii and Washington, D.C., experienced sharp murder-rate increases after passing tough gun control laws. Canada, Taiwan and Jamaica reported similar experiences. \n \n Myth No. 3: Guns are of little help in defending against criminals. In fact, guns are a big help. Each year, potential victims kill from 2,000 to 3,000 criminals and wound an additional 9,000 to 17,000. And mishaps are rare. Private citizens mistakenly kill innocent people only 30 times a year, compared with about 330 mistaken killings by police. Criminals succeed in taking a gun away from an armed victim less than 1 percent of the time. \n \n Myth No. 4: Killing someone is the only reason to buy a handgun. The vast majority of gun owners cite protection from crime as one of the main reasons they own a gun. And for good reason. Americans use guns for self-protection about one million times a year. In 98 percent of the cases, they simply brandish the weapon or fire a warning shot. \n \n Myth No. 5: People who buy guns are more prone to violence and crime than are other people. Violence and crime are higher among black than white, lower-income than middle- or upper-income, young than middle-aged, single than married, and urban than rural individuals - all contrary to the pattern of gun ownership. \n \n Myth No. 6: Criminals mainly have guns in order to commit crimes. The number one reason criminals acquire guns is for self-protection against other criminals. Fewer than half of felons think handguns are important for use in committing crimes. \n \n Myth No. 7: Killings and other violent crimes were prevalent in the Old West because guns were so plentiful. Much of the violence on the frontier involved clashes with Indians, bandits and foreigners. Even so, the frontier was a lot safer than America is today. There was very little ordinary crime - less than in most cities in the East. \n \n Myth No. 8: Gun controls keep criminals from obtaining guns. In surveys of prisoners, a majority said that prior to imprisonment they had owned a handgun. But fewer than one in six guns had been purchased from a retail dealer. Three-fourths of the felons said they would have no trouble obtaining a gun when they were released, despite legal prohibitions. \n \n Myth No. 9: Required waiting periods would prevent some of the most vicious crimes. If the Brady bill were law, it would not have saved Jim Brady. Nor would it have prevented the Killeen, Texas, massacre or the slaughter at McDonald's in Stockton, Calif. However, an instant records check (to identify felons when they try to purchase guns from retail dealers) and better enforcement of existing laws (to turn criminals into convicted felons) might well prevent some vicious crimes. \n \n Myth No. 10: Most murders are committed by people killing friends or family members. The actual number is about one out of five. Most in-household killings are not crimes of passion. They're the culmination of years of abusive behavior, and often it is the abuser who is killed. \n \n Myth No. 11: The availability of guns contributes to crimes of passion. In about 90 percent of \"crime-of-passion\" domestic homicides, the police had been called in previously to break up violence. In half the cases, the police had been called in five or more times. There is no evidence that a significant number of homicides occur simply because a lethal weapon is handy. \n \n Myth No. 12: Automatic rifles and so-called assault weapons are too dangerous to be left in private hands. Over the past 50 years no civilian has ever used a legally owned machine gun in a violent crime. And despite their repeated use by drug dealers on \"Miami Vice\" and in the movies, no Uzi has ever been used to kill a police officer. Even gun control advocates concede that so-called assault weapons play a minor role in violent crime. \n \n Myth No. 13: Gun control laws are especially needed to prevent the purchase of \"Saturday Night Specials.\" Inexpensive handguns are involved in only 1 to 3 percent of violent crimes, and criminals are no more likely to use one than any other type of handgun. \n \n Myth No. 14: People don't need guns for self-protection because they can rely on the police. About 83 percent of the population will be victims of violent crime at some point in their lives, and in any given year serious crime touches 25 percent of all households. Considering that, effectively, there is only one police officer on patrol for every 3,300 people, the odds are not likely to improve. And the courts have ruled that government has no duty to protect individual citizens from crime. \n \n Myth No. 15: Gun ownership is not a constitutional right. The Second Amendment reflects the founders' belief that an armed citizenry (called the \"general militia\") was a necessary precaution against tyranny by our own government and its army. The idea that government has a constitutional right to disarm the general citizenry is totally foreign to the intent of the Constitution's framers.",

Whether Jefferson said it or not is not the issue. The topic of this thread is \"15 myths about gun control\" But you seem unable to make a logical point so you resort to attacking the individual...\n \n \n Significant portions of this article are excerpted from Michael Z. Williamson's excellent and witty piece, It's amazing what one has to believe to believe in gun control\" \n \n \n 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.\n \n 2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.\n \n 3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are \"just statistics.\"\n \n 4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.\n \n 5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.\n \n 6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.\n \n 7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.\n \n 8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.\n \n 9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should \"put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run\" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).\n \n 10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.\n \n 11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.\n \n 12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.\n \n 13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a \"state\" militia.\n \n 14. These phrases: \"right of the people peaceably to assemble,\" \"right of the people to be secure in their homes,\" \"enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,\" and \"The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people\" all refer to individuals, but \"the right of the people to keep and bear arm\" refers to the state.\n \n 15. \"The Constitution is strong and will never change.\" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.\n \n 16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.\n \n 17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't \"military weapons\", but private citizens shouldn't have \"assault rifles\", because they are military weapons.\n \n 18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.\n \n 19. The NRA's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign is responsible social activity.\n \n 20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.\n \n 21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.\n \n 22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is \"an accident waiting to happen\" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are \"preying on their fears.\"\n \n 23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.\n \n 24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.\n \n 25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.\n \n 26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a \"weapon of mass destruction\" or an \"assault weapon.\"\n \n 27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.\n \n 28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.\n \n 29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.\n \n 30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.\n \n 31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.\n \n 32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do \"civilians\" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.\n \n 33. We should ban \"Saturday Night Specials\" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.\n \n 34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.\n \n 35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.\n \n 36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.\n \n 37. \"Assault weapons\" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.\n \n 38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.\n \n 39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.\n \n 40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to \"keep guns out of the wrong hands.\" Guess what? You have the wrong hands",

   "\n Show me where the Patriot act violates US citizens rights.. Marching is for trustifarian wanna be hippie liberals who can't think for themselves.\n \n\n Why would you ask this question? Searching through some old posts I found this post by you. \n \n \n\n You don't think so? My position as outlined in my several posts in regards to the constitution have been backed with examples of the \n trampling of the constitution by our elected officials on both sides of the isle.\n \n Lets go Amendment by Amendment ILIS has spelled this out nicely:\n \n Amendment I\n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. \n \n \"Commercial, sexual, and political speech are increasingly censored. In the name of \"national security\", government employees have been censored for life. To combat pornography, federal and state governments have imprisoned musicians, seized the entire contents of bookstores and video rental outlets, and have even prosecuted museums and art galleries. To \"fight crime,\" hundreds of communities have enacted curfews and \"anti-loitering\" laws. Children who refuse to attend government schools can be imprisoned along with their parents. Freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly are under siege.\" \"\n \n Campaing finance reform\n Patriot Act\n Anti-Smoking regulations\n Voluntary Prayer in public schools\n etc. etc.\n \n Amendment II\n A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. \n \n \" Our right to bear arms is being gradually destroyed as the federal government, the states, and communities enact ever more repressive \n \"gun control\" legislation. California made criminals of over 700,000 of its citizens with the stroke of a pen by banning many popular semi-automatic rifles. To fight government and criminal violence, Americans need the means to defend themselves more than ever, yet we are \n being \"legally\" disarmed.\"\n \n \n Crime Bill\n Brady Bill\n \"assault weapons ban\"\n etc. etc.\n \n \n Amendment III\n No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manners prescribed by law. \n \n \"In Puerto Rico, National Guard troops have been permanently stationed in 54 apartment buildings. Government also destroys our privacy by wire-tapping our telephones, seizing business records and keeping extensive files on most citizens\"\n \n This is a new one for me...\n \n Amendment IV \n The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized.\n \n \" Recent Supreme Court decisions have given the police nearly unlimited power to search houses, businesses and cars - in many cases without a warrant. In Florida, courts have refused to stop police from boarding buses, blocking exits and searching passengers. RICO laws and \"anti-drug\" laws have given government the power to seize all of an individual's or company's assets without indictment or trial. Strip-searching persons arrested for even minor traffic violations is becoming more and more common. Courts and legislatures now consider virtually any government search and seizure \"reasonable.\" \"\n \n Patriot Act\n RICO acts\n \"Rockefeller drug laws\"\n Roving wiretaps\n etc. etc.\n \n Amendment V\n No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. \n \n \n \"The Founding Fathers believed that no one should be indicted without a hearing. Today the IRS can seize your bank account, the FBI can take your computer, the Coast Guard can take your boat, and welfare authorities can take away your children, without any hearing or indictment by a Grand Jury. Increasingly, fundamental legal restraints on the power of government agencies are being abandoned. \"\n \n \n Patriot act\n DYFUS\n etc. etc.\n \n Amendment VI\n In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed; which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and the cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have assistance of counsel for his defense. \n \n \" The United States has adopted the totalitarian practice of imprisoning defendants for long periods before trial. As a growing list of personal behavior and technical errors are criminalized, the court system is being impossibly over-loaded. It now takes years before most serious cases ever get to trial. The growing power of prosecutors, and government seizure of attorneys' fees, are destroying the ability of those accused to defend themselves.\"\n \n Marijuana laws (no I do not smoke marijuana or do any drugs)\n Most if not all \"Mala Prohibita\" laws\n \n Amendment VII\n In Suits of common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law. \n \n \" Less than 3% of criminal defendants now get a trial. Pre-trial detention is growing and some people have been imprisoned for over two years without trial. In direct violation of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has ruled that you don't even have to be given a jury trial if you face less than six months in prison. And if you have a dispute with the IRS, EPA or any of a dozen other regulatory agencies, your case will usually be heard by an administrative law judge employed by the same agency you are disputing. Judges routinely deny the traditional right of jurors to judge the law, as well as the facts of a case, and vote their conscience. Judges and prosecutors exclude any juror who won't agree to convict in advance, stacking juries to ensure convictions. These are precisely the sorts of abuses our Bill of Rights was designed to prevent. \"\n \n \n Speaks for itself....\n \n \n Amendment VIII\n Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n \n \n \" By calling penalties \"civil\" rather than \"criminal,\" government can seize all of your assets without trial or any other form of legal proceeding. Bail has been abolished for virtually all federal crimes, including crimes that didn't even exist as recently as ten years ago, such as \"money-laundering\" and \"structuring.\" Punishments are becoming increasingly harsh. Teenagers are getting years or decades in prison for minor drug offenses. Businessmen are receiving long prison sentences for technical violations of incomprehensible tax laws and securities regulations. Ordinary citizens are being imprisoned for possession of banned literature, guns, and even medicines. \"\n \n \n Amendment IX\n The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. [b]\n \n \"The Constitution and Bill of Rights were intended as strict restrictions on government power. Those powers not explicitly granted to government were retained by the individual. Today the Constitution has been stood on its head. Courts are now saying anything the government wants to do is permissible, unless explicitly prohibited by the Constitution. Government now has nearly unlimited power, and the American people are losing control of their own lives, property, and destinies\"\n \n \n This is the heart of the argument. [b]\"Those powers not explicitly granted to government were retained by the individual.\" This deserves much study.\n \n Amendment X\n The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. \n \n \"Power has shifted from the individual to the states, and from the states to the federal government. Federal aid to states has meant federal control of the states. By including the entire economy under the Constitutions \"interstate commerce\" clause, the Supreme Court has given the US Government control over every aspect of society. \"\n \n \n Portions used from International Society for Individual Liberty \n \n \n \n I can get into many more examples but this should suffice for now. Let me ask you how is the federal government protecting out Bill of rights?\n\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=14420#post14420\n You've already said it does violate US citizen rights.",

The scenario of an overthrow perpetuated by the citizens of the US is indeed valid, especially when you consider that our soldiers are also citizens, and it is unlikly that even the paltry 1 million soldiers that coulld potentially be mobilised rapidly to put down a rebelion are unlikely to be 100 percent loyal.\n \n As far as the res of your post, I am glad to see somebody from another country explaining that the US is not the only free country on the planet.
