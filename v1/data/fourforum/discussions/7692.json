Who says \"liberal\" really means \"pro-women\" anyway? Or why should we assume \"conservative\" means NOT being pro-women?

For example, a shoe shop chain I worked for spent a little over 10% of its turnover on wages. If it had doubled the pay of everyone on minimum wage, then that proportion would still have been less than 20% of turnover, which would have perhaps meant a 10% increases in prices. Admittedly there are knock effects if the supply chain is in the same country, but nothing like enough to cancel out the wage increase. Also a lot of the services provided by these jobs, such as childcare, are bought almost exclusively by the middle classes.",
