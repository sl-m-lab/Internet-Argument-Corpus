   "I hate this! But I suppose I have to find out about this XXXX.\n \n I don't really see how a scientific theory can be grafted onto what a society does but let the argument begin. I will steal some stuff from Wikipedia to start:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_darwinism\n \n \nSocial Darwinism is a term used to describe a style or trend in social theory which holds that Darwin's theory of evolution of biological traits in a population by natural selection can also be applied to human social institutions. Initially expressed in the writings of English philosopher and author Herbert Spencer (27 April 1820 - 8 December 1903), and William Graham Sumner, Social Darwinism first became popular in the late 19th century and continued in popularity until the end of World War II, though some claim that contemporary sociobiology could be classified as a form of Social Darwinism. The application of the term to 19th and 20th century modes of thought, however, generally did not occur until after the publication of American historian Richard Hofstadter's Social Darwinism in American Thought in 1944, which codified the concept in the sense it is generally used today. Thus the term is an anachronism, although it is still widely used by historians.\n\n Charles Darwin, British naturalist, lived from 1809 to 1882. His notable work on evolution was published in 1859.\n \n http://www2.lucidcafe.com/lucidcafe/library/96feb/darwin.html\n \n The Wikipedia article indicates that the concept of social Darwinism did not fully evolve until mid 20th-century. In the early part of the 20th century there were a whole bunch of half-baked social theories, that's all I've got to say at the moment, but you may rest assured that I shall have much more to say later if I get ticked off enough.",

   "Social Darwinism is the mistaking of a scientific/naturalistic theory for an ethical one. The seeds of it were not so much Darwin, but Huxley's coining of the phrase 'survival of the fittest' which implies some fundamental superiority. Also the focus on evolution as a way of seeing the whole world, which was a sort of naturalisation of Hegel's dialectic: if I remember correctly, both Freud and Marx wished to dedicate their works to Darwin and saw themselves as following in his footsteps",
