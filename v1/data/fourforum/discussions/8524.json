   "The house has passed a bill that would ban internet poker and have up to 5 years in jail as the max punishment. Since when do they have the right to do this? Why are they doing this? It's our money, let us spend/gamble it as we please. For the record I have never played poker for money online, but I will defend the rights of those that do. What comes next? Ban what I think is bad music? You're only wasting your money, at least with gambling there's a chance to win (and it takes more skill than horse racing betting, which this bill keeps legal). Let's ban buying bad cars, let's ban buying ice cream, after all at the end it'll be gone and how many people really buy ice cream because they're hungry? It's just a waste for the temporary good taste you get. You lose money and risk your teeth rotting. What's next? Poker is fun, so even if you lose you're paying for entertainment (much like casino poker, which is still legal under this bill BTW) and you can also win money. Just because people are too stupid to realize that the money they're risking is real money and don't know when to quit gambling is not the fault of other people. If they want to throw it away, fine. But let me (hypothetically me) throw my money away if I want. I realize that I'm paying for entertainment, and I have a set amount that I'm willing to lose per week. Once I lose that, I'm done. If I win, it's just a bonus.",

I think it was some people don't realize it's real money so they gamble away their own money and then can't afford to make the payment on the house, buy food, etc. Apparently there was some guy who was hoping it would pass so he himself wouldn't have to worry about gambling all his money away. That's even easier than being a parent. Online poker money is real money just like any online payment is. Don't play internet poker for the purpose of making money, play it for fun and if you win money, that's just a bonus. The problem is when people expect to win and then don't. Try being responsible for your own money.",

Since when have I favored a living Constitution? There are a few things that can actually be interpreted and change with time such as what a reasonable search and seizure is, but most of the Constitution should be interpreted as it is written. But they keep chipping away at our rights. First it's no \"hate\" speech, then censorship of the the airwaves, what's next? No criticizing the government? I realize we have a way to go with that one but the same is true for the 2nd amendment. We started with the right to bear arms shall not be ABRIDGED. We've gone from not allowing the right to be abridged to forcing someone to get a permit if they want to own any gun, and outright banning others. Just a few examples. Now they're on to protecting us for our own good again, just what the Constitution does NOT describe. The government's supposed to protect us from threats of force, not our own spending habits. \n \n It was with regard to online sales of wine.
