   "This is the source of the anti-gunner, Civil rights violators claim to a collective right to keep and bear arms over an individuals.. Riding a dead horse indeed!\n \n \n \n http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/kstrassel/?id=110004653\n \n Bellesiles Misfires \n An antigun \"scholar\" as today's Galileo? Oh please, just shoot me. \n \n BY KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL \n Friday, February 6, 2004 12:01 a.m. EST \n \n History has its fair share of persecuted geniuses, men who were ahead of their time and made to pay for it. There's the hemlocked Socrates, the house-arrested Galileo, the exiled Rousseau. And to this list of giants it seems that we are now expected to add the name of Michael Bellesiles.\n \n Mr. Bellesiles is the former Emory professor who shook the scholarly world in 2000 with his book \"Arming America.\" An academic bombshell, the tome went against long-held beliefs by claiming that few colonial Americans actually owned guns. This set off a riotous public debate over whether the Second Amendment was designed to protect individual gun rights. Mr. Bellesiles was showered with prizes and media praise, becoming an instant academic star.\n \n That is, until his peers started looking into that little thing called research. Reputable scholars in the ensuing months tore apart his work on probate and military records, travel narratives, and other documents. Mr. Bellesiles, when asked to explain, provided ever-more outlandish excuses: that his notes had been lost in a flood, that his Web site had been hacked, that he couldn't remember where he'd found certain documents. The officials of the prestigious Bancroft Prize stripped him of his award, he left Emory and Knopf chose to stop publishing his book. Most of us sighed happily and figured that was the end of that academic scandal.\n \n But oh, no. It turns out that Mr. Bellesiles is still riding his dead horse, his nonexistent guns still blazing. Soft Skull Press (which takes pride in putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin) has not only agreed to reissue \"Arming America\" but has decided to release Mr. Bellesiles's latest response to his critics. This 59-page pamphlet, \"Weighed in an Even Balance,\" is a spirited attempt by Mr. Bellesiles to turn himself into the world's latest misunderstood genius. As such, it's worth reading for pure entertainment value.\n \n \n \n \n \n Much of the booklet is a repeat of the professor's creative excuses and dissembling. He explains again about the flood and helpfully assures us that he is not an agent of the Zionist Occupational Government (though surely that is why the Bancroft panel took away his prize, right?). He does acknowledge a few errors, but only after pointing out that \"even the finest scholars . . . make mistakes.\" As proof, he cites one blooper in esteemed historian David McCullough's 1,120-page biography of Harry Truman.\n But the most amusing parts of the pamphlet are those meant to support our scholar's belief that he is up against a stubborn world that refuses to open its mind to the truth. And his sense of persecution and righteousness is very much on display. The very title of his book is taken from Job: \"Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may known mine integrity.\"\n \n And that's just for starters. The pamphlet is sprinkled with quotations from thoughtful men, all meant to back up Mr. Bellesiles's argument that he is fighting the good fight. We hear from Isaiah Berlin: \"Few things have done more harm than the belief on the part of individuals or groups . . . that he or she or they are in sole possession of the truth.\" One epigraph recounts that in the 16th century, Oxford used to fine any student who diverged from the teachings of Aristotle. We are clearly meant to envision a feisty Mr. Bellesiles handing over his shillings to the dons.\n \n We are treated to lecturing tracts about the benefits of scholarly disagreement, the complex nature of historical research and the need for academic exploration. And finally, in case readers still aren't getting his drift, Mr. Bellesiles sums it all up in his conclusion: \"There are those who rest their very identity on the notion of a certain, unchanging past. The vision that society is unalterable is not just incorrect, it is dangerously undemocratic, and as such should be of concern to every modern historian.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n In fact, the academic world is hardly a monolothic creature that resists all change. If it were, we'd still be trying to explain how the sun moves around the Earth. Most historians and scientists are wise enough to realize that new discoveries or interpretations hold out opportunity. But before they completely cast aside mountains of research, they usually demand some proof. Mr. Bellesiles's problem isn't that he's misunderstood; it's that he still hasn't given them any.\n Or as the old saying goes: \"To be a persecuted genius, you not only have to be persecuted; you also have to be right.\"\n \n \n Ms. Strassel is a senior editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal.",

   "SO we are sticking with the now defamed \"collective right theory\" As of yet you have not explained:\n \n How the people in the 2nd amendment differ from the people in the other amendments.\n \n why the government would put a bill of rights that pertained to \"the people\" in all the other amendments but somehow saw the need to write one for themselves in the 2nd.\n \n \n Ill keep it to 2 for now\n\n A strawman argument.

   "There are some objections that I have to that interpretation. \n 1) It does not examine the meaning of the term \"bear arms\" at the time of the writing of the Constitution.\n \n 2) In most second amendment cases the courts have not agreed with the above interpretation. \n \n 3) The American Bar Association rejects such an interpretation.\n \"Since today's 'well regulated militia' does not use privately owned firearms, courts since Miller have unanimously held that regulation of such guns does not offend the Second Amendment...As lawyers, as representatives of the legal profession, and as recognized experts on the meaning of the Constitution and our system of justice, we share a responsibility to the public and lawmakers to 'say what the law is.'\"\n http://www.abanet.org/gunviol/secondamend.html\n \n\n \n The ABA is a well known liberal anti-gun institution & it appears are not above letting their own beliefs dictate how they interprate the law. \n \n Anyways, where does \"Since today's 'well regulated militia' does not use privately owned firearms, ...\" come from? Who do they consider the 'well regulated militia'? \n \n In CT, there are 4 classes of Militia of which the National Guard is one. The \"...unorganized militia shall consist of all male citizens and all male residents of the state who have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, not exempt from military duty by federal or state laws or by such reasons of physical or mental disabilities as shall be prescribed in general orders or regulations published by the Adjutant General and approved by the Governor and who are not members of the organized militia or of the National Guard or of the naval militia, and all female citizens and all female residents of the state who have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, who may voluntarily offer their services to the state...\"\n \n Whose arms does the \"unorganized militia\" use?? I've never been given a rifle by the state to practice with! Shouldn't we be allowed to own & practice with arms similar to those in use by the \"Organized militia\" & the National Guard so that in case of duty we will be \"well regulated\"??",

   "So you think that only the sentence structure needs to be examined and not the meaning of the words? \n\n \n Fortunatly, to \"Bear arms\" means the same thing today that it did back then. There are hundreds of examples available to support this. Check out guncite.com. They have a full archive of such examples.\n \n \n \nThe courts have the legal authority to interpret the second amendment, not Journalism teachers. And I don't think that you can totally disregard what historians say. This is an matter in which fields of expertise overlap.\n\n \n The historians ou cited based their entire supposition on the grammatical structure of the statement. If their argument had been primarily based in history, perhapse it could be considerd valid. Instead it was based on the structure of the sentence, a topic on which they are not qualified to comment.\n \n The courts do have the ultimate responsibility of interpeting the second amendment. The lower federal courts have been split on this, and the supreme court refuses to hear a case. Renquest once said in response to this:\n \n \"Would you want to be on the court that abolished all gun control laws?\"\n \n \n Which would imply he is fairly confident that, should the second ammendment be examined using the guidlines commonly utilised by the supreme court, the second amendment would most definatly convey not only an individual right, but one that is immune to the limits imposed by gun control legislation.",
