   "Republicans repeatedly balk at the idea of repealing DADT, despite the fact that we have kicked out NUMEROUS gay Arabic translators at a time that we obviously DESPERATELY NEED them in the armed service.\n \n Moreover, we NEED PEOPLE in the armed service...\n So while they are saying \"No\" to gays, how are they trying to keep up with the quotas?\n WHO ARE they letting in, while insisting that gays should be kept out???\n \n \nA few days after he arrived at boot camp here, Joshua Fry no longer wanted to be a Marine.\n \n He was confused by the orders drill instructors shouted at him. He was caught stealing peanut butter from the chow hall. He urinated in his canteen. He talked back to the drill instructors.

Fry figured this admission would persuade the Marines to let him return to the group home in Irvine for disturbed young adults where he was living when he enlisted.\n \n Instead, he was sent back to Platoon 1021, Company B. The drill instructors became more helpful, and in April 2008 he finished the grueling 11-week regimen and was sent to Camp Pendleton for infantry training.\n \n Within weeks he was under arrest for desertion and possession of child pornography.\n \n Documents in Fry's court-martial case detail a troubled upbringing and a Marine career that was both improbable and misbegotten.\n \n But far from being a routine instance of a young man unable to adjust to military life, the Fry case has exposed an awkward issue for the Marines and other military services: Recruiters sometimes take ethical shortcuts to make their quotas at a time when Americans have tired of the nation's wars and finding recruits is difficult.\n \n According to court documents, Fry's recruiter knew he was autistic. The Marine Corps is investigating the recruiter's conduct.\n\n Case of autistic Marine brings recruiting problems to the forefront - Los Angeles Times",

   "June 15, 2009 | On a muggy Florida evening in 2008, I meet Iraq War veteran Forrest Fogarty in the Winghouse, a little bar-restaurant on the outskirts of Tampa, his favorite hangout. He told me on the phone I would recognize him by his skinhead. Sure enough, when I spot a white guy at a table by the door with a shaved head, white tank top and bulging muscles, I know it can only be him.\n \n Over a plate of chicken wings, he tells me about his path into the white-power movement. \"I was 14 when I decided I wanted to be a Nazi,\" he says. At his first high school, near Los Angeles, he was bullied by black and Latino kids. That's when he first heard Skrewdriver, a band he calls \"the godfather of the white power movement.\" \"I became obsessed,\" he says. He had an image from one of Skrewdriver's album covers - a Viking carrying a staff, an icon among white nationalists - tattooed on his left forearm. Soon after he had a Celtic cross, an Irish symbol appropriated by neo-Nazis, emblazoned on his stomach.\n \n At 15, Fogarty moved with his dad to Tampa, where he started picking fights with groups of black kids at his new high school. \"On the first day, this bunch of niggers, they thought I was a racist, so they asked, 'Are you in the KKK?'\" he tells me. \"I said, 'Yeah,' and it was on.\" Soon enough, he was expelled.\n \n For the next six years, Fogarty flitted from landscaping job to construction job, neither of which he'd ever wanted to do. \"I was just drinking and fighting,\" he says. He started his own Nazi rock group, Attack, and made friends in the National Alliance, at the time the biggest neo-Nazi group in the country. It has called for a \"a long-term eugenics program involving at least the entire populations of Europe and America.\"\n \n But the military ran in Fogarty's family. His grandfather had served during World War II, Korea and Vietnam, and his dad had been a Marine in Vietnam. At 22, Fogarty resolved to follow in their footsteps. \"I wanted to serve my country,\" he says.\n \n Army regulations prohibit soldiers from participating in racist groups, and recruiters are instructed to keep an eye out for suspicious tattoos. Before signing on the dotted line, enlistees are required to explain any tattoos. At a Tampa recruitment office, though, Fogarty sailed right through the signup process. \"They just told me to write an explanation of each tattoo, and I made up some stuff, and that was that,\" he says. Soon he was posted to Fort Stewart in Georgia, where he became part of the 3rd Infantry Division.\n \n Fogarty's ex-girlfriend, intent on destroying his new military career, sent a dossier of photographs to Fort Stewart. The photos showed Fogarty attending white supremacist rallies and performing with his band, Attack. \"They hauled me before some sort of committee and showed me the pictures,\" Fogarty says. \"I just denied them and said my girlfriend was a spiteful bitch.\" He adds: \"They knew what I was about. But they let it go because I'm a great soldier.\"\n \n In 2003, Fogarty was sent to Iraq. For two years he served in the military police, escorting officers, including generals, around the hostile country. He says he was granted top-secret clearance and access to battle plans. Fogarty speaks with regret that he \"never had any kill counts.\" But he says his time in Iraq increased his racist resolve.\n \n \"I hate Arabs more than anybody, for the simple fact I've served over there and seen how they live,\" he tells me. \"They're just a backward people. Them and the Jews are just disgusting people as far as I'm concerned. Their customs, everything to do with the Middle East, is just repugnant to me.\"\n \n Because of his tattoos and his racist comments, most of his buddies and his commanding officers were aware of his Nazism. \"They all knew in my unit,\" he says. \"They would always kid around and say, 'Hey, you're that skinhead!'\" But no one sounded an alarm to higher-ups. \"I would volunteer for all the hardest missions, and they were like, 'Let Fogarty go.' They didn't want to get rid of me.\"\n ....\n The lax regulations have also opened the military's doors to neo-Nazis, white supremacists and gang members - with drastic consequences. Some neo-Nazis have been charged with crimes inside the military, and others have been linked to recruitment efforts for the white right. A recent Department of Homeland Security report, \"Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,\" stated: \"The willingness of a small percentage of military personnel to join extremist groups during the 1990s because they were disgruntled, disillusioned, or suffering from the psychological effects of war is being replicated today.\" Many white supremacists join the Army to secure training for, as they see it, a future domestic race war. Others claim to be shooting Iraqis not to pursue the military's strategic goals but because killing \"hajjis\" is their duty as white militants.\n \n Soldiers' associations with extremist groups, and their racist actions, contravene a host of military statutes instituted in the past three decades. But during the \"war on terror,\" U.S. armed forces have turned a blind eye on their own regulations. A 2005 Department of Defense report states, \"Effectively, the military has a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy pertaining to extremism. If individuals can perform satisfactorily, without making their extremist opinions overt ... they are likely to be able to complete their contracts.\"\n \n Carter F. Smith is a former military investigator who worked with the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command from 2004 to 2006, when he helped to root out gang violence in troops. \"When you need more soldiers, you lower the standards, whether you say so or not,\" he says. \"The increase in gangs and extremists is an indicator of this.\" Military investigators may be concerned about white supremacists, he says. \"But they have a war to fight, and they don't have incentive to slow down.\"\n \n Tom Metzger is the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and current leader of the White Aryan Resistance. He tells me the military has never been more tolerant of racial extremists. \"Now they are letting everybody in,\" he says.\n\n Neo-Nazis are in the Army now | Salon News\n \n Except in this version, even if everybody knows, they still get to stay...\n :shock:\n \n I am so overwhelmed by confidence in the military's false claim of \"unit cohesion\" as an excuse to continue the anti-gay military exclusion policy...\n I'm sure the racists provide excellent \"unit cohesion\"!\n \n Gays? Must be kept out.\n Racists? Not a problem...",
