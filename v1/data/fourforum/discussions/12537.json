   "Those American henchmen who have got foot in EU by Washington&#8217;s support will finish us off! At first Poland showed herself off in EU and now Romania is dreaming about returning former territories by help of EU!\n I can&#8217;t understand since when Romania has great funds for realization this project by overthrow of power in Moldavia. Look, I remember that not long ago Bucharest supplicated for money for negotiation of global financial crisis supervening, who has helped them? Washington, I&#8217;m sure!\n I wonder, does anybody in Romania think what their officials do? Look, Romania could draw into a war EU and NATO! What the hell is going on? Anyone is trying to use the European union for its own benefit! What for did Romania enter the EU? Was it for solving its own problems by our hands? I don&#8217;t want it!",
