   "This site has been open since September 12th, 2001. It is for serious adult discussion regarding terrorism, national and global events, breaking news government, tracking terrorist web sites and translating them.\n \n We also have many sections just to chit chat, get or give advise about many other topics as well.\n \n The owner of the site was responsible for transferring ownership of Al-Quedas primary web site out of their hands and into ours. CNN, among many publications did segments on this achievment. You can read up on this particular accomplishment here:  http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/08/08/porn.patriot/ \n (Note: He no longer has any ties to the web porn business... and there are no pop ups or ads on the site I am discussing.)\n \n Since September 12th, 2001 it has been the leading location to view peoples opinions from all areas of the world, all ethnicities, religions, governmental parties, etc. And it is a place to have your voice heard.\n \n If this sounds like something of interest to you, please feel free to stop by and visit us at http://www.itshappening.com and take a look.\n \n We are always happy to have more people joining the discussions.\n \n Cheers.",
