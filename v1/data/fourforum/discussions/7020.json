According to the article, this one passenger, who was sitting some distance away from Alpizar in the aircraft, and apparently talkng on his cell phone, states that he did not hear the world bomb. This does in no way mean that there was never any mention of a bomb. It simply means that this one passenger did not hear it.\n \n 2.
