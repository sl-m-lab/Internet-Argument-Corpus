   "\n You obviously do not understand. Several countries, including Thailand have regulated industries that, in specific parts that aren't corrupted, have very low rates of disease when compared to unregulated parts of the industry. Manadatory condom usage, monthly testing, taxes. It appears many of the countries who do regualte actually make a sizable tax income off of legalization. Look at Las Vegas. Specific counties there legalize it. \n \n\n \n Las Vegas is in Clark County, where prostitution is illegal. Nevada's code on prostitution makes it a county option, with that option going away when a county's population exceeds (I believe) 400,000. Clark County (Las Vegas) has the ability to amend that code, but a Clark County presence of the largest Mormon population outside of Utah would make it political suicide for any legislator attempting to do so. The result is a 1/2\" section of yellow pages listing 'escort' services promising to fulfill any fantasy, street crime, expanded LE services and a gaping hole in potential tax revenue. The current mayor of Las Vegas has long promoted turning part of the eroding and seedy downtown section into an area of bordellos, but is unable to overcome the Mormon voting block (few of whom live downtown). \n \n The city of Parump, about 60-miles from Las Vegas and in a county where prostitution is legal, has a constant, day and night stream of limos taking customers from the Vegas strip to Parump and then returning them. Those cities in counties with legalized prostitution regulate, value and support their bordellos. Those businesses contribute significant tax revenue, eliminate street crime, participate in community efforts and in general are good neighbors. The working girls are considered part of the community, just as they were in much of the US before 'sin' was turned into a political football supported by belief system leadership.",

And I'm saying that as one who voted for Bush. You are not nearly as brilliant or well informed as you think you are.\n\n \n Clinton followed the lead of Bush Sr. in using all 'surplus' SS funds (anything not paid out in current benefits) for general operating expenses to reduce deficits. Like Bush Sr. after the Gulf War, he also continued reducing military expenses by trading off the ongoing pentagon/defense contractors sleeping buddies with reducing active military and replacing them with reserves and National Guard numbers. \n \n Bush Jr went against all traditional Republican standards and used (uses) public funds, government expansion and war like a drunken sailor to ensure reelection while hoping for favorable historical notice. Unlike Bush Sr. and Clinton attempting an inevitable, gradual decline in US standards of living due to our inability to compete in global markets, this administration has painted themselves into an economic corner. \n \n To discuss surplus as a debate point in a presidential term is ridiculous and uninformed if you know and understand the history and trend of trade imbalance and GDP composition. Other than the obvious, serious shortcomings of Bush Jr's administration, the only current differences in US political parties is which one happens to have a rope in the ring nose of an extremely ignorant and gullible public desperate for return of the 'good old days'.",

There are many factors contributing to our national debt.\n\n \n Actually several administrations, but the causes are basic. We're still living at '80s level mentality with a declining tax base and escalating trade imbalances. While excessive public and consumer spending polishes GDP for public consumption, printing more money on a debt basis severely compounds the problem. This administration has displayed fiscal irresponsibility in exchange for office on a scale that simply can't be maintained. But the general public, with equal disdain for reality, has the same habits and as long as they're told it's OK, will run en mass over the same cliff. That's why current estimates of private wealth, a small body of individuals who pay the majority of taxes, being transferred out of the US in the past three years exceed $11-trillion dollars. A lot of trust funds and almost matches our annual cooked GDP. When one looks at actual numbers, a better picture appears as part of the desperation to get each worker contributing 5% of earnings to drive equity markets. Without lifer 401 (insert various alphabetic numbers) chumps, those markets would already be in disarray. And when baby boomers begin retirement and discover 6.1% average return won't hack it, something had better be ready to replace their equity market withdrawals.",

As we live in a colder climate, those numbers normally fall off during winter as the homeless migrate to warmer climates and then increase as warmer weather arrives. We've watched a steady increase in numbers all winter to the point where our facilities (seating 40) are now at two sittings, we're actively seeking additional volunteers and donations to expand for what looks like ongoing increases all year. Our homeless population has become permanent and will expand.\n \n While those who are destitute include a small percentage of mental causes and burned out drug addicts, what we're seeing in increases is former workers from unskilled to the middle class who lost jobs, couldn't replace them and ran out of resources. Our sheriff tells us there are semi-permanent encampments ranging from a few families to 50 and more people in the federal forests around us. The feds responsible for the forests have been stripped of operating money for all but revenue generating public parks, so unless marijuana is openly being cultivated in large quantities, enforcement is non-existent. \n \n From what we experience and hear, the homeless situation is going to become far, far worse.
