   "One of the most dangerous things an African woman can do is become pregnant. So, along with the winner of my contest for college students, Paul Bowers, I have been visiting the forlorn hospitals here in West Africa. According to the World Health Organization, Sierra Leone has the highest maternal mortality in the world, and in several African countries, 1 woman in 10 ends up dying in childbirth.\n \n It's pretty clear that if men were dying at these rates, the United Nations Security Council would be holding urgent consultations, and a country such as this would appoint a minister of paternal mortality. Yet half-a-million women die annually from complications related to pregnancy or childbirth without attracting much interest because the victims are typically among the most voiceless people in the world: impoverished, rural, uneducated and female.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/opinion/17kristof.html\n \n But women, being less than human, are extremely expendable.\n \n Right, Cybererratus?",

Why see both the woman and the baby die? Most pro-lifers anywhere agree with that. In fact, anyone who is Catholic should believe that, because the Catholic Church holds that position as well.\n \n As for Cyber...he is not a Catholic but an atheist so I have no idea what he will think of this...Atheist + pro-life is quite strange, but not unheard of.",

They don't practice the religion in other words. These are the Catholics who either don't go to mass ever or only go Christmas/Easter.\n\n Yes, I could well imagine that those who are more strongly religious would statistically tend to be more likely to be pro-life. However, there are large numbers of Americans that are religious without being of the sort that attend mass or service regularly - including Catholics. However, just because they do not attend mass or service regularly does not mean that one can claim that they are either atheists or anti-religion. The very fact that they claim allegiance to a particular religion means that they do believe in many or most of that religion's tenets. The fact that they do not attend mass or service as frequently might simply mean that their beliefs may not be as strongly held, or they may not feel as much need to follow religious authorities, rituals or communities.\n \n Either way, my main point was that being pro-choice does not automatically translate into being anti-religion. There is very significant overlap between people who espouse religious beliefs and those that espouse pro-choice views. Certainly, if one takes the extremes of the strongly religious vs atheists, then the strongly religious will be far more likely to be pro-life whereas atheists will be far more likely to be pro-choice. However, those extremes do not consitute the majority of the US population - whose religious views and abortion issue affiliations are far more mixed.",
