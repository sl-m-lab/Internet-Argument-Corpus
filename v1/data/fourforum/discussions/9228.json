   "Conservative Pat Buchanan takes on the tough issues of immigration, ethnicity, religion and race in a book subtitled \"The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America.\" Buchanan sees western civilization as dying. It is not reproducing itself. Birth rates are down due to birth control and abortion. White population was 90% in 1960. It is now 67%. Hispanics make up 14.4% They outnumber blacks. As Mexicans pour into the southwest, whites are leaving California for places like Colorado. There are 12 million illegal aliens in the United States. Liberalism and multiculturalism are to blame. Buchanan faults President Bush for not enforcing immigration laws. He says the Republicans will not put a moratorium on immigration because they see Hispanics as a means of retaining power. Their lust for cheap labor is destroying America's European core as corporations erase borders and undermine nations. Materialism is their religion. Meanwhile, Anglo-Americans are in danger of becoming a minority. Is Buchanan an alarmist? He is steeped in American history. He revers Jackson and Polk. His views reflect the Eisenhower and Reagan eras. He hates globalism and sees unchecked diversity as weakening our culture. He foresees the end of the United States unless our borders are fixed. It is pointless to secure the borders of Korea and Kosovo while neglecting out own. \n \n According to Buchanan, there is a reconquest of the American southwest taking place, that many Mexicans feel the land was stolen from them. It is an idea taught in their schools and promoted by the Mexican government. There have been reports of the Mexican military crossing the U.S. border. America's elite does nothing about it because they are paralyzed by guilt and a fear of being labelled \"racist.\" \n \n White supremacy was accepted before World War I. Everyone believed in the superiority of the white race. No one felt guilt about Indians or blacks. There was no talk of racism or imperialism. Buchanan writes, \"In public life, the charge of \"racism\" has become modernity's equivalent of the charge of heresy in the Inquisition. \n \n From 1492 to 1960, Europe conquered and colonized the world. Between 1914 and 1945, the European empires committed suicide in the two worst wars in history. European mother countries are now being overrun by the descendants of the people they once ruled. \n \n Moslems are overwhelming Europe as Mexicans are illegally entering the United States. Similarly, the Moslems are unwilling to give up their own culture. \n \n Buchanan says the real conflict is between the elites and middle and lower classes, haves and have-nots of America. The elites are loyal only to money and trans-national corporations. They no longer care about country. They hire Hispanics and Asians and pay them less. The elites do not have to live with them. They are secluded in the rich part of town. Their kids go to private schools. Third world workers are thrust on the middle and lower classes. The workers do not care for American culture. They do not want to speak English. They wave flags of the countries they came from. This is in contrast to the immigrants who came to America during the Great Wave 1890-1920. They wanted to be Americans. It was possible to assimilate them. What is going on now is not Ellis Island. \n \n Buchanan gives the west one last chance. Specific things must be done. There must be a moratorium on immigration, and we must decide whom we will let it after the melting pot has healed. We should accept only those who bring something to our country, preferrably English-speaking, educated Christians. We need to build a 2,000 mile fence along our sounthern border, end dual citizenship and birthright citizenship to children of illegals. We need to deport criminals. It is up to our leaders to act.",

   "Who gave up their culture? Jews? Irish? British? Who did that?\n \n \n Did I miss the part when the Catholics gave up their culture??\n \n As far as abortion, up to 50% are black. Whites abort, 1 out of four women in the U.S. have. 25% of our female population in other words and race is not an indicator.\n \n Muslims taking over Europe? Ok. Christians and Jews have been in the middle east since the dawn of time. I figure how can we do less. Unless we follow our fellow Christian, Hitler's plan.",
