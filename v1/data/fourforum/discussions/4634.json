It, like most tax code, is complicated, includes carry back year(s) deductions/additions and other factors which affect adjusted, actual tax rates. A tax rate can't be quoted without actual numbers to make the calculation. \n \n In short, the donor is normally liable for taxes, not the recipient. On the surface, a high income taxpayer could gift (money) a low income taxpayer at a substantially lower tax rate than the low income taxpayer could incur taxable wages. The secondary possibility could be moving post-tax revenue producing assets to a trust where the low income taxpayer receives that revenue as a trustee, is taxed at a lower rate than the higher bracket donor and avoids future inheritance taxes. There are a variety of legitimate ways to move revenue producing assets and money around while reducing tax exposure, but anyone who doesn't use a good registered agent CPA and tax lawyer, I stress good as every profession has a percentage of incompetents, is usually asking for trouble.",

It rings too much of a dystopia where everything is done by force...\n \n Honestly, when the government discourages gifts, and supports taxation, we are approaching a society that shuns voluntary transactions and supports brute force.
