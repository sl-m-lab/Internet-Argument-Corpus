   "Unbelieveable. I'm sitting here reading the accounts of the people who suffered, were tortured, raped, lost children, etc. under Saddam Hussein testify in his trial. It absolutely turns my stomach to hear what this man did to people. Then I turn over to the CNN website, and what is their headline? \"Hussein threatens to skip court.\" They're playing up Hussein's words in the court, making a big deal about his outbursts and words of defiance, and aren't even focused on the things these people are recounting. It's absolutely surreal! I don't see how ANYBODY could not see the way the liberal media has spun this whole thing from the beginning, from the outset to even Saddam's trial! Has America gotten THAT dumbed down? \n \n The real story here is that these people are confirming what Bush and others said about Saddam!! Where the heck is the reporting on that? I'm just flabbergasted at how many people seem to sympathize with this nut. I've heard a few posters right here in these forums downplay Saddam and his horrors in order to make Bush look bad and only focus on the fact Bush went to war. \n \n Absolutely freaky.",

   "The news is that these accounts confirm a lot of what Bush and others have \n said about Saddam.\n\n \n So the \"news\" regarding Saddams trial is what shrub said? You live in a sorry little world, friend. Liberal media spinning the trial? If they were trying to really \"spin\" the trial, they would be heavily reporting that thus far, no witness has testified that they actually heard Saddam order ANYBODY killed. \n \n We all know that the trial is a farce...just the precurser to an already forgone conclusion. IT will be interesting to see how the defense team plays this off, though. I would imagine that it is likely they do the same thing the US does when it gets caught torturing and murdering people...they will try to blame it on the underlings and claim they were acting without Saddams knowledge. \n \n I don't think that anybody has argued that Saddam was a nice guy, though I have argued that he was a hell of a lot nicer than the Sauds or those bastards in Kuwait...our allies.\n \n Saddams antics are not news?\n \n http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2005/11/29/flashes_of_old_hussein_set_off_ripples/?page=2\n \n \nThat mix of imperiousness and theatrical flair has revived the dictator's image, which plummeted even among sympathizers when he was led out of an underground hole by American troops in December 2003, haggard, dirty, and meek.\n\n \n \nSuch language endears Hussein to the constituency that actively or passively backs the insurgency in Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland -- places such as Hussein's birthplace, Awja, where yesterday protesters chanted ''Yes, yes to Saddam\" in a demonstration broadcast on Iraqi television.\n \n In recent days, Baghdad residents in the Sunni insurgent stronghold neighborhood of Aadhamiya spoke openly of their affection for Hussein -- which has grown, many of them said, over the last year as the elected, Shi'ite-dominated government has failed to curb crime, terrorism, and the insurgency.\n\n \n I owuld say that is news. The murdering despot is drumming up support while he is in prison. Who knows....if he gets enough, we may not get to see the end fo the trial. His strategy here is golden.\n \n Personally, I am not really actively followign the trial. i am just interested to see whether they execute him immediatly after the current bit is over. The crimes in Dujail were an interesting pick for the opening round, since they are pretty much the least of the crimes he is accused of. That is, until you consider the fact that it took place a year before the US became heavily involved in Iraq and that to closely examine the other charges would almost without doubt implicate the US.",

   "Saddam threatened to skip court. Big deal. I do not know, but I think even if he skips court, his attorneys would still be there listening. They probably still would have the trial. Just without his presense. But, then again, I may be wrong.\n I really think it is wrong what he did. No individual on gods green earth should have to endure such harsh behaviors as Saddam Hussein exhibited.\n He is a killer. He raped thousands, he allowed his family to participate in the crimes, he murdered probably a million I would think, he tortured a hell of a lot of people, and this is not right.\n Power hungry people like this need to stop thinking about power and authority they have over others. They need to realize communism and stuff like that does not work. Look at communist countries today. They spend a lot of money on their military and government then they do on their people. During Saddams Regime, a lot of people were poor. \n But, today, look at Iraq. It is prospering and becoming greater by the years. \n One of you said, well why does the media have to keep announcing this stuff over again? Half the stuff that happened a while ago is old news. Well, ther reason being is because most forget. Hell, a lot of people forgot about the holocaust or thought it did not happen. Most people think that because we are fortunate to live in a country that is nothing like Saddams, that nothing like that could ever happen. But, it did.\n Incidents like the #### Hittler and Saddam pull is going on in many countries in Africa, and al throughout the world. \n My theory is that Saddam is getting angry in court because he knows he is going to be executed, and he is in a denial stage. He knows that he is no longer president. He is a thug, and I hope he dies.\n Let me get a hoorah!!!!",

It is no longer a tyrannical government forcing them to vote for a single dictator or die.\n \n \n \n \n\n So a suicide bomber is gutless and cowardly, but a US pilot dropping cluster munitions in residential areas from 40,000 ft is brave and honorable? \n \n Can we say blind, ignorant patriotism?\nI don't know that they did this. Do you have any credible links?...some links that aren't \"dedicated to exposing the cruelties of war and the Bush administration\"?\n \n Perhaps you should try listening to some real Iraqi citizens rather than make up stories.

Under the watchful eye of Saddam's thugs, these \"voters\" must sign their names to the \"ballots,\" and any who dare vote \"no\" can expect to be executed.\n \n \n http://www.thechrismatthewsshow.com/102002.html\n \n CHRIS MATTHEWS, host: Before we go to break, this week Saddam Hussein faced the voters of Iraq. In the 1995 presidential election Saddam ran unopposed: 99.96 percent of the people said yes to another seven-year term, .04 percent said no. \n Well, the Iraqis went to the polls again this week and again Saddam's was the only name on the ballot. And look at this. He's even more popular now. A hundred percent said yes to their leader. A hundred percent. It sure helps to run against nobody. Even Jay Leno thought it was, as they say, a bit odd. \n Mr. JAY LENO: Talk about job security. Yesterday, the election in Iraq, Saddam Hussein got 100 percent of the vote, 100 percent.

   "Erm, hello?\n \n The Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, topped his personal best election performance by securing 100% of the vote in yesterday's referendum, election officials said today.\nI'm not sure of your intent here because the above could be used to support either side of this semantics digression. If he topped his best election performance (as said by election officials), why is it a stretch to call the referendum (designed to determine if the people thought he should stay in power) an election?\n \n Comparing a referendum to an election should fit the apples/oranges bag. However, as the referendum in question included his name (and his name only) on the ballot, it was indeed an election, as many people have referred to it as such.\n \n Besides, this is just a senseless digression to formulated to take away from the main point of my original statement regarding it. Saddams name was the only name on the ballot.\n \n My original statement was:\n \n \nGive me a break! He used his overwhelming military might and gutless weapons to murder thousands of his own people in fear of being defeated in an honest election. {after all...his was the only name on the ballot for a many \"elections\". }\n \nThe first use of the word election is completely legitimate. The second is in quotation marks, meant to imply a dubious definition of fairness was being promoted by the \"voting\".\n \n The daewoo comes back with:\n \n \nHis name was never the only name on the ballot. When nobody would run against him, he assigned somebody. \n\n \n Then I linked:\n \n \nThe ABC and NBC stories followed some cheerleading from CNN, as related in the October 15 CyberAlert: A plug for American Morning with Paula Zahn on CNN&#8217;s Web site promised a look at how &#8220;Iraqi citizens are preparing to go to the polls to decide whether Hussein stays in office.&#8221; The story which actually aired acknowledged that he&#8217;s the only name on the ballot, but fill-in host Carol Costello nonetheless stressed how in the days before the big vote &#8220;the mood on the street&#8221; in Iraq &#8220;is more festive than afraid.&#8221; Reporter Nic Robertson passed along how &#8220;students at Baghdad's fine arts school, too young to vote in the last referendum in 1995, appear eager now.&#8221; For details:\n http://www.mediaresearch.org/cyberal...20021015.asp#2 \n \n\n \n The daewoo fires back:\n \n \nI prefer to get details from sources that are not \"dedicated to exposing liberal media bias\", and preferably souirces where their links actually go to the relevant information, as opposed to being ghost links.\n \n In 96, Saddam assinged one of his sons to run against him. If he was the only name ont he ballot, how could he possibly not have gotten 100% of the vote? There are not \"write in\" options in Iraq. If he didn't get 100%, there HAD TO BE another option. This is not rocket science, Jim.\nNote that he cleverly went from the \"election\" I mentioned where he was indeed the only name on the ballot to a previous \"election\" where he played a similar trick, knowing he would still win.\n \n My original claim that he is afraid of a real election has not yet been refuted.\n \n I then linked:\nTry this one!\n It was on the occasion of Saddam Hussein's final presidential referendum. To encourage a large voter turnout, Saddam's secret service monitored the polling stations, and to ensure his victory, his was the only name listed on the ballot. Not surprisingly, Saddam won a landslide victory &#8211; securing 100%of the votes from a 100% voter turnout.\n \n http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exer...81B088805B.htm\n \n...clearly pointing out that I was not referring to the 1996 \"election\" but the \"referendum/election\" where his name was the only one on the ballot.\n \n Then...:\nYour link from AJ is completely unrelated. They are talkign about the 2002 referendum. It was a simple yes/no vote. Should Saddam remain in power...yes/no. They circled one. The last time they had to actually vote for a canidate was 1996. \nThis is where he dodges the original issue with semantics. A cheap and time consuming trick.\n \n My math is not flawed and neither is the logic behind the point I tried to make. daewoo exhibits obtuseness in his unrelenting effort to criticize anyone who posts positive things about the Iraqi situation and our (US/Iraqi)struggle for their freedom from a murdering tyranical family.\n \n If that is not clear to all you fine people who actually do understand logic, I cannot make it so.",

Let THEM decide whether they want us there rather than the anti-war industry here in the U.S. At least give freedom a friggin' chance.\n \n \nProviding the ability to vote is a domineering, desperate measure of defining freedom\n\n \n I'm sure glad our founding fathers didn't take such a low esteem of voting when they enacted it. Somehow I doubt they would have viewed voting as 'desperate' and 'domineering.'",

   "Guys, if we return to the topic and recapitulate the whole thing, we get to this:\n \n -Iraq has proven itself as a very hard place to govern, for Saddam, the US and the new Iraqui government.\n -Saddam adopted a heavy handed strategy, using significant amounts of force to establish and retain control. A part of this were mass killings, genocidal acts and similar, killing thousands.\n -these acts are condemned by just about all posters.\n -the media reports of the trial are focusing on things that happen at the trial, not on the charges themselves.\n \n Now, however, I would open some questions:\n -is Saddam actually on trial for the mass killings? If yes, some mention of these acts would be expected, although they are by now common knowledge. If not, then media focus is rather understandable, but it does make us wonder about why the charges do not include these acts.\n -if the US is using the Iraqui resistance to justify heavy handed approaches (shock and awe, cluster bombs, incendiaries and similar), can these then not apply to Saddam, too?",
