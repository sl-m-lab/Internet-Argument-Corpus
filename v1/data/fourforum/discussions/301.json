   "What do you all think of midwife assisted childbirth? I dont neccessarily mean just in homebirths, but what about midwives in hospitals and birthing centers. Increasingly, in north America, midwives are being marginalized. Not just lay midwives, i.e. men (yes, there are male midwives!) and women with no actualy training, but also certified midwives who have to go through 2 or 3 year courses including intensive hands on training, are finding it harder an harder to work around government regulations. In some places midwives may only practise if they have a doctor to act as a backup, but few if any doctors are willing to act as backups for midwives.\n \n While its true that only a small percentage of people actually seek out a midwife's services, government restrictions are so stifling that there arent enought midwives to meed even that demand. Reasons that women and their partners generally choose midwives over obstetricians include a greater degree of control over the birth process, a higher degree of respect towards the mother, lack of unnecessary intervention including episiotomies, efm and forceps birth, lower c-section rate and more control on procedures performed on the newborn.\n \n Inspite of the fact that mortality rates for midwife assisted births in lowrisk women is equall to or less than that in traditional births, many insurance companies refuse to cover them, mostly because doctors still insist that they are dangerous. I, for one, would like to see fewer regulations and more understanding in this matter.",
