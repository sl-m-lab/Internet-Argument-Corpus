   "I just stumbled across an interesting article:\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4543767.stm\n \n It put me in mind of Kronus stating how he wanted an intelligent discussion on this forum and various people pointing out to him how that wasn't possible with creationists around. \n \n So I'm offering up this article as a possible discussion point because I personally feel it adds weight to the \"aquatic ape\" hypothesis of human evolution. This basically argues that ape species that evolved into humans didn't live on the plains of Africa, but instead lived close to the shore of the sea or lakes. We have become the only ape species that can swim, hold our breath under water etc due to effectively becoming a semi-aquatic species. This forced us to becoem upright in posture and provided the nutrients that removed the selection pressure away from large brains allowing us to evolve a trully massive brain for our body size. The idea that early humans spread out of Africa along the coast supports this idea as that was the habitat we occupied.\n \n So does any NON CREATIONIST \"aquatic ape\" detractor care to argue otherwise?",
