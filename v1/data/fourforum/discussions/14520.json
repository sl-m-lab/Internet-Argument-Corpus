   "hi. ive noticed some trends when listening to music from different areas of the world. i listen to mainly post-rock music but i listen to many different genres. here is my CD collection. thats about 250-300 CDs.\n \n also, here is a grooveshark playlist to follow along with. to get what im talking about, i suggest at least sampling each track.\n \n some trends that ive noticed:\n American Music\n to me, american music feels a bit watered down. that doesnt mean its bad, my favorite band is american. it just seems like american musicians could do better than what they do.\n \n examples:\n this will destroy you - a three legged work horse\n glassjaw - ape dos mil\n \n Canadian Music\n i find canadian music to be very empowering. i feel motivated and emotional when i listen to canadian music, and that makes me proud to be canadian.\n \n examples:\n final fantasy (owen pallatt) - this is the dream of win and regine\n arcade fire - neighborhood 1: tunnels\n \n British Music\n i really dislike british music as a whole. its far too 'chav-y' for me. there is one band that i love very much though, and thats the cinematic orchestra. there are a couple bands that stand out, but as a whole, it just doesnt have enough impact.\n \n examples:\n mogwai - like herod (chav-y)\n the cinematic orchestra - everyday\n \n Swedish Music\n like canadian music, swedish music is really powerful. you can tell the swedes take their music very seriously.\n \n examples:\n cult of luna - finland\n jeniferever - alvik\n \n Icelandic Music\n i feel very dreamy and spiritual when listening to icelandic music. there's a certain aura about it that i think no other regional music has.\n \n examples:\n sigur ros - gobbledigook\n mum - marmalade fires\n \n i think that geographical landscapes influence musicians a lot. i can even imagine what iceland looks like just from listening to the music from there. the geography of a certain place influences many things about us, but what else would cause such drastic separation of music between countries, seemingly close together in geographical setting such as canada and america or britian and sweden? cultural differences? political differences? these things of course help develop a person when they are being raised as a child, so these differences probably develop creative influence as well.",

   "Please don't base all American music on what you hear on MTV and American Idol.\n \n That said - don't forget we are the origination of jazz, rock, blues, country, and funk! :)\n \n Not to diss the Canucks - my fave band is Canadian (the Headstones).",
