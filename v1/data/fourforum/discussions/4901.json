   "\"Another associate said Powell had little trust or affection for the hard-line conservative and The New York Times reported the he expressed reservations about Bolton to Republican Sens. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska..... \n \n The president has made it clear that John Bolton is the right person at the right time for this important position,\" White House spokesman Scott McClellan said on Friday. \"The Senate needs to stop playing politics and get him confirmed.\" \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20050422/ts_nm/bush_bolton_dc_31\n \n Apparently to the Bush Adminstration, Congress is suppose to do whatever the white house wants, wasn't there suppose to be checks and balances in this government? \n \n Anyways, good for Powell, he's casting off the **** that Bush made him do.",

   "I always felt Powell, like many of we traditional Republicans, never knew what was in store for us when the current administration was empowered. Powell's integrity and intellect must have taken a terrible beating during that four years. His replacement, grating, without style or international experience, seems more of a fit for the crusader and cronies. \n \n All I know of Bolton is that he's touted as a 'team' player (which to me means\n subservient with little personal integrity) and prone to ferocious temper tantrums, especially when dealing with subordinates in a demeaning manner. I do find it unusual that politicians, who have multiple personality defects would question his appointment, which to me means where there's smoke fire normally follows. There are even Republicans questioning his suitability. Sounds like, for obvious reasons, that he'd fit right in with the rest of the administration.",
