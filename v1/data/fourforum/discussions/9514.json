   "Can't recall the author's name at the moment, but previews for the upcoming movie \"300\" brought it back to mind. (The movie is based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller of \"Sin City\" fame, and I'd recommend it as well)\n Gates of Fire, though, is \"historical fiction\" about the Battle of Thermopylae. If you're a history buff, you'll be up late for sure, so hopefully you'll start reading on a Friday evening. :)\n If you're not so into history I'd imagine you'd still find it entertaining. It's one of the better written examples of said \"historical fiction\" I've come across.\n Check it out.",
