   "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6769668/site/newsweek/\n \n \n The link is to an interview of Bishop Desmond Tutu, the South African Archbishop who pressed for the end of apartheid. Over a good read with this being the most significant quote in my mind\n \n \nJust look at the facts on the table: He'd gone into a war having misled people-whether deliberately or not-about why he went to war. You would think that would have knocked him out [of the race.] It didn't. Look at the number of American soldiers who have died since he claimed that the war had ended. And yet it seems this doesn't make most Americans worry too much. I was teaching in Jacksonville, Fla., [during the election campaign] and I was shocked, because I had naively believed all these many years that Americans genuinely believed in freedom of speech. [But I] discovered there that when you made an utterance that was remotely contrary to what the White House was saying, then they attacked you. For a South African the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was frightening. They behaved exactly the same way that used to happen here [during apartheid]-vilifying those who are putting forward a slightly different view.\n\n \n The bold area is the one that I find the most disconcerting, when the general public is pushing for censorship, how difficult is it for the government and media to censor without a public outcry.",

Contemporary political manipulation is larger in scope and not exclusive to any nation. \n \n My viewpoint on the dumbing up of America stems from my interpretation of our ideology, which stresses government by the people for the people. Our constitution states that our military is a defense mechanism. I interpret that as being maintained for defense purposes at a high enough level to accomplish adequate retaliation in the event of an attack, leading to eventual defeat of that attacker. I see nothing in our constitution that provides for direct military aggression against another sovereign nation or assisting other nations that would invoke direct military aggression without being the victim of a military attack. \n \n That said, we've spent the last 50 or so years as an aggressor, facilitating with military and/or monetary aid, and in the cases of Vietnam, Iraq and some banana republics, direct military aggression without once being attacked by a sovereign nation. Those actions, past and present, now account for 50% of our national budget. And the America is right no matter what mentality generated by a self-serving government and accepted by the general public.\n \n That government control and waste of resources has permeated our social structure to an extent that many Americans now look to a somewhat autonomous government body to provide them with personal direction and care for them from cradle to grave. Our electoral process has degenerated into a popularity contest judged by who can spend the largest amount of public funds in capturing votes, accelerating the loss of personal responsibility and national wealth. \n \n When our government is viewed as the will of the American public, it becomes obvious as to why we've encountered great resistance to our foreign policy from the international community. Domestically, our social structure now takes direction from central government example, further diluting individual responsibility. As government continues to eliminate any requirement for personal responsibility, mediocrity becomes the norm, resulting in deterioration of our educational, judicial and related social systems. At some point, whatever central government dictates is detached from our constitutional intent and becomes the prevalent rule based on government by majority consensus. That majority consensus being soundly shaped by secretive government policy and drumming whatever message it prefers the public to accept into their heads by waving a flag, invoking mythological standards and constructing a sense of national fear with the government as sole redemption. \n \n Just my opinion. We've drifted way off course and we're running downwind. Getting back on course will more than likely take hitting a rock of some sort or another. \n \n I think the discussion does in a sense relate to the remarks of Tutu and others who are not intimidated (nothing to lose) by US military and economic clout. The pope just harps on about homosexual marriage and other such vital issues to avoid world political controversy.",

You have the economic data at your fingertips, I was trying to probe opinion about the nature of public susceptibility to government and media driven propaganda. You focus on insurmountable economic difficulties. \n \n If I've understood what's been asserted previously, it seems that an excess of patriotic zeal tends to leave the American public open to manipulation by the deceitful messages of politicians etc. I asked how this might be remedied (and answered the question myself by suggesting better civic education and rational thinking).

To me, the current economic situation has developed due to what you surmise and has been discussed, the ability of politicians to lead the American public in an irresponsible, self-serving manner using patriotism as motivation, with the economic circumstance urgency overshadowing long-term solutions. \n \n Your suggestion of better civic education and rational thinking is certainly a viable solution.

   "One paradox I've noticed after reading this thread through again, is that contributors (generally speaking) are worried about the probability that the American public is being \"subverted\" by government propaganda that exploits the \"weakness\" that might be detected in unthinking patriotism. But, from what I've seen of American TV, it's dominated by liberal commentators and pundits who are almost always opposed to the administration point of view when the Republicans are in power. \n The messages about what to think that the American people are receiving from the news media would seem to contradict what the (present) government wants them to believe - if my reasoning here isn't total hogwash.\n\n i believe there is a lot of conservatism in the media, and very little liberalism. the liberal commentators and pundits are usually waved away and discredited by the mainstream news media itself. in fact, a lot of these \"pundits\" are often directly slandered with personal attacks that have nothing to do with the issues they raise and everything to do with swaying the public view of them. i dont see them \"dominating\" tv at all.",

To facilitate public acceptance of government policies, the economy must be kept at a level meeting current standards of living for a majority of the voting voting public, a common governing objective. Public expenditures utilizing public debt to drive GDP numbers, the US political and general public economic focal point, beyond debt service ability is the only critical issue. That turning point is out of US hands, limited or encouraged by the purchasers of our debt. \n \n With regard to to the feasibility of better civic education and rational thinking as a solution to the core problem, I refer to prior posts examining the general quality of education in the US through the undergrad level. By all reports that quality has declined on a scale closely following the increase in public expenditures as the general populace continues to turn to government for direction with diminishing reliance on personal responsibility.",

I see liberals like Rather, Jennings and Moyer on TV nightly and turn the channel away from them nightly.

When ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC have pundits on, it's usually 3 from the Left and one from the Right, with the three ganging up on the lone Conservative. Hardly \"fair and balanced\". FoxNews has leveled the playing field, and in doing so, has pulled huge numbers of viewers away from the major networks.

Personal demonstrations are limited to official permits, close law enforcement observation and, as in the case of Rice's recent speaking engagement, actually moving the demonstration from the immediate area to eliminate disturbance of the speaker. If you've ever experienced a visit by any ranking executive branch individual to your city, you can understand why demonstrations are, for the most part, ineffective at this point. The security is so overwhelming that traffic is restricted to a point where people would require busing in to amass a crowd. If a permit was issued. The press won't move from a position of reporting and supporting administration claims until they sense the public mood, advertiser audiences, has moved from a position of administrative support to displeasure with government policies. Like the public viewing body bags, this administration heeded the power of free speech assemblies that turned the media from support of Vietnam to honest reporting.",
