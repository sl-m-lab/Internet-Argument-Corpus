   "At Least 30 GIs die in Iraq in 72 hours. The Chickenhawk Bush Cartel Needs to be Impeached and Tried. Save Our Soldiers. Save Our Nation. Fight Incompetence and Lying: Impeach Bush and Cheney. 4/7\n \n \n \n \n 30 GIs die in Iraq in 72 hours  \n \n \n \n Newsday \n \n WASHINGTON -- This week in Iraq marks one of the bloodiest periods for Americans since the war ended; 30 soldiers have been killed in just 72 hours. If Iraq had been simmering in the background, it has moved front-and-center now, and the timing is likely to prove troublesome for President Bush. \n With Bush hoping to win re-election as a wartime president, political analysts say continued violence in Iraq could threaten Bush's hold on the White House. Unfortunately for Bush, the news from the military campaign isn't any better, as even his own generals now are raising a politically explosive topic for an election year: The United States might need to send more troops to Iraq. \n The violence Tuesday, including an attack that killed as many as 12 U.S. Marines, comes on the heels of the shocking images last week of charred and battered American corpses in Fallujah. \n \"To a certain degree over time, people become numb to it all, but they don't become numb to days like this one,\" Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said Tuesday. \"The more days like this, the more people will say, we have to vote for change.\" \n The Bush administration transition toward putting the Iraqis in power is June 30. Bush is holding firm to that date for a handover, though congressional leaders are questioning whether it can happen in the face of all this violence. \n This week's events also have given ammunition to Democrats like Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a leading opponent of the war, who on Monday called Iraq \"Bush's Vietnam.\" \n Bush's presidential rival, Sen. John Kerry called the June 30 deadline \"a fiction\" devised to hand over Iraqi control well before the presidential election.",

   "The news that so many American GIs have been killed in Iraq in such a short amount of time is tragic. I hoped there would be some respect shown to these brave young men and what it was they were fighting for and avoid politicising their deaths, but I guess not. I for one am thankful that these kinds of people exist, and I sincerely hope we can complete our mission in Iraq and get the rest of them home.",

   "Hey, I understand. After the Fallujah incident last week I had an urge to napalm the whole damn city. I don't feel that way all the time either, I just have a huge problem with desecration of bodies. Once someone is dead, you should try and treat their body with respect as a human being. That's my opinion at least.",
