   "Speaking at the National Press Club for the Gerald R. Ford Foundation journalism awards, Cheney was asked about recent rulings and legislative action in Iowa and elsewhere that allowed for gay couples to legally wed.\n \n \"I think that freedom means freedom for everyone,\" replied the former V.P. \"As many of you know, one of my daughters is gay and it is something we have lived with for a long time in our family. I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish. Any kind of arrangement they wish. The question of whether or not there ought to be a federal statute to protect this, I don't support. I do believe that the historically the way marriage has been regulated is at the state level. It has always been a state issue and I think that is the way it ought to be handled, on a state-by-state basis. ... But I don't have any problem with that. People ought to get a shot at that.\"\n\n Cheney Offers Support For Gay Marriage\n YouTube - Dick Cheney on Same-Sex Marriage\n \n emoticon_ic\n I think I just found one very good example of how the \"gay\" issue is really losing ground as a \"Republican v Democrat\" issue, cause the Republicans are losing their position (on the party population basis).\n \n Even today, Republicans (popular opinion within the party) support gay equality on MOST gay issues like civil unions (which actually covers a LOT more issues), gays in the military, no sodomy laws, ENDA, hate crimes legislation, etc, etc...\n (Of course, the party LEADERS is an entirely different situation... :xbanghead )\n \n And also, it's a way to show people that BEING OUT MATTERS.\n People can pass all sorts of vile \"this is what gays are like\" junk stereo-types all over the place.\n But when the recipient KNOWS a gay person, and REALIZES the claims are false, bigotry loses a foot-hold.",

   "Wow, well, actually isn't his daughter a lesbian? I remember reading something like that a while back. Honestly, I think gay marriage will become legal some time in the future. You just can't discriminate people like that. It is no different then the discrimination that Jim Crow laws brought.",

I am not commenting about his position on other issues. \n \n I do think that we should pressure President Obama on gay rights. I think he should exercise leadership in pushing for the repeal of the federal DOMA law, for example. He has said that he opposes Don't Ask, Don't Tell, but I hear he is doing nothing to try to repeal it. I think we should push for more leadership from him on equality for gay people, especially in areas where he has said he will act but has yet to do so.",

Fighting against ENDA. Fighting against hate crimes legislation. Fighting against gays in the military.\n As I pointed out in another thread, the recent set of gay marriage advances have been in Democrat dominated state congress's.\n And when a Governor has voted against it? Republican...\n \n Good for Cheney. It's a pity he didn't have the courage to say that while in office.\n But obviously, that would have come with severe repercussions from the RNC itself...",
