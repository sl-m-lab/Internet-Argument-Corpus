   "Though this is not an original idea...I have heard it discussed in several venues...I am wondering what would be the result of a period of suspension of taxation to allow wage earners to spend the extra income on their own rather than have a group of biased congressmen determine where the money should be spent.\n \n I am not talking about a suspension of income taxes only. That would benefit only those that pay income taxes. I mean a suspension of taxation....payroll deductions, federal sales tax. If only for a month, it would seem that money would begin to flow from the hands of consumers and users into the business economy. It would be spent as the individuals choose and not for the benefit of special interest groups or contractors that grease the palms of our dishonest representatives in government.\n \n If a person is not employed by a bridge builder or another local company related to bridge building, what good does it do that person for the federal government to spend millions on a new bridge?",

   "Generally bridges are built to connect two locations. For example, near where I used to live it has long been proposed that there be a bridge across Morecambe Bay, linking the old shipyard town of Barrow with the M6 motorway, hence opening the extremely deprived Cumbrian coast to development and investment. In that instance the bridge would benefit hundreds of thousands of people. I imagine there are similar instance in the US. The problem with tax cuts as a solution to the economic crisis is that they are extremely imprecise - you cannot control what the money is spent on, which means it may well be spent on Chinese imports from Walmart, which isn't a great boost to the US economy. Even worse, people will pay off credit cards and overdrafts, or save the money, effectively just adding to the already massive and pretty worthless bank bailouts. To take full advantage of the multiplier effects in the economy, money needs to be spent on infrastructure projects that will employ people in the short term and make the economy more efficient in the long term.",
