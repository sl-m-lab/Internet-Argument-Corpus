They tell you bad things you dont want to hear . They stick things up your keester that just dont belong up there. But, alas, I end up going to them anyway, because fear aside, they do help me stay alive. The Christian belief is to help keep your spiritual being stay healthy and alive. A good dose of fire and brimstone is needed to help keep one on track, much like a bad cholestrol reading from your doctor...\n \n \n Needless to say we have all witnessed or read of the negative aspects of Christianity. Maybe we will all get to ask those souls that were tormented and burned at the stake for professing their faith back in the middle ages, about their fears. Maybe we will get to ask them just why their \"fear \" of Christianity, didnt overpower their desire to live, when all they had to do was denounce Christ to the King , in order to save themselves from being burned at the stake ? ... \n \n \n In my 52 years of life I have spent a lot of time at peoples sick/death beds . I have spent 12 years of my life working in a hospital . Both enviroments provided the very emotional aspect of human suffering. Both were rampant with visual pain from the person laying on the sickbed, or sometimes death bed. Of all the people I have watched die or suffer, I have yet to see one, that after their clergy held their hand and said a prayer with them, would roll up in a ball and cry in fear. If I recollect, it always seem that a strange, peaceful calm came to their distorted faces, like they had just got the best fuzzy in the world.",

And as far as rules go, there are a lot of rules outside religion, and I learned very early on in my life that breaking rules can result in punishment. I did not need to be taught this by religion. I find that it is easier just to not break the rules. So if somehow I can miraculously manage to behave on my own without the aid of religion (pehaps by using a little something called comon sense), why do I have to pledge eternal homage to god or jesus?",

They simply do not believe in the same things you believe in, for numerous reasons.\n \n The past transgressions or the transgressions of Christians today certainly don't cause me to fear, or even dislike, Christianity, they cause me to dislike those that have transgressed, especially when they do so in the name of Christianity. \n \n You can rest assured that for 99% of non-believers, their non-belief has nothing to do with \"the rules\". The rules exist in our society regardless of Christianity's presence, we all live by them or face the consequences, now, in this life, there's no need to wait for an afterlife. \n \n Further to that, as has been said, if your only reason for doing the right thing and making a concerted effort in life is fear of consequences, that's the worst possible reason. You're missing out on a lot.\n \n That being said, I do strongly object to being told what I can and can't do, or what is \"moral\" based on one group's religious belief. \n \n There's a reason why religion and law have been separated in all free democratic countries.\n \n Waxy",

Religious beliefs come ready packaged with a \"moral code\" - for example, in the Ten Commandments or extrapolated from the admonitions in the Sermon on the Mount etc. Asked for an \"authority\" for guidance in solving a given moral problem, the Christian person will, if pressed, ultimately cite God or Jesus Christ.\n \n For the secularist individual no such moral authority exists and he/she must work out a moral position on a private basis. This is easier said than done and has to be adjusted, case by case, on fundamental principles.\n \n In countries where religion and law have not been separated (in a theocracy) the \"citizen\" has to be content with having all his moral responses articulated for him by the state; in some ways this makes life \"easier\". Making the effort to make moral judgements for oneself, even where it is permitted to do so, is costly in terms of the reasoning and reflection involved.",

Teral was as good as I have ever witnessed in wringing every bit of \"truth\" out of the scripture as it is written, and he knows the scripture VERY well.

   "Do you not understand the concepts of \"physical reality\" and \"spiritual reality.\"\n \n You say it is not logical. You say you are very logical. You are not, because if you were you would realize that logic is not the problem for you on this one. It is a matter of judgement. You say that it is wrong that murderers go to heaven and the rich don't. You are saying that you know better than god and therefore you will not believe him.\n \n\n \n OH please, I never said I knew more than God. I slo don't believe in god so that is not possible. I am saying that this whole Idea is iilogical. I didn't say I don't get it. I do. ButI don't believe it. there is a difference between not getting it it, and not buying it.\n \n\n Ity is perfectly logical that if spiritual life is a gift that is given then it would not be removed because of behavior. God does not give spiritual life because we deserve it. He does it out of love. How would it seem to go to your wife on your anniversary and say, here is this gift because I am obligated to give you one on your birthday. Talk about illogical.\n\n \n only if you believe and I don't, so therfore I think you are smoking crack! Gifts? I don't have a wife, I have a husband. Remember I am gay! I am obligated to ive him noting. We do not do much for B-days becausewe don't think they are that big a deal as others.\n \n\n If you don't want to believe it fine. Don't. I am not forcing you to. Just don't use logic as the argument. The verse about a rich man and the eye of a needle is preceded by the \"love of money is the root of all evil\" statement and followed by \"but with God all things are possible.\"\n \n\n \n Of course it is logic. If a rich man repents and stays rich, he is not welcome in the kingdom. He must give it all away. In other words....you canot be GW bush with alll that money and come into the kingdom of god. It says so in the bible. Wait, let me get this striaght....if I am rich all my life...murder and rape, but in the end ...repent. I can go into the kingdom? Bull.\n \n \nPlease keep context if you are going to use the bible.\n\n \n I am",

If I could do it myself then Christ need not have died. 2nd your argument is precisely the argument that the apostle Paul argues against in Romans when he says \"now that we are no longer under law but under grace, shall we go on sinning...MAY IT NEVER BE!\" (emphasis mine). Eph 2:8 You are saved by grace through faith and that is not of yourselves but is the gift of God that no man may boast. Romans 8:1 There is therefore now NO CONDEMNATION for those who are in Christ Jesus. \n \n The book of hebrews states that We have a high priest in jesus and an advocate in front of the father. It is he that prevents us from losing our salvation not ourselves. There is nothing in scripture to indicate otherwise. Your simplistic analogy is way off and is argued against by the apostle paul himself. You do not argue any of the points in my post. You simply don't like the idea that God may forgive people who \"aren't as good as you.\" Jesus himself argued against this when he told the story of the priest who said thank you god for not making me like this tax collector and the tax collector who said forgive me father for I am a sinner. \n \n Who are you to declare what God does that is just or unjust. You claim it isn't fair if Hitler or Dahmer are in heaven. You lived a good life after all. Do you not see that is \"self righteousness\" by definition. It is you making you go to heaven. The only righteousness worth anything is That given by Christ. \n \n Sure he wants us to live a good life. But it is not us who does it. We do it the same way we came to salvation in the first place. Through grace by faith. We trust what GOD has already done. If you are trusting your good works to get you to heaven, Read Paul's words where he says, I was born of the nation of israel, circumcised the eighth day of the tribe of benjamin, a pharasee of pharisee's. As to the law found blameless. What does he say about those? Do you know. He says he counts them as DUNG! Rubbish, Garbage to be burned, Animal refuse. He placed his trust in Christ. It is the only thing that can save. \n \n Ryrie provides a much better description and biblical passages. I refer you there for futher reading. In the meantime, pray and ask GOd to show you if I am right or wrong. I believe he will.",

I assumed you to be a christian and would understand that the term simply means one who is able to provide for their own justification and sanctification as opposed to trusting God wholly for it. \n \n I quote the bible because it is THE authority on who God is. There is no other. Your experience may lie to you. How do you know who God is? How do you know He won't allow someone who has murdered into heaven? Do you have this direct line you speak of. I speak only from what the bible tells me. My faith rests there, not my experience. If it rested in my experience I would be dead long ago. I am not \"one of those\" as you say. (Speaking of which, which one of us is really prejudiced to use such a term as \"one of those\".)\n \n You do not answer any of the arguments. The truth is if it is required that we be afraid that God will slam us if we do something wrong then that is not a God worthy of worship. It is the same god of the world that is so well known. Again, Paul argues against this very thing in Romans when he says you have not been given a spirit of fear leading to slavery again.\n \n The fact that you react vehemently only proves my point.\n \n edit: As to where I was when you asked some all important question, how would I know. You actually expect everyone to read everything and respond to you, because you are so all fired important that we should all give up school, jobs, etc just to watch for the one post that might come from you. Just a bit self centered aren't you? I would be happy to answer any question. I will likely use scripture especially if you ask me about God. If I don't know then I don't know. If an agnostic or atheist provides you with an answer you prefer then by all means take it. I am not here to force anything on you.\n \n Christ is able to keep us. if it were not so, then why did he need to die if I could keep myself. Splain it to me lucy! Seriously, answer why Christ would have to die if I could save myself.\n \n What does it say to those looking at this site? It says.......\"What a merciful God they must know, perhaps he would be willing to know me too.\"\n \n I shall darken your door no longer, unless you wish to step back and re read without the chip on your shoulder.",

   "The christian doctrine is that hell really is spiritual death. The christian doctrine is that people ARE spiritually dead from the outset. It requires the saving grace of christ to make you spiritually alive. The point is we are all already dead. It is not an \"If...Then...\" situation. The truth is if one does not accept the free gift that is offered then one stays put.\n\n That's true with one exception: Babies (including the aborted) and the mentally retarded - those that are not ignorant because they have not heard the Word of God, but because they never will hear it. Yes, they will hear the words, but the words just won't mean anything. I believe these are the ones that have the spirit of those that chose God during the first earth-age when Lucifer tried to kill God.\n \nNow, the next argument is that this isn't fair. God makes people dead and then doesn't save them. NOt fair. Wrong, he did save us by sending his son. We simply have to accept it.\n\n I agree. Furthermore, not only accept Him but also do as He says. So many religions distort the Gospel; twist it so that it is impossible to please God. I mean that in a pure sense because without faith it is impossible to please God - and that scripture pertains to faith in God, not religion.\n \nYou cannot earn your way out of grace.\n\n I'm glad you brought that up, epaphras faith. So many people are misled in believing that one person or another or even they have fallen from Grace. There is no such thing as \"fallen from Grace\". That is another religious fallacy, perpetrated by the powers of darkness to force mankind into a fear-and-doubt mode.\n \n It is a gift that has the eternity of God and the advocacy of christ behind it. If one accepts the grace of christ and then murders someone, guess what folks, he gets to heaven. If it were all based on my behavior then Christ would not have had to die.\n\n I can't agree with that, however. It is written that if a person turns from righteousness that he will die in whatever sin he committed.\n Ezekiel 3:20 - Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him wanting, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.\n \n I am a firm believer that no one can live without sin, but sinning and being addicted to sin is two different things altogether.\n \n I also know that Romans 9:11 says, For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance., but that goes along with the scripture of 1 John 2:19 that says,  They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.\n \n You have no doubt seen, EF, the righteous that become separated from God, and turn aside from the right way, have you not?\n \n That does not mean that they have fallen from Grace, for God's grace abounds each day \"fresh and new\", but they have ignored that Grace (that remains with them) and have followed the big road - which seems right, and clear, and open.\n \n Back to the topic - I don't think people are afraid of Christianity as a way of life, but are afraid of the religion that claims to be Christianity that is the way of death.",

   "That's true with one exception: Babies (including the aborted) and the mentally retarded - those that are not ignorant because they have not heard the Word of God, but because they never will hear it. Yes, they will hear the words, but the words just won't mean anything. I believe these are the ones that have the spirit of those that chose God during the first earth-age when Lucifer tried to kill God.\n \n I agree. Furthermore, not only accept Him but also do as He says. So many religions distort the Gospel; twist it so that it is impossible to please God. I mean that in a pure sense because without faith it is impossible to please God - and that scripture pertains to faith in God, not religion.\n \n I'm glad you brought that up, epaphras faith. So many people are misled in believing that one person or another or even they have fallen from Grace. There is no such thing as \"fallen from Grace\". That is another religious fallacy, perpetrated by the powers of darkness to force mankind into a fear-and-doubt mode.\n \n I can't agree with that, however. It is written that if a person turns from righteousness that he will die in whatever sin he committed.\n Ezekiel 3:20 - Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him wanting, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.\n \n I am a firm believer that no one can live without sin, but sinning and being addicted to sin is two different things altogether.\n \n I also know that Romans 9:11 says, For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance., but that goes along with the scripture of 1 John 2:19 that says,  They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.\n \n You have no doubt seen, EF, the righteous that become separated from God, and turn aside from the right way, have you not?\n \n That does not mean that they have fallen from Grace, for God's grace abounds each day \"fresh and new\", but they have ignored that Grace (that remains with them) and have followed the big road - which seems right, and clear, and open.\n \n Back to the topic - I don't think people are afraid of Christianity as a way of life, but are afraid of the religion that claims to be Christianity that is the way of death.\n\n \n hey there Big O.\n \n I have only one comment. I believe (and I think the hebrew and greek texts bear this out) that the death referred to for a believer who turns from God and continues in sin is physical not spiritual death. We can sin to the point that God will take us home that we may sin no more.\n \n Place it in the context of a loving God and it makes sense.",

   "Yes, I quote the bible to answer questions about who God is. You quote your experience. The term \"self righteous\" was not meant to have the usual connotation. I assumed you to be a christian and would understand that the term simply means one who is able to provide for their own justification and sanctification as opposed to trusting God wholly for it. \n \n I quote the bible because it is THE authority on who God is. There is no other. Your experience may lie to you. How do you know who God is? How do you know He won't allow someone who has murdered into heaven? Do you have this direct line you speak of. I speak only from what the bible tells me. My faith rests there, not my experience. If it rested in my experience I would be dead long ago. I am not \"one of those\" as you say. (Speaking of which, which one of us is really prejudiced to use such a term as \"one of those\".)\n \n You do not answer any of the arguments. The truth is if it is required that we be afraid that God will slam us if we do something wrong then that is not a God worthy of worship. It is the same god of the world that is so well known. Again, Paul argues against this very thing in Romans when he says you have not been given a spirit of fear leading to slavery again.\n \n The fact that you react vehemently only proves my point.\n \n edit: As to where I was when you asked some all important question, how would I know. You actually expect everyone to read everything and respond to you, because you are so all fired important that we should all give up school, jobs, etc just to watch for the one post that might come from you. Just a bit self centered aren't you? I would be happy to answer any question. I will likely use scripture especially if you ask me about God. If I don't know then I don't know. If an agnostic or atheist provides you with an answer you prefer then by all means take it. I am not here to force anything on you.\n \n Christ is able to keep us. if it were not so, then why did he need to die if I could keep myself. Splain it to me lucy! Seriously, answer why Christ would have to die if I could save myself.\n \n What does it say to those looking at this site? It says.......\"What a merciful God they must know, perhaps he would be willing to know me too.\"\n \n I shall darken your door no longer, unless you wish to step back and re read without the chip on your shoulder.\n\n \n \n Epaphras Faith, \n \n If you live your Christian life not entering through the doors of people that annoy you, you may only end up spreading the Gospel to fellow Christians, :) ......\n \n After taking a couple of days to reflect and re-read our posts here , I see we were both guilty of assuming the others stance, resulting in both of us firing at will.

I also apoligize for lumping you into a category of people. I think the point that I was making on my original position is that The apostle Paul argued against the very point you make in stating that a person can become christian and live anyway they want. In the book of romans he answers this question as it was a complaint of the jewish community and the judaizers of the time. What Paul pointed out is that the non christian who sins, doesn't give a rip about it (my words not his obviously), but a christian can still sin, but it will bother them because that is the nature they have been given. If a christian murders, his position in heaven is not in question, the Holy spirit of God which now indwells him will convict him of the sin. He will regret it. One should question themselves about how they know God if they sin, like sinning and want to continue sinning. \n \n But, the second point, not as clearly stated by me, is that we (you and I or anyone for that matter) cannot state the eternal destination of another's soul. That is for God and God alone. By definition it is \"judgement\". We as christians are admonished to avoid that. The witness of a christian is not in what they say about God but, rather, how they deal with their own sin. If I am forgiven and know it, If I know of Jesus propitiation for me, then I cannot help but regret the sins I commit. It is where Paul says in Romans 8:1 \"There is therefore, now, no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus\".\n \n I use scripture to back up my point not so as to quote scripture at you, but because it is the authority on which my statements rest. Just like an attorney will quote the statutes of a state when attempting to convict a person of a crime. It is the authority on which his statements rest. He appels to statute because only that really can determine what is a crime. Likewise, I appeal to the bible, because only that can really say what is the nature of God.\n \n Best and Blessing\n \n EF\n .",

However, Uriah was a good man and refused to \"lay with his wife\" because he thought that would dishonor his friends in battle. So David sent him back into battle and had him killed.

Not because of any behavior of his. But because God declared it so. \n \n Jacob, name changed to Israel by God. A whole nation, literraly, came from him. Jacob was second born of twins. His brother should have received the lion share of the inheritance and the \"blessing of the first born\". His brother's name was esau. Esau was hairy. Jacob dressed up in a fur coat and pretended to be Esau so his father (who was blind at this point) would give him the blessing instead. Jacob had to run from his brother for years. He went to live with his mother's brother, Laban. Jacob wanted to marry Laban's daughter Rachel. He agreed, readily to work for seven years for Rachel's hand. An exorbitant price. He was not wise. He worked seven years and then married what he thought was rachel. Labab fooled him and married him to Leah instead saying, essentially, \"around these parts it is not proper for the younger to be married first.\" Making a clear reference to Jacob stealing the birthright. Jacob then agreed to work another seven years for Rachel. He then loved rachel and not leah. He did not care for his first wife. \n \n Jacob was a swindler and thief. God blessed him none the less. Why? Because of His grace.\n \n This is all through the scripture. Jesus called Peter \"Satan\". Yet Peter was given the gift of the Spirit. Look at Jonah. He was a prophet of God and yet when GOd told him to go to Nineveh to warn them so that they would repent, Jonah ran away and refused. God however, appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah and spit him up on shore. Where? Nineveh? Jonah wanted Nineveh destroyed, God in his mercy and grace did not.\n \n Doing great things for God is nothing. If you do great things then get to heaven what you have received is wages. In romans it says, \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" \"The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" (Rom 3:23 and 6:23) What you and I have earned is death. What has been given freely is life. \n \n You see, the point I am making, is that if you think you can earn your way to heaven, you will find you will never be enough.

I for one will look forward to it. In my own way of thinking, it is that notion of the final destruction of the soul scenario , that keeps the fire and brimestone aspect of religion alive.\n Think about it, what will have the most profound effect on ones interpretation regarding their final outcome of their soul ? The thought of the much acclaimed \" heaping of fire and ETERNAL damnation\" for the condemned soul OR, the thought of the soul just being terminated....\n \n Thinking in these terms, I could live with the thought of the \"ending\" of my soul , a lot better than that eternal torment gig. If the soul is terminated, hey, poof, nothingness, its over. When one thinks about it, just which scenario would have held the most power over the people , especially when the churches held the controlling power over the people in the old days of the kings , and maybe still today ? ...\n \n When I think of it in these terms, I readily see why the eternal torment scenario ending up being the leading deterrent to saving ones soul, as revered by many churches today. I am at a age to where the best years of my life are passed now. I get to look to a future of arthritis , blood pressure meds, stomach meds, bad knees, naturally failing health , and uncertain employment. ...\n \n And again, no one ever knows , when or if, they may come a point in their life , that ending it all would be a welcoming and final solution. If it ever gets to that point in a persons life, which of the above scenarios would be the best for that person to have in their heart, as the real TRUTH ?? If I was in the business of being sure my creations were to keep themselves alive and get them safely back home to me, I would probaly go for the hell and heaping of coals thing, it makes a lot better long lasting impression. :) Please stay calm everyone, this is just another analogy for me to help me sort things out. take care , all jmo",

Today all of us, believers or not, are covered by His grace. We have no idea what it's like to be stripped of that grace. Being sent to that final destruction - however long that takes (and I admit I don't know) - is ,as described in the Bible by Jesus, something so terrible that not even He could describe it fully.

I asked what Greg thought the requirements were. \n \n Greg: I don't think it actually says repent of your sins. I believe the idea is that you confess (agree with god) that you are a sinner, believe that christ died for your sins. I cannot find any other requirement in scripture. Secondly, the Holy Spirit is refered to as the \"seal\" of God. This seal cannot be removed. If I could sin and lose my salvation, then I could earn it again. Why did christ need to die if I could do it. You have yet to answer that question. If it was about me, then as Paul says, we would crucify christ again, \"May it Never be\". Do not think your God so small that he would take away from you what has been given freely.\n \n I say this as encouragement and not an attack.

   "[QUOTE=epaphras_faith]\n\n \n Trebor: I did not say that there were requirements. I asked what Greg thought the requirements were. \n \n Greg: I don't think it actually says repent of your sins. I believe the idea is that you confess (agree with god) that you are a sinner, believe that christ died for your sins. I cannot find any other requirement in scripture. Secondly, the Holy Spirit is refered to as the \"seal\" of God. This seal cannot be removed. If I could sin and lose my salvation, then I could earn it again. Why did christ need to die if I could do it. You have yet to answer that question. If it was about me, then as Paul says, we would crucify christ again, \"May it Never be\". Do not think your God so small that he would take away from you what has been given freely.\n \n I say this as encouragement and not an attack. If someone is telling you that you are not saved because you need to ask christ forgiveness again and be baptised again, it is legalism and it is what the pharisees and saducees were guilty of.

If your asking me do I believe that one has to be \"saved\" twice\" to have eternal life , I say no. I have never been baptized, so I would not be eligible for a second one, thats for sure. I do not have the scripture in front of me to support lines 1 and 2. It is possible that I have the two crosslinked . Until the time I reached 13 years of age, I acquired my religous teachings in a Southern Baptist church. I am sure we all have opinions on that one :) ....\n \n I wasnt raised in the \"hardshell\" baptist church, but I still remember that preacher. He worked at the GE plant in Louisville, Ky, for his living, and preached in this little maybe 30 ft x 75 ft. wood frame church on Sundays and wed. nites. He recieved no salary , just what ever the poor folk in our neck of the woods could put in the little basket they handed out. Out of that basket came utilities, church maintenance, so on. I would always drop my quarter in, and never saw more than maybe ten one dollar bills in that basket. Forty years later now, I can still see in my minds eye that 40 something, obese preacher with sweat rolling down his red face, pounding on the pulpit and telling us all about this \"free gift\" , a gift that we only needed to come up front to the pulpit and get. I rememeber thinking at that time, wow, this guy must have some kind of \"fire\" in him to be so sure about what he is saying....\n \n After the person that wanted that gift had walked up front and was holding the preachers hand , and he was saying the prayer, then the whole congregation would break out in song, one of those old hymns that always brought tears to my eyes back then. Then the following sunday, I would watch him do what looked like an attempted drowning in our local creek, of that very same person that had walked up front and said something to him. I think the thought of that cold creek dunking scared me so bad back then, I just kind of shyed away from it. Afterall, back then I felt I didnt need someone half drowning me, just for me to believe in Jesus, I already knew I did.",

I believe, and my church also believes that baptism is not a requirement for salvation but rather a response to it. It is identification with Jesus in his death, burial and ressurrection. It is symbolic and we believe an act of obedience that is not in order to please god but because we already are pleasing to him. My belief anyway. \n \n I went to a similar church as a kid.

Logically speaking of course.\n\n \n The analogy is parallel. God setting the conditions is irrelevant. He created people with free will. He did this so that He could love them and they would love him. Love, by it's very nature requires that a person have a choice. If everything was perfect and no suffering existed and no one needed to depend on God then there is no choice. There is no love.\n \n Because God loves us, he set up the conditions wherein you and I might have a real choice. If God made it so everyone chose him, then there really isn't anything like a choice. The choice requires two options. God or not God. The choice is indeed yours. The need for forgiveness is what offers the choice. \n \n It is actually the only logical way it could be. You statement that it is a bad analogy and that it is illogical has no basis. You simply state that it is. You state (assumingly) that it is a bad analogy becasue it is not parallel because God set up the world and we didn't. Not true. Whether or not God created the world is irrelevant. Even if he did (and he did) then for LOVE (which is how God defines himself) to be the determining factor, He logically created the choice. He defined the consequences for the various choices.\n \n People do that for their children. \"You can play here as long as you are quite. If you are too loud you will need to go to the back yard.\" Defined situation, and consequences. Why, for love.\n \n To answer Joe on Faith not being evidence, \n \n If I pick the winning lottery numbers and they are displayed on the TV, It is faith to go to the lottery office to collect. If I tell my friends that I won and then never go and they never see my ticket, they would naturally conclude that I did not win. If they never see my ticket and I go to the lottery office, they see me walking in, they naturally conclude that I won. The evidence is my faith.\n \n It is the most tangible thing on the planet. One can easily see what people put their faith in by simply watching how they live. It is indeed the greatest evidence of what is true.\n \n If I say that I believe God is forgiving and loving and yet I am always defensive, one would wonder if I really believe what I say. This actually happens to me. I don't always live like I believe this. Why? Because I don't always believe it. But, By and large, it is how I live my life. I struggle with this earth suit (like any human) but live in faith.\n \n THAT is EVIDENCE!\n \n Ef",

   "The analogy is parallel. God setting the conditions is irrelevant. He created people with free will. He did this so that He could love them and they would love him. Love, by it's very nature requires that a person have a choice. If everything was perfect and no suffering existed and no one needed to depend on God then there is no choice. There is no love.\n \n Because God loves us, he set up the conditions wherein you and I might have a real choice. If God made it so everyone chose him, then there really isn't anything like a choice. The choice requires two options. God or not God. The choice is indeed yours. The need for forgiveness is what offers the choice. \n \n It is actually the only logical way it could be. You statement that it is a bad analogy and that it is illogical has no basis. You simply state that it is. You state (assumingly) that it is a bad analogy becasue it is not parallel because God set up the world and we didn't. Not true. Whether or not God created the world is irrelevant. Even if he did (and he did) then for LOVE (which is how God defines himself) to be the determining factor, He logically created the choice. He defined the consequences for the various choices.\n \n People do that for their children. \"You can play here as long as you are quite. If you are too loud you will need to go to the back yard.\" Defined situation, and consequences. Why, for love.\n \n To answer Joe on Faith not being evidence, \n \n If I pick the winning lottery numbers and they are displayed on the TV, It is faith to go to the lottery office to collect. If I tell my friends that I won and then never go and they never see my ticket, they would naturally conclude that I did not win. If they never see my ticket and I go to the lottery office, they see me walking in, they naturally conclude that I won. The evidence is my faith.\n \n It is the most tangible thing on the planet. One can easily see what people put their faith in by simply watching how they live. It is indeed the greatest evidence of what is true.\n \n If I say that I believe God is forgiving and loving and yet I am always defensive, one would wonder if I really believe what I say. This actually happens to me. I don't always live like I believe this. Why? Because I don't always believe it. But, By and large, it is how I live my life. I struggle with this earth suit (like any human) but live in faith.\n \n THAT is EVIDENCE!\n \n Ef\n\n \n \n That might be evidence to you. I don't call that evidence at all. I might call it self justification. But, that is not evidence.\n \n When I take a look at the way the this 'Easyrider' uses the scripture to threaten people with 'much gnashing of teeth', it makes makes me sure the \n God described in the Christian bible can not exist.",

   "One must give credit to the Jews for codifying the rules they picked up from the Assyrians and other assorted urban tribes of the Middle East into the Ten Commandments.\n \n An interesting thing was done with the Commandments in a recent Wall Street Journal column:\n \n The 60% Solution\n By GREGG EASTERBROOK \n February 4, 2005; Page W13\n Soon the Supreme Court will take up the question of whether the Ten Commandments can be displayed on government property. At the heart of this culture-war blockbuster will be two familiar and rivalrous claims: first, that any government sanction of religious material violates the separation of church and state; second, that the Ten Commandments promote morality and so their display must not be prohibited. We will undoubtedly hear one side decrying Christian activism run amok and the other godless secularism run amok.\n \n Yet there is an alternative to the Ten Commandments -- namely, the Six Commandments, enunciated by Jesus himself. And the Six Commandments could hang in any public facility without jeopardizing the separation of church and state.\n \n In the Gospel of Matthew, a man asks Jesus what a person must do to enter heaven. He answers: \"Keep the commandments.\" The man inquires: \"Which ones?\" Here is how the biblical account continues: \"And Jesus said, 'You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness. Honor your father and mother. Also, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.'\"\n \n Debating what laws are more important than others was a long-standing exercise of the rabbinical tradition in which Jesus was educated. But in these verses, which have a parallel retelling in the Gospel of Mark, Christ is not merely offering an opinion about law. Something wholly remarkable happens -- Jesus edits the commandments.\n \n Quickly now, which commandments did he leave out? \"You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourselves an idol. You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God. Remember the Sabbath Day, and keep it holy.\" These are the commandments having to do with formal religious observance -- from today's perspective, the ones that clash with the Establishment Clause. Jesus' Six Commandments make no mention of God or faith. They could be posted on public property without constitutional entanglements.\n \n If Jesus taught Six Commandments, why do Christians talk so much about 10? As a churchgoer, I am amazed at how many of my fellow Christians do not seem to know Christ's teachings. Consider, for instance, that Jesus instructed: \"Give to everyone who begs from you.\" Watch throngs of Christians pass panhandlers without giving and you'll have an example of how unfamiliar many are with the content of their Redeemer's ministry.\n \n Because the Six Commandments de-emphasize formal observation of religion, some Christian traditionalists pretend that the verses do not exist. In a lifetime of sitting through the sermons of various denominations, I have never heard a minister make more than passing reference to Christ's deletion of commandments. Such was his gift that, in the Gospel of John, he simplified all moral and spiritual instruction into a single dictum: \"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.\" That modification of the original commandments also de-emphasizes formal religion and as such is also given short shrift by institutional Christianity. Many Christians seem to prefer the Ten Commandments because they embody a sense of might, mountaintops and divine wrath.\n But if displaying Scripture in public is meant to encourage morality, surely the Six Commandments serve the purpose. Read them again:\n \n You shall not murder.\n \n You shall not commit adultery.\n \n You shall not steal.\n \n You shall not bear false witness.\n \n Honor your father and mother.\n \n Also, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n \n Here is a full moral road map for society, no matter the faith, or the secular beliefs, of its individual members.\n \n Christians who say that morality is their concern in the public-display controversy ought to switch to the Six Commandments. The whole question of whether declarations about God may be posted on public property can be avoided simply by heeding Jesus.\n \n Mr. Easterbrook, an editor of the New Republic, is the author of \"Beside Still Waters\" (Morrow, 1998), a book about Christian theology.",

   "These basic six commandments seem to be universally held by humanity around the globe simply because they make it possible to create a peaceful, unified society--basic rules funneled out of thousands of years of experimentation with various rules to make sense out of the community of humans.\n \n I must credit Christ for his wisdom. I also agree with Christ and his discrediting of public prayer--which I think also applies to the maddening Christian insistence upon prayer in public schools--the biggest piece of hypocrisy I have ever witnessed.",

   "One must give credit to the Jews for codifying the rules they picked up from the Assyrians and other assorted urban tribes of the Middle East into the Ten Commandments.\n \n An interesting thing was done with the Commandments in a recent Wall Street Journal column:\n \n The 60% Solution\n By GREGG EASTERBROOK \n February 4, 2005; Page W13\n Soon the Supreme Court will take up the question of whether the Ten Commandments can be displayed on government property. At the heart of this culture-war blockbuster will be two familiar and rivalrous claims: first, that any government sanction of religious material violates the separation of church and state; second, that the Ten Commandments promote morality and so their display must not be prohibited. We will undoubtedly hear one side decrying Christian activism run amok and the other godless secularism run amok.\n \n Yet there is an alternative to the Ten Commandments -- namely, the Six Commandments, enunciated by Jesus himself. And the Six Commandments could hang in any public facility without jeopardizing the separation of church and state.\n \n In the Gospel of Matthew, a man asks Jesus what a person must do to enter heaven. He answers: \"Keep the commandments.\" The man inquires: \"Which ones?\" Here is how the biblical account continues: \"And Jesus said, 'You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness. Honor your father and mother. Also, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.'\"\n \n Debating what laws are more important than others was a long-standing exercise of the rabbinical tradition in which Jesus was educated. But in these verses, which have a parallel retelling in the Gospel of Mark, Christ is not merely offering an opinion about law. Something wholly remarkable happens -- Jesus edits the commandments.\n \n Quickly now, which commandments did he leave out? \"You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourselves an idol. You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God. Remember the Sabbath Day, and keep it holy.\" These are the commandments having to do with formal religious observance -- from today's perspective, the ones that clash with the Establishment Clause. Jesus' Six Commandments make no mention of God or faith. They could be posted on public property without constitutional entanglements.\n \n If Jesus taught Six Commandments, why do Christians talk so much about 10? As a churchgoer, I am amazed at how many of my fellow Christians do not seem to know Christ's teachings. Consider, for instance, that Jesus instructed: \"Give to everyone who begs from you.\" Watch throngs of Christians pass panhandlers without giving and you'll have an example of how unfamiliar many are with the content of their Redeemer's ministry.\n \n Because the Six Commandments de-emphasize formal observation of religion, some Christian traditionalists pretend that the verses do not exist.

(please refer to former president clinton and the media outpouring concerning Ms. Lewinski for reference)\n \n Also, Jesus intent (if you read the context surrounding that story) was not to eliminate public prayer but rather to do away with prayer that has, at its core, the desire to make oneself look good. He also prominently talks about praying together (corporate prayer), I think in the sermon on the mount.\n \n The christian intent in prayer in schools is not that one should pray publicly and therefore hypocritically, but rather that the government does not have the right to infringe on my child's freedom of religious expression. Mandated prayer, I think would be wrong. That is not really what is being fought for though. It is that children are prohibited from praying if they want. \n \n Back to the six commandments you recite. What about lying (bearing false witness). Untold millions will tell you that it is perfectly fine to lie as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.\n \n This is what is meant by moral relavitism. \n \n Sinjin: Consensus CAN have the effect of reducing, but frequently does not. Additionally, it does not eliminate it. At best it reduces it. The problem is that consensus changes with the wind. View the last two elections. Very close. The first one so close that many claim bush was never really president.\n \n An objective standard is what solves these issues.",
