To put the point very crudely, wasn't Lincoln willing to forget about emancipating the slaves if the secessionist states returned to the union ?\n\n \n Well, I should first state that Lincoln never planned to emancipate the slaves; he ran only on preventing the expansion of slavery into new states, and he planned to do only that. He emancipated slaves as part of the war effort, but this effectively destroyed slavery.\n \n But did the states have a right to seceed? That was certainly a highly debated question at the time.\n \n The way I see it, on one hand, there is no specific right of state governments to remove themselves from the Federal government listed. There is no exception made saying that the states can refuse to obey the Federal government. And isn't that really what secession is? Isn't that just states saying, \"I'm no longer going to follow the rules and regulations imposed by the Federal government.\" So it seems to me initially to be an attempt to break the law created by the Federal government, and no such exception was provided in the Constitution for the states to be allowed to do so. When the states entered into the union, they agreed to this Constitution. They agreed to follow its rules and regulations; they didn't just say \"we'll follow them, but only until a law we don't like gets passed, then we're out of here.\"\n \n But a lot of people believed that Lincoln stood in violation of the Constitution by seeking to prevent slavery. They believed that states should be able to decide for themselves whether or not to have slaves. They pointed out all the references to people who could only be slaves in the Constitution, and they said that the Constitution not only makes no prohibition against slavery, it has institutionalized it, and it has left the decision up to the states. They then pointed back to the Declaration of Independance (which talks about the reasons for revolution from Britain), and they claimed that it supports their revolution.\n \n Well, Lincoln was no strict Constitutionalist himself; reading his speeches, it seems that he believed that the Constitution could only be interpreted through the Declaration. And since the Declaration states that all men are created equal and are entitled to liberty, the Constitution must be interpreted in that light. Because of this, the Constitution could not be interpreted as protecting the right to slavery unless slaves were not to be considered men. Since it was clear that slaves are men, the seceeding states did not have just cause to seceed, and the states did need very good reason to seceed. The Declaration reads:\n \n Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. -Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain [George III] is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.\n \n It then goes on to list the many reasons that revolution is necessary. Lincoln could then say that the seceeding states in fact did not have a good reason for revolution; the law as agreed upon had been followed, he had been elected, and states do not have the right to simply stop obeying the law of the Federal government just because the person they wanted to win the election lost.\n \n \nHere's a hypothetical follow-up question: supposing a possibly self-sufficient state like California or Texas were to declare unilateral independence and secede from the union right now, how could this be prevented ? Another civil war presumably would be out of the question.\n\n \n I don't agree that a civil war would be out of the question; I'd guess that the state would be forced to stay in the union. Though I'm not really sure. I don't think that states can maintain any political right to seceed, but according to the Declaration, I'd say that they have a moral obligation to act outside of their political rights if the government has become too tyrannical.",

But this argument forgets that secession is in effect nothing but removing all of the power of the federal government from a territory. The Constitution specifically grants powers to the Federal government, and the right we are talking about is the right to deny the government those powers, to overrule the powers of the Federal government. So a claim that the 10th Amendment grants the power of secession to the states is in its nature equivalent to saying that the 10th Amendment gives states the right to ignore the powers granted to the Federal government as they see fit.\n \n Although someone who reads the Constitution word-for-word might claim that since states are not explicitly denied the power to pick and choose which rules and powers of the Federal government they will follow, then states have the power to do just that. But the intent of the Constitution was clearly not to list a set of rules and powers granted to the Federal government, then to follow it by saying, \"But no one has to obey any of these laws or powers granted to the Federal government does if it doesn't want to.\" For example, by granting the power of taxing States to the Federal government, the State governments are implicitly prohibited the power to deny that taxation or the Federal government really has been granted no power at all.",

If it does not, then you've granted no power, for the Federal Government must merely ask to tax, and if the state disagrees, it doesn't have to pay those taxes.

Even though people claimed to be defending \"states' rights\" in general, they were really more specifically defending only the states' right to slavery, and that was one right that the states should not have had.

You can make a legally binding will and testament, but change or cancel it later if you choose.\n\n \n Well, remember that individuals have the political right to change their associations, their will, and their testaments only because the government allows them to do these things. These things are only valid because the government recognizes them, and the government has complete control over their validity. But I think you are asking whether states should be allowed to seceed, not whether the Constitution has the power to prevent them from seceeding.\n \n In order to answer the question over whether states should be allowed to seceed, I must first point out the distinction between individual people and government. I do not disagree that we should protect the freedom and equality of people. Any person or group of people should be allowed to disassociate themselves with the US, to leave the US, change his will etc. Individuals should have as much power and control over their lives as possible. But governments are not people. Governments should have as little control over the people as possible. Governments do not have fundamental liberties; they exist to protect the fundamental liberties of the people as much as possible.\n \n This doesn't mean that governments should not be allowed to form associations that they can later resolve, but it also does not mean that governments should always be allowed the power to disassociate themselves. The Constitution did not create a confederacy; it did not create a set of individual nations bound together by an agreement to listen to a set of federal decision-makers at the top. The Constitution created a single nation, and a single nation has a single government. The power of that government was split up into many branches. There are state level branches, which each state would decide, as well Federal level branches, such as the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches. But even though this nation is subdivided into states, the Constitution still created only one nation, one government. The land belongs to the nation, the people are citizens of the nation, and one government rules over the nation (though individuals may be appointed differently and have different powers). \n \n By accepting the Constitution, the states did not just agree to some alliance or treaty; they agreed to become a nation. And in a nation, no small group of government officials has the right to decree that they no longer recognize the power of a different part of the government. The people governing a state should have no more power to break away from the government than the President has to break away from Congress. Although there may be some situation where Congress is so tyrannical that the President is morally obligated to say, \"Congress, your power or authority is no longer recognized, and someone else will have your power\", the President certainly has no political right to do this. In the same note, the state-level branch of government should not have the power to say, \"Federal branch, this state will no longer recognize your power and authority, and someone else will now have your power\". The state government isn't the leaders of the state; they're just people who decide certain laws for that state. The land of the state does not belong to the state officials; it belongs to the nation.\n \n So in accepting the Constitution, the state governments agreed not to be individual nations any longer, but to be sections of a single nation.

   "Nice job getting the Ken Burns' documentary, I saw a little bit of it and thought it was great.\n \n Here's my advice, don't think of the civil war as a civil war--- the South was never really a part of the United States. Think of the north and south as two different nations. The cause of this division is clear, slavery. Slavery is the source of all division between the north and south and with time, it had such a strong effect on the social and economic strucutres, that eventually the last straw was pulled---politics.

   "I think the Southern states did have the right to secede. The Constitution did not give them that right, but it didn't deny them of it either. And since all unspecified powers were returned to the states and the people, pulling out of the Union was kosher. Plus, since the Constitution had no time provisions per se, from a contractual standpoint, any state could leave at any time.\n \n Secondly, Thomas Jefferson himself was the one who said folks who are unhappy with their government have the right to abandon it and create something new for themselves. Now, I'm sure we'd all agree that protecting slavery is an unworthy reason to pull out of a nation, but if all people indeed have that governmental right, the South's decision was justified whether we like it or not.\n \n Lastly, I have a BA and MA in history, and I've still never run across a true legal reason why the South couldn't secede. Geographically, the South was a big chunk of the the US in 1861, and it had a lot of economic clout. For the sake of national health and international legitimacy, Lincoln and the North insisted that the South be recovered and fought for it. Based on democratic principles and the Constitution, did they have the right to do so? Proably not. But it's all water under the bridge now I guess.",

The problem lies in returning native lands. The missionaries who settled The Islands were gracious enough to also spread literacy so Hawaiians could legally sign away their lands.
