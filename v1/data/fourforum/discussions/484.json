   "I can understand that you think I meant excessive spanking, but I didn't.\n It is not a lazy parents problem solver, okay some parents are lazy and don't want to deal with the problem. \n But for a parent that loves their child and wants to teach them right from wrong, spanking is a tool of discipline.\n \n -Example one: Johnny hits Tommy.\n I feel that these are the proper steps of discipline:\n 1st offense: Tell Johnny that it is wrong to hit Tommy, seperate him and Tommy for a few days. Do not just discipline Johnny but talk to him and tell him why it is wrong. Make sure he know not to hit, because it is wrong, not just because he will get spanked. Warn him that next time he will lose a privledge.\n \n 2nd offense: Tell Johnny again that it is wrong, and take away a privledge, so that he knows there are consequences. Warn him that next time he will get a spanking.\n \n 3rd offense: Tell Johnny that it is wrong, and follow up with the previous warning of a spanking.\n \n -Example two: Katie colors on the white wall with red and black crayons.\n 1st offense: Tell Katie it is wrong and tell her she can only have her crayons when Mom or Dad is there to watch her. Warn her that next time she will get her crayons taken away.\n 2nd offense: Tell Katie it is wrong and take away her crayons.\n Warn her that next time she will get a spanking.\n 3rd offense: Tell Katie that it is wrong, and follow up with the previous warning of spanking.\n \n It is wrong to just spank a child without explaining what he/she did wrong. Children are people too, and they need to know what they did wrong so they will learn not to do it again. This way, children will not learn to fear the parents wrath, but they will learn right from wrong. \n Give the children a discipline system based on consequences, and follow up with it. Do not threaten a child with a spanking if they mis-behave at their freinds house. Tell them that they will not get to see their friend, and if it happens again, promise them a spanking, and follow through.\n The biggest mistake of disciplining a child is failure to follow through. If the consequences is spanking, then by golly, spank them. Because if you don't, they will learn that they can get away with it, because mom and dad never follow through.",

My parents were very strict, and I turned out to be a well respected person not only in the family but also where I work. I have never been in Jail; I've never committed a crime. There is a line between abuse and discipline, there are parents out there that cross the line every single day, that I am against, but a simple pat on the XXX and being sent to your room and no TV or video games for a week tends to make kids think about what they did, and if the parents talk to there kids the week that they are grounded about what they did, I feel that would do even more good. Most parents today do one but not the other, today the parents that do not spank will talk to there kids about what happened and will take there favorite thing they do at home away from them for awhile but most parents fail to realize that a good spanking really gets the kids attention, spanking your kids is the key to getting there attention, but most today will bitch about the spanking part because they say its abuse, \"WRONG!\" there is a line between abuse and discipline, if you hit your kid on the butt and only hit him a few times that's just simple basic discipline, if you hit your kid in the chest or kick him or slap him or her in the face and use a belt across the face or back that is abuse. Most kids hate it when they have to be spanked, they will run and or Hide or run away from home, which \"HEY!\" theres the proof, start with the spanking, then ground the kid for a week, and during that week talk to the kid and find out why they did what they did.\n \n If the parrents are firm and strict, the kids have a less of a chance of going to jail someday and they will have more respect for others.",

   "Hank and Gilligan, I have to agree with the both of you. Like you, Gilligan, I had an occasion every now and then were I 'deserved a spankin'. I'm sure all of us have had those moments. When parents sit down and try to talk to little children and explain to them what they did wrong, there's very little chance that they are actually comprehending anything that is being said to them. If they do comprehend, then I doubt they're of the majority. This is simply because they're young. Spanking is simple, and if done properly (sounds funny....) then it does its job. Punishment (as I learned in psychology...) has to occur immediately after the 'crime' is committed. Otherwise it does no good. The phrase \"you'll hear about this later' is almost a joke to me... it simply doesn't do much good.\n Now if you spank a child often and unnecessarily, then it's not going to do any good... and if there is little or no reason for it, then it could be considered abuse. Also, the child is not going to learn from it, and may become 'immune' to it. (not to the point where they don't notice pain, but where they fail to associate pain with punishment) \n Over all, I think spanking is a reasonable way to get to the point with a child. Like said above, it gets their attention.\n I know more and more parents are moving away from this method, and where I work, I see the results obviously. There are more children 'ruling' the parents and getting away with everything. It's becoming common to see this, and it can get annoying when you have little kids running around screaming and breaking things and the parents are trying to talk calmly to them, and OF COURSE they're not paying the least bit of attention. I know some people think it's wrong to hurt another person, but it's either hurt them a little to do them good, or they're going to do more hurting in the long run.\n Some will argue that they've raised perfectly behaved children without a spanking, and their children have never gone wrong. Well, for one, they're underrepresented as it seems, and two, there is always an exception.",

   "It's so strange to me that people keep arguing that spanking is useful or necessary when all evidence demonstrates that it isn't. It really isn't effective, on a short or long term. \n \n If you want your kid to not run into the road while they are too small to know better, don't send them off to play near the road, or build a fence for crying out loud. It makes no sense to argue that the best thing you can do for your children is to raise them in an atmosphere of fear and violence. However \"occasional\" or \"reasonable\" that violence may be. \n \n That said, as pointed out by other posters, \"spanking\" usually has more to do with parents' frustration than behaviour modification. People spank their kids because they're scared or mad at them, and because their kids are smaller than them, they can just smack them around with no immediate consequences. This is not an ideal way to bring up children.\n \n Obviously getting smacked once or twice will not cause \"permanent psychological damage\". But as it's useless as a parenting tool, why do it at all?\n \n Personal story: My mother was spanked as a child, and lived in fear of her father. She usually did what he said to his face but covertly disobeyed him because her fear was of being punished, not acting wrong. When she had her own kids, she had an experience which made her want to do differently than her parents.\n \n My older sister was just a baby at the time, sitting on my mother's left knee in the living room of a friend they were visiting. My sister kept pulling at a house plant that was beside her in the corner of the room. My mother smacked her hand (she was concerned the plant might be poisonous), and my sister looked shocked, and started to cry. She was completely distracted from the plant while she was crying, but as soon as she recovered she reached for the plant again. My mother had a sort of epiphany that this wasn't working very well, and she should think about what she was doing instead of just automatically doing what her parents did. She moved my sister to her right knee, and handed her a toy. Problem solved.\n \n There's another thing about corporal punishment- it requires constant vigilance and reinforcement. I just don't have the energy to track and smack kids. I find if I just set up a good play environment and let them be, we both feel better. No sense having them play beside a highway. No reason to give them access to delicate, expensive or dangerous household items. Why add stress to your life?",

It would be assault if you were to do it to another adult hard, so why shouldn't it be the same for a child? \n \n The smacks should be \"medium\". Just hard enough to be a warning to the child. There are however, alternate methods for discipling your child that may want to be explored. \n \n FYI, there was a lady here in NSW, Australia who recently went to court for smacking her child \"lightly\" (what she said on A Current Affairs, ACA) across the head!

   "Firstly, If the child begins to associate the parent with pain, the parent is obviously using the form of punishment too often. I can't see a problem with spanking a child if they step out of line repeatedly. I was struck across the hand with a belt when I was younger, and I've turned out fine. If a child is surrounded by a loving and caring environment for 99% of the time, that 1% where there the parent does discipline the kid and play \"the bad guy,\" won't make the child hate their parents. It will show the child that they have behaved incorrectly as they have forced their normally loving parent to become \"mad\" at you.\n \n Sometimes sitting down a small child and trying to explain to them why certain behaviour is unacceptable isn't the way to convey the message, but if the child associates a smack with a certain action, they won't do it. For example, something like writing on the walls. A child will not be able to comprehend that writing on the walls will decrease the value of the house as they have no grasp of monetary value. The child won't be able to understand that the parent wants to keep the house clean for when the visitors come over for tea. But if the child receives a smack across the bottom or hand after writing on the walls, they will understand that drawing on the wall = SMACK... and simpley won't do it again.",

Secondly, you are going way far afield when you mention judgement. No one hear ever said the parent was a bad parent or a bad person. Only that the evidence shows that spanking, by and large, is not as effective as many other methods. The idea of speaking to a child is only one possible alternative. You grabbed that and stuck to it. Yes, the getting angry once in a while is more effective when it is only once in a while and the parents are loving parents. I have even stated as much in my posts which you obviously have not read. (using phrases like judgement when none was offered, and saying \"just explaining\" without understanding the context in which that was written etc.) \n \n The topic is about spanking as \"discipline.\" It is not discipline. The word discipline comes from the root \"disciple\" meaning one who is taught under someone. It has a modern day equivalent of apprentice. The primary mode of learning for an apprentice was modeling. Spanking only models violent behavior. A two year old understands time out, removal of toys, removal from the area, and a whole host of other things. It also models restraint, love, and guidance.\n \n Spanking is purely punishment. Punishment is not discipline. It is exacting a payment for some action. It does not teach. It is why we started calling our prisons \"correctional facilities\". They are intended in part to teach proper behavior to those who don't use it. Now we know that by and large it does not do that. It exacts a punishment mostly. \n \n Now, I have a degree in Psychology and quoted many many psyuchologists who provide these opinions. You have used some anecdotal information and an attempt to play on peoples emotions with words like \"judgement.\" If you have actual real evidence that spanking is an \"effective discipline\" then please provide it.",

You remove a small child from the kitchen because something hot is cooking, the next time you may not get there in time and the child is injured.

You must have me confused with someone else, because I don't know you and you definately don't know me... \n \n Yes, I was spanked, but there is nothing about me that is evidence that it has effected me in any different way. My parents just didn't beat my butt and then it was over, but grounded me as a finishing touch. I'm sorry, but if kids are sensitive to the point where they have emotional scars because \"daddy spanked me emoticon_cry \" then they were bound to have problems from the get go and spanking just happened to be the roll of the dice. We're not talking about physical abuse here, we're not talking about anyone being flogged. What we're talking about is a quick little surge of pain (here in a second, gone in a flash) to get the attention of the child and stops the undesired behaviour immediately. I got popped on the rear and my crying and temper tantrums would stop and that was that. Then came the grounding, then came the removal of priveleges. And your little list of different methods is almost comical. Let's see; modeling appropriate behavior, rewarding conflicting behavior, instilling integrity and character are all things you do on a subconscious level and constantly. No parent looks at their watch and says \"Oh, it looks like it's time to go model to Billy some integrity and character\". \n \n And about discipline;\n One definition of discipline is the treatment that correct or punishes. I can understand your point, but I can also counter it with the idea that pain (once again I am talking about a QUICK pain) is a brand of punishment and correction. It only messes up those who were destined to be messed up in the first place. If a kid gets beat without an explanation or just a beating and then the parent leaves the room, then of course it's going to affect them sooner or later.

Any form of discipline (time-out, restriction, etc.), when used inappropriately and in anger, can result in distorting a child's perception of justice and harming his emotional development\")\n \n http://www.nospank.net/johnson2.htm\n (\"Such an objection might seem petty were it not for the authors' closing assertion that there is \"insufficient evidence\" to denounce spanking and \"adequate evidence\" to justify it. Most condemnation of spanking, in fact, does not rest solely, or even mainly, upon evidence. It rests upon simple--though some might call them simplistic--moral standards.\" That statement, from an anti-spanking advocate, seems to fly directly in the face of your own arguement epaphras_faith.)\n \n http://www.goodparent.org/articles/findings.htm\n (\"Dr. Baumrind described findings from her own research, an analysis of data from a long-term study of more than 100 families, indicating that mild to moderate spanking had no detrimental effects when such confounding influences were separated out. When the parents who delivered severe punishment - for example, frequently spanking with a paddle or striking a child in the face - were removed from the analysis, Dr. Baumrind and her colleague, Dr. Elizabeth Owens, found that few harmful effects linked with spanking were left. And the few that remained could be explained by other aspects of the parent-child relationship. \" \"When parents are loving and firm and communicate well with the child,\" Dr. Baumrind said, \"the children are exceptionally competent and well adjusted, whether or not their parents spanked them as preschoolers.\" ) **** You have to agree with me now epaphras_faith, becuase you place so much emphasis on the findings of psychologists, and this lady is contridicting you. **** Dr. Straus, who attended Dr. Baumrind's talk, praised her study. \"It may be the best single study available,\" he said, in terms of methodology. Even anti-spanking advocates liked what she had to say.\n \n \n The point, that I belive has been clearly made here, is that the studies that you rely so heavily on to support your arguements and believe provide the unoquivically correct answers, appear to not hold the answer to this debate. When I searched the web for studies on spanking, there were multiple studies that supported both sides, so which of the studies do we belive and which do we disregard?",
