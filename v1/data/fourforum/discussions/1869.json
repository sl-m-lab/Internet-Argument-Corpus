   "I think it's because their laws prevent most criminals from obtaining guns.\n\n \n No, they do not. I know several people in England who posess weapons the bought on the street. How are the gun laws in england working when you can buy a machine gun? \n \n Before the ban, england had lower numbers when it came to firearms related deaths. They also had lower crime numbers. The sociological differences between England and the United States are not be be discounted.\n \n It is interesting to note that crime rates in England seem to be rising now that the gun ban has been around for a while. There is even a movement by public officials to arm police officers in response to the rising rate of violent crime. There isa n article and debate about it right here on the forums.\n \n The biggest difference lately in the statistics in England in the US is not the numbers, it is how they are recorded. If a guy is confronted by three people outside a bar and shot to death, but the gus get off during trial, it is still recorded in America s a three person homocide. In england, it is NOT recorded. I get the London Times, and they have done several articles accusing th British government of manipulating crime figures. I think that if we in America only recorded solved crimes in our crime statistics, we might become one of the most cime free contries in the world!",
