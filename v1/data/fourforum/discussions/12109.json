It is an inevitable consequence of dictatorships. \n \n This is why our founders allowed for the right to bear arms by the civilian population; specifically as a safeguard against Government tyranny. And secondarily as a safeguard against foreign invasion. Even though Europe isn't currently oppressing the individual freedoms and personal rights of its citizens, the people have no personal way of defending themselves if such a move were enacted by the EU or the individual Governments. \n \n I personally find that position very scary for the citizens on the European Continent. Apart from a few Countries (Switzerland being one) they are completely at the mercy of trusting their Governments to continue to respect their individual human rights. If discriminatory martial law was imposed against the will of the targeted citizens, they would have no way of defending themselves against it.",

So I have a hard time understanding how Nazi Germany shows how guns will prevent dictatorships. \n \n Even though gun ownership was common in Iraq it didn't prevent a dictator from taking control. From a news article about Iraq that was published while Hussein was in power:\n \n \"One gauge of that fear is the trade at gun shops. Most Iraqi households own at least one gun, so there has been no particular run on armaments. But some gun shop owners report as much as a 50 percent jump in ammunition sales.\" \n http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E5D8153EF931A25750C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1\n \n Another article published at about the same time:\n \"With a gun culture that closely resembles that of the United States, Iraq is one of the most heavily armed societies in the world. Its tradition of self-reliance and hard desert and mountain living puts it on a gun-per-person level rivaling other clan systems in Yemen or Somalia....\n \n \" 'It's our culture that people keep guns in their houses - it's inherited from our grandfathers,' says Mr. Ghazi, sorting through an array of pistol bullets. Among the ammunition selection is a 12.7mm bullet for a heavy machine gun, with the red-painted tip of a tracer that burns bright as it flies.\"\n Iraqi public well-armed and wary | csmonitor.com",

Which one is it?\n\n \n What needs to be clarified in NATO's favor is that it was the very target group of Hitler in Nazi Germany which was denied the right to bear arms. That is very relevant to the point being made. \n \n Also, regarding Saddam in Iraq, beside there being a long standing culture of gun ownership there which he probably feared interfering with for fear of causing a mass revolution, if you recollect, he had a \"stand in\" to make most all public appearances in his place, especially when he walked amongst the Iraqi people. Beside that he/even his stand in was surrounded by heavily armed loyalists from the Republican Guard which sent a clear message to the masses that any dissenters or attackers will be killed in short order so the idea of a lone gunman, or even a group ever thinking they could actually reach Saddam, even in a public setting was remote. After all, they knew about the stand in and didn't want to die for nothing. So the existence of that stand in was a powerful deterrent. \n \n Beside that, we know that being an armed society never protected one of the citizens from ending up in one of the many mass graves we have found since his removal, since dissenters were targeted individually and probably arrested at times when they were away from home and separated from their weapons. I mean, we know they were an armed population, but we also know that those arms never prevented the oppression of individuals from taking place. This reminds me of the wisdom of our founders for speaking to militias existing in addition to individual gun ownership. There is power in numbers.",
