   "I like some of these.\n \n \n'Woolly mammoths were snap frozen during the Flood catastrophe'. This is contradicted by the geological setting in which mammoths are found. It's most likely that they perished toward the end of the Ice Age, possibly in catastrophic dust storms. Partially digested stomach contents are not proof of a snap freeze, because the elephant's stomach functions as a holding area-a mastodon with preserved stomach contents was found in mid-western USA, where the ground was not frozen. See also technical PDF article.\n\n \n When did this \"ice age\" take place? Between 4000-4500BC?\n \n\n 'The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics began at the Fall'. This law says that the entropy ('disorder') of the Universe increases over time, and some have thought that this was the result of the Curse. However, disorder isn't always harmful. An obvious example is digestion, breaking down large complex food molecules into their simple building blocks. Another is friction, which turns ordered mechanical energy into disordered heat-otherwise Adam and Eve would have slipped as they walked with God in Eden! A less obvious example to laymen might be the sun heating the Earth-to a physical chemist, heat transfer from a hot object to a cold one is the classic case of the Second Law in action. Also, breathing is based on another classic Second Law process, gas moving from a high pressure to low pressure. Finally, all beneficial processes in the world, including the development from embryo to adult, increase the overall disorder of the universe, showing that the Second Law is not inherently a curse.\n \n Death and suffering of nephesh animals before sin are contrary to the Biblical framework above, as are suffering (or 'groaning in travail' (Rom. 8:20-22)). It is more likely that God withdrew some of His sustaining power (Col. 1:15-17) at the Fall so that the decay effect of the Second Law was no longer countered.\n \n SO the 2nd law of thermodynamics didn't start at the fall, but it STILL disproves evolution!!! emoticon_frazzled \n \n \n'Archaeopteryx is a fraud'. Archaeopteryx was genuine (unlike Archaeoraptor, a 'Piltdown bird'), as shown by anatomical studies and close analysis of the fossil slab. It was a true bird, not a 'missing link'.\n\n Or was it a true reptile? Or both, or something in between? I forget.\n \n\n 'There are no beneficial mutations.' This is not true, since some changes do confer an advantage in some situations. Rather, we should say, 'We have yet to find a mutation that increases genetic information, even in those rare instances where the mutation confers an advantage.' For examples of information loss being advantageous, see Beetle Bloopers: defects can be an advantage sometimes, New eyes for blind cave fish? and Is antibiotic resistance really due to increase in information?\n\n \n They say: don't say this incorrect statement, say this other one instead!\n Wow, the \"information\" thing will never cease to kill me.\n \n \n'No new species have been produced.' This is not true-new species have been observed to form. In fact, rapid speciation is an important part of the creation model. But this speciation is within the 'kind', and involves no new genetic information. See Q&A: Speciation.\n\n Whoa! They should have just stopped at the first sentence. This is awesome, they can't escape the fact that speciation happens.\n \n \n'Geocentrism (in the classical sense of taking the Earth as an absolute reference frame) is taught by Scripture and Heliocentrism is anti-Scriptural.' AiG rejects this dogmatic geocentrism, and believes that the Biblical passages about sunset etc. should be understood as taking the Earth as a reference frame, but that this is one of many physically valid reference frames; the centre of mass of the solar system is also a valid reference frame. See also Q&A: Geocentrism, Faulkner, D., Geocentrism and Creation , TJ15(2):110-121; 2001.\n\n This has got to be my favorite.\n OH! So saying that the Bible says there is a flat, motionless earth is reading it too literally, but evolution on the other hand...\n \n This is great. If I were to take the Bible literally, I would take Psalm 104:5 \"He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.\" to mean that the earth cannot be moved since that's what it says. I would take Genesis 1:5 \"God called the light \"day,\" and the darkness he called \"night.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the first day.\" That was one 24 hour day, since that's what it says.\n \n \n'Plate tectonics is fallacious.' AiG believes that Dr John Baumgardner's work on Catastrophic Plate Tectonics provides a good explanation of continental shifts and the Flood. See Q&A: Plate Tectonics. However, AiG recognises that some reputable creationist scientists disagree with plate tectonics.\n\n Did these reputable creationists realize that we can measure continental drift?\n \n\n 'Creationists believe in microevolution but not macroevolution.' These terms, which focus on 'small' v. 'large' changes, distract from the key issue of information. That is, particles-to-people evolution requires changes that increase genetic information, but all we observe is sorting and loss of information. We have yet to see even a 'micro' increase in information, although such changes should be frequent if evolution were true. Conversely, we do observe quite 'macro' changes that involve no new information, e.g. when a control gene is switched on or off.\n\n AH! the old \"information\" gambit. It only shows that anyone who uses this doesn't no what they are talking about. Take a biology/genetics class and you'd realize how stupid this sounds.\n \n Thank you for finding this page!!!",

   "There are several fallacies with Darwin's theory of evolution: .\n\n \n Somone has mislead you, I implore you to read more on the subject(s).\n \n \n(1) Evolution supposedly explains the \"creation\" of all things in terms of present processes, but the first law of thermodynamics says that nothing is now being \"created.\" \n \n Strawman. Evolution is a process, it's not \"creating\" anything.\n Fallacy: The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It's the conservation of energy. It has nothing to do with the reorganization of matter and/or energy into other forms. Whatsoever.\n No fallacy here on their side, but you're doing pretty good for your first point on your side.\n \n \n(2) Evolution presupposes an innate tendency towards progress and increasing order and complexity in the universe, but the second law of thermodynamics proves there is an innate tendency towards decay and disorder in the universe. \n \n Did you like your physics courses? I did.\n Strawman, and general misunderstanding of physics (#2).\n No, evolution does not presuppose that there is an iinnate tendancy towards progress and increasing order an complexity IN THE UNIVERSE. Fallacy again on your part, but no fallacy on the opposition.\n \n The system of the universe does seem to always follow what we call the 2nd law of thermodynamics, you cannot subdivided the system and look at it, in an isolated fashion, for starters.\n \n Secondly, if you do, it still works fine. You eat order and expel heat and disorder during your life. When you die, your body decays into...a more chaotic state. Even in an organism you only obstruct the second law of thermodynamics, but ultimately, you fulfill it.\n \n \n \n(3) Evolution supposedly is brought about by gene mutations, but almost 100% of all known mutations are harmful or even fatal to the creatures which experience them. \n \n http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/02/020228072919.htm\n There is one link that refutes that misleading statement.\n We can fill up the server with them if you like. No fallacy here either.\n \n \n(4) No example of true evolution from one basic \"kind\" into another \"kind\" is known either in the present world or in the fossil record of the past. \n \n Lungfish? Swimming mammals that have fingers and toes in their fins? What are you asking for exactly? Are you asking if it's possible to collect a fossil from every species through fossils? That's unknown, we have huge gaps not in just the fossil record, but also in entire time periods where we have no fossils. Does this refute anything? No, since with additional fossil information we only get a better picture of evolution, so it's just going to get harder to keep sticking to the same arguments. Certainly no fallacy, you haven't shown anything to refute the theory of evolution.\n \n \n(5) Evolutionary kinship of all creatures would imply a continuous intergrading of all forms of life, but both present life and the records of past life show great gaps between all the different kinds of plants and animals. \n No, some show very few gaps, some show huge gaps not just in the animals, but huge time periods that we have no fossils from. (see above, same argument). It's certainly no fallacy, since to be fallacy you'd need to prove it false, not just \"incomplete.\" \n \n \n(6) Natural selection supposedly accounts for the development of new kinds, but actually tends to preserve the present kinds, since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no \"survival\" value unless it were fully functional from its very beginning. \n \n Present..you mean this year or the next 2,000,000 years? problem is, you can't think about a time span that long. But nature seems to have no issue with it. Furthermore, ANYTHIGN that improves survival, even slightly, can become present in the entire gene pool given competition. So, no fallacy here either.\n \n \n(7) Evolution contradicts the scientific law that no effect can be greater than its cause, since it assumes that intelligence was developed from non-intelligent matter, that morality was evolved from non-moral processes, that love and other emotional qualities came out of unfeeling chemicals, that infinitely complex structures arose from simple beginnings, and that spiritual consciousness began out of inert molecules\n\n \n I've never heard of the law of \"no effect can be greater than it's cause\". Sounds like strawman to me. No fallacy here.\n \n Not like we didn't know the outcome of this before it began. Someone else might have more concise rebuttals, I'm tired and off to bed.\n \n -Mach",

   "There are several fallacies with Darwin's theory of evolution:\n\n But I'll bet that you don't know what any of them are. \n \n(1) Evolution supposedly explains the \"creation\" of all things in terms of present processes, but the first law of thermodynamics says that nothing is now being \"created.\"\n\n Evolution does no such thing. Evolution explains changes in living things. It makes zero claims about the creation of anything. The 1st Law of Thermodynamics is actually irrelevant. Besides the real 1st Law of Thermodynamics says that energy can be neither created nor destroyed.\n \n(2) Evolution presupposes an innate tendency towards progress and increasing order and complexity in the universe, but the second law of thermodynamics proves there is an innate tendency towards decay and disorder in the universe.\n\n Nope. Evolution makes no such presupposition. Evolution does not require any sort of progress or complexity, and evolution does not deal with the universe. Please define what you mean by \"progress\" and \"complexity.\" Also, the Laws of Physics don't prove anything. They are statements of principles that have been repeatedly observed to be true. The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics does not state that there is an innate tendency towards decay and disorder in the universe. Again, evolution does not deal with the universe but only life on earth. Please define what you mean by \"decay\" and \"disorder.\" The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics actually says that it is impossible for any system to operate in such a way tht the sole result whould be an energy transfer by heat from a cooler to a hotter body. Another way of saying that is that the entropy of a closed system cannot decrease. Entropy is not another word for \"decay\". Of course, the word \"disorder\" comes from statistical thermodynamics, where the potential position and momentum of all particles have meaning. That is why water is more disordered than ice - the number of potential arrangements of the particles is much greater.\n \n(3) Evolution supposedly is brought about by gene mutations, but almost 100% of all known mutations are harmful or even fatal to the creatures which experience them.\n \n Nonsense. That's just not true. Most mutations have no effect. Some are harmful. But some are beneficial. However mutation is only one of several mechanisms of evolution. \n \n(4) No example of true evolution from one basic \"kind\" into another \"kind\" is known either in the present world or in the fossil record of the past.\n\n What's a \"kind\"? Of course, evolution is a slow process so only a fool would expect to see one \"kind\" of animal change into another \"kind.\" But there are some quite good examples in the fossil record. The horse and the whale are two. And the dinosaur to bird line is getting better all the time.\n \n(5) Evolutionary kinship of all creatures would imply a continuous intergrading of all forms of life, but both present life and the records of past life show great gaps between all the different kinds of plants and animals.\n \n Actually, there is no such implication. However, there are some things that we might expect if all life is descended from a common ancestor. For one thing, we might expect that the molecule of heredity would be the same across all life. We find that it is DNA. We would expect that the particular codons that encode amino acids would be quite similar for all forms of life. That turns out to be the case, except for minor variations in some primitive forms of life, the DNA code is identical across life. We would expect to see a nested hierarchy of species and we do. We find that house cats are similar to the other 36 species of cat, which are carnivores, which are mammals, which are tetrapods, which are vertebrates, which are chordates. We would expect to find transitional species between major groups of animals, and we do. We find feathered dinosaurs and birds with bony tails and teeth. We find whales with feet. We find reptiles that are very much like mammals, even some with a double jointed jaw that was part of the transition of reptile jaw bones to the inner ear of mammals. We even find mammals that lay eggs.\n \n(6) Natural selection supposedly accounts for the development of new kinds, but actually tends to preserve the present kinds, since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no \"survival\" value unless it were fully functional from its very beginning.\n \n Actually, natural selection tends to preserve a species with only minor changes in a stable environment. But environments tend to change. I don't know what that \"incipient organ\" junk is supposed to mean. Is that another way of saying \"what good is half a wing.\" Well, check out a penguin to find out. Look at a seal flipper. It has the same bones, arranged in the same way as a monkey. What good is it for a land animal? And what does \"fully functional\" mean? What function? Perhaps the new organ had a different purpose - take the clawed hands of fossil birds for example. They were good for catching prey and climbing, just like they were for their dinosaur ancestors. But those clawed wings also allowed early birds to fly.\n \n(7) Evolution contradicts the scientific law that no effect can be greater than its cause, since it assumes that intelligence was developed from non-intelligent matter, that morality was evolved from non-moral processes, that love and other emotional qualities came out of unfeeling chemicals, that infinitely complex structures arose from simple beginnings, and that spiritual consciousness began out of inert molecules.\n\n Sorry, but there is no scientific law that no effect can be greater than its cause. Nor does evolution assume that intelligence developed from non-intelligent matter. However, intelligence does seem to be linked to brain size in relation to body size. And morality, love, and spiritual conciousness aren't matters of genetic change over generations. If you wish to argue against evolutionary theory, wouldn't it be a good idea to actually learn what you claim to oppose?",
