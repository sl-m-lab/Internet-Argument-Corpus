   "Here are some pieces of evidence that show that there were active WMD programs in Iraq:\n \n A clandestine network of laboratories and safe houses within the Iraqi Intelligence Service that contained equipment that was subject to U.N. monitoring and was suitable for continuing chemical and biological weapons research.\n \n A prison laboratory complex that possibly was used to test biological weapons agents on humans. Kay said his investigations have shown that Iraqi officials working to prepare for U.N. inspections were ordered not to declare the facility to the U.N.\n \n Reference strains of biological organisms concealed in the home of an Iraqi scientist. One of the strains can be used to produce biological weapons.\n \n New research on biological weapons-applicable agents, Brucella and Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), and continuing work on ricin and aflatoxin ? none of which were declared to the U.N.\n \n Documents and equipment, hidden in scientists' homes, that would have helped Iraq resume uranium enrichment by centrifuge and electromagnetic isotope separation.\n \n \n \n Should be obvious that the programs were at least there. They had the strains to create the weapons, you'd just have to go stick those in a bioreactor and you're on your way to a lot of new virus particles.\n \n _______\n \n Important to note that massive amounts of WMD could be hidden in a space as small as a two car garage. In fact, the entire Iraqi supply of anthrax, enough to kill tens of thousands of people, could be fit into four briefcases. \n \n Anyway... reportedly they're getting a lot more scientists to cooperate, and the senior people still can't pass their polygraphs. If we find something, I honestly believe it's going to be by chance. Recall those 30 Mig fighter jets? We were operating almost next to them and only found them because the wind blew some of the sand away. Imagine looking for a briefcase of anthrax... can't dig up the whole country.\n \n Information from http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS...kay/index.html, Wall Street Journal, various TV news reports.",

   "The link you gave didn't work.\n \n There is a difference in the claims:\n a) Iraq has WMDs\n &\n b) Iraq has the potential to make WMDs.\n \n The former, has so far yet to be proven. The later is not the claim used by the USA as a cause bellum (reason to go to war). The USA calimed the first, not the last. You are being dishonest if you are now using the later as the excuse.\n \n Imagine if you're on trial for muder. Half way through the trial, the prosecutor says \"Okay, we've found no evidence of a murder, but we now believe that you were attempting to commit murder\" Would you sue for a misstrial?\n \n \"Kay said inspectors have found no weapons, but said he is not ready to say that there are no weapons to be found.\"\n http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/02/sprj.irq.kay/index.html\n \n \n The second statement is hollow as even tiny nations have the potential to create WMDs.\n \n \n \n Anyway... Australia was caught up in the USA's lies too!\n In the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" (this paper, and Melbourne's \"The Age\" are the two leading Australian dailies).\n \n No WMD yet, but PM defends war role\n October 3, 2003 - 1:39PM\n \n Prime Minister John Howard today defended Australia's role in the Iraq war despite a new US report saying weapons of mass destruction were yet to be found in Iraq.\n United States weapons inspector David Kay has released his report in Washington, saying no such weapons had been found.\n But he said there was \"substantial evidence\" Iraq planned to make chemical and biological arms and it would take between six and nine more months to give a firm indication of the state of the Iraqi weapons program.\n Mr Howard today stressed the Kay report was an interim one.\n \"It certainly has already demonstrated a great deal of concealment by the former regime and a clear intention to develop weapons programs,\" Mr Howard told journalists in Brisbane.\n \"I think you have to suspend final judgment until the report has been completed.\"\n Mr Howard said Australia had clear intelligence assessments at the time it joined the coalition forces against Iraq that Saddam Hussein's regime had a weapons of mass destruction capability. \n \"That was unambiguous,\" he said.\n \"That was the basis of the judgment that we made at the time we joined the coalition and I don't retreat from that one iota.\n \"I can understand people disagreeing with our decision but it remains the fact that in March there were assessments then available to our government, to the British government and to the United States government which justified the action we took.\"\n Mr Howard said Saddam would still be running Iraq if there had been no war.\n Mr Kay stressed his findings did not mean the US had concluded there were no weapons.\n He said experts in the Iraq Survey Group that he heads had found \"a large body of continuing activities and equipment that were not declared to ... UN inspectors when they returned in November of last year\".\n AAP \n \n \n The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has\n \"Opp jumps on Iraq weapons report\n The Federal Opposition says a United States report showing no weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq is proof Australians were misled prior to the war. \n The interim document has been released by US weapons inspector David Kay. \n Prime Minister John Howard has moved to downplay the significance of the Kay report, which finds no weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq but does cite dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related programs. \n Mr Howard says he went to war based on the information he had at the time.\n \"The judgment was justified and it's a judgment I totally stand by and do not retreat from one iota,\" he said.\n Mr Howard says before the war the Labor Party also declared that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. \n But Foreign Affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd says Labor was reliant on information provided by the Government.\n \"The Australian Labor Party was dependent entirely upon the intelligence briefings,\" he said.\n Mr Howard says he will wait to see the final report before making a judgment. \n British response\n The British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, has been defending the British and American-led decision to go to war in Iraq, after the release of Mr Kay's report. \n Mr Straw says the resolve of the international community to deal with Iraq would have weakened if military action had not gone ahead. \n He says there was evidence the former Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, had concealed the weapons program.\n \"The Saddam regime posed a threat to international peace and security by reason of its proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, its long-range missile systems and its defiance of the United Nations,\" he said. \n \"And it was because of the Saddam regime's failure to meet the obligations, to deal with that threat, that the military action was taken, and it was taken in support of United Nations resolutions.\"\n http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s959651.htm",
