   "We do not need the electoral college. Our founding fathers set up the electoral college to even out the vote because at that point in history only wealthy, adult, white, male, land owners voted. Now it's purpose is to even out the vote of the people because we have been influenced by media and other sources of influence. But are the politicians whom are the electoral college NOT influenced. In their case, they will not only be influenced by family, friends and media but by their OWN party as well. Why should we take at the minimun 3 (You have three representitives at the very least who represent your state in the electoral college) people whom would have even MORE influence than us to vote FOR us? That is the equilivent of taking at random three citizens and saying \"Okay, who do you vote for?\". The electoral college was also set up to be a \"win or take all\" situation. Like in 2000, with the Goore and Bush election: Goore had won the popular vote, but because Bush won the electoral college vote, he sat in the White House with the title of President of the United States of America. It is unjust that OUR voices do not have the power to select the people to represent US. Not ONLY the electoral college members. We set up our govenment as a Republic so that WE could ELECT (meaning our votes) a man or woman that reflected our personal political views and that they would represent the people. Not to have 12 \"important\" people decide FOR us. There have been multiple movements in the past, but I say that we spread this around. Inform our fellow citizens about how absolutely ridiculous the electoral college is. I can see that if we can get ENOUGH people behind this, we could write a petition to ammend the constitution because of our changed current society. The only reason the electoral college is still in action today, during OUR elections for OUR president, is because politicians like having that POWER. Thank you for your time. I ask you graciously to spread this.",

I ask you graciously to spread this.\n\n \n \n You make a good point and I agree with your premise. But you make one major error. Currently it is not like picking random people to vote, because the party picks people to vote for them. My problem is that even if the electoral vote/person in each state was the same, it would be possible to win the election with 25% (ok 25.1%) because if you get 50.000001% in a state you can win so if you win 50% plus one electoral vote with just barely a majority and lose all the other states unanimously, you have won the election with 25% of the vote. The problem also is that my vote literally does not count. I live in MD and I know that no matter who I vote for the Democrat will win. So basically it magnifies the importance of certain states a lot and renders us voters in largely Democrat or Republican states meaningless. Of course that means politicians don't need to care about these states because they know they will win/lose it. I say make them get all the votes and they will be forced to care about all citizens and worry about the issues that matter to the most people, not the most people in swing states.",

   "I think people forget that we are 50 united states. We have 50 elections for president and then pick one guy. The reason for it was because our founding fathers realized that New York is different for North Carolina. So we have 50 'little countries' and a group to watch over them all..the federal government. Granted the federal government has gotten insanly powerful over the years, but the point still remains that we have 50 states because people are different from state to state and thus are 50 elections for president. I might be in favor of Congress electing the president though...like they used to.",
