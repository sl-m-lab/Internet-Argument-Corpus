   "22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. 24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator-who is forever praised. Amen. 26Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.28Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.",

   "Please, this debate forum is about rights and laws, laws which are NOT based in your Christian Bible, but in equality and human dignity. But since you're so insistant to keep harping on this in religious terms I suggest you try a little reading: \n \n http://whosoever.org/bible/index.html\n \n Romans 1:26 and 27, at first glance, appears to condemn gay and lesbian activity. Paul criticizes sexual activity which is against a person's nature or disposition. But in Greek society of the time, homosexuality and bisexuality was regarded as a natural activity for some people. Thus Paul might have been criticizing heterosexuals who were engaged in homosexual activities against their nature. He might not be referring to homosexuals or bisexuals at all.\n \n The verses preceding 26 might indicate that he was referring to sexual acts associated with idol worship. The verse is too vague to be interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all same-sex activities.[1] \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n ROMANS 1:24-27 \n \n This passage has been used by some Christians to make an issue over how \"unrighteous\" and sinful homosexuals are. In fact, it has been used to support the view that AIDS is the \"penalty of their error which was due.\" What is fascinating about this kind of application is that it is totally at odds with what, I believe, Paul was really saying. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF ROMANS CHAPTER ONE YOU MUST READ ROMANS CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH THREE. The outline is as follows: \n \n I. The Gospel is for EVERYONE, Jews and Gentiles. (1:16) \n \n II. Why? Because God's wrath is against ALL unrighteousness. (verse 18). \n \n II. The Gentiles need the Gospel. (1:28-32) The examples of their \"uncleanness\" include idolatry and homosexual acts which are either connected to or resulting from idolatry. \n \n III. But the Jews are just as unrighteous as the Gentiles. (2:3) \n \n IV. \"All have sinned\" and are \"justified (made right with God) FREELY by God's grace (unearned love) through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.\" (3:23-24) \n \n While Paul is certainly not favorable toward the homosexual acts that he is writing about it is interesting to note that Paul classifies them \"unclean\" which is not necessarily a \"moral\" precept. (According to the Holiness Code lobsters and shrimp are \"unclean\" also.) He may be pointing out that though the Jews are different than the Gentiles in that they are ritually \"clean\" (according to the Old Covenant) they are still just as much in need of the grace of the New Covenant. \n \n Let's look at some of the verses in this section: \n \n Verse 27b \"And receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due\". Is Paul here saying that those who committed homosexual acts were punished in some physical way...as in venereal disease? Or could \"uncleanness,\" being cut off from the Old Hebrew Covenant, be the penalty of the Gentile's error? \n \n 28 \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to adebased mind, to do those things which are not fitting...\" People often take this to mean one of the following things: \n \n Since homosexuals didn't retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind. \n Since the Gentiles were idolatrous God gave them over to a debased mind of homosexuality. However, I believe that Paul was saying the following: \n \"Since the Gentiles did not retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a debased mind. The debased mind is NOT homosexuality but a mind that is centered on unrighteousness, hence the listing of what the Gentile mind is full of in verse 29. \n 29-32 This list of \"unrighteousness\" is being applied to all Gentiles, not Gentiles that commit homosexual sex acts. It is the Gentiles \"who are worthy of death.\" These verses are really just an exposition of verse 18. \n 26-27 Another interesting point to consider is that people often use verses 26-27 to prove that Paul used an argument from \"nature\" to prove that homosexual activity was wrong. However that kind of usage of the word \"nature\" is highly unlikely as Paul usually uses the word \"nature\" or \"natural\" to mean not what \"Mother Nature\" does but instead he means \"the previously accepted common usage\". Nature is not a great teacher about ethics and humans are nowhere called in scripture to emulate it. What is more, homosexual activity DOES go on in the animal world. \n It must be remembered also that Paul was referring to homosexual ACTS, not homosexuals. AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HOMOSEXUAL ACTS PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT... NO ONE KNOWS THE BACKGROUND... We must ask ourselves \"what type of homosexual acts was Paul talking about?\" Was he talking exclusively about homosexual acts connected with idolatry? (Perhaps that was the only kind of homosexual activity he was familiar with.) Was he talking about pederasty? Was he talking about homosexual acts committed with slaves? Was he talking about people of heterosexual orientation committing homosexual acts? Just exactly what type of homosexual acts was he concerned with? Do people have the Right to just ASSUME that these verses were a blanket condemnation of homosexual sex in every context? \n In my personal opinion Paul was referring to same sex sexual acts committed in idolatrous worship by people he regarded as heterosexual. Even the most conservative theologian can only give their opinion as to what type of same sex acts Paul was referring to. No one can state that God clearly condemns all homosexuality activity based upon these verses. It is just too vague. \n \n As for me, based on the context of Paul's writing in Romans chapters 1-3 I choose to believe that God's New Covenant of grace embraces those who believe in Jesus; being a Jew doesn't make you better than a Gentile; being a heterosexual doesn't make you any better than a homosexual. Romans chapters one through three strike at the very heart of self-righteous pride. It is amazing that some Christians continue to lord their own sense of righteousness over gays and lesbians as if their heterosexual sex acts make them somehow better, or less in need of grace. We are all in need of grace and we ALL have that grace in Jesus Christ.",

   "The Dynamics of Becoming \"Born-Again\"\n \n Becoming a born-again Christian usually entails the following: (1 )A person is consciously or sub-consciously concerned with the direction of his life. This may include a recent traumatic happening in his life such as a death, loss of a job, divorce mortgage foreclosure or any number of events which may cause one to look closely at the specific causes and effects in his life.\n \n There may be a \"spiritual hunger\", a strong desire to know \"Why am I here?\", and \"What's the purpose of my life on this earth?\". The realization that one is mortal and that at some time, death will overtake and this earthly existence will cease often plays a big role in \"seeking God\". There are many factors and these are only a few.\n \n (2)The person is in some manner exposed to the born again teaching. This may occur in church, at an evangelistic service, on television, by reading, or other media.\n \n (3)At some point, the person is told that (a) all humans have sinned (transgression or the breaking of divine law) and are therefore sinners. (b)That the bible is the word of God and it states that sinners cannot go to heaven and will suffer some sort of spiritual death forever and that (c)God has, however, provided a way for the sinner by placing the guilt of the sinner on his son, Jesus Christ, who came to the earth as a human and took the sins of all humanity on himself by suffering death by crucifixion.\n \n (4)The individual is strongly encouraged to \"accept\" this sacrifice by Jesus, and ask God to forgive his past sins. When the person does this, God grants him forgiveness and he may now enter into heaven or God's presence when he dies. He is taught that he is a \"new person\" or a \"new creature\" and that the spirit of Jesus Christ is imparted to him - something he didn't have before. He is now a \"spiritual\" being as well as a human being.\n \n The procedure I have described may vary according to different churches and their interpretations of the bible and its requirements for salvation but these are the basic guidelines for salvation. I say this for my Christian friends who may dispute the exact requirements.\n \n The \"new\" Christian is encouraged to become involved with others who have like beliefs. Once other Christians become aware that the person has become \"saved\" or \"born again\", they encourage him to attend fundamentalist churches. The attendance allows the new Christian to be exposed to older Christians who begin their indoctrination and conditioning.\n \n The new Christian is encouraged to attend classes and fraternize only with those who hold the same beliefs. Scripture is used to reinforced these ideas. The new Christian is then 'trained' in the ways of the Lord according to the beliefs of the particular church.\n \n There are many inherent problems with the \"prescription for salvation\" I have described above.\n \n The Problems\n \n The new Christian usually has very little or even no knowledge of the bible and its origins and the history of the church when he makes his committment. Yet he has chosen to base his entire life on the contents of a book of which he knows very little or nothing at all. He is now being very subtly trained by Christians who were once in the same shoes as the new Christian. They teach him what they have been taught by the Christians who were before them - and so on.\n \n The knowledge handed down from the older Christians is allegedy \"bible based\" and \"scriptural\". In fact, it is what they have been taught and decided to accept as true.\n \n The real truth is that the bible is a compendium of books by different authors from different time periods. It describes a biblegod who, during the Passover, killed innocents such as infants and old men and women. It describes him as \"repenting\" or changing his previous committments as he pleases. It contains contradictions, inconsistencies and errors. It sometimes describes God as a singular entity - sometimes as having more than one personality.\n \n Much of the bible is borrowed from earlier, ancient religions. Many of the names and incidents are strikingly similar. One needs only observe the present day Christian holidays to verify this truth. Easter is of Pagan origin. Christmas was celebrated by older religions before Christ arrived.\n \n Although Jesus never referred to his 'miraculous' birth, Christians claim he was born of a virgin - a most unusual happening. The 'original' evidence is supported only in the gospels of Luke and Matthew. It is not supported in any historical work. There are, however, other \"virgin\" births in other ancient religions similar to the one described in the bible. When confronted with scientific evidence that a virgin birth is difficult if not impossible, the born-again response is usually \"God can do anything\". Born-again Christians, on the other hand, will not accept a response from a non-believer which may be superstitious in nature. Any phenomena which occurs outside of Bible teachings is usually attributed to Satan, demons or just plain \"evil\".\n \n While we know that a human must have oxygen to live and that the digestive juices in a whale's stomach will deteriorate metal, nevertheless, the bible teaches us that Jonah lived in a whale's belly for three days and survived.\n \n Again, the Christian response is usually \"God can do anything\" which is, of course, a very inadequate response.\n \n It is important to realize that Christianity invented sin. Then, Christianity offers to \"fix\" it so the sinner can go to heaven. Its sort of like having someone punch you in the eye and then sell you ice to keep the swelling down.\n \n The bible teaches that women are worth less than men. In the Old Testament when women were sold, they were always sold for less money than men. (Biblegod condoned the practice of selling human beings and also condoned slavery.) The Bible commands that women should not be allowed to preach in church. It also commands that women must always be subservient to men.\n \n The new \"Promise Keepers\" movement promises to enforce and keep alive the ancient customs.\n \n The thrust of my comments is to show that the bible is not a book to be trusted to guide one's life. Nor are seasoned born-again Christians accurate or knowledgable with their teachings about salvation, born-againism, etc. They parrot what they've been taught. And what they've been taught is incorrect, inaccurate and unproven. And they in turn teach their falsehoods to others.\n \n Is the Bible Really the Inerrant Word of God?\n It is my sincere hope that no one reading this will ever refuse to explore new areas of information and knowledge because of unfounded fears that new ideas may re-shape their thinking and beliefs. We are all \"captains of our own ship\" and therefore free to accept or reject any or all new information and concepts.\n \n Born again Christians argue that the bible is the infallible, inerrant, inspired word of God. Let's take a close look.\n \n When a born again fundamentalist Christian speaks of salvation or matters regarding his spiritual beliefs, he usually backs up his statements by quoting the bible to prove his authority. He quotes biblical verses taken from various areas of the bible in a certain sequence. The quotes and the sequence serve as the authority to prove that the statements are true.\n \n Nearly any religious doctrine can be \"proven\" by quoting scriptures in the alleged proper sequence, claiming they are all in context with each other.\n \n Christians use scripture to prove they are correct. Interestingly, there are hundreds of differing Christian factions - all using scripture to prove that only they have the truth.\n \n Using Scripture to prove Scripture is factual and true is called \"begging the question\". Proof must come from extra-biblical, non biased, provedn documentation.\n \n Lets go right to the core of belief that the bible is the word of God. How valid is the claim that the bible is inerrant (without error) and that it contains no contradictions?\n \n It is a fact that not a single original manuscript of any book of the bible exists today. We cannot, therefore, say that, in the present tense, \"they are inerrant\". Furthermore, by the time the latest book of the bible was written, all of the original manuscripts had long since been worn out and replaced by copies. There were no firsthand copies. They were copies of copies of copies....and on and on. This means that nobody ever saw the entire bible as it was originally written.\n \n Even if the original manuscripts were inerrant - and there is no evidence that they were - there is presently no way to determine which parts of the bible were originally \"true\" and which parts are now \"false\" or errant.\n \n So if the claim is made the scriptures were inerrant in their original manuscripts, it is an empty, meaningless claim today since there is no way to compare the copies of copies of copies to the original manuscripts to verify their accuracy. There never was an \"inerrant\" bible and there never will be. Fundamentalist Christians will certainly dispute what I have written. Some will say they don't care what I say and that the bible is the inspired word of God and they choose to believe it - not me. That's because the bible says it is the word of god. That's really a \"Catch 22\". A favorite quote by born-again Christians is, \"The bible says it, I believe it, that settles it!\". No reason, logic, thinking or knowledge is required.\n \n If the bible says it, its true. The bible is a self-perpetuating book. It makes claims and then warns and threatens us not to dispute those claims under pain of being cast into a \"lake of fire\". If you choose to believe the entire bible literally, you are left absolutely no room or right to questions its validity or authority.\n \n An interesting note - the entire content of the Bible was chosen by men. The writings which were excluded were excluded by men. Be assured these men all had an agenda which was to propagate and preserve what THEY believed. Some scholars chose to include books contained in the \"Apocrypha\" and these books appear in the Douay-Rheims version of the Bible. Other men chose to omit the Apocrypha, so it is not included in the King James version. The concept of the Trinity of the Godhead was a political issue and was voted upon by religious factions in the early days of Christianity. Whether you accept the Trinity as a part of your beliefs or not, the Trinity is generally incorporated into Chrisitan doctrine because men voted upon the concept and the pro-Trinity faction won. Divine inspiration of what to include and preclude in the Bible then, often depended upon the whims and agenda of a man or a few men who made the decision.\n \n Having Second Thoughts About Born Again Fundamentalist Christianity?\n \n If you're involved in born again, fundamentalist Christianity and you're have second thoughts and doubts about it, join the email discussion group BELOW where you can discuss them with others who feel the same way you do.\n \n The email list below (sometimes called a newsgroup) consists of ex-fundamentalists and those who are interested in walking away from born again fundamentalism or who aren't sure and have questions about whether to leave.\n \n This is a support group and is not intended to take you away from spiritual beliefs in which you are comfortable and in which you wish to stay.",

Paul criticizes sexual activity which is against a person's nature or disposition. But in Greek society of the time, homosexuality and bisexuality was regarded as a natural activity for some people. Thus Paul might have been criticizing heterosexuals who were engaged in homosexual activities against their nature. He might not be referring to homosexuals or bisexuals at all.\n \n The verses preceding 26 might indicate that he was referring to sexual acts associated with idol worship. The verse is too vague to be interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all same-sex activities.[1] \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n ROMANS 1:24-27 \n \n This passage has been used by some Christians to make an issue over how \"unrighteous\" and sinful homosexuals are. In fact, it has been used to support the view that AIDS is the \"penalty of their error which was due.\" What is fascinating about this kind of application is that it is totally at odds with what, I believe, Paul was really saying. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF ROMANS CHAPTER ONE YOU MUST READ ROMANS CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH THREE. The outline is as follows: \n \n I. The Gospel is for EVERYONE, Jews and Gentiles. (1:16) \n \n II. Why? Because God's wrath is against ALL unrighteousness. (verse 18). \n \n II. The Gentiles need the Gospel. (1:28-32) The examples of their \"uncleanness\" include idolatry and homosexual acts which are either connected to or resulting from idolatry. \n \n III. But the Jews are just as unrighteous as the Gentiles. (2:3) \n \n IV. \"All have sinned\" and are \"justified (made right with God) FREELY by God's grace (unearned love) through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.\" (3:23-24) \n \n While Paul is certainly not favorable toward the homosexual acts that he is writing about it is interesting to note that Paul classifies them \"unclean\" which is not necessarily a \"moral\" precept. (According to the Holiness Code lobsters and shrimp are \"unclean\" also.) He may be pointing out that though the Jews are different than the Gentiles in that they are ritually \"clean\" (according to the Old Covenant) they are still just as much in need of the grace of the New Covenant. \n \n Let's look at some of the verses in this section: \n \n Verse 27b \"And receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due\". Is Paul here saying that those who committed homosexual acts were punished in some physical way...as in venereal disease? Or could \"uncleanness,\" being cut off from the Old Hebrew Covenant, be the penalty of the Gentile's error? \n \n 28 \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to adebased mind, to do those things which are not fitting...\" People often take this to mean one of the following things: \n \n Since homosexuals didn't retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind. \n Since the Gentiles were idolatrous God gave them over to a debased mind of homosexuality. However, I believe that Paul was saying the following: \n \"Since the Gentiles did not retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a debased mind. The debased mind is NOT homosexuality but a mind that is centered on unrighteousness, hence the listing of what the Gentile mind is full of in verse 29. \n 29-32 This list of \"unrighteousness\" is being applied to all Gentiles, not Gentiles that commit homosexual sex acts. It is the Gentiles \"who are worthy of death.\" These verses are really just an exposition of verse 18. \n 26-27 Another interesting point to consider is that people often use verses 26-27 to prove that Paul used an argument from \"nature\" to prove that homosexual activity was wrong. However that kind of usage of the word \"nature\" is highly unlikely as Paul usually uses the word \"nature\" or \"natural\" to mean not what \"Mother Nature\" does but instead he means \"the previously accepted common usage\". Nature is not a great teacher about ethics and humans are nowhere called in scripture to emulate it. What is more, homosexual activity DOES go on in the animal world. \n It must be remembered also that Paul was referring to homosexual ACTS, not homosexuals. AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HOMOSEXUAL ACTS PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT... NO ONE KNOWS THE BACKGROUND... We must ask ourselves \"what type of homosexual acts was Paul talking about?\" Was he talking exclusively about homosexual acts connected with idolatry? (Perhaps that was the only kind of homosexual activity he was familiar with.) Was he talking about pederasty? Was he talking about homosexual acts committed with slaves? Was he talking about people of heterosexual orientation committing homosexual acts? Just exactly what type of homosexual acts was he concerned with? Do people have the Right to just ASSUME that these verses were a blanket condemnation of homosexual sex in every context? \n In my personal opinion Paul was referring to same sex sexual acts committed in idolatrous worship by people he regarded as heterosexual. Even the most conservative theologian can only give their opinion as to what type of same sex acts Paul was referring to. No one can state that God clearly condemns all homosexuality activity based upon these verses. It is just too vague. \n \n As for me, based on the context of Paul's writing in Romans chapters 1-3 I choose to believe that God's New Covenant of grace embraces those who believe in Jesus; being a Jew doesn't make you better than a Gentile; being a heterosexual doesn't make you any better than a homosexual. Romans chapters one through three strike at the very heart of self-righteous pride. It is amazing that some Christians continue to lord their own sense of righteousness over gays and lesbians as if their heterosexual sex acts make them somehow better, or less in need of grace. We are all in need of grace and we ALL have that grace in Jesus Christ.\n\n \n There are plenty of other references if you would like: \n \n http://www.rodneyanonymous.com/read/boswell/boswell.html\n \n http://www.gayxjw.org/bible.html\n \n http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/231.ctl\n \n http://www.celebrationoffaith.org/p80310.cfm\n \n http://www.outfordemocracy.org/arch/000314.html\n \n http://members.cox.net/dave-kinnear/rescuing_the_bible.htm\n \n http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Heights/1734/sodomites.html\n \n above are just a few...",

But if there is some insistence on playing the Bible card, which is meaningless in a free society, I suggest this site:\n \n \n Other Bible translations, such as the American Standard Version, J.N. Darby Translation (1890), Hebrew Names Version, New American Standard Bible, New King James Version, New Living Translation, Revised Standard Version, Noah Webster Version (1833), Robert Young Literal Translation (1898), etc. do not differ significantly from the King James Version.\n \n As stated in 2 Peter 3:15-17, we have to be very careful when interpreting the writings of Paul. \"As also in all his [Paul's] epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.\" (KJV)\n \n As stated by Dr. R.S. Truluck, \"Paul's writings have been taken out of context and twisted to punish and oppress every identifiable minority in the world: Jews, children, women, blacks, slaves, politicians, divorced people, convicts, pro choice people, lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals, religious reformers, the mentally ill, and the list could go on and on. Paul is often difficult and confusing to understand. A lot of Paul's writing is very difficult to translate. Since most of his letters were written in response to news from other people, reading Paul can be like listening to one side of a telephone conversation. We know, or think we know, what Paul is saying, but we have to guess what the other side has said.\" 2\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibc3.htm\n \n J. Nelson: \"Paul didn't write it as a condemnation of homosexuality, but as a criticism of Greek behavior in temple worship. Greeks often incorporated sexual behavior in temple worship.\" 1\n D. Bartlett: \"This is the tough one. I think one doesn't get around this. It's the only place in the New Testament where there's any extensive discussion of homosexual relations. In Romans, there's no question that Paul thinks certain kinds of homosexual behavior are a result of the idolatry of the pagan world.\"\n \n (CUT)\n \n Verses are unrelated to homosexuality: The complete passage describes how the ex-Christians engaged in orgiastic, presumably heterosexual sexual activities. This type of behavior was common among Pagan fertility religions in Rome during Paul's time. Paul writes that, later, God \"gave them over\" to something new: homosexual behavior. This implies that throughout their lifetime they had had a heterosexual orientation and had engaged only in heterosexual sex. God influenced them so that they engaged in homosexual sex. This was, for them, an unnatural activity. They were criticized because they were engaged in sexual activity which was unnatural for them. For a person with a heterosexual orientation, homosexual behavior is \"shameful,\" \"unnatural,\" \"indecent,\" and a \"perversion.\" The passage in Romans is not a condemnation of homosexual behavior. Rather, it disapproves of sexual behavior that is against a person's basic nature (i.e. homosexual behaviors by people whose orientation is heterosexual). Presumably this would condemn heterosexual behavior by gays and lesbians -- activity which is equally against their nature. 2\n \n For the vast majority of adults, those who are heterosexual, it is indecent for them to engage in homosexual activities. For the small minority of humans who are homosexual, it would be indecent for them to engage in heterosexual activities. As C. Ann Shepherd writes: \"When the scripture is understood correctly, it seems to imply that it would be unnatural for heterosexuals to live as homosexuals, and for homosexuals to live as heterosexuals.\" 3\n \n Bruce Hahne writes, in point form:\n \"Verses 26-27 exploit Jewish cultural prejudices.\n Good rhetorical strategy: begin with assumptions of audience, build on them to make your point.\n So Romans 1:26-27 speaks only of heterosexual people who act 'contrary to their nature.'\n The text provides neither ethical nor behavioral guidance to lesbian, bay or bisexual people.\" 4\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibc5.htm",

If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. 21 But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. 22 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin. 23 He that hateth me hateth my Father also. \n \n John 17: 14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\n \n Why do homosexuals hate God?

   "Please, this debate forum is about rights and laws, laws which are NOT based in your Christian Bible, but in equality and human dignity. But since you're so insistant to keep harping on this in religious terms I suggest you try a little reading: \n \n http://whosoever.org/bible/index.html\n \n Romans 1:26 and 27, at first glance, appears to condemn gay and lesbian activity. Paul criticizes sexual activity which is against a person's nature or disposition. But in Greek society of the time, homosexuality and bisexuality was regarded as a natural activity for some people. Thus Paul might have been criticizing heterosexuals who were engaged in homosexual activities against their nature. He might not be referring to homosexuals or bisexuals at all.\n \n The verses preceding 26 might indicate that he was referring to sexual acts associated with idol worship. The verse is too vague to be interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all same-sex activities.[1] \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n ROMANS 1:24-27 \n \n This passage has been used by some Christians to make an issue over how \"unrighteous\" and sinful homosexuals are. In fact, it has been used to support the view that AIDS is the \"penalty of their error which was due.\" What is fascinating about this kind of application is that it is totally at odds with what, I believe, Paul was really saying. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF ROMANS CHAPTER ONE YOU MUST READ ROMANS CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH THREE. The outline is as follows: \n \n I. The Gospel is for EVERYONE, Jews and Gentiles. (1:16) \n \n II. Why? Because God's wrath is against ALL unrighteousness. (verse 18). \n \n II. The Gentiles need the Gospel. (1:28-32) The examples of their \"uncleanness\" include idolatry and homosexual acts which are either connected to or resulting from idolatry. \n \n III. But the Jews are just as unrighteous as the Gentiles. (2:3) \n \n IV. \"All have sinned\" and are \"justified (made right with God) FREELY by God's grace (unearned love) through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.\" (3:23-24) \n \n While Paul is certainly not favorable toward the homosexual acts that he is writing about it is interesting to note that Paul classifies them \"unclean\" which is not necessarily a \"moral\" precept. (According to the Holiness Code lobsters and shrimp are \"unclean\" also.) He may be pointing out that though the Jews are different than the Gentiles in that they are ritually \"clean\" (according to the Old Covenant) they are still just as much in need of the grace of the New Covenant. \n \n Let's look at some of the verses in this section: \n \n Verse 27b \"And receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due\". Is Paul here saying that those who committed homosexual acts were punished in some physical way...as in venereal disease? Or could \"uncleanness,\" being cut off from the Old Hebrew Covenant, be the penalty of the Gentile's error? \n \n 28 \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to adebased mind, to do those things which are not fitting...\" People often take this to mean one of the following things: \n \n Since homosexuals didn't retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind. \n Since the Gentiles were idolatrous God gave them over to a debased mind of homosexuality. However, I believe that Paul was saying the following: \n \"Since the Gentiles did not retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a debased mind. The debased mind is NOT homosexuality but a mind that is centered on unrighteousness, hence the listing of what the Gentile mind is full of in verse 29. \n 29-32 This list of \"unrighteousness\" is being applied to all Gentiles, not Gentiles that commit homosexual sex acts. It is the Gentiles \"who are worthy of death.\" These verses are really just an exposition of verse 18. \n 26-27 Another interesting point to consider is that people often use verses 26-27 to prove that Paul used an argument from \"nature\" to prove that homosexual activity was wrong. However that kind of usage of the word \"nature\" is highly unlikely as Paul usually uses the word \"nature\" or \"natural\" to mean not what \"Mother Nature\" does but instead he means \"the previously accepted common usage\". Nature is not a great teacher about ethics and humans are nowhere called in scripture to emulate it. What is more, homosexual activity DOES go on in the animal world. \n It must be remembered also that Paul was referring to homosexual ACTS, not homosexuals. AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HOMOSEXUAL ACTS PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT... NO ONE KNOWS THE BACKGROUND... We must ask ourselves \"what type of homosexual acts was Paul talking about?\" Was he talking exclusively about homosexual acts connected with idolatry? (Perhaps that was the only kind of homosexual activity he was familiar with.) Was he talking about pederasty? Was he talking about homosexual acts committed with slaves? Was he talking about people of heterosexual orientation committing homosexual acts? Just exactly what type of homosexual acts was he concerned with? Do people have the Right to just ASSUME that these verses were a blanket condemnation of homosexual sex in every context? \n In my personal opinion Paul was referring to same sex sexual acts committed in idolatrous worship by people he regarded as heterosexual. Even the most conservative theologian can only give their opinion as to what type of same sex acts Paul was referring to. No one can state that God clearly condemns all homosexuality activity based upon these verses. It is just too vague. \n \n As for me, based on the context of Paul's writing in Romans chapters 1-3 I choose to believe that God's New Covenant of grace embraces those who believe in Jesus; being a Jew doesn't make you better than a Gentile; being a heterosexual doesn't make you any better than a homosexual. Romans chapters one through three strike at the very heart of self-righteous pride. It is amazing that some Christians continue to lord their own sense of righteousness over gays and lesbians as if their heterosexual sex acts make them somehow better, or less in need of grace. We are all in need of grace and we ALL have that grace in Jesus Christ.\n\n \n \n If that is how you interpret it, then I bet you have trouble following kinder egg surprise toy instructions.",

   "ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE\n \n We Baptists believe that each person must interpret the Bible for himself or herself; we are not to let anyone else control our thinking about scripture. Surely there are some helpful guides for interpreting scripture, some principles that we should follow. I have selected a few of these to discuss briefly that I think are very important to our rightly understanding our Bible and perhaps especially the subject of homosexuality.\n \n (1) Understanding the Bible is understanding what the writer wanted his readers to understand. This seems so obvious, but millions of Bible readers and thousands of preachers violate this principle constantly because when they look at a passage, they do not give a thought either to the author or to those to whom he wrote but immediately begin to decide what the words, by themselves, mean. Practically everyone is guilty of this. This leads to almost as many different ideas as there are readers. But the only truth in a passage is the truth the writer was trying to convey to readers who were his contemporaries. The New Testament scholar H. E. Dana, in his Searching the Scriptures, says, \"The ultimate object which we seek in interpretation is the thought in the mind of the New Testament writer which sought expression in the written text.... We should seek to discover the one meaning which the writer had in mind, and then apply that meaning to our moral and religious experience.\"A-1 This is a basic fact about the whole Bible, and it involves several things:\n \n (a) The writer's meaning comes out of his background. While the Bible is an inspired revelation of God, giving us \"truth without any mixture of error\" about God as the Baptist Faith and Message Statement says, God did not dictate; he let the authors of the books write out of their own consciousness and experience, using their own words (for example, the Greek of some NT writers was atrocious. Isn't it wonderful how unimportant that was for God's using them!). The Biblical author can write only out of his own culture, understandings and presuppositions. (Two presuppositions every writer in the Bible had were that everyone was heterosexual and that women were inferior.) People who have gone to church and Sunday school regularly usually know something about the writer's circumstances. The problem often is not ignorance of the writer's background but careless inattention to it.\n \n (b) The writer's meaning is determined by the background and situation of those to whom he wrote. Paul's letter to Philemon is an obvious illustration of this. The scriptures were written to people who lived thousands of years ago. Everything the author wrote to them had in mind their culture, circumstances and needs. Do we read and with great earnestness ask, \"What is Paul saying to me?\" The answer: Nothing. He wasn't writing to me. God is trying to say something to me through something he inspired Paul to write almost 2000 years ago to his (Paul's) contemporaries to meet their first century needs. Paul was applying eternal, Christian principles to their needs. It is my task to see and understand these principles so that I can apply them to my 21st century life.\n \n (c) Our understanding of the writer's meaning is colored by our own culture, experiences, understandings, presuppositions, etc. It is easier for us to impose our culture on the first century writer and readers than it is to understand theirs, so I am sure our interpretations would often be unrecognizable by the writer. If you and I read the same thing, not just the Bible, our interpretations will often be different just because of our different backgrounds and experiences. Which of us will be right? So many times I have stood in the vestibule after a service to speak to people as they left the church and had someone comment on something I had said in the sermon, only to think to myself, Where in the world did they get that? I didn't say anything like that! Many church members have such a cultural revulsion to the thought of same-gender sex that anything in the Bible about it is interpreted as its being the worst of revolting evils. So their thought is, \"No homosexual could ever be welcomed to our church, he or she is just too vile.\" Actually, same-gender sex is in lists along with greed, envy, lying and gossip and is apparently neither better nor worse than those sins. Our culture's influence is what makes them different, not the Bible. (Now, does the list mean that lust is not very bad or that greed, envy, lying and gossip are just as vile in God's sight as lust? That is a serious question: How does God judge sin? The way we do? Appendix C below attempts to say a little about this.) We must try to keep our own background and culture out of our interpretations.\n \n (d) Isn't it obvious and unquestionable that the Bible writers had a purpose for writing what they did? Our understanding of that purpose may be the most important thing about our understanding the meaning. As we read and watch the author fulfill his purpose, our understanding opens up. Whatever the author's purpose, it was for his contemporaries; he didn't have us in mind. Understanding why the writer was writing and what he wanted to accomplish will lead to our finding the principles and eternal truths in the writing.\n \n (e) The meaning of the author is not in his words (!); words are merely imperfect vehicles for use in transferring thought. I can still hear the great W. T. Connor raise his voice in my theology class: \"The Bible does not mean what it says, it means what it means.\" And I also hear thoughtless, defensive cries, \"My Bible means what it says!\" No, nothing ever written or spoken means what it says, it always means what it means. Words are the best things we have for trying to transfer the thinking of one mind to the understanding of another mind. If we are face to face, gestures and tone of voice help, and we can ask, \"What do you mean?\" But if it is something written, we probably never get exactly what was in the writer's mind. Nevertheless, we must try, and remembering principles of interpretation helps.\n \n Every principle of interpretation outlined here is violated when we lift words out of the Bible, out of their context, out of their culture, away from the writer's purpose, hold them up and declare, \"This is what the Bible says!\" An example of this evil is in pointing to Leviticus 18 or Romans 1 and declaring, \"The Bible says homosexuals are going to hell.\" The words of the Bible, wonderful as they are, are still limited in transferring thought, but they are all the writer had for getting his thoughts to his readers. If we can possibly go behind the words to the mind of the writer, we can have a glorious revelation of God. If we stop with the words, we shall find and worship and proclaim only false gods. The right question never is, \"What does this passage say?\" It always is, \"What does this passage mean?\" \n \n If all these things are not considered seriously, we shall have either no understanding of what we have read or a wrong understanding.",

Nevertheless, we must try, and remembering principles of interpretation helps.\n \n Every principle of interpretation outlined here is violated when we lift words out of the Bible, out of their context, out of their culture, away from the writer's purpose, hold them up and declare, \"This is what the Bible says!\" An example of this evil is in pointing to Leviticus 18 or Romans 1 and declaring, \"The Bible says homosexuals are going to hell.\" The words of the Bible, wonderful as they are, are still limited in transferring thought, but they are all the writer had for getting his thoughts to his readers. If we can possibly go behind the words to the mind of the writer, we can have a glorious revelation of God. If we stop with the words, we shall find and worship and proclaim only false gods. The right question never is, \"What does this passage say?\" It always is, \"What does this passage mean?\" \n \n If all these things are not considered seriously, we shall have either no understanding of what we have read or a wrong understanding.\n\n \n \n Joe, please visit liberalslikechrist(I bet you already have) website when you get a chance. The creater of the site really does an excellent job in presented evidence to the public. He's a scholar from 'the old school.' Some of these people worship the bible(which was written by humans and contains various errors) more than Christ himself. The people during biblical time most likely did not understand sexual orientation. I THINK the Ten Commandments are the most important rules to follow and homosexuality is not even mentioned in any of the rules. Therefore, some of these people pull scripts from Paul(he is not God), Leviticus(who in their right mind follow all those rules?), Sodom(What do HETROROSEXUAL OR HOMOSEXUAL RAPE have in common with two people of the same sex in a positive relationshp?), and other incorrect information.",

   "http://img191.echo.cx/img191/9683/therealtargetofhateintheworld0.jpg\n\n \n This picture indicates that \"the favorite target of most homosexuals, atheists, abortionists, feminists, pluralists, and their supporters\" is Christianity. Such a claim seems quite absurd to me, as most homosexuals, abortionists, and feminists are Christian. Why they would be targetting themselves is certainly beyond me. I can say that not a single atheist is Christian, and it certainly does make sense that they would target Christians. An atheist is someone who by definition does not believe in God, and a Christian is someone who by definition does belive in God. Christians are the majority religion, and they are bound to target atheists as much as atheists target them.\n \n On a similar note, we can say that pro-choice people target pro-life people, feminists target anti-feminists, and homosexuals target people who seek to strip or deny rights from homosexuals. Pluralists, well I'm not certain they generally do much targetting...\n \n Anyhow, it's easy to say that \"Christians are made targets\", but that image isn't talking about Christians, it's talking about Republicans. What that image really means is \"republicans are made targets by democrats\", and truthfully, republicans target democrats just as much, if not more than, they themselves are targetted.\n \n Addressing homosexuals specifically, I can agree that homosexuals do target the viewpoints of Christians, they argue against those viewpoints, and some homosexuals will call some gay rights opponents bigots for holding those viewpoints. Gay rights opponents are as likely to do the same to homosexuals. \n \n However, when it comes to hate, I think it is hands-down gay rights opponents who are inciting hatred against homosexuals, not the other way around. No gay rights advocate ever suggests that we should kill gay rights opponents, no gay rights advocate ever suggests that we should treat them worse, no gay rights advocate ever suggests that they life a certain way, engage in an evil lifestyle, or are unfit to raise children. They simply attack the idea that homosexuals should not be granted the same rights as opposite-sex couples.\n \n While gay rights opponents will attack that idea, they will add to it that gay people are sinners, their religion and beliefs must be shunned by the government, and their lifestyle is evil. Many perpetuate outright lies about same-sex couples, including that studies show they are less fit to raise children (just the opposite is true), they are promiscuous instead of monogamous (they are as monogamous as any heterosexual), gay sex leads to AIDS (irresponsible sex leads to AIDS, safe gay sex is as safe as any other sex), and often even that they deserve to die.\n \n It is not homosexuals that are teaching hatred, they are teaching equal treatment of everyone. I myself will be the first to admit that I am no better than any opponent of same-sex marriage. We all deserve the same treatment. Remember that according to Matthew, those who have all manner of evil spoken against them falsely in the name of God are those who are blessed. Are the homosexuals who demand marriage speaking all manner of evil against the opponents of same-sex marriage, or is it those who call homosexuals sinners who are speaking all manner of evil against homosexuals in the name of God? I cannot answer that question for you, but I think it is clear which conclusion I've drawn.",

   "I have to disagree with you there, that's the way it should be but I feel that many people give it a disproportionate(sp) amount of attention compared to other sins.\n\n \n To whit:\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_dira.htm\n \nA recent study by the Barna Research Group throws extreme doubt on these estimates. Barna released the results of their poll about divorce on 1999-DEC-21. 1 They had interviewed 3,854 adults from the 48 contiguous states. The sampling error is within 2 percentage points. The survey found:\n \n 11% of the adult population is currently divorced. \n 25% of adults have had at least one divorce during their lifetime. \n Divorce rates among conservative Christians were much higher than for other faith groups, and for Atheists and Agnostics.\n\n \n Also:\n http://www.divorcereform.org/mel/rreligion.html\n \n \n[I believe the message quoted below was a posting by Prof. Cary Lantz of the Family Studies Dept. at Liberty University, Lynchburg, Va., in response to the study on Baptists having the highest divorce rate. Others had responded that the statistic on evangelicals and Bible-Belt states having the most divorce actually disappears when you control for education levels and poverty.]\n \n Those of us interested in divorce stats know that everyone slices the data\n up idiosyncratically, making it difficult to compare one summary to another.\n However, having said that, according to one Gallup report (1) 10% of\n Protestants and 10% of Catholics are divorced and (2) 26% of Protestants and\n 23% of Catholics have been divorced at some point.\n And, while I couldn't put my hands on the report right at the moment, Barna\n reports that something like 26-27% of Christians identifying themselves as\n \"born again\" have been divorced. (I hope I'm not slaughtering his exact\n language too badly.) (However, to reinforce your point made re: Catholics,\n Barna also found that -- again from memory, so don't quote me -- something\n like 30-35% of those identifying themselves as \"born again\" felt that Jesus\n wasn't totally sinless! This is heresy to historic Christian faith.\n My point is not so much theological as it is to affirm your point that\n people are endorsing labels on surveys (e.g., \"Catholic\", \"evangelical\",\n Christian\", \"born again\") which may be fairly meaningless as far as\n clarifying their personal beliefs. The labels may be, as you say, \"ethnic\",\n or in the case of the diverse ethnic groups comprising Protestantism, the\n labels may represent a \"generational\" identity. My personal crusade is to\n chase down (or do it myself) research which has gone beyond categorization\n by these generic labels which seem to be losing their former meaning, to\n tease out specific beliefs and \"spiritual disciplines\" related to mature,\n committed faith, which may prove to be better predictors (as far as the\n religious variable is concerned) of enduring marriage and/or divorce. A\n long sentence, but I hope you catch my drift.\n My quest at the moment is to track down a 1980 report which suggested that,\n at that time, those who attend church regularly together, pray together\n regularly, and read the Bible together regularly have a <1% divorce rate!!\n I am planning an updated examination of that alleged report; but first I\n need to find the original.\n In a related finding, Greeley (1991) reported that only 1% of those who pray\n together regularly and report a high quality sexual relationship \"think that\n divorce is possible\" for them. Thus, there is some suggestive evidence that\n if we get beyond labels to behaviors (and possibly underlying strongly-held\n faith beliefs) we may begin to find some \"inoculating\" factors againstdivorce.\n\n \n And:\n http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/4903.htm\n \nAnd Christians tend to hang on to bad marriages longer than others, he says. \"The good news is we are staying together longer and taking marriage seriously, but the bad news is we're putting up with a lot more pain and ending up getting divorced anyway.\" \n \n Whiteman believes that Christians who stay in troubled marriages may sometimes be seeking revenge on their mates: \"I have heard both men and women say, I'm going to be the instrument of pain in that person's life.'\" \n\n \n A very \"christian\" attitude.",

   "Actually, unlike some Christians today, Jesus was very forgiving and less harsh on sexual sins. If we follow his example, these things would be treated mildly and openly.\n \n But, one more time, this is a free country and we don't have to follow him. So, live your life as you see fit and let others live theirs without your nonsense. Seems fair to me.\n\n \n \n Hey. . . . Thanks for the out of context sermon. Actually forgiveness was given to people who asked for forgiveness after they repented.\n \n Matt 11: 20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: 21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. 23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.\n \n Acts 2: 37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? 38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. 40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.",

   "Church/state separation in the U.S. Constitution:\n The framers of the U.S. Constitution were concerned that European history might repeat itself in the new world. They wanted to avoid the continual wars motivated by religious hatred that had decimated many countries within Europe. They decided that a church/state separation was their best assurance that the U.S. would remain relatively free of inter-religious strife. Many commentators feel that over two centuries of relative religious peace in the U.S. have shown that they were right.\n \n In 1789, the first of ten amendments were written to the Federal Constitution; they have since been known as the Bill of Rights. The First Amendment reads:\n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" \n \n This was ratified by the States in 1791. \n \n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/scs_intr.htm",

Therefore it is a parable. Parables have hidden meanings. If you didn't know it was aprable you are in the category of an outsider.\n \n Matt 13: 10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 11 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. 12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. 13 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. 14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive: 15 For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. 16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. 17 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.\n \n Matt 22: 1 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, 2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, 3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. 4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage. 5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: 6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them. 7 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. 8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. 9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. 10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.\n 11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: 12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. 13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 14 For many are called, but few are chosen.\n 15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. 16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. 17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? 19 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. 20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 21 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's. 22 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.",

Just because the Ten Commandments sit in a government building does not prove that our government is in any way a \"christian\" government. \n \n If that is the only thing you have to try to prove your point, it's quite lame. \n \n The Faith of our Founding Fathers, by Dean Worbois\n No one disputes the faith of our Founding Fathers. To speak of unalienable Rights being endowed by a Creator certainly shows a sensitivity to our spiritual selves. What is surprising is when fundamentalist Christians think the Founding Fathers' faith had anything to do with the Bible. Without exception, the faith of our Founding Fathers was deist, not theist. It was best expressed earlier in the Declaration of Independence, when they spoke of \"the Laws of Nature\" and of \"Nature's God.\"\n \n Thomas Jefferson: \n \n I have examined all the known superstitions of the world, and I do not find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth.\n SIX HISTORIC AMERICANS,\n by John E. Remsburg, letter to William Short\n Jefferson again: \n Christianity...(has become) the most perverted system that ever shone on man. ...Rogueries, absurdities and untruths were perpetrated upon the teachings of Jesus by a large band of dupes and importers led by Paul, the first great corrupter of the teaching of Jesus.\n More Jefferson: \n The clergy converted the simple teachings of Jesus into an engine for enslaving mankind and adulterated by artificial constructions into a contrivance to filch wealth and power to themselves...these clergy, in fact, constitute the real Anti-Christ.\n Jefferson's word for the Bible? \n Dunghill.\n John Adams: \n Where do we find a precept in the Bible for Creeds, Confessions, Doctrines and Oaths, and whole carloads of other trumpery that we find religion encumbered with in these days?\n Also Adams: \n The doctrine of the divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity.\n Adams signed the Treaty of Tripoli. Article 11 states: \n The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.\n Here's Thomas Paine: \n I would not dare to so dishonor my Creator God by attaching His name to that book (the Bible).\n \n Among the most detestable villains in history, you could not find one worse than Moses. Here is an order, attributed to 'God' to butcher the boys, to massacre the mothers and to debauch and rape the daughters. I would not dare so dishonor my Creator's name by (attaching) it to this filthy book (the Bible).\n \n It is the duty of every true Deist to vindicate the moral justice of God against the evils of the Bible.\n \n Accustom a people to believe that priests and clergy can forgive sins...and you will have sins in abundance.\n \n The Christian church has set up a religion of pomp and revenue in pretended imitation of a person (Jesus) who lived a life of poverty.\n \n Finally let's hear from James Madison: \n \n What influence in fact have Christian ecclesiastical establishments had on civil society? In many instances they have been upholding the thrones of political tyranny. In no instance have they been seen as the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty have found in the clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate liberty, does not need the clergy.\n \n Madison objected to state-supported chaplains in Congress and to the exemption of churches from taxation. He wrote: \n \n Religion and government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together.\n \n These founding fathers were a reflection of the American population. Having escaped from the state-established religions of Europe, only 7% of the people in the 13 colonies belonged to a church when the Declaration of Independence was signed.\n \n Among those who confuse Christianity with the founding of America, the rise of conservative Baptists is one of the more interesting developments. The Baptists believed God's authority came from the people, not the priesthood, and they had been persecuted for this belief. It was they-the Baptists-who were instrumental in securing the separation of church and state. They knew you can not have a \"one-way wall\" that lets religion into government but that does not let it out. They knew no religion is capable of handling political power without becoming corrupted by it. And, perhaps, they knew it was Christ himself who first proposed the separation of church and state: Give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto the Lord that which is the Lord's.\n \n In the last five years the Baptists have been taken over by a fundamentalist faction that insists authority comes from the Bible and that the individual must accept the interpretation of the Bible from a higher authority. These usurpers of the Baptist faith are those who insist they should meddle in the affairs of the government and it is they who insist the government should meddle in the beliefs of individuals.\n \n The price of Liberty is constant vigilance. Religious fundamentalism and zealous patriotism have always been the forces which require the greatest attention.\n \n http://www.postfun.com/pfp/worbois.html\n \n More: \n \n http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/extra/founding-fathers.html\n \n http://earlyamerica.com/review/summer97/secular.html\n \n http://www.glhumanist.org/tim.htm\n \n http://www.herbertwarmstrong.com/christian-founding-fathers2.htm",

   "Bumper Sticker:\"Kill a XXXXX for Christ\" \n \n I added the italics, foolishly; what italics are needed for such a statement. In your small town you probably have not seen that cleverly alliterative bumper sticker. For you and me it is unbelievable, unreal. Sadly, it is very real. \n \n The thinking shown in the bumper sticker and the position of many churches and their pastors abets the crimes against gays and lesbians. Peter Gomes, Professor of Christian Morals at Harvard, says, \"The combination of ignorance and prejudice under the guise of morality makes the religious community, and its abuse of scripture in this regard, itself morally culpable.\"6-1 He relates this:\n \n In preparing for her novel The Drowning of Stephen Jones, based upon the true story of a young gay man tossed from a bridge to his death by a group of young gay-bashers, author Bette Greene interviewed more than four hundred young men in jail for various forms of gay-bashing. Few of the men, she noted, showed any remorse for their crimes. Few saw anything morally wrong with their crimes, and more than a few of them told her that they were justified in their opinions and in their actions by the religious traditions from which they came. Homosexuality was wrong and against the Bible. One of those interviewed told her that the pastor of his church had said that homosexuals represented Satan and the Devil. The implication of his logic was clear: Who could possibly do wrong in destroying Satan and all of his works? The legitimization of violence against homosexuals and Jews and women and blacks, as we have seen, comes from the view that the Bible stigmatizes these people, thereby making them fair game. If the Bible expresses such a prejudice, then it certainly cannot be wrong to act on that prejudice. This is the argument every anti-Semite and racist has used with demonstrably devastating consequences, as our social history all too vividly shows.6-2 \n \n When the funeral of Matt Shepard (above) was held, a Baptist preacher from Kansas with sympathizers from several states were there marching in front of the funeral site with placards reading, \"God Hates Fa**\" and \"*** Matt in Hell.\" It is some consolation to know that the people of the town formed themselves into a wall between the marchers and the family, and when the marchers began to cry out their messages, the people sang \"Amazing Grace.\" (\"***,\" short for \"*****t,\" originated several centuries ago in Europe when people who had engaged in same-gender sex were burned at the stake.)\n \n In the summer of 1998 fundamentalist Christian organizations, fearful of the consideration by some states of recognizing same-gender marriage, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads in major newspapers telling the nation that gays and lesbians are \"sick\" and \"sinful,\" that they can and should be \"cured,\" and that their rights and protections should be denied.6-3\n \n Louise, one of the first things I realized when I started to think about this subject was that the millions of gays and lesbians in this nation will never, with few exceptions, darken the doors of our churches, because they know our attitude toward them is one of hatred and condemnation. Is \"hatred\" too strong a word? A few years ago a Baptist church in Austin ordained a homosexual, and the leaders of the Baptist General Convention of Texas asked the church to disassociate itself from the Convention. The next day The Dallas Morning News ran this two-column headline: \"Baptist General Convention Reasserts Its Hatred of Gays, Lesbians.\"6-4 We may piously say that we don't hate the sinner, only the sin, but the newspaper believed it just the way it was printed, and gays and lesbians do, too.\n \n A writer says, \"Those of us who have published opinion pieces in favor of gay equality can testify that most of the hate mail we get cites religious justifications for the hate.\"6-5\n \n A gay and a straight man worked together and became close friends. Then the straight man became a Christian. When his friend learned about it, he was concerned and asked, \"Now that you are a Christian, will you still love me?\" Isn't that a tragic question? What did this man think about Christians that made him ask that? The Christian has a love that transcends anything known by the world, doesn't he/she? Yet how many Christians would desert such a friendship? Christians! Jesus' love included; our lack of love excludes. I have read that Carl Sandburg was once asked what he thought was the ugliest word in the English language. He thought for a minute and replied, \"Exclusion.\"\n \n Our churches need to change, for the churches ought to be havens for gays and lesbians from the insufferable burdens they bear constantly. But when the world believes that churches despise and condemn homosexuals, those who hate them find encouragement. Fundamentalists such as Southern Baptists and Catholics promote the problems seemingly with a vengeance, declaring homosexuality itself a sin.6-6 Even the mainstream denominations do to a great extent as we read frequently in the papers. Most denominations are discussing it openly; without exception they are divided in their thinking, and the news reports of the discussions publicize the negative rhetoric along with the positive. This subject so needs to be examined and discussed at length in our churches, without passion and with open minds. I believe what I am stating in this letter will be the truth the churches will discover. Then they must act on and proclaim that truth.\n \n When the story of the Holocaust became more fully known, there was recognition that the sin of the Nazis was not the only sin involved--there was the silence on the part of the churches and of other nations as they learned about it during the war. When we know of the hate and the hate-crimes against lesbians and gays, we should not be silent; we have a responsibility to fight it. Our silence encourages it and makes us guilty.\n \n Pastor Paul Duke is preaching about the sufferings of gays and lesbians:\n \n Whose fault is this? It's the fault of us all. It's the fault of any of us who make jokes about gay people, who insult them with the use of demeaning names. It's the fault of us who are silent when others do these things or when they publish lies about what homosexuality is. And it's the fault of us who don't provide a safe place and a caring response to those of homosexual orientation. Who knows how many hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost - to violence, to suicide, to drugs, to promiscuity, to AIDS, to shattered self-esteem, to life forever outside the doors of the church - because we have participated in or by silence colluded with the demeaning and the ostracizing of homosexual people. In this respect there is blood on the hands of the church. And that's what has driven me more than anything else to talk with you as I am doing. I have had a vision of Christ at the judgment asking, \"Why were you silent?\" Why has the church abandoned these children of God to despair and to death? When people are lost and dying by the millions you don't pontificate about sexual morality, you reach out to them, you give them a safe place, you listen, you talk, you love with the love of Christ.6-7\n \n You and I realize that the people in our churches are ignorant about the truths I have already stated about homosexuals and homosexuality. They must be made to realize that honesty and integrity demand they make judgments on the basis of knowledge and not on groundless feelings and prejudice. It's like the race hatreds and segregated churches of a few decades ago; most church people know better now and our churches are at least open to all. The same must happen with this issue. I think of the homespun philosopher Josh Billings' saying, \"The longer I live the more I find it necessary to reexamine those things about which I was once most certain.\" The church can't begin its reexamination too soon.\n \n I've given a lot of space to the church here, but that's where we both have our hearts. And our churches are so terribly wrong here, just as they were in the sixties with the race issue and 150 years ago with slavery. All the wonderful things our churches are doing and the immeasurable importance they are to our society can't cover up our woeful failures in this matter.\n http://www.godmademegay.com/Letter.htm",

   "Romans 1: 23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.\n 24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. 26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.\n \n Well actually it doesn't say \"and will burn in eternal hell fires\" since Christ has a simple plan for the sick dogs (dog = homosexuals) called death.\n \n Luke 19: 27 But these enemies of mine, those not desiring me to reign over them, bring them here and execute them before me.\n \n 1 Cor 6: 9 Or do you not know that unjust ones will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor abusers, nor homosexuals, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous ones, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor plunderers shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And some were these things, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.\n \n Rev 22: 15 But outside are the dogs and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and everyone loving a lie, and making it. \n \n Deut 23: 18 You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the price of a dog, into the house of Jehovah your God for any vow; for even both of these are an abomination to Jehovah your God.\n\n \n \n \n lots of yammer, but anal sex is not mentioned in any of that and that was the challenge you didn't meet.\n \n You also quote the bible as using the word \"homosexuals\" which didn't show up in history till 1869. \n \n Just show you are brainwashed. a robot.",

   "Several passages in the Bible speak of same-gender sex. In every instance, the Bible is talking about heterosexuals who, filled with lust, have become sex perverts. The Bible says nothing about innate homosexuality as we know it today or about people who are homosexuals.\n \n Until the late nineteenth century, as already mentioned, the concept of homosexuality was totally unknown. No Bible writer knew of homosexuality, so no Bible writer could have said anything about it. When the Bible speaks of same-gender sex, it is always talking about heterosexuals who are given over to such lust that they commit lustful acts. There cannot be anything in the Bible that says anything about (unknown) homosexuality or homosexual people or acts by homosexuals.\n \n No one questions the Bible's condemnation of sexual lust, and today that would be whether it was homosexual or heterosexual. Some want to say that same-gender sex acts are condemned by the Bible, and it doesn`t matter by whom they are committed. No, lustful same-gender sex acts are. Heterosexual sex acts are also condemned by the Bible whenever they are lustful, but that doesn't mean all heterosexual sex acts are condemned. It is the lust that is condemned, not an act. If we recognize that opposite-gender sex can be either lustful and evil as in rape or be moral and beautiful as between loving spouses, we must recognize the possibility that same-gender sex can be moral and beautiful, as well as lustful and evil. (This is discussed further in Eight below.) The Bible says nothing about homosexual people being sent to hell.\n \n As stated above, until 1869 there was no written idea of homosexuality being an innate part of one's nature. Until that time it was believed that all people were heterosexual, but some were so perverted that they engaged in same-gender sex. When the Bible writers talked on this subject, within their culture and understanding, that is what they were talking about--that kind of heterosexuality.\n \n Nevertheless, there are Bible passages used by some people today to condemn homosexuals. I want to discuss each passage in some detail to show that not only is there no statement about homosexuality, but also that there is no statement applicable to homosexual sex if that sex is not lustful. Many authors write on this subject, and I am indebted to many of them.\n \n http://www.godmademegay.com/Letter.htm",

They are both part of the Old Testament Holiness Code, a religious, not a moral code; it later became the Jewish Purity Laws. [\"Abomination\" is used throughout the Old Testament to designate sins that involve ethnic contamination or idolatry. The word relates to the failure to worship God or to worshiping a false god; it does not relate to morality.] Professor Soards tell us, \"Old Testament experts view the regulations of Leviticus as standards of holiness, directives for the formation of community life, aimed at establishing and maintaining a people's identity in relation to God.\"B-4 This is because God was so determined that his people would not adopt the practices of the Baal worshipers in Canaan, and same-gender sex was part of Baal worship. (The laws say nothing about women engaging in same-gender sex; probably this had to do with man's dominance, and such acts by the subservient had nothing to do with religious impurity.)\n \n God required purity for his worship. Anything pure was unadulterated, unmixed with anything else These Purity Laws prohibited mixing different threads in one garment, sowing a field with two kinds of seed, crossbreeding animals. A few years ago in Israel when an orthodox government came into power, McDonalds had to stop selling cheeseburgers. Hamburgers, OK. Cheese sandwiches, OK. But mixing milk and meat in one sandwich violated the Purity Laws--it had nothing to do with morality. These were laws about worshipping God, not ethics, and so have no bearing on our discussion of morality. Helmut Thielicke remarks on these passages: \"It would never occur to anyone to wrench these laws of cultic purification from their concrete situation and give them the kind of normative authority that the Decalogue, for example, has.\"B-5\n \n \n \n Another reason they are not pertinent to our discussion is that these laws were for the particular time and circumstances existing when they were given. If you planted a fruit tree, you could not eat its fruit until its fifth year, and all fruit the fourth year must be offered to the Lord. A worker must be paid his wage on the day of his labor. You must not harvest a field to its edge. We readily dismiss most of them as not applicable to our day and culture, and if we dismiss some of them for any reason, we have to dismiss all of them, including the sexual regulations, for that same reason.\n \n \n \n When we add the fact that these laws were talking about heterosexuals, it makes three reasons, any one of which would be sufficient, why they have no bearing on questions about homosexuals or homosexuality or on the morality of same-gender sex by homosexuals today.\n refernces:\n B-4 Soards, Marion L, Scripture and Homosexuality: Biblical Authority and the Church Today, 57\n B-5 Helmut Thielicke, 227\n \n http://www.godmademegay.com/Letter.htm",

It would certainly end the debate about gay rights very quickly, if we followed the verse, and believed in this interpretation of it.

   "Let me first say that NONE of this ought to matter one fricken bit in determining my civil rights.\n \n BUT, if there is some chance that REASON might call theologians to their moral and ethical duty, I say give 'em a chance.\n \n \nHere is the original Hebrew script of Lev. 18:22, a verse often used as a blanket condemnation of homosexuality.

Isn't it odd that in a book of the bible that goes into minute detail on so many subjects, that the author of Leviticus didn't get down to the nitty gritty? One could conclude that \"lying with a woman\" means penile/vaginal intercourse. So, maybe the words are meant to allude to anal sex. Odd that anal sex in general isn't mentioned, as it was and remains a rather common act between heterosexuals, especially those with no reliable means of birth control available. But I digress.\n \n What about hand jobs? What about oral sex? Is anyone really going to argue with a straight face that a man going down on another man's lap resembles in any way, a man lying with a woman? \n \n Please explain the similarities.

(Only goes to show how legitimate God must view it to never once even mention it in the Bible, while considering a relationship between a man and a woman valid to the point of even using it as a symbol to represent a person's relationship with God Himself.) Yet even then, as you well know, homosexual acts are mentioned several times.\n\n \n God says somewhere that a person's relationship with the divine is like a sexual union in marriage?
