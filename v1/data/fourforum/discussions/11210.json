   "After passing this yard several times and seeing what I thought to be some sort of flower scattered widely throughout the yard, I stopped for some close up photos. The dew on the \"flowers\" in the early morning had caught my attention and initiated some pondering about what they could be.\n \n I was surprised to find that each \"flower\" is actually a web, spun like a funnel coming out of the ground...and each has a resident spider such as the one in the bottom photo.\n \n Being the first I'd seen of this king of \"spider town\", I just had to share and ask the experts what kind of spider would do a thing like that?\n \n http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y86/jimstrucking/misc005.jpg\n \n \n \n http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y86/jimstrucking/misc006.jpg\n \n \n \n http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y86/jimstrucking/10.jpg",
