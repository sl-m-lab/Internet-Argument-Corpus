   "Obama has clearly stated that he does not intend to raise the taxes of anyone who makes less than $250,000 or $200,000 a year. And yet, McCain has frequently stated that \"Obama wants to raise your taxes.\" Thus, it is clear that McCain is directing his remarks to those who earn more than $200,000. Once one understands the target audience, then more of McCain's remarks are clear. He says that he will \"reduce your taxes in order to create jobs.\" So it seems clear that McCain is still following the old, discredited trickle down tax plan followed by Reagan; reduce taxes on the rich and that money will trickle down to the middle class. It didn't work with Reagan, it didn't work with either Bush, and it won't work with McCain. In fact, the Republican National Committee actually announced during the Clinton years that the trickle down economy didn't work and was bad economic policy. You would be hard pressed to find that press statement today. It was a one shot release that was in the news for only a couple of days - then it disappeared forever.",
