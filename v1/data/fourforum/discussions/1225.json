   "Has anyone read the book \"Gospel Reloaded\"  I scanned it breifly in Barns and Nobel, they wanted too much money for it. I found the premis interesting. The book was an atempt to link the story of the Matrix  to the gospel story. What was also interesting was a biography of the Wachaski brothers. The reason behind my request is to find out if any one knows towhich faith they subscribe. I was told Buddism, however the Matrix flies in the face of Buddist idiology. I just returned from seeing the Matrix Revolutions much better the it's predicessor. I watch and see the Symbolic Christ through the series and especally in this chapter of the story. Just wondering about some other thoughts, and the possible source to the authors intuition.",

   "I haven't seen any but the first matrix- so these comments are based only on the first installment of the trilogy.\n \n I have been told by a philospohy major I know that the matrix is a direct retelling of the cave theory ( i beleive it was nietzche) \n The story is not just another version of the christ tale, although certain words come straight from christian scriptures... It is the first time honored tale of movies... the hero's journey. \n I find things in the Matrix remarkably resemble buddhist teachings...that the reality we know is designed within the mind.. that there is a whole different reality that very few are aware of. My favorite part of the movie is the cool little zen-master kid...\"there is no spoon\" Another part I like is when the Oracle tells Neo he is not the one... the schools of zen are full of stories of monks thinking they have it figured out, but the master tells them otherwise.\n I think (I hope) the wachowski brothers tried to develop a new tale out of several contributing factors... rather that just paraphrased the bible.",

The only real corralation can be seen in the messianic figure of Neo. My question is is this the intent of the Wachowski brothers or a fluke as often seen in movies. Sometime christians see things in the story of movies not intended in order to justify seeing them. I beleve that it was intentional and willful part of the story in this case and was hoping some one here has read a biography of the brothers to confirm of deny this claim.",

   "Without directly questioning the creators, who WILL have answers (unlike God, who we are not supposed to test, just blindly swallow His unproven promises and unfulfilled prophecies), we can never really know their true intent. It's easy to see correlations between Christian mythology and The Matrix; however, I can't accept that it's really that simple. The Matrix could perhaps more correctly be defined as a fusion of philosophies and mythological interpretation of humanity's existence throughout time. The Bible is not the only book in the world with false prophecies and messiahs, and if you think it is, do climb out from under your rock. A rpophecy is a common religious idea, even an idea used in popular culture. There is a prophecy in Star Wars, for example. One can argue that it has or has not been fulfilled by Anakin or even Luke, but that's another thread for another time. \n \n One argues that they are seeing the film The Matrix for what they want it to be, i.e. Christian mythology, interpreting Daoism, etc. However, to do so is to miss the point: how can we fully know that what we see, hear, feel, touch, taste, and understand is reality? To have complete faith is to deny that there is any other possibility, and to do that is to admit an inability to be humble. For the Christian, how can he/she know that God's word is really what He claims it to be? Has He not tested His follows, misguiding them? If He created All, then evil, too, fits into His resume. How can a just creator willingly test us like that?\n \n All I'm saying is this: everything deserves scrutiny and skepticism. Including God.",

   "The Allegory of the Cave is Plato, well, well before Neitzche, but otherwise yes. \n Not read the book but the theory I have heard before (in school assembly) but it does make a few mistakes as well though I can't actually remember the details. \n The most important thing to remeber about the Matrix is that primarily it is the Matrix, a sci-fi film, and not actually the gospel according to the wachoski brothers",
