The draft would make sense if for instance the US needed people to help fight to protect our allies from being over run.

After which, they go to a forward combat area, and serve a tour of 1 year. So lets say the average time from enlisting to discharge lasts 15 months. The draft is not just a concept, it is a law (currently inactive). My idea for people who refuse the draft is to have them serve a 15 month prison term. During this prison term, the prisoners work in some way to support the war effort. \n \n Those who evade the draft by moving to another country should automatically have their US citizenship revoked. They should be notified that if they return to the US, they will be inprisoned for a term of 15 months. At the end of this term they will be given a hearing to determine if they should get their citizenship back. \n \n These may seem like rather stiff sentences especially from someone who does not really support the idea of a draft, but I do support the idea of laws.

The rest are all support and administration. Realistically, we probably need 300,000 troops in Iraq to get done what we claim we want done the way we want it done. There are those in the government that are already hinting about taking action against syria. \n \n If we are going to continue invading little countries all over the world, we need a draft. Currently, we have lost almost all of afghanistan. We need a lot more troops there if we are actually going to try to claim that as a victory. We don;t have enough combat troops to secure Iraq and Afghanistan at the same time even if you put forth every combat capable unit in the military. \n \n This is an important question that Americans need to answer. How far are we willing to go, and how many are we willng to kill in pursuit of global conquest?",

We use our military to protect American business inerests. To a lot of people in the world, this looks like aggression.\n\n \n This simply is not global conquest. Global conquest would involve taking control of the world as many have tried in the past. What the US is trying is to get every nation in the world to form an economy and government similar to ours. We are not trying to control their economy or government after that point. This all began during the Cold War when the US was standing up for Democracy and freedoms while Russia was pushing for Communism and police states. Both sides went to war and lost thousands of lives pushing their own agenda with neither side trying to attempt global conquest. It was a matter of trying to shape the world in each sides own view. The US won that war and due to that fact billions of people now have freedom.\n \n Now the Cold War may be over but there are still nations out there that are suffering a similar fate to those who were once communist and many of them are dictatorships. Also assuming the entire world becomes a free market/democracy it is far less likely that terrorists will be able to exist in coordinated groups as they do today. Governments like North Korea's and Syria's would also not exist. India and Pakistan would not be at each others throat and China and Taiwan would eventually become one under peaceful terms. This is what the US is pushing for. Just as peace we secured in the Cold War by aggressively moving against those who were communist we will also be able to secure peace in the war on terror by going after dictatorships especially in the Middle East. Yes this is the peace that the US is looking for but so is much of the world. Instead of just hoping that the Middle East will work things out, which it won't, we are going to make them work things out.\n \n So while I agree that we are begin aggressive in going after our own interests I see us as doing now what we did in the Cold War. We are going to war to secure peace, not to capture land.",
