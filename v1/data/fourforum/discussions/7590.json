Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), stoppage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (stroke), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (heart attack or angina pectoris) or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes and subsequent serious medical consequences. \n \n 2. In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. In addition, some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer. However, liver cancers are rare. \n \n 3. High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped. The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed leaflet given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your healthcare provider if you notice any unusual physical disturbances whiletaking the pill. In addition, drugs such as rifampin, as well as some anticonvulsants and some antibiotics may decrease oral contraceptive effectiveness. \n \n Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly after using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age. \n \n Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral con-traceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone-sensitive tumor.\n Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral con-traceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives. There\n is insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the pill may cause such cancers. \n\n \n \n Where will the government be when lawsuits are filed against Wal-mart for products that cause health problems and even DEATH. I can see the headlines already. Wal-mart known or should have known that BC pills/patch causes cancer/clotting and even death and by selling a product and profitting from a product Wal-mart hands are not clean, and I rule in favor of the plaintiff....5 million dollars.\n \n http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?hint=2&DR_ID=33664\n http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-11-10-birth-control-patch_x.htm\n \n Law suits are happening as we speak over the birth control patch.\n Maybe just maybe Wal-mart doesn't want to be a part of the trend of promoting early deaths with blood clots and possibly Cancer!!!\n \n And I know people, they sue EVERYONE, from the maker to the seller. So the question is, should a government force a company to sell a disease causing product????????? And the answer is NO.",

You can say individuals pollute and extort etc but you aren't for regulating their activity. So I take a consistent approach to this whole issue. You can regulate individuals and their activities so long as the people approve of it (which doesn't mean I may agree with what the people wish to regulate). Therefore if the people want to say \"businesses can't pollute and homosexuals can't marry\" then I believe they have every right to do so.

So, in summary, what Massachussets has done is require Wal-Mart to stock a drug that can kill living human embryos.\n\n \n \n See there is an agenda.

   "I like how you say \"individual rights\" as if a business is some machine made up out of nowhere coming to attack the human race. A business is made up of \"individuals\" that are performing an activity. The activity of selling makes it a business. You can say individuals pollute and extort etc but you aren't for regulating their activity. So I take a consistent approach to this whole issue. You can regulate individuals and their activities so long as the people approve of it (which doesn't mean I may agree with what the people wish to regulate). Therefore if the people want to say \"businesses can't pollute and homosexuals can't marry\" then I believe they have every right to do so. Of course it becomes harder to regulate when mess with the constitution--assuming US-- (which none of the examples do). I think you are just wrong to imply someone in a business is not part of the public.\n \n It has to do with the morning after pill\n\n \n Look at the state of business in the late 19th century when there was no regulation. Business in the name of profits would have no problem dumpping all kinds of toxic garbage into rivers and landfills if not regulated not to. If not forced to pay a minimum wage business in the name of profits would pay people an unjust wage and take advantage of thier being desprate. Business in the name of profits would cut worker safety. Busisness in the name of profits would do almost anything to cut costs.People in business, unless it effects them personally, are allways looking out for the bottom line and if there were no regulations on safety, pollution, and wages people in business will take any opportunity to cut costs.",

Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), stoppage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (stroke), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (heart attack or angina pectoris) or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes and subsequent serious medical consequences. \n \n 2. In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. In addition, some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer. However, liver cancers are rare. \n \n 3. High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped. The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed leaflet given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your healthcare provider if you notice any unusual physical disturbances whiletaking the pill. In addition, drugs such as rifampin, as well as some anticonvulsants and some antibiotics may decrease oral contraceptive effectiveness. \n \n Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly after using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age. \n \n Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral con-traceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone-sensitive tumor.\n Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral con-traceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives. There\n is insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the pill may cause such cancers. \n\n \n \n Your mistake in your thinking is PRODUCTS are the same as RIGHTS and they are NOT.

   "See there is an agenda.\n\n No, there's no agenda. You asked why it was posted in the abortion forum, and I said why; mainly because it has to do with a drug that is very controversial for the reasons I stated earlier.\n \n \nBTW walmart also carries many other types of drugs, namely alcohol, that can kill a fetus also. Not to mention caffine isn't the greatsest thing fo a fetus.\n\n This is beside the point. The point I'm making is not that Wal-Mart should not be able to sell things that may kill a fetus, my point is that they should not be required by the government to do so. Deciding what drugs to sell and not sell should be up to the individual pharmacy so long as they are not government entities.\n \n For instance, I think (can't remember, and won't look it up) that California allows medical marijuana. If they do not, simply imagine a hypothetical state that does. Doctors may prescribe that patients use marijuana, but does that automatically mean that Wal-Mart should have to stock such things? There are many reasons from a business standpoint that they would not wish to do so, and thus they probably will never stock medical marijuana. Should the government be able to force them to offer that drug also? That would be ridiculous. If the government wants to make such prescriptions more available, they should start their own government run pharmacies.\n \n \nWhat drug is walmart being forced to carry?\n\n Morning after (also known as Plan B) pill.\n \n \nBy not stating clearly what this thread was about has led two different subjects.\n\n Don't try to blame your misunderstanding on the poster. The first post clearly said to read the news story first before answering.\n \n \nYes walmart should be forced to carry any drug that a doctor can perscribe if they offer pharmacy services.\n\n Even marijuana? That's ridiculous.\n \n \nNo walmart should not be forced to carry any product they don't want to unless it is the a formentioned perscription.\n\n This is contradictory.\n \n \nOk my mistake I did not follow the link but I have the same dislike for foxnews as steeeeve has for 365gay.\n\n But as I understand it, steeeeve still visits your links. It was just an interesting story, and every news agency covered it. It just so happened I was on foxnews when I thought about starting a thread about it. For instance, you could find this story at CNN, CBS, ABC, Reuters. You could also find information at these less than biased (and certainly not news agency) sites: NOW and Planned Parenthood. So, in short, just because a story is from a news agency you don't like does not mean that you shouldn't take a look at the story, especially if the thread builds off of that story.\n \n \nMY statement still stands. If a docor can prescribe it a company should be forced to carrythe drug. That's why it is a perscribed medication.\n\n Again I point to my medical marijuana example (which I'll bet you will disagree with). The bottom line is that every part of Wal-Mart (including their pharmacy) is a private business. They should be to make the decision not to offer any products they do not wish to offer. If women Massachusetts wanted to get their morning after prescriptions filled, they could have gone to any other major pharmacy in the state to do so.",

Now, what you are telling me is that both of these people can have the government tell them what type of toasters they have to sell or what type of microwaves they have to sell. The point of showing this is that everyone is considered a buyer and seller. We all trade. But you wish to only be able to restrict or regulate a persons activity as a seller and not a buyer. I say either both or none. If you say \"no one can have cocaine\" you restrict a seller and buyer. If you say \"all citizens must has cocaine\" you regulate the buyer. If you say \"all cocaine sellers must sell tylenol\" then you regulate the seller. I think we agree on all that I said about but you wish to be inconsistent with the government control and say you seller is subject to regulation and restrcition. I must ask why this is the case? Why should the buyer have more freedom then the seller but this freedom flips when the rule is reversed? Why can't the seller have more freedom or why can't you do it on equal ground? \n \n \nIt depends on the justification. In our case, Wal-mart is the major or sole purveyer of pharmacy drugs for the State, I'm assuming. What Wal-mart does not sell is an issue for the whole State. If what Wal-mart does not sell is considered to negatively affect the health of the State, the State is justified in requiring Wal-mart to sell said item if it wishes to maintain a pharmacy.\n Ok, i argue with this point because there were many other places to obtain the medicine and Wal-Mart actually directed you to a place to obtain the medicine. So you assumed incorrectly. You also need to prove that the morning after pill is beneficial to the health of the State.\n \n \n\n If you were the only car dealership in the State and the dealership as a whole morally objects to selling a certain model, and this model is a health issue for the State, then the State would be justified in requiring this model to be available to those who want it.\n What does health have to do with anything? Why is health different from anything else? Maybe the state just has an interest in having more than one style car on the road.\n \n \nIf you are the only or the major restaurant available in the State and morally object to cooking well-done steak, I would think the State justified in requiring well-done steak to be available for those who wish the option because it is a health issue.\n I fail to see why health is such a key issue. The buyer could just not eat out. Or, the state could make it illegal for people to eat non-welldone steaks. Why is this any different? See my buyer seller thing above.",

   "They don't for some businesses. Never the less, the reasons for taxes are beyond our discussion for free trade.\n\n \n Nevertheless, private citizens are treated differently by the gov't than businesses are. \n \n \nWell obviously they do not the question is should they?\n\n \n The question is whether the gov't stepped outside their bounds by requiring Wal-mart to stock EC at their pharmacies, and whether this is the same as requiring private citizens to do something. The answer is no on both counts because businesses are not private citizens.\n \n \nWHy is selling an activity that is any different from other activities a private citizen might do?\n\n \n A private citizen selling something is not a corporation selling something. A person selling on behalf of a corporation is not a private citizen selling you his toenail clippings. The corporation is selling, not the person.\n \n \nIt seems like you want to tell the seller how to do something but you don't wish to tell the buyer how to do something. What is the reasoning for this? Do you support price setting as well? How is this having a free market?\n\n \n Is a monopoly a free market, Steve? Really free?\n \n \nHow can one act like a private citizen? They just are; no matter what activity they are preforming...working, brushing teeth, etc. Although I would like to know the differnce in a public citizen and a private citizen...I don't really understand how you switch between them.\n\n \n A person selling on behalf of a corporation is not selling as a private citizen. They are selling as part of a corporation. When performing an activity as part of a corporation you are not performing that activity as a private citizen.\n \n \nI must ask why this is the case? Why should the buyer have more freedom then the seller but this freedom flips when the rule is reversed?

So you assumed incorrectly. You also need to prove that the morning after pill is beneficial to the health of the State.\n\n \n I need to prove no such thing, I only need to prove that the State can judge it such and then act as it did.\n \n So, why all the hoopla about Wal-mart when that store can't even control what the pharmacy carries? If it just directs people to different pharmacies how can any action against the store affect anything?\n \n \nWhat does health have to do with anything? Why is health different from anything else? Maybe the state just has an interest in having more than one style car on the road.\n\n \n I would not judge that sufficient justification. Health issues are more important than what car people drive.\n \n \nI fail to see why health is such a key issue. The buyer could just not eat out. Or, the state could make it illegal for people to eat non-welldone steaks. Why is this any different? See my buyer seller thing above.\n\n \n Agreed, but if the buyer does and you're the only game in town I view it as valid that the gov't requires you to provide well-done steak for those who wish it, because well-done has the best chance of killing meat born diseases.\n \n I would not view it as valid for the gov't to restrict businesses from providing less than well-done steak, though, nor would I view it as valid for the State to forbid people from eating less than well-done steak.",

When someone applies a principle to everyone, they are not discriminating against anyone. When somone treats all people the same when applying a principle, they are not discriminating against anyone. So, when a pharmacist refuses to fill abortion pill prescriptions (for whatever reason), they refuse to fill it for everyone.

A private company is not barred from discriminating, except of course, as a state determines. In some states, an employee of a private business can be fired for any reason or no reason at all (employment at will), and thus it seems that (at least in the aforementioned states) a consumer can be denied a good/service by a private company for any reason or no reason at all.\n \n \nJust as a woman owns her own body, so does a pharmacist own their own body.

That very issue has been covered and studied multiple times. You should check it out....or wander over to the gun control forum where there are plenty of folks who will straighten you out. As is, it is just a cheap, chilidish jab akin to a temper tantrum. Certain to increase your credibility when you are already making a horribly illogical argument. Next you might post a short video of yourself throwing yourself on the floor kicking and screaming. My 3 yr old seems to think it is effective.\n \n \nAs for access to abortion, there was an underground of abortion providers before Roe v. Wade and this underground can be reactivated again if it proves necessary.\n\n \n If they really want to have a back alley abortion, I guess that is OK, though completely foolish given the fact that there are thousands of providers in this country willing to do them. A woman has the right to an abortion. She simply does not have the right to force people to aid her who do not wish to do so. \n \n This is a straw man argument, and a pretty sad one at that. this thread is ot abotu whether a woman should be allowed to have an abortion or not.

Doctors have refused to train\n colleagues, fearing they will only help a potential competitor in a\n lucrative, often cash-only, business.\n\n \n 86% of coutnies have no abortion provider. What this article is saying is that the abortion rate has decreased to the point that even the relatively few doctors and clinics that DO provide them are having trouble staying in business.\n \n \nWhatever the reason, the falling number of abortions has come at a\n time when the number of clinics in major cities has not changed.\n Since 1992, the number of clinics doing 400 or more abortions a year\n has remained steady at 690. It is in these clinics - 99 percent of\n which are in metropolitan areas - that 89 percent of abortions take\n place.\n\n \n This is classic capaitalist economic theory. Demand has decreased while supply has remained static, so prices have fallen as competition increases.",

   "Your comparison here is not valid. Utilities are regulated due to the size and scope of their business. In most cases they are regulated monopolies.

Your argument here holds no water.\n\n \n They are monopolies because we're regulating the industry. The reason they were regulated was, partly, so that our essential services were not subject to market forces, not merely because of the size and scope.

Competition does not always serve the public well, so the State regulates some services.\n\n \n You need to seriously go back and study the basic principals of cause and effect. Utilities are not monompolies becuase they are regulated. They are regulated becuse they are monopolies. Years ago there were a bunch of little utility companies all ver the country. The demand of operating power generation over an interconnected grid was not finacially viable for these companies, so they started goign out of business and buying each other up.

Serving meat is part of your job.\n\n \n So pharmacists should be forced to give up their jobs becuase of an incredibly slim minority of their customers? Get real. In the real world, less than .0001% of drugs dispensed are emergency contraceptives. It is a NOTHING deal for pharmacists to simply not fill those .0001% of prescritions. Your siggestion that pharmacists should not be pharmacists because of .0001% of their potential business is ludicrous.

If none would accept it for liability reasons, then that is a separate issue with a separate solution.\n\n \n Wal Mart has very good finacial reasons for refusing to sell the pill. Wal mart is a store. They depend on consumer sales to stay in business. Many consumer boycott pharmacies that provide the morning after pill (in reality I think this is probably the real reason Wal Mart does not sell the pill....Wal Mart is not known for their moral standards). \n \n Motivation does not matter. Whether it is a moral question, a finacial question, or a supply question is irrelevant to the discussion. Int he case cited, it is almost certainly a finacial question, jut liek the example I gave above. When you are dealing with an individual pharmacist, it is a moral question.

I just advocate the mandatory birth control becuase it gives an \"out\" should somethign strange happen. No birth control is 100% effective. Women get pregnant on the shot, implants, just about everything. If that were to happen to a woman on medicaid, and she WAS using birth control, it would not be right to deny her claim, IMO, becuase she made a reasonable effort. If birth control was required (i.e a shot or norplant), then we would KNOW that reasonable efforts had been made and it was not merely the result of irresponsibility or an intentional act. \n \n I don't care how temporary their medicaid is.

I think that if we can be assured that reasonable steps had been taken to prevent the pregnancy.\n I think making exceptions for rape would be ok but reasonable to me would mean not having sex.\n \n \nAs far as welfare reform, I think that the solution to that is to INCREASE benifits, but put a time limit on them. If we raised the benifits, it would help people who are struggling get by until they can stand on their own. I am all for this. It is the career welfare recipients that are killing the system.\n \n Of course, then we have the problem of what to do with welfare recipients whose benifits run out. If we just abandon them, that is going to make for some pretty unpleasant cities with streets full of homless folks. Not really something I care about. I live in the country behind a 12 ft brick wall and keep attack dogs. To folks in the city, though, it could become inconvenient.\nA hard problem but at some point you gotta let the bird learn to fly.",
