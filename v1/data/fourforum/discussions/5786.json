If someone changes the meaning of it that wasn't elected then where is the restraint on them? An amendment is adopted and has a meaning and a purpose...there are no hidden meanings or \"halos\" around certain amendments or certain rights in the constitution that are better then others thus requiring more to take away. As for the rights for the unborn...you are right, they are not in the constitution. Thus should be left to the states and thus making Roe vs Wade a wrongful case. \n \n Then the best part...where does the constitution say it should be used...Have you read the thing? obviously not, because it is very clear about powers and where they are delegated too. Try reading the federalists papers too...maybe you will learn something about this country.

All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \n You clearly don't know your history.\n \n \n \nOh really? Let's try that. The consitution clearly does not include unborn as who has rights. If a state was to give such rights, other states would be mandated to follow such laws due to the full faith and credit ammendemnt. As such, such law would create new rights that were never given by the consitution and unsurp what the consitution says.\n\n 1) The Constitution did not say a fetus isn't a person, the Supreme Court did. Thus, it was the Supreme Court that denied rights to the unborn, not the Constitution.\n \n 2) Before Roe v Wade, there were both states that regulated abortion and states that didn't. Among the states that regulated abortions, there were different regulations. Thus we see that if one state made a law banning abortion that other states would not be forced to follow those laws.\n \n \nThen clearly you have not read it. (not to mention accounting as well, MR. FASB is not part of accounting at all) The consitution gives powers and to whom, but it does not detail how they are specifically to be used. I asked you to show me but as always, you have failed.\n \n You clearly don't understand the word power. Is it really unclear that the Judicial branch is not given legislative power?

The SCOTUS usurped the right of the States to protect fetuses in the 1st and 2nd trimester in Roe v Wade.\n 3. Even post Roe v Wade, there are laws in many states protecting fetuses. \n A man was recently convicted on 2 counts of murder when he took a baseball bat to his pregnant girlfriend's stomach and killed two fetuses, for example.\n http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=825252\n \n\n Then clearly you have not read it.

Different states have their own marriage laws and will until the Supreme Court decides to legislate again.\n \n \n Is it really unclear to you that the Judicial branch must enforce the consitution? emoticon_rolleyes\n\n So the Supreme Court has Executive power in additon to their Judicial and Legislative powers?
