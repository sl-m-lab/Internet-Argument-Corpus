The problem is that this is a pipe dream; you won't stop people from having sex using threats and scare tactics.

For the same reason I consider people who want to get rid of roads because \"they are a scar on the Earth\" to be XXXXXX because they have no viable alternatives.\n\n \n The viable replacement to abortion exists now, and always has existed. It's called adoption. Today there's a 3 to 5 year waiting period for a standard adoption. And even a 2 year waiting period if one goes through a private agency and has to buy their baby. This article explains it better than I can and discusses how it works in other Countries where Americans go to adopt children because they just aren't available here. So pro-lifers have an optional solution, it's just that pro-abortionists reject it in favor of the convenience of infanticide. Here's an excerpt.\n When Faith Allen wanted to adopt a baby, she turned to the yellow pages. Allen, 37, a professional writer from North Carolina in the US, had suffered many painful years of infertility and in 1999 decided to adopt.\n \n A friend recommended a nearby adoption agency but the three- to five-year waiting period seemed much too long to wait. That's when Allen decided to turn to the phone book.\n \n \"I wound up stumbling upon a wonderful agency,\" said Allen who admits that she \"got lucky\" with her find.\n \n Nearly two years and $12,000 (E8,000) later, Allen's dearest wish was finally realised when she became a mother to a little baby boy named Nicholas.\n \n When news of his birth broke, Allen and her husband packed their car and drove six hours from North Carolina to Georgia. For two days they waited anxiously in a friend's house until the baby's mother signed the papers. Three days after his birth, they had Nicholas in their arms.\n http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/parenting/so-you-want-to-adopt-a-baby-1255662.html",

As to banning vs. solving the problem, many pro-lifers hold that banning the procedure of abortion will significantly reduce the number of abortions, and many view this as solving the problem.\n \n \nPerhaps they should study Romania after the creed banning abortion?\n\n No need to.

My points were on the problem of removing an solution without providing an additional solution. Nothing you wrote even hints at that.\n\n Abortion is a solution to what?

More hypocrisy and double standards from our standard source of such idiocy.\n\n \n And since he fully believes exactly as I have recommended and would have fought tooth and nail had I insisted that parents be forced to carry all special needs babies to term no matter what their disability, then that makes him a total hypocrite for attacking me for agreeing with an issue he himself endorses. That's the definition of a hypocrite lyteboy, and disingenuous too. And then he goes on to defend his attack on me:\n \n \nYou see this as good reason to attack me as a hypocrite? Care to explain that logic?\n I attack you as a hypocrite when you say \"all life is sacred and we should give it its due respect\" and then turn around and introduce subjective qualifiers for which life is really sacred because some isn't. Either all life is sacred or not all life is sacred; if it's the latter, then the former can't be your argument against abortion without putting yourself in a self-contradictory position.\n The fact that I've pointed this out doesn't make me a hypocrite anywhere but your fantasy, hatemongering world.\n\n \n What is subjective about admitting that birth defects exist for whatever reasons and that because of prenatal testing today, dr's can identify specifically what they will be, giving parents an opportunity to decide if they can afford the care or if they can emotionally handle the responsibility of raising special needs children? How am I being a hypocrite for facing that reality and being willing to compromise knowing that some of those special needs children will never experience a normal life?\n \n Did I call for the extermination of all special needs children? Of course not. That would have been hypocritical for sure. But I have only compromised in a specific area of this debate in order to save the majority of perfectly healthy babies that are currently being aborted nilly willy. So yes, all life is sacred; but not all lives are worth living if they offer an unreasonable burden on parents that they can't handle. And I believe that option is only fair to those who are facing it. And what makes you a complete and totally pathetic hypocrite for attacking me when I was objective enough to make such a compromise is that \"YOU AGREE WITH ME 100%\". You would never agree to force women carrying special needs babies to be forced to carry them to term against their wills, but here you are attacking me for being reasonable.  \n \n But if I insisted that no matter how deformed or damaged a fetus was, it must be carried to term, and if it lived then the mother must raise it, you would cry and scream at how closed minded and oppressive I am in my unbending views. SO LET'S JUST FACE IT LYTEBOY, NOTHING I EVER SAY, NO MATTER HOW REASONABLE OR HOW MUCH YOU AGREE WITH IT IN PRINCIPLE WILL EVER BE MET BY YOU OBJECTIVELY OR FAIRLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE AN HONEST, FAIR, OR OBJECTIVE BONE IN YOUR BODY.\n \n So just admit it electrolyte, your goal here isn't to debate issues and come to reasonable conclusions with people you disagree with, but it's to read my every post with a critical, judgmental and adversarial eye as you use even my most reasonable and compromising opinion as a childish and immature excuse to attack me.",

   "Wouldn't any rational pro-choicer consider that a generous and reasonable compromise position from a pro-lifer?\n\n No, a rational person would realize that your position is still irrational, perhaps now even more. The fact that you consider it a \"compromise\" means nothing. This is like my telling you that 2+2=4, but you insist that the real sum is really five... unless you use a calculator, in which case the answer is really four. I'm supposed to be happy that you've \"compromised\" that 2+2=4 even though you still hold an illogical position, and I'm not supposed to point out that your willing \"compromise\" is contradictory?\n \n \nAnd since he fully believes exactly as I have recommended and would have fought tooth and nail had I insisted that parents be forced to carry all special needs babies to term no matter what their disability, then that makes him a total hypocrite for attacking me for agreeing with an issue he himself endorses.\n\n No, I'm only a hypocrite if I practice something other than I preach. Again, if you want to argue that 2+2=5 but you'll admit that 1+1+2=4, I get to point out that your argument is flawed and self-contradictory. When you go around demanding that 2+2=5 always (\"all life is sacred\") and then admit that 1+1+2=4 (not all life is sacred enough), I get to rip you a new one for being a hypocrite. Whether you are a hypocrite has nothing to do with whether you agree with me (or anybody else) either in general or in compromise.\n \n \nThat's the definition of a hypocrite lyteboy\n\n No, Archie:Main Entry: hyp\u00b7o\u00b7crite\n Function: noun \n 1 : a person who puts on a false appearance of virtue or religion\n 2 : a person who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelingsThat's the definition of a hypocrite. Let me add some emphasis:\n 2 : a person who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings\n That's what you're doing, Archie. You say that all life is sacred and shouldn't be terminated before birth, then you say that it's okay to terminate some before birth.\n \n \nWhat is subjective about admitting that birth defects exist for whatever reasons and that because of prenatal testing today, dr's can identify specifically what they will be, giving parents an opportunity to decide if they can afford the care or if they can emotionally handle the responsibility of raising special needs children?\n\n There is nothing subjective about realizing that birth defects exist. I never argued such. See below regarding subjectivity.\n \n \n[bolded portion requoted] ... giving parents an opportunity to decide if they can afford the care or if they can emotionally handle the responsibility of raising special needs children? How am I being a hypocrite for facing that reality and being willing to compromise knowing that some of those special needs children will never experience a normal life?\n\n Pay very close attention, Archangel. Are you reading carefully? Lean forward so you can see clearly:\n If the parents are supposed to be given the opportunity to decide whether they can deal with a child, then that's the decision of THE PARENTS (and possibly their doctor) but NOT YOU. You are being a hypocrite because you are trying to impose your will upon these people who clearly have a better understanding of what they can handle mentally, emotionally, physically, and financially. This is a subjective matter, which means -- unless it's your matter -- it's not your decision.\n Why, Archangel, do these \"special needs\" fetuses get different consideration than other fetuses? Do not real people with non-\"special\" babies also have issues to consider? I know plenty of people who have gotten pregnant and really didn't have the resources to accomodate a new member of the family; this resulted in hardships of all sorts. Why should these hardships be considered for some pregnancies but not for others?\n \n \nDid I call for the extermination of all special needs children? Of course not.\n\n Just to stave off misinterpretations, I neither thought nor claimed that you did. (That said, I understand that you aren't accusing me of accusing you of this.)\n \n \nBut I have only compromised in a specific area of this debate in order to save the majority of perfectly healthy babies that are currently being aborted nilly willy. So yes, all life is sacred; but not all lives are worth living if they offer an unreasonable burden on parents that they can't handle. And I believe that option is only fair to those who are facing it.\n\n YOU are not the one to make this decision for anyone but yourself. YOU cannot know what any particular parent(s) feel(s) is an unreasonable burden.\n \n \nAnd what makes you a complete and totally pathetic hypocrite for attacking me when I was objective enough to make such a compromise is that \"YOU AGREE WITH ME 100%\". You would never agree to force women carrying special needs babies to be forced to carry them to term against their wills, but here you are attacking me for being reasonable. \n\n I'm not attacking you for being reasonable. (Hell, this is quite possibly the first time I've seen any evidence that you don't live in an entirely fantastic world.) I'm attacking you for being hypocritical: you say that all life is sacred, then you abandon for subjective reasons the implication that you insist follows from that assertion. Not only this, but you have no way to determine which subjective reasons are sufficient, and even though you say that parents should be able to decide, you are trying to set up the guidelines yourself.\n 2 : a person who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings\n \n \nBut if I insisted that no matter how deformed or damaged a fetus was, it must be carried to term, and if it lived then the mother must raise it, you would cry and scream at how closed minded and oppressive I am in my unbending views.\n\n Damn right.\n (The irony here is that Phyllis will call you a hypocrite -- the first definition -- for holding this position.)\n \n \nSO LET'S JUST FACE IT LYTEBOY, NOTHING I EVER SAY, NO MATTER HOW REASONABLE OR HOW MUCH YOU AGREE WITH IT IN PRINCIPLE WILL EVER BE MET BY YOU OBJECTIVELY OR FAIRLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE AN HONEST, FAIR, OR OBJECTIVE BONE IN YOUR BODY. [bold original]\n\n Well, Mr. Bolded \"I'm So Persecuted\" McScreamy, I think I've explained pretty well why I don't have to fall down on my knees and bow to you for \"compromising\" here. Although it's good that you've actually recognized that it's not a dreamworld, you nevertheless still ignore the fact that you have double standards (why some pregnancies and not others?) and are still being hypocritical in wanting parents to make these choices while you demand to make the choice for them.\n \n \nSo just admit it electrolyte, your goal here isn't to debate issues and come to reasonable conclusions with people you disagree with, but it's to read my every post with a critical, judgmental and adversarial eye as you use even my most reasonable and compromising opinion as a childish and immature excuse to attack me.\n\n \"Admit\" something that isn't true? Look, McScreamy, I enjoy ripping you a new one whenever you deserve it, but that's not unique to you. (You can look around, too; I got into with Ingus even though we're arguing the same \"side\" of this debate.) The bottom line is that here you're promoting one argument, subjectively instituting your own exception to argue for subjectivity only to make declarations and belittle the effect that the appropriate subjectivity might have, all while insisting that the original argument is universal. It's not my fault that your \"universal\" position is so flawed that you have to institute exceptions, and it's not my fault that your insistence that your way is the right way somehow should take precedent over the the opinions of the parents, whom you said should have the say anyway.",

Meaning that those who do need it, for whatever reason, just have to make do with unlicenced quacks with no guarantee of quality?\n \n Surely this would very detrimental to society and women's health.\n \n Smiley\n\n \nPro lifers would never fight to prevent a woman the right to an abortion if carrying the child to term really threatened her life. And neither would we fight to prevent the abortion of a child who was so deformed or otherwise damaged that it had no hope for a quality, or any kind of a normal existence at all. I believe when Roe V Wade was passed, those were the circumstances upon which it was argued by the pro abortion side that it was needed so badly, in addition to rape and incest of course.\n \n Yet, here we are 30 years later and approximately only 1.5 to 2% of all abortions carried out in America each year are performed for the original reasons stated above. So let's get back to respecting life that is viable and truly protecting women's health when it is necessary; and once again encouraging adult women to take responsibility for their own sexual irresponsibility rather than encouraging a culture of death by allowing them to kill the result of their own actions and making their unborn children pay the price for their mistakes and promiscuity.\n",
