   "The mighty BEARS (10-4) travel to the frozen tundra of Green Bay to play the laughable Packers this week.\n \n After the red-headed step child 48-3 beating the Pack took from Baltimore on monday night, they should be thoroughly demoralized - playing to lose for a shot at Reggie Bush.\n \n The Bears have number one QB Rex Grossman back and he looked fairly sharp, coming into the game in the second half against Atlanta. He energized the offense. \n \n BEARS 35 Packers 3",

   "Well the Packers played hard and well.\n \n I was sweating bullets in the fourth quarter. But, DA BEARS prevailed and won the division and a first round bye.\n \n The offense is beginning to click again with Grossman back in as QB, the top defense in the NFL, and the Bears are a dangerous team rolling into the playoffs after next week. emoticon_xkill",
