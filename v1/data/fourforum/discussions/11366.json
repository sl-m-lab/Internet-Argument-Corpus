Once again it's a case of wait and see.\n \n \nYou get careless with it and you can have it confiscated and lose your license.\n\n \n If you get careless with a gun then you can be arrested.\n \n \nI don't see how that will violate human rights.\n \n \n So having to pay your government money in exchange for permission to actually keep your gun, basically needing permission to own your own property that you bought and paid for with your own money, isn't a violation of human rights?\n \n \nOk, I figure you shouldn't need a license to buy a gun or use it within the bounds of your own home, but you would if you are carrying around on you.\n\n \n That's already the way it is with concealed carry.\n \n \nYou should be able to buy guns on ebay, but have the title and registration documents properly transferred. Every gun should have a fairly visible serial number, like a license plate, and records can be queried by the police, just like with cars. \n\n \n We've already got something like that in place with C&R firearms, except you can't buy them over ebay.\n \n \nI see where the pro-control side makes a valid argument. Where human endangerment is concerned, and we're talking about keeping people from things that could harm them, this should be able to overrule the second amendment.\n\n \n So the founding laws of the nation should have a clause that allows them to be superseded by something like a local ordinance, or maybe a law that was based on lies and will actually do no good.\n \n \nBlogs. And religions generally can't endanger other people's lives or put people in harm's way, and if they do, the police can and will shut them down, regardless of what the second amendment says.\n \n \n People like the Neonazis use the First Amendment to form assemblies and marches, preaching their messages of a world free of anyone that isn't white. The police are often dispatched to keep riots from breaking out because the black and jewish people would probably like to hang these bastards from trees for what they have to say about them.\n \n The Los Angelas Race Riots of the 1990s were sparked by crimes against black community members and a hate-filled message that resulted in days of bloody violence. Homes and stores were burnt down, people were dragged from buildings into the streets to be beaten or killed, damage was in the millions. The only ones in the area who avoided having their property burnt to the ground were those that had guns to shoot the guys carrying molotov cocktails.\n \n Now considering that the police have to be called out anytime there's an assembly or protest, but they never need to be called out to a gun range when it's full, wouldn't that suggest that the First Amendment holds more potential for danger than the Second Amendment?",

   "[QUOTE]\nWould you propose we do the same with car ownership? Or is it only that the right to drive cars isn't protected by the constitution? After all, how could they? Cars weren't even invented yet.\n\n \n And yet even if you have a long criminal record, you can still buy a car and get a driver's license with very little in the way of hassle. If the same person with the same record tried to buy a gun they'd be denied at the background check and possibly arrested for trying to buy a gun.\n \n \nIn my mind the laws would serve primarily to account for which gun belongs to who. From the manufacture of every gun there would be a registered serial number. The record of the transfer of the gun would be kept by the government, as well as the status of the license of its current owner.\n \n \n What you're basically supporting is a nationwide firearms registration database that would be in the hands of the government. That's a very bad idea for so many reasons.\n \n For starters, such a database would violate the 4th Amendment by infringing on a person's right to privacy and to be secure in their property. There's also the fact that the larger a database gets the more difficult it becomes to use because there are many millions of pieces of information to go through and compare. Currently Canada has been trying for years to put an end to their long gun registry because it's overly complex, has cost them billions of dollars, and hasn't been useful in solving a single firearms crime and thus has no justification for remaining in effect.\n \n Then there's the issue of privacy, again. If this registry was made subject to the Freedom of Information Act then anybody who filled out a request would be given access to a list of hundreds of millions of people who own guns. A criminal could use this as a shopping list of where to get a gun, or to know who isn't armed so they can more easily victimize people. Or the person filling out the request could do what several newspapers do and release the database and reveal where every single gun owner lives, thus violating privacy rights and forcing people with violent exhusbands to move for their own safety yet again.\n \n There's also the fact that the database could be used by the government for future disarmament purposes just as firearms registries were used in other areas of the world, like Germany when the nazis were in power. The holocaust wasn't carried out against armed jews, it was done against jews that were disarmed so they could be more easily slaughtered like diseased cattle.\n \n And another thing. What would keep the people in charge of the licensing and registration from charging outrageous rates? How do you keep the from slapping a $1,000 per gun fee on getting your gun registered or licensed?\n \n \nIf a gun is found to be in the possession of womeone who it isn't registered for, it can be traced back to its last known owner. The last owner would be liable for his gun being misplaced, and the necessary penalties would be effected. This would motivate gun owners to take precautions to keep their guns secure and to keep their liability insurance current.\n \n \n What you're suggesting is basically the same as the \"lost or stolen firearms act\" that several states have tried to initiate. What this does is makes the owner of a firearm guilty of a crime if they fail to report the loss or theft of their gun within 72 hours of having discovered or \"should have known\" or the theft. This makes the original owner more liable for criminal penalties than the actual criminal.\n \n If you've been away on the business trip for a week and your gun was stolen during that time, and the police recover it before you arrive home and discover the theft, at whatever time that is, you're the one who gets in trouble because you \"should have known\" of the theft. I've read these laws, there aren't any exceptions for being away for extended periods of time, you're expected to know of the theft of your property even when you aren't there.\n \n These laws serve as nothing more than simple harassment of gun owners by trying to implement useless rules and restrictions and criminalize what's beyond a person's ability to control, especially with the \"should have known\" clause. Anybody that's responsible will report the loss of their gun immediately after discovering it. Anybody that's not responsible will fail to report the loss and can then be charged appropriately. We don't need another law to do what the current laws do.\n \n \nWhoever currently can qualify to own a gun, or carry it concealed, will still be able to do so. It doesn't restrict anybody from owning a gun, but I think it would encourage more gun ownership responsibility.\n \n \n Gun owners are far more responsible than people are willing to give us credit for. We know far more about the risks and requirements than most people do. We don't need laws to tell us what we already know, it's redundant and stupid and catering to the lowest common denominator. It's like having a law that makes it a criminal act to not wash your hands after using the bathroom.\n \n \nI never implied anything remotely resembling that and you know it.\n\n \n You said unlicensed individuals and minors. How would an 11 year old be able to get a gun license when the age of purchase is 18?\n \n \nHaving your gun secure means being fully responsible for its whereabouts and status. If you own a gun, you should be the only one able to get to it.\n\n \n I don't like this idea, it's just plain wrong. There are going to be times when you're not home, but somebody in your family is and they're going to find themselves in a situation where they need a gun immediately, so having it be inaccessible to them will only hurt them.\n \n If you're married and have a wife, but you're the only one that owns a gun because she's still not sure about it, and somebody's trying to get in the house when she's at home by herself, are you going to want her to not be able to access your gun when she might need it?\n \n \nSo like I said, its either free guns for everybody or no guns for anybody?\n\n \n No.\n \n \nThe taxes aren't necessary, but the renewal of the licenses and filing of title changes should be. Insurance can be optional or not, but I'd highly recommend it.\n\n \n Licensing programs like this aren't needed. They're also hurtful if a gun owner dies for any reason just after reregistering their firearm and nobody is made aware of this. If something like that happens and the gun is stolen then you're going to be looking for the wrong individual.\n \n \nBesides, I said that the license should be necessary for carry guns with you, not possessing and using them in your home.\n\n \n That's how it already is with concealed carry.\n \n \nIf you want a gun solely for the protection of your personal property, a license isn't even necessary. But registration still should be.\n \n \n Again, registration is nothing but a bad idea.\n \n \nSo how would you interpret the words \"well regulated\" getting in there? A mistake? A forgery? It doesn't mean what it says?\n\n \n Well instead of \"well regulated\" meaning \"tightly restricted by laws and legislation\" perhaps it could be \"well organized\" or \"uniformly armed for maximum effectiveness\" or maybe even \"well trained and drilled in the art of war\"?\n \n The Founding Fathers had just gotten away from tyranny, there's no grounds for believing that they'd give the new government a method of overriding the constitution that they drafted to restrict it.\n \n \nThere are lots of materials that are heavily restricted because of the nature of their use, such as uranium and prescription drugs. Your freedom to obtain these items are not necessarily infringed, but you do need to justify to the authorities would you need to have them.\n\n \n So...you should need to justify your desire before you can exercise a human right? Should you also be required to do the same thing if you want to change your religion?\n \n \nIts not whether your character is questionable that determines the restriction. And yes, despite these restrictions malicious people still get their hands on them, but the regulation serves to keep the items' distribution and whereabouts in check for the most part.\n\n \n And there's also a lot of things that aren't restricted that're pretty damn dangerous when used in the right/wrong manner.",

   "Ok omegamon, since you're apparently not happy with any proposals for any form of gun registration or gun control, how would you describe the ideal gun distribution scenario that complies with the second amendment and works out best overall?\n\n \n Well if I were in charge, there would be very little in the way of gun control, because no matter how many times you try and draw comparisons gun control simply is NOT crime control. Instead of trying to ban guns and heavily restrict them, we need to be focusing on criminals and treating them like the scum of the earth that they are. Instead of passing gun laws that are only applied to people who haven't done anything wrong, we need to pass laws that carry severe penalties for criminal acts.\n \n This is what we need to do. We need to pass laws in every state that mandates federal punishment for firearm-related crimes so that they MUST be observed on local levels. We need to make these punishments mandatory and we need to have something in place that will require the judge to issue the minimum sentence instead of saying that it's too strict.\n \n From now on if you're a criminal with a prior record and you're caught in possession of a firearm, you get five years in prison even if you didn't do anything wrong. If you're a gun trafficker you get 10 years for every gun trafficked. And if you're a judge that'll give a suspended sentence for a crime like you, your salary takes a huge cut for the rest of the year just to teach you a lesson.\n \n \nAnd what about the current laws concerning guns, such as the conceal and carry licenses (which is likely also in a centralized database) and other laws concerning gun ownership. Are they adequate? Are they too restrictive?\n\n \n Current laws are too strict. If I had the power I'd pass heavy reform. The importation of \"non sporting\" firearms would be opened up again, the manufacture, importation and sale of machineguns to civilians would be reinstated and the registration and licensing of firearms would be drastically limited in terms of just what firearms could be made subject to registration. Acquiring Class 3 weapons would also be made easier.\n \n About the only things that would be restricted would be weapons of truly dangerous nature, like grenades and WMDs. If you have the proper crime control then you have little to no need for gun control.\n \n \nI don't see how people keep linking gun registration to gun confiscation on demand.\n \n \n Because it's happened in the past! It happened in Germany, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Africa, New York and California. Gun registration has lead to gun confiscation in other countries and that's what we keep making a big deal out of it.\n \n \nI think its paranoia to use that as the sole reason to not register.\n \n\n \n We have history to show us that it's happened before, and it'll happen again if you don't learn from history to spot a trap.\n \n \nI recognize the risk, but in my opinion it can't be that easy for anybody with this info, if they could access it in the first place, to try to victimize gun-weilding citizens.\n\n \n You obviously haven't experienced enough then.\n \n \nThe advantages of gun registration would be to track down guns that are lost or stolen. If a registered gun owner uses his gun to commit a crime, (besides running the risk of threatening armed citizens) he would be easily tracked down and apprehended. If, on the other hand, guns are being supplied illegally on the streets, the source of those guns and the links to the suppliers can be easily identified and stopped at that level. It wouldn't be as easy to steal a consignment of guns and have them freely distributed without a trace.\n\n \n We already have something like that in place. Anytime you buy a gun from a licensed dealer then serial number is registered with your name by the ATF. They have a complete list of everybody that's ever bought a gun from a licensed dealer in this country, they know who everyone is, where they live and what they have at the time of their last purchase. Anytime a gun is lost or stolen and the police find it they can easily call up the ATF to get the serial number traced. Therefore we don't need guns to be registered anymore than they are.",

And I suppose you're fine with the system that is already in place, except for restrictions on certain types of assault weapons that you'd like to see more available.\n\n \n I tolerate the backdoor registration scheme that the ATF has in place. I'm not fine with it, but until we can get the ATF to start following the rules and doing as told and finally bring them under control we have to work with it. And since they have a registration program in effect, I see absolutely no reason for any state to try and institute a licensing scheme since it's redundant and requires taxes and fees.\n \n There's much I'd like to change, much that I'd like to improve upon. But until I get into this position of authority I'm going to just have to go along with what's in place. That doesn't mean I have to like it, or stand by while more of the same is trying to be passed.\n \n \nSo what are the current laws on acquiring regular hand guns? What restrictions are there that. Everybody is getting worked up about? Can I get a gun? Please?\n\n \n Federally? Just go to your local gun store, select the model you want, fill out form 4473, have your driver's license with you, and wait while your information is called in. If you have no criminal or mental illness record in the system the check will come back clear and the sale can take place. Takes about 30 minutes total, but then again there's no point in dragging something out for a week or more; if you're not in the system then you're not in the system and that's that.\n \n Locally this is the same in most of the states, although a few of the more draconian areas that have decided to recede from the union of the United States and become their own foreign nations have more involved processes, such as going to the police and requesting permission to exercise your right. Sometimes this involves filling out forms, paying an application fee, having letters of reference to testify that you're of good character, submitting to fingerprints and mental health evaluations, justifying your \"need\" to exercise your right, and waiting for everything to go through before you either get your permission slip, or get denied for whatever reason and have to start all over again. Bear in mind that with some states the wait could be anywhere between a couple of weeks and a few years depending on how they feel about regular people buying guns.\n \n With some states the process if even more involved, because after you get your permission slip from the police (if you get it at all) then you still have to go through the federal requirements and after all is said and done then you've gotta take your gun back to the police so you can have it registered in your name, let the police get a ballistic fingerprint of the gun bore and enter that into another database, pay the registration fee, be registered as a gun owner, and then start paying license fees for the annual renewal or your permit to own a firearm.",

   "I don't see how people keep linking gun registration to gun confiscation on demand.\n\n \n Mostly because of the deceptive and untrustworthy nature of the Anti-Gun party. Even if they signed a contract that said they couldn't try to take away the people's guns, they still would. If it is known who has a gun, and the anti-gun party gets their way, it will be extremely easy for guns to be taken away. If they're not registered, the Anti-Gun party will have a hard time executing their plans. This may lead them to a compromise.\n \n \n \nConsidering all the personal property we own that we register, like our homes, cars, computers, cell phones, video game consoles, cable tv, and many major appliances, even though the possibility exists that someone could maliciously use this info against us, I think its paranoia to use that as the sole reason to not register.\n\n \n It is mostly because you don't have misguided organizations trying to ban \"our homes, cars, computers, cell phones, video game consoles, cable tv, and many major appliances.\"\n \n \n \nNo, I'm not na\u00efve and don't trust the government one bit. I recognize the risk, but in my opinion it can't be that easy for anybody with this info, if they could access it in the first place, to try to victimize gun-weilding citizens.\n\n \n I am compelled to ask, what if the anti-gunners get their way?\n \n \n \nThe advantages of gun registration would be to track down guns that are lost or stolen. If a registered gun owner uses his gun to commit a crime, (besides running the risk of threatening armed citizens) he would be easily tracked down and apprehended. If, on the other hand, guns are being supplied illegally on the streets, the source of those guns and the links to the suppliers can be easily identified and stopped at that level. It wouldn't be as easy to steal a consignment of guns and have them freely distributed without a trace.\n\n \n That is why I'm not entirely adamant about my stance on registration. If the anti-gunners could be trusted, and I could be guaranteed that guns would not be banned, then I'd be all for registration.\n \n It looks very suspicious when the people trying to ban guns all together are pushing for registration. It makes you wonder what they will do once gun registration laws are enacted.",

   "Maybe I'm a bit slow, or maybe I just didn't catch it, but something just came to my mind that's worth pointing out.\n \n \nLaws are not designed to stop people from breaking them, they serve to spell out the associated consequences of breaking them. People are going to do whatever they want to do because they have free will. But with a law in place, they know what the consequences are. Being aware that law-breakers persist doesn't justify that there be no law. Law-abiding citizens will. Always outnumber law breakers.\n\n \n If laws aren't designed to stop crime, then how come the anti-gunners always argue \"This law will save lives\" or \"We need this law in order to save lives\" when they're trying to get a law passed, and anytime a law is going to expire or be repealed they start yelling \"Without this law many more people will be killed\"? If the laws are there only to make something a crime that can be punished, how exactly is that going to save lives or keep people from getting killed? Doesn't that basically mean the anti-gunners are blatantly and shamelessly lying to everyone anytime they talk about gun control laws?",
