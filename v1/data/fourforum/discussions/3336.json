   "PAX TV has a new program called Faith Under Fire which discusses topical and age-old religious issues. The host, Lee Strobel, is a well-know journalist and author who claims to be a former atheist but is now a Christian. It airs on Saturday nights, 9 P.M. CST. \n \n I watched it for the first time last Saturday, one segment was between heavyweights William Lane Craig and Richard Carrier. It is in debate format, very fast-paced with four completely different subjects each hour-long show. Strobel is earning a early reputation of being a very fair moderator. \n \n I think it's worth watching and I recommend it.",
