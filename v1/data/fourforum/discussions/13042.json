No? \n \n Perhaps before demanding that we give up Constitutional Rights to suit anti-gun hopes, one can show us that your schemes would actually work! Would that not be a prudent step? After all, all that you and Obama want in gun control schemes, have been tried in two countries most like ours with these below effects! \n \n Both studies were conducted 10 years after enacting all that you want and even more than you want to boot. \n \n England.\n   Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n \n &#8220;Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,&#8221; a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n\n \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n \n A report produced by Australian Institute of Criminology here called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. &#8230;. reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals.

If such a system were ever enacted, either in this state or on a national level, I'd get all my friends together and we'd start a little gun trading ring, continually buying and selling one or several guns between each other, each transaction being all documented out. If we do this we could easily ring up about a thousand private transactions just between several people. If the records were ever searched the police would be chasing their tails, and there's not thing one they can do about it because such a scam would never qualify as illegal.\n \n You'd have a better chance of pushing for a law that made it illegal to sell your privately owned guns to anyone except back to the FFL dealer you bought it from.\n\n \n Yeah, a for instance.

Of course there is the very real danger of the \"its not enough syndrome.\" Some tragedy occurs and its not enough so we need more strict, more stringent, more punitive laws.

Failing to acknowledge that the major problem is not the availability of guns on the street, it's the failure to remove criminals from the street.

Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n",

If you want to own a gun in California and you live in public housing or an apartment complex, you're SOL because these entities won't let you bolt anything to the walls and ruin the finish for the next tenant or damage their property. And portable safes can easily be carted away with the rest of the goods.\n \n You also fail to take into account the instances of the perp actually following you home and attacking as you're going inside.\n \n \nAnd remember I'm for mandatory theft/loss reporting and documentation of every change of ownership. At least in the hands of the original dealer, where the manufacturer could point police.\n\n \n And you've still failed to prove conclusively that the loss of freedoms and liberties that your proposals would guarantee, would be offset by the amount of security and crime fighting potential that could be generated.\n \n Add to that you've all but outright refused to concede that increasing the amount of paperwork would be nothing more than a waste of police power, or supply information that gun owners are overwhelmingly and intentionally supplying weapons to known criminals.\n \n \nThis might be one solution under current law. Your kids will have their own opinions I imagine.\n\n \n They don't get to have a say in the matter, they're minors. What their opinion is doesn't count.",

   "Doc-\n Sarge-\n \n I don't really see why we're arguing with Sinjin in the first place, do you?\n \n Is he anti-gun? He claims that he's not, but his support of proposals that have the potential to make criminals out of innocent crime victims would suggest otherwise.\n \n Sinjin claims that mandatory reporting laws are necessary to make people accountable when they store their guns in a way that makes them easily accessible to criminals, even though for the criminals to actually get them it would require them committing the illegal act of breaking and entering someone's private property.\n \n Despite this claim, and his repeated cited of the \"200,000 stolen guns per year\" figure, Sinjin has been wholly unable, and entirely unwilling, to prove that gun owners will routinely and intentionally not report the loss of their privately owned guns to the police. He fails to address the fact that a police report is necessary for the insurance statement to get reimbursement on your loss; and money is a very good motivator to do the right thing.\n \n Sinjin has claimed that we need to make any and all private transactions of firearms, between two or more private individuals, a matter of official government record by mandating that they have to be done through FFL dealers, in order to track the gun over the course of its life and so we'll know who to go after if the gun is ever used in a crime.\n \n In making this claim, Sinjin chooses to outright ignore the fact that any such program would be unmanageable, and rarely, if ever, used by the police to try and track the gun recovered at the crime scene. Such a program would literally create tons of new paperwork, all in the form of hard copy forms that would be stored in cardboard boxes, and have to be searched through, by hand, in a manner that would waste valuable police resources and time. Just to deal with the new influx of records, the police would have to either pull patrol officers and stick them behind desks, or hire new officers and further strain their constant lack of funds.\n \n How much new crime fighting equipment could be bought with the money that would be needed to hire new officers to go through boxes and boxes of paperwork trying to find a single serial number?\n \n Sinjin claims that mandatory storage laws would cut down on the number of guns that are stolen from people when they're out and away from their homes.\n \n In making this claim, Sinjin is voicing his approval for a clearly, if not blatantly, unconstitutional law that the Supreme Court itself shot down just last year in the Heller ruling. Mandatory storage laws leave absolutely no room for keeping a defensive firearm stored in a manner where it can be immediately accessible in a moment's notice, meaning it violates a person's free exercise of their constitutional right to defend themselves against harm from another party.\n \n Complicating Sinjin's argument, his home state of California has a mandatory storage law, and thanks to him we see it specifically spells out that a person can't be found guilty of improper storage of a firearm if a criminal breaks in and steals said firearm. The same law also spells out that it's not a crime to store your firearms in a manner that would allow your own children to gain access to them. Instead the law makes it illegal to store your guns in a manner that might allow your neighbor's kid to gain access to them without your permission.\n \n So...mandatory storage isn't about keeping guns from criminals, it's not about preventing accidents in the home, it's about providing an excuse to parents to not enroll their kids in the Eddie Eagle program, or telling them to keep their damn little grubby hands off of another person's gun! This law is nothing but a green light to practice bad parenting. Perhaps we should also pass laws that would give parents an excuse to not tell their children to stay away from strangers, don't play with knives, and don't cross the street when there are cars coming.\n \n Sinjin, you've proven nothing. Your only tools are hyperbole and emotional rhetoric. You're without standing to be making decisions of what laws should be passed, especially when you don't know the laws in your own state and how they affect the rights that you, and everyone around you, possess equally. So come back with proof that would conclusively support your position and prove it's the correct one, or don't bother coming back.",

   "Doc-\n Sarge-\n \n I don't really see why we're arguing with Sinjin in the first place, do you?\nI'm discussing. Y'all are the ones getting hot under the collar.\n \n \nIs he anti-gun? He claims that he's not, but his support of proposals that have the potential to make criminals out of innocent crime victims would suggest otherwise.\nNot if you follow the law.\n \n \nSinjin claims that mandatory reporting laws are necessary to make people accountable when they store their guns in a way that makes them easily accessible to criminals...\nNo to encourage secure storage and to separate actual victims of theft from those delivering firearms to criminals. \n \n \nDespite this claim, and his repeated cited of the \"200,000 stolen guns per year\" figure, Sinjin has been wholly unable, and entirely unwilling, to prove that gun owners will routinely and intentionally not report the loss of their privately owned guns to the police. He fails to address the fact that a police report is necessary for the insurance statement to get reimbursement on your loss; and money is a very good motivator to do the right thing.\nUnless there never was a theft in the first place.\n \n \nSinjin has claimed that we need to make any and all private transactions of firearms, between two or more private individuals, a matter of official government record by mandating that they have to be done through FFL dealers, in order to track the gun over the course of its life and so we'll know who to go after if the gun is ever used in a crime.\nWe'll know where to start at least. And we'll find a theft report if that owner isn't involved.\n \n \nIn making this claim, Sinjin chooses to outright ignore the fact that any such program would be unmanageable, and rarely, if ever, used by the police to try and track the gun recovered at the crime scene. Such a program would literally create tons of new paperwork, all in the form of hard copy forms that would be stored in cardboard boxes, and have to be searched through, by hand, in a manner that would waste valuable police resources and time. Just to deal with the new influx of records, the police would have to either pull patrol officers and stick them behind desks, or hire new officers and further strain their constant lack of funds.\nSez you. Simple solutions available.\n \n \nSinjin claims that mandatory storage laws would cut down on the number of guns that are stolen from people when they're out and away from their homes.\nNo doubt.\n \n \nIn making this claim, Sinjin is voicing his approval for a clearly, if not blatantly, unconstitutional law that the Supreme Court itself shot down just last year in the Heller ruling. Mandatory storage laws leave absolutely no room for keeping a defensive firearm stored in a manner where it can be immediately accessible in a moment's notice, meaning it violates a person's free exercise of their constitutional right to defend themselves against harm from another party.\nCCW?\n \n \nComplicating Sinjin's argument, his home state of California has a mandatory storage law, and thanks to him we see it specifically spells out that a person can't be found guilty of improper storage of a firearm if a criminal breaks in and steals said firearm. The same law also spells out that it's not a crime to store your firearms in a manner that would allow your own children to gain access to them. Instead the law makes it illegal to store your guns in a manner that might allow your neighbor's kid to gain access to them without your permission.\nThat's why there called CAP laws.\n \n \nSo...mandatory storage isn't about keeping guns from criminals, it's not about preventing accidents in the home,\nCAP laws are.\n \n \nSinjin, you've proven nothing. Your only tools are hyperbole and emotional rhetoric. You're without standing to be making decisions of what laws should be passed,\nI'm making suggestions.\n \n \n \nSo come back with proof that would conclusively support your position and prove it's the correct one, or don't bother coming back. \nNot your call.",

   "I'm discussing. Y'all are the ones getting hot under the collar.\n\n \n You call this a discussion? You're on here, continually talking about how we need to pass laws that're already on the books, laws that haven't been proven effective or even useful, and you refuse to address the potential shortcomings that we're pointing out to you.\n \n This isn't a discussion, this is our group beating up a mental cripple.\n \n \nNot if you follow the law.\n\n \n Oh? It's that simple, just follow the law?\n \n How simple is your thought process? Do you even know what you're proposing?\n \n Very few of us are legal experts and able to fully understand the entire text of laws that're already on the books, and bills that're being proposed everyday. This isn't a case of ignorance of the law, it's the inability to comprehend legal mumbo jumbo. Look at any proposed bill and you'll see it referring to another bill title that can't be found without looking elsewhere. Then you have to read that entire bill and then go back to reread the previous bill to try and determine what kind of effect it'll have.\n \n And even if you can understand the law, that's not good enough, you have to be fully versed in the interpretation of the law, you have to know how the courts have ruled in previous cases to get an idea of the full scope of what the law does, what it doesn't do, and these opinions are often changed with the passage of another ruling that contradicts earlier precedent. And each of these court decisions can be many, possibly hundreds of pages long. Do you really expect that we gun owners spend the time necessary to read and memorize the entirety of all this paperwork before we be allowed to exercise our constitutional rights? That's an awfully high standard there, quite excessive really. I really fail to see how that would qualify as fair and legal under constitutional standards.\n \n And making it even better, what does a person do when laws run contradictory to each other? What can you really do when one law says one thing, but another says something opposite and completely different?\n \n Do you have any serious, well thought out answers to address these valid concerns?\n \n \nNo to encourage secure storage and to separate actual victims of theft from those delivering firearms to criminals.\n\n \n Encouragement suggests supplying people with the incentive to do something. What you're proposing is bullying and harassment.\n \n And another thing. Your favored mandatory storage laws would do nothing to separate actual victims from gun runners, it's simply not possible under the proposal.\n \n How is safe storage going to address the issue of gun runners supplying weapons out of the trunk of their cars, or in back alleys?\n \n \nUnless there never was a theft in the first place.\n\n \n Say what? What kind of snake oil are you trying to sell now with this statement?\n \n \nWe'll know where to start at least. And we'll find a theft report if that owner isn't involved.\n\n \n Then can you provide some examples of how this proposal has worked in your own home state? It would really help your case if you could point to some genuine results.\n \n \nSez you. Simple solutions available.\n\n \n Simple solutions? When the BATFE is involved? HA!\n \n Do you realize, or even care, that the ATF has revoked FFL licenses over matters of storing paperwork in alphabetical order instead of chronological? Or chronological instead of alphabetical? Logic has no place with the ATF, they're very contradictory and randomly reverse their positions on a regular basis and without notice. The way it works one ATF agent can tell you one thing, another ATF agent can tell you something that's the complete opposite, and within the agency both statements are simultaneously regarded as the correct and proper position, even though such is an impossibility.\n \n There are no simple solutions with private sales being recorded; if there were then you'd provide what they are, instead of simply saying that they exist and leaving it at that and expecting us to accept your word as face value.\n \n Firearm transfer records aren't computerized, they're all written out on paper by hand. You can't just go to search, type in a serial number and come back with a hit. You have to sort through all the piles of records by hand, in hope of finding a single hit.\n \n \nNo doubt.\n\n \n You still haven't proven this is factual.\n \n \nCCW?\n\n \n And what's your proposal for those who're gun owners but don't have a concealed carry permit, either because they choose not to, or because the state won't give them one because the police chief has total discretion; such as in Los Angelas? \n \n \nThat's why there called CAP laws.\n\n \n No they aren't. The name has nothing to do with the law, it's just something to throw out there to sound good.\n \n You do realize that for neighborhood kids to gain access to your guns, especially when they don't have permission to be on your property, they have to be breaking the law in the first place, right? Trespassing, breaking and entering, etc.\n \n \nCAP laws are.\n\n \n No they're not, otherwise there would be no exceptions in the bill that would allow you to store your firearms in an \"easily accessible\" manner around your own children.\n \n \nI'm making suggestions.\n\n \n You haven't suggested a single idea that's your own. Everything you've put out come from the anti-gun playbook. Come up with something of your own.",

   "City to Require Owners to Report Lost or Stolen Guns\n Council approves a law requiring owners to report lost or stolen weapons. Some use the excuse to sell arms to criminals, police say.\n \n LA Times | October 19, 2006\n By Steve Hymon \n \n In an attempt to prevent gun sales to criminals, the Los Angeles City Council approved an ordinance Wednesday that requires residents report the loss or theft of their guns to police within 48 hours.\n \n The ordinance, which goes into effect next month, also requires anyone who had a gun stolen or lost in the last five years to report the loss. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's press office said he supports the measure and would allow it to become law.\n \n Residents who fail to report a loss of their weapon face a misdemeanor charge and up to one year in jail.

   "\"A few Ventura County cities have recently passed, or are considering passing, ordinances requiring gun owners to report the loss or theft of their firearms, typically within 48 hours of when the owner knew or \"should have known\" the gun was missing. Gun-control advocacy groups, having learned from professionals how to spin their anti-gun-owner proposals as benign, disingenuously claim the law will prevent unlawful sales of firearms by purchasers who buy a gun legally, intending to resell it illegally on the black market. These \"straw\" purchasers often falsely claim that a crime gun traced back to them was stolen or lost. \n \n Gun owners typically report stolen firearms anyway. These laws will only further victimize theft victims and impede criminal prosecutions. \n Ironically, the ordinance cannot be used against the real bad guys. No law can compel lawbreakers to report themselves. So a straw purchaser who legally buys a gun cannot be compelled to report that he resold it illegally. And since it wasn't actually lost or stolen, he hasn't violated the ordinance. Similarly, if a felon prohibited from possessing a gun illegally possesses one anyway, and it is lost or stolen, he can be prosecuted for having the gun in the first place, but cannot be prosecuted for failing to incriminate himself by reporting the loss. \n Enforcement of these ordinances places prosecutors in a precarious legal and ethical position. Say a straw-purchaser's gun is recovered at a crime scene and traced back to him. If he lies to police claiming his gun was \"stolen\" when he really sold it on the black market, will we nonetheless prosecute him for something he did not do (fail to report the \"stolen\" gun -- which wasn't actually stolen) but to which he \"confessed\"? Ethics and legality aside, securing a misdemeanor conviction for failing to report a theft (that never occurred) likely prohibits prosecuting the straw purchaser for the more serious felony black market sale or for making a false statement to police. \n \n Perhaps worse, gun owners who truly are burglary victims must now hesitate to speak with police if their stolen gun is recovered at a crime scene. If the gun owner failed to report the loss at all, or on time, she faces possible criminal prosecution if she cooperates with police investigating the recovered gun. She should remain silent, get a lawyer and seek immunity first. \n \n Legal representation may also be appropriate when a gun is first discovered missing. The owner can be prosecuted if the theft is not reported within 48 hours of when the owner \"should have known\" the gun was missing. Proponents have made clear they believe \"responsible\" gun owners should know where their gun is at every single moment and \"should know\" a gun is gone immediately. And the fear of prosecution will encourage those who miss the 48-hour window not to report the loss at all. \n \n Effectively, these ordinances place the legitimate gun owner in jeopardy of prosecution for becoming a victim of a crime. In light of these liabilities, gun-rights groups and the criminal-defense bar have begun advising gun owners -- who would ordinarily be happy to assist police with their investigation -- that they need a lawyer if they are contacted by police. \n \n In 2006, the Sacramento Police Department discovered these ordinances are unused in the cities that have them. Police and district attorneys in Oakland, San Francisco, Berkeley and Alameda were completely unaware the ordinances existed, and reported that no investigations, arrests or convictions related to the ordinances had taken place. An experienced inspector in the weapons unit of the San Francisco Police Department, who reads 3,000 reports every month, stated that he had not handled nor had he heard of any cases in which the ordinance was invoked. An assistant district attorney for the county of San Francisco stated: \"I do not believe it will expand my ability to prosecute crime.\" \n \n Even Sacramento Councilwoman Lauren Hammond, while acknowledging that Sacramento is at the forefront of gun-violence prevention, conceded that: \"On top of an ordinance that sounds really good, it hasn't done anything. Although I do support the concept, we've had an opportunity to see what it's done in other jurisdictions and it hasn't done a darned thing ... why ask the city attorney to bother to write an ordinance that no one uses and has had no effect in the jurisdictions that have it?\" \n \n Why indeed? \n \n Why pass an ineffective law on guns? : Opinion : Ventura County Star",

Once the owner is identified, then they must be located.If the owner is located and the owner is less than honest or is trafficking in guns, the owner can easily use the excuse that the \"gun was stolen.\" The prosecution of straw purchasers is not possible in this circumstance since current law does notrequire reporting of lost or stolen firearms. Implementing a reporting requirement,however, may have a deterrent effect on those who are selling or giving guns toothers for illegal proposes, and provide a consequence for those that claim the gun\"was lost or stolen\" after the crime was committed.\n\n \n No statistics = no crime duh! May does not equate to will, duh! Wonder how many straw purchasers are prosecuted, after all that is against existing law. Your straw man is burning still Calico Slimjim.\n \n Perhaps worse, gun owners who truly are burglary victims must now hesitate to speak with police if their stolen gun is recovered at a crime scene. If the gun owner failed to report the loss at all, or on time, she faces possible criminal prosecution if she cooperates with police investigating the recovered gun. She should remain silent, get a lawyer and seek immunity first. \n \n Legal representation may also be appropriate when a gun is first discovered missing. The owner can be prosecuted if the theft is not reported within 48 hours of when the owner \"should have known\" the gun was missing. Proponents have made clear they believe \"responsible\" gun owners should know where their gun is at every single moment and \"should know\" a gun is gone immediately. And the fear of prosecution will encourage those who miss the 48-hour window not to report the loss at all. ",

   "In an attempt to prevent gun sales to criminals, the Los Angeles City Council approved an ordinance Wednesday that requires residents report the loss or theft of their guns to police within 48 hours.\n\n \n I'm gonna throw a monkey wrench into your entire argument. How will this LA ordinance be able to address the issue of guns acquired out of state by straw purchasers.\n \n Anytime we talk about how overly strict the laws of one state are, people from that state are always complaining about how the \"weak, almost non-existent\" gun laws of neighboring states allows criminals to buy their guns there and then smuggle them back home where they can use them freely.\n \n So how's it going to work, Sinjin? How will LA's mandatory reporting law enable the city, or even the state, to better deal with gun runners when said runners aren't doing their buying and trading within that jurisdiction? The ATF isn't going to simply turn over trace data to police when they have no jurisdiction in the area in question. To me it sounds like the ordinance wasn't designed as anything more than a tactic to bully innocent people.\n \n \nResidents who fail to report a loss of their weapon face a misdemeanor charge and up to one year in jail. The ordinance applies to all guns, including rifles and shotguns.\n\n \n You still haven't met your burden of proof to convince us that this is actually happening.\n \n \nThe council voted 12 to 0 to approve the ordinance.\n\n \n And the Los Angelas police chief can deny anyone and everyone a concealed carry permit without reason or just cause.\n \n Wise up, just because the LA county is fully in favor of a gun control law, that doesn't mean that it's a good idea. San Francisco tried a citywide handgun and ammunition ban several years ago, but the courts b*tch slapped them and told them they weren't allowed to pull that kinda stunt.\n \n \n...Los Angeles Police Department officials said they recovered 6,600 illegally owned guns in 2005 and 4,800 so far this year.\n\n \n \"Illegally owned\"? Would you care to elaborate on just what that means?\n \n Were these cases of people owning guns with an expired license, or no license? Or were these examples of raids on known criminals who were found to be in possession of stolen guns?\n \n \nOne of their goals is to use the new law to prosecute people who repeatedly have their \"lost\" guns used in crimes.\n\n \n In other words, punishing people who have been repeatedly victimized by violent crime. Yeah that's real nice.\n \n I'm going to ask you something, and I want you to answer it without any of your liberal sanctioned rhetoric and soundbytes. You yourself said that very few straw purchasers were ever prosecuted in your state. What makes you think this mandatory reporting ordinance would make it any easier?\n \n \nLt. Steven A. Nielsen, of the gang and operations support division, said that investigators routinely can find the buyer of a gun used in a crime but then have no other recourse if that person says the gun was lost.\n\n \n I've got a better one for you: what's the answer when the original owner no longer lives within the jurisdiction? What if they're not even in the state any longer?",

   "For example, to obtain the owner information from ATF may take from 24 hours to a week.\n\n \n That's because the system they have is quite simply enormous, it has the information of tens of millions of people on record. And if it takes the professionals up to a week to find out the information, even when they have the resources and the latest technology, how long do you think it's going to take a local, small time group like the city police to sort through such a database?\n \n \nOnce the owner is identified, then they must be located.If the owner is located and the owner is less than honest or is trafficking in guns, the owner can easily use the excuse that the \"gun was stolen.\"\n\n \n What's to stop them from reporting the gun stolen ten seconds after they finish the illegal transaction? Would you please for the love of God answer that already!?\n \n \nThe prosecution of straw purchasers is not possible in this circumstance since current law does not require reporting of lost or stolen firearms.\n\n \n It isn't? You're telling me that it's absolutely, 100% impossible to prosecute someone for knowingly and intentionally supplying a gun to a person they know is a criminal?\n \n You've gotta be kidding! What about things like means, motive and opportunity? Surely these things can still be proven, right? Surely any prosecutor worth his salt can make a case that someone suspected of gun trafficking had every opportunity, and the intent, to procure weapons for the purpose of illegally transferring them to make a profit, right?\n \n \nImplementing a reporting requirement,however, may have a deterrent effect on those who are selling or giving guns to others for illegal proposes,\n\n \n So the ten year prison sentence for trafficking a gun to criminals isn't any sort of deterrent? Instead you need a one year jail sentence to really have these guys ****ing their pants if they even consider selling a gun to make a buck?\n \n \nand provide a consequence for those that claim the gun\"was lost or stolen\" after the crime was committed.\n\n \n How will you address the people who're criminalized when their gun was stolen and used in a murder just hours after the theft occurred, and they didn't know the gun went missing until they decided to go to the range the next day, or the next week?\n \n Or do you simply not care about the unintended consequences? Do you see everyone as being disposable and cannon fodder in the name of trying to catch a few small fish in the river of criminal masterminds?",
