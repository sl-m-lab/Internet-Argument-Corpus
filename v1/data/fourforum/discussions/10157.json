   "Americans don't want liberal college professors proselytizing to their kids. \n \n \n\n Released: July 10, 2007\n \n Zogby Poll: Most Think Political Bias Among College Professors a Serious Problem\n \n Four in 10 said the problem is \"very serious;\" Tenure seen as harmful to teaching quality\n \n As legislation is introduced in more than a dozen states across the country to counter political pressure and proselytizing on students in college classrooms, a majority of Americans believe the political bias of college professors is a serious problem, a new Zogby Interactive poll shows.\n \n Nearly six in 10 - 58% - said they see it as a serious problem, with 39% saying it was a \"very serious\" problem.\n \n The online survey of 9,464 adult respondents nationwide was conducted July 5-9, 2007, and carries a margin of error of +/- 1.0 percentage points.\n \n Predictably, whether political bias is a problem depends greatly on the philosophy of the respondents. While 91% of very conservative adults said the bias is a \"serious problem,\" just 3% of liberals agreed. Conservatives have long held that college campuses are a haven for liberal professors. The activist group Students for Academic Freedom, founded by conservative activist David Horowitz, has promoted state legislation invoking a \"Students Bill of Rights\" on campuses to protect conservative students from academic reprisals by professors who hold contradictory beliefs.\n \n Men were much more likely than women to see the bias of professors as a problem - 64% of men agreed, while 53% of women said the same.\n \n Whites were twice as likely to call it a \"serious problem\" as African Americans, the survey showed.\n \n The survey also showed that an overwhelming majority also believe that job security for college professors leaves them less motivated to do a good job than those professors who do not enjoy a tenured status - 65% said they believe non-tenured professors are more motivated to do a good job in the classroom.\n \n Asked whether they think the quality of a college education today is better or worse than it was 25 years ago, 46% said they think it is worse, while 29% said it is better. Another 16% said the quality now is about the same as it was a generation ago. Older respondents were much more likely than their younger counterparts to say the education quality has deteriorated: just 21% of those age 70 and older said it was better now, compared to 47% of those age 18 to 24 who said today's education was better. Among women, 30% said it was better, while 43% said it was worse and 17% said it was about the same. Among men, 29% said it was better, 49% said it was worse, and 16% said it was about the same.\n",

   "There have been studies in which professors and students were asked their politics. The results weren't surprising; they're predominantly liberals.\n \n\n Liberal bias in the ivory tower\n By Cathy Young | April 11, 2005\n \n YET ANOTHER study has come out documenting what most conservatives consider to be blindingly obvious: the leftward tilt of the American professoriate. The latest report, by political scientist Stanley Rothman of Smith College, communications professor S. Robert Lichter of George Mason University, and Canadian polling expert Neil Nevitte, published in the online journal Forum, paints a stark picture of a politically skewed academy. Nearly three quarters of the professors in a 1999 survey of college faculty identified themselves as left/liberal, only 15 percent as right/conservative; 50 percent were Democrats and 11 percent Republicans.\n \n A typical reaction to such studies from the left has been to shoot the messenger without denying the basic facts of the message. Thus, on his website, Michael B\u00e9rub\u00e9, a professor of literature and cultural studies at Penn State who has often locked horns with conservative critics of the academy, challenges the study's sample size and points out that it was financed by a conservative foundation. Then he cites a 2001 survey by the UCLA Higher Education Research Institute which yielded fairly similar results: 5.3 percent of faculty members were classified as ''far left,\" 42.3 percent as ''liberal,\" 34.3 percent as ''middle of the road,\" 17.7 percent as ''conservative,\" and 0.3 percent as ''far right.\" ''Yep,\" concedes B\u00e9rub\u00e9, ''we're a pretty liberal bunch.\"\n \n Once that point is conceded, the next argument is that political imbalance in colleges and universities (1) does not reflect bias against conservatives and (2) does not pose any real problem.\n \n Some academic liberals earnestly explain that conservatives are scarce in the universities because -- well, they're just not good enough. George P. Lakoff, professor of linguistics at the University of California-Berkeley, has told The New York Times that liberals go into the academy because, ''unlike conservatives, they believe in working for the public good and social justice, as well as knowledge and art for their own sake.\" Another variation on this theme is that liberals are better suited to academic life because, unlike those closed-minded, intolerant conservatives, they are open-minded and willing to allow the free expression of ideas they find disagreeable.\n \n Sure. Unless, of course, the upsetting idea is that racial preferences in college admissions are a bad policy (Ward Connerly, the African-American businessman who espouses this heresy, has been repeatedly shouted down when appearing on college campuses). Or that the shortage of women among top scientists may be partly due to innate differences between the sexes (just ask Harvard President Lawrence Summers about liberal tolerance on this issue).\n \n It is true, of course, that statistical imbalances don't automatically prove discrimination (as conservatives usually argue when it comes to racial and gender disparities). Like-minded people, just like people of similar ethnic background, can gravitate to the same profession for a variety of reasons -- including the desire to work with people like themselves. But bias, perhaps unconscious, may play a role: Rothman, Lichter, and Nevitte found evidence that Republican and conservative professors tend to be employed at lower-quality institutions than their similarly qualified liberal and Democratic colleagues.\n \n Whatever its cause, is this imbalance a cause for concern? Liberals wryly point out that no one complains about the dominance of Republicans in business. But universities are different: ideas are their lifeblood, and a lack of intellectual diversity endangers the very purpose of the academy. In a recent survey by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni nearly half of the students at America's top 50 universities and colleges complained of ''totally one-sided\" presentations and readings on controversial topics.\n On a subtler level, there is on many campuses a climate in which a ''normal\" person is presumed to be liberal. A young woman who is a graduate student at a Midwestern university and a liberal Democrat told me in a recent e-mail exchange that after the 2004 election, the unanimous opinion among the professors was that Americans who voted for Bush were ''either too stupid to know they 'should' vote for Kerry, or a bunch of right-wing bigots.\" She was open-minded enough to read some pro-Bush Internet sites and find a lot of Bush voters who bore no resemblance to this caricature. But she is convinced that if she were to share her observations with anyone in her department, the consequence would be social and professional ostracism.\n \n Some conservatives want a political solution: legislation that would not only protect the rights of dissenting students but penalize professors who use the classroom to push a political agenda. Many professors are appalled, understandably, by the idea of legislative intervention in the classroom. The best way to avoid such intervention is for the academy to make a good-faith effort to recognize and correct its intellectual diversity problem.\n http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/04/11/liberal_bias_in_the_ivory_tower/ \n",

In my 12 years of schooling from 1960 to 1972, I never heard a political opinion from any of my college educated teachers, and this was the very heart of the Vietnam war.

Whether the teaching in modern liberal arts and social science courses subscribes to enlightenment values may be doubted when these studies become instruments for the transmission of socialist opinions and attitudes. \n \n The result of biased teaching is unenlightened graduates who fail to acquire the intellectual equipment of an educated person. In other words, a university education should produce not \"liberal\" clones, but people of independent judgment who have acquired \"a clear and conscious view of their own opinions and judgments, a truth in developing them, an eloquence in expressing them, and a force in urging them. It teaches them to see things as they are, to go right to the point, to disentangle a skein of thought, to detect what is sophistical, and to discard what is irrelevant\" (John Henry Newman). \n\n I agree that it is critical objective thinking which should be most nurtured in students. From that point of view, I wouldn't mind professors preferring one political point of view to another if it is supported by rational arguement, where the opposite view is fairly represented. What I would find unacceptable is a professor who purposely distorts the opposite view with blanket statements that cannot be supported and also white-washes his own political view. The pros and cons of all views need to be considered and presented as objectively as possible. That will not necessarily result in a neutral political view, but at least the arguements will attempt to stay rational and objective.",

Such freedom is the breath in the nostrils of all scientific activity. \n\"Far from a comprehension\" - not likely to be found in todays study of critical thinking, is it? Critical thinking instructors seem to have more confidence in it than in past generations. \n\n \"Far from a comprehension\", in this case, was referring to \"in the spiritual life, and in the interpretation of the general meaning and ends of human existence and its relation to the universe\" - not to other areas of knowledge. These are spiritual / emotion questions that Science and secular reasoning cannot answer. Secular reasoning would question whether there is any one goal to human existence since no one goal has showed itself to be prominent (unless you want to call propagation of the species a goal). Since there is no evidence of religion or religiously reasoned goals for human existence, then secular reasoning cannot address that. Religious reasoning tries to address those questions and different religions give different answers. Either way, the quote you showed was very specific in what it was commenting about, it was not addressing knowledge in general. I think most would agree that we have made vast progress in our knowledge about most aspects of our existence over the last decades and centuries. Do you not agree?\n \n\"Disinterestedness\" - in academia, is it the same today as it was 10, 20,30, 50 after the 1915 principles were established? Waxy will show me that it is in our formal debate. He knows all about U.S. universities. :p\n\n It depends on what you mean by \"disinterestedness\". I think nearly every academic, indeed nearly every person in general, holds some opinions, views and preferences - one cannot help it as a human being. So, from that point of view, they are not personally \"disinterested\". However, where educating students is concerned, it is incumbent upon the professor to restrain his own personal biases and present the material as objectively as possible. Most seem to succeed in this fairly well, but I would agree that there are occasionally professors who let their personal biases influence the objectivity of their teaching so that, for example, they distort the opposing view and white-wash their own. I agree that something should be done about that, but not to the degree that it limits the freedom of responsible professors.",

   "There is a formal debate challange waiting for you in the challanges section. But you already knew that, didn't you?\n\n \n Actually, I didn't. I did check it out though. I'll respond there.\n \n \nIt's like evolution, it can be defined in many ways. I'm concerned how it's being redefined in todays academia. \n\n \n That doesn't suprise me.\n \n I'd be concerned if you weren't concerned.\n \n \nIt's dominated by current, left leaning perspectives on critical thinking. Here's an example;\n \n another example; \n \n This is how todays modern thought and instruction of critical thinking is done. The above quote naturally reaches a \"false conclusion\". A good way to teach it, with atheistic tidbits like that? You can't see it? \n\n \n No, I don't have time to search through pages of examples of logical analysis to search out juicy tidbits like that to feed my paranoia.\n \n \n:)\n\n \n We are a little unhinged as a group, you won't hear me argue that. It comes with the territory.\n \n \nYou're not really worth my time, except in a formal debate. Check it out;\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=9966 \n \n you would be taking a politically correct negative, practically an automatic win here. \n\n \n Nor are you worth mine. A few passing shots is all of my life I care to devote to you.\n \n \nBut they don't do that much on university computers.\n \n \n How would you/do you know this?\n \n Do you have personal experience? Do you have access to university records of searches done from their computers?\n \n \nIn the formal debate, I'll be glad to show you.\n \n \n It would almost be worth it, just for that.\n \n \nI understand that when many, if not most people use them, they'll grab what they find on the first page only, and not take the time to look further. It's the same as newspaper headlines - they get a lot more attention than the more obscure paragraphs below the headlines. Do you now understand more about human tendencies work with search engines? \n\n \n Apparently then, according to you, most people show a lack of critical thought when using search engines. Perhaps a few years of university training would teach them to dig deeper and check on those results, verifying them with several sources to ensure their accuracy.\n \n Personally, I read the whole newspaper. I guess only reading the headlines would be a lot cheaper, no need to buy the paper, just look at the front page and you're finished. Of course, you'd be very poorly informed, and such an action wouldn't demonstrate much critical thought.\n \n \nI can't imagine what I've done to him in this thread. Maybe some past \"around the blocks\" have caused it. Maybe he'll use some 4 letter words in our formal debate. :p \n\n \n You started this thread down the personal road in your post dated 3:35PM yesterday, and have continued to do so in posts today that aren't even addressed to me, so don't play the martyr now that you've been responded to in kind. It's rather pathetic, especially in the pandering manner in which you've done it.\n \n Four letter words are best left to those incapable of expressing themselves intelligently. The thought hadn't crossed my mind, apparently to your mind, it merited mentioning...\n \n \nI knew that one was coming, and from who was very predictible. If I don't have a secondary education, I don't have the critical thinking skills to be in a conversation about it right? \n\n \n You may very well have critical thinking skills. What you lack is any personal knowledge or understanding of the university environment. Based on your assessment of my knowledge of the USA, it would seem to me that you deem such personal knowledge as being valuable, perhaps even necessary, to be able to respond intelligently to a topic.\n \n There's an old saying marc, \"those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones\".\n \n \nHow about this basis, my tax dollars support it? \n \n (If you do the formal debate, (har)I may need a little time to get my sick computer to the doctor, and back in order. It's very slow and unpredictable. )\n\n \n Your tax dollars support many things, secondary education is a miniscule proportion of it.\n \n Waxy",
