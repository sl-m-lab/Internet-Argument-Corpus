Humans probably crossed over either ice bridges during ice ages, or boated over. There is evidence they crossed the Pacific as well. Fossilisation is rare, especially when populations are small. It wouldn't even have taken thousands of people to have managed the migration.\n \n The genetic and archaeological evidence for the migration -- well, actually about three independent migrations -- is pretty conclusive.\n \n \nAnd the point I was making is that moneys evolved after the split of the continents, yet are found both on Africa and South America.

And how would they have managed to get from the Americas to the Ark in the first place? Rafting? If they could raft, why did they need Noah?\n \n Look, no-one knows how the ancestors of the Old World monkeys got there. Maybe a small group of their common ancestor did drift across on a vegetation raft -- these occur today. Or maybe the genetic dating for the lineage separation is in error. But whatever the unknowns in the evolutionary explanation, they are huge problems raised to a vast power for your famous flood theory.\n \n So tell us again... how did all the Old World monkeys swim across the Atlantic together all the way from Mt.

(However, there are some complications and puzzles.)\n \n Old world to new world connections were available across the northern North Atlantic in the Eocene, although minor rafting may have been required. A lot of Asian mammals entered into North America around 55 m.y. ago (Asia had dry land connections to N. America then, but not to Europe). Then the two were disconnected, but connections seem to have started again at about 20 m.y. ago. Connections via Australia, Antarctica, and South America were available until late in the Cretaceous, and may have been late enough to allow the very earliest primates to get around the world, including to S. America, but would not have been significant to post-lemuriform primates.\n \n With respect to people crossing from Siberia to North America, a nice example of a standard summary can be found at http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/geog/native/text/history.htm \n \n The Bering 'land bridge' that was important during the last ice age happened because the area did not have much snow and thus sufficiently ice-free, and because sea levels were lower than today (because of all the water stored on land as ice). Specifically, sea levels were around 120 m lower than today (with variations due to local tectonic changes), which is much lower than the continental crust now submereged under the Bering Sea. On the map at http://www.ims.uaf.edu/NPRBdrifters/bering%20chukchi%20map.png , anything colored any shade of pink to red would have been above sea level at maximal glaciation. However, the area would nonetheless have been quite cold, lifeless, and challenging, and people seem to have come across comparatively late, when the land bridge was much reduced.\n \n See http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/parcs/atlas/beringia/lbridge.html\n \n From http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/beringia.html#top\n [quote]One attempt to study the coastal terrain of this area as it was about 10,000 BC used a bathymetric map to locate areas for submarine sample collection which could be Carbon-14 dated. This provided evidence of coastal forests that had covered the area by that time, even though a couple of thousand years earlier it would have been frozen. One stone tool was even recovered dating from about 8,000 BC from a level 53 meters below the present sea level. These finds suggest continuing human populations in these coastal areas, and increase the probability of a model that would see the coast as also having been an early \"migration route\" into the Americas.\n \n Dates\n The following dates summarize the availability of unobstructed routes for human migration southward from Beringia during the ice age. During the \"warm\" periods of melted glaciers and high sea water, when Beringia itself was submerged, naturally both the coastal and inland routes were ice-free. Although the chart suggests a binary \"open\" and \"shut\" distinction, this is too simplistic: \"open\" does not always mean equally inviting, as the variation in sea levels and coastal woodland ecology clearly shows.\n \n From the paleoclimatological information given here, it looks as though the coastal route hypothesis is stronger than the inland route hypothesis, and as though the \"smart money\" would be on the period 22,000-15,000 BC as the most probable time for this initial migration, with 38,000-34,000 as a provocative early-end hypothesis.\n \n\n Dates BC Beringia Coastal Route Mackenzie Corridor \n \"Land Bridge\" \n 38,000-34,000 accessible (open) open closed\n 34,000-30,000 submerged (closed) open open\n 30,000-22,000 accessible (open) closed open\n 22,000-15,000 accessible (open) open closed\n 15,000 - today submerged (closed) open open\n \n\n [quote]\n \n From http://www.geotimes.org/dec06/NN_migration.html , \nTerrestrial fossils in cores collected two decades ago from the Chukchi Sea suggest that the Bering Strait flooded around 13,000 years ago, cutting off any migration route for humans and megafauna, says Julie Brigham-Grette, a geologist at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. But the samples that had shown the earliest dates for the flooding were less reliable than they could have been, Brigham-Grette says.\n \n Trying to constrain when the strait flooded and closed off that migration route, Lloyd Keigwin of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and colleagues, including Brigham-Grette, surveyed and drilled cores into the Bering and Chukchi seas in the Arctic. Isotopic, marine fossil and sediment analyses from the team's cores indicate that the Bering Strait flooded sometime shortly before 12,000 years ago, as they reported in the October Geology. \n\n \n From http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/156/3773/380\n \nPaul A. Colinvaux, 1967, \"Bering Land Bridge: Evidence of Spruce in Late-Wisconsin Times\", Science 21 April 1967, 156(3773):380 - 383\n \n A 14-meter core from a crater lake on Saint Paul Island in the Pribilofs has been examined by pollen analysis. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the core spans more than 10,000 years and probably more than 18,000 years. A spruce-pollen maximum about 10,000 years ago suggests that spruce advanced to the flanks of the southern coast of the Bering land bridge toward the close of the land-bridge period. The forests of Alaska and Siberia did not merge, however, and the environment of the southern coast of the land bridge remained cold.\n\n \n Also bear in mind that a crossing does not have to be a single long arduous journey. An inhabitable coastal strip could simply be gradually inhabited by succeeding generations, as young couples tend to settle uninhabited regions slightly farther east until we have humans living in coastal Alaska. You could have a strip of habitable land extending from Siberia into the Bering region, which gets inhabited. If habitable climate regions shift east a bit, the habitable region could grow east, but get detached from habitable parts of Siberia. People may well shift with it over centuries, as they simply keep shifting around in the habitable areas. If the patch at some point expanded into contact with North American forests or grasslands, then you'd have people living in North America. (That's basically what the 'coastal' and 'Mackenzie' routes are all about, above.) You can also add the possibility of people making boats and paddling off to explore distant islands.",
