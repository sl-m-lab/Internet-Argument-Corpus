   " ATF to Require Multiple Sales Reports for Long Guns \n This ATF &#8220;emergency&#8221; mandate was originally pushed by the anti-gun Mayors Against Illegal Guns (MAIG) coalition, headed by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, more than a year and a half ago. And the Post reports that the Department of Justice has &#8220;languished&#8221; over this plan for several months. Given this timetable, it&#8217;s hard to see exactly where the &#8220;emergency&#8221; is.\n\n \n I am sure this is JUST Coincidence. I am sure this is a Real Emergency, now, as apposed to when the Illegal Mayors wanted it. \n \n Meanwhile, lets take a look at just how corrupt The Mexican Government and justice system is. \n  Authorities Say 151 Inmates Escaped Mexico Prison \n Friday&#8217;s prison break brings to 352 the number of inmates who have escaped Tamaulipas penitentiaries thus far this year. The tally as of Sept. 10 was 201, including 86 men who busted out of a prison in Reynosa, neighboring McAllen, Texas. \n \n The Gulf coast state of Tamaulipas has been battered this year by a turf war between the Gulf drug cartel and former allies Los Zetas, a conflict that has left hundreds dead.\n \n Massive prison breaks are a tactic employed by drug mobs in response to the killings and arrests of their gunmen.\n\n They just walk right out of prison, while no one says a word. The last big prison break that was posted here included reports on how the prisoners, went to the Armory before leaving and looted it before leaving. \n \n Los Zetas. You know. The Mexican Special Forces trained by our Special Forces, to fight the drug cartel! Before they defected to start their very own and the most vicious of the drug cartels! \n \n  Mexican security forces are scrambling to catch scores of inmates who broke out of a prison near the US border in a region plagued by drug gang violence. \n The prison warden has gone missing since the breakout, which went unnoticed until a routine head count late Thursday. \n\n The warden is probably sitting on a beach on Costa Rica sipping his favorite drinks. The finest government, and judicial system, their Drug Money can buy! \n \n Oh yeah. One more thing. \n  Mexican city devastated by pipeline blast; 27 die \n Mexico-based CEO Alberto Islas says several gangs are responsible, including the Zetas drug cartel, a former group of trained military assassins that is causing much of the drug violence in Mexico as it battles its old ally, the Gulf cartel.\n",

I made several points regarding the physical issues that would need to be addressed with non-lead ammunition, but you chose not to address them.

Again I point out how exposure to lead is something that's impossible to avoid, and the fact that no scientific evidence was offered to support the claim about the dangers of lead exposure.\n \n I then went further and brought up several unmentioned points on the article you cited, the article which point you basically accepted as your own, revealing that it was put forth by the Violence Policy Center, which also suggested banning the use of so-called \"assault weapons\" at ranges, denying federal funding to shooting ranges, and barring children from having any access to the various shooting sports on the grounds that the lead exposure was too serious a health hazard to warrant them being given access to what the courts have correctly recognized as a Constitutional right. \n \n I took extreme issue with this, as I was started out early and have grown up just fine. I started shooting before I was ten years old, cutting my teeth on a rimfire rifle. I had as much exposure to lead as both my parents, as well as uncles, grandparents, cousins and even my aunts, and I experienced no developmental issues while growing up.

However unlike Bryan I'll post the entire section to show the case.\n \n \"Each licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, and licensed dealer shall maintain such records of importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms at his place of business for such period, and in such form, as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe.

The Attorney General, when he has reasonable cause to believe a violation of this chapter has occurred and that evidence thereof may be found on such premises, may, upon demonstrating such cause before a Federal magistrate judge and securing from such magistrate judge a warrant authorizing entry, enter during business hours the premises (including places of storage) of any licensed firearms importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, licensed collector, or any licensed importer or manufacturer of ammunition, for the purpose of inspecting or examining- \n \n (i) any records or documents required to be kept by such licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector under this chapter or rules or regulations under this chapter, and\n \n (ii) any firearms or ammunition kept or stored by such licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, at such premises.\"\n \n It specifically says right there, in black and white, that the Attorney General already has the authority to inspect any record at any licensed gun store in the country. Any documents required to be kept by such a licensed...dealer. The ATF, acting with the Attorney General, can already compel any dealer to submit records for long guns, under current law, it's as simple as that. They don't need emergency authority, they don't need new laws, they don't need any of that.

   "Changed my stance? Or a false dilemma created by you? It's logically possible for both hunters to pollute the environment and for target shooters to poison others.\n\n \n You specifically mentioned hunters being the threat in your first post. Then when you were confronted with the facts you changed your stance to go off on target shooters.\n \n There's no false dilemma here. All we have right here is you with your bobbing and weaving. We confront you with one false position, you immediately abandon ship and try another false position, only to be confronted on that one as well.\n \n Why haven't you addressed the physical impracticalities of implementing non-lead ammunition?\n \n Better yet, why haven't you elaborated the position of the Violence Policy Center study that you've adopted as your own position by posting it here? There are serious questions that have been raised by it, and they're in need of an answer.\n \n \n\"upon demonstrating such cause before a Federal magistrate judge and securing from such magistrate judge a warrant authorizing entry\"\n \n And you're arguing that the authorities are just as likely to find out about suspicious gun purchases if the authorities have to obtain a warrant before seeing the records?\n\n \n If obtaining a warrant is good enough for the police in all other matters then I fail to see why the same standard is insufficient in this matter.\n \n Surely if American gun shops close to the border are truly supplying weapons to criminals in Mexico, that would qualify as sufficient cause for the Attorney General to obtain a warrant for their sales records, correct? And if not then why not?\n \n \nThe comparison was between guns and pseudoephedrine. Guns can be misused. Pseudoephedrine can be misused.\n\n \n Well then let's do this. Name one thing in the world that can't be misused for criminal purposes. I'd love to see what you come up with.\n \n \nAnd you can make claims that are contrary to the BATFE's position and post no evidence to support such claims.\n\n \n Ignorance of the law is no excuse. If the ATF isn't aware of what the laws are that're currently in place then they really shouldn't be in the law enforcement business, they should go back to treasury matters exclusively.\n \n Besides it's a little hard to post evidence when I'm several posts short of active link privileges.\n \n \nSo a law will only work if all the criminals comply with it? But that \"logic\" could be used against any law. I'm not buying it.\n\n \n Well considering you chose to ally yourself with environmental extremists I'm not surprised that you're not buying the facts. Facts go against the position of those that you've chosen to side with. Facts are things that emotional rhetoric and fear mongering can't wash away no matter how hard one tries.\n \n How about you elaborate and tell us how the various gun control laws that have been proposed by the various anti gun organizations have helped reduce crime. I'd love to see how gun rationing, ammunition documentation, ending private sales, gun registration, and restriction of right to carry, has helped reduce violence crimes and make things difficult for criminals.\n \n If you have any evidence that can be verified and scientifically proven then I'd love to see it. The gun control side keeps making bold claims about what a proposed law will do. But when asked for examples of how the law has supposedly worked in other areas it's been implemented, they suddenly clam up and disappear into the shadows, never giving an answer to the question.\n \n \nI don't know what you mean about camera owners being \"subjected to laws against child pornography.\" Why wouldn't they be bound by such laws?\n\n \n You can't make child pornography without cameras. Therefore camera owners need to be targeted for the welfare and protection of children. Anyone who can snap a picture needs to be regarded as a potential threat or they might post inappropriate images on the internet to be ogled. Do you care to disagree with this position? \n \n I advise you to be careful though. This is the same logic the gun control supporters apply to people exercising their Second Amendment rights. To try and argue that the logic used with regard to gun owners is wrong when suddenly applied to camera owners, that casts serious doubt on the validity of the logic to begin with.\n \n You yourself tried to make a comparison between legal guns and legal medical drugs, claiming both can be misused and thus made subject to further regulation and tracking. Cameras can also be misused, but for a much more heinous type of crime. Shouldn't they also be regulated in a manner similar to guns and medical drugs, to ensure that they aren't being misused by people with bad intentions?",

   "ATF is asking for permission to do what FFL dealers are already required to report for handguns. I see this as not a request for more legislation but rather a request to use the existing law to require these reports. It is more of a request to the AG than the \"White House.\" In my opinion, the AG already has the statutory authority to order the reporting the ATF wants (and he can order FFLs to report far more information than just multiple rifle sales in a five day period.) \n \n I think there is some confusion over what 18 U.S.C. 923 authorizes. We are dealing with part (g) of the statute, which reads in its entirety as follows:\n \n U.S. Code 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923\n (g)\n \n (1)\n \n (A) Each licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, and licensed dealer shall maintain such records of importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms at his place of business for such period, and in such form, as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe. Such importers, manufacturers, and dealers shall not be required to submit to the Attorney General reports and information with respect to such records and the contents thereof, except as expressly required by this section. The Attorney General, when he has reasonable cause to believe a violation of this chapter has occurred and that evidence thereof may be found on such premises, may, upon demonstrating such cause before a Federal magistrate judge and securing from such magistrate judge a warrant authorizing entry, enter during business hours the premises (including places of storage) of any licensed firearms importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, licensed collector, or any licensed importer or manufacturer of ammunition, for the purpose of inspecting or examining -\n \n (i) any records or documents required to be kept by such licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector under this chapter or rules or regulations under this chapter, and\n \n (ii) any firearms or ammunition kept or stored by such licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, at such premises.\n \n (B) The Attorney General may inspect or examine the inventory and records of a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer without such reasonable cause or warrant -\n \n (i) in the course of a reasonable inquiry during the course of a criminal investigation of a person or persons other than the licensee;\n \n (ii) for ensuring compliance with the record keeping requirements of this chapter -\n \n (I) not more than once during any 12-month period; or\n \n (II) at any time with respect to records relating to a firearm involved in a criminal investigation that is traced to the licensee; or\n \n (iii) when such inspection or examination may be required for determining the disposition of one or more particular firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation.\n \n (C) The Attorney General may inspect the inventory and records of a licensed collector without such reasonable cause or warrant -\n \n (i) for ensuring compliance with the record keeping requirements of this chapter not more than once during any twelve-month period; or\n \n (ii) when such inspection or examination may be required for determining the disposition of one or more particular firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation.\n \n (D) At the election of a licensed collector, the annual inspection of records and inventory permitted under this paragraph shall be performed at the office of the Attorney General designated for such inspections which is located in closest proximity to the premises where the inventory and records of such licensed collector are maintained. The inspection and examination authorized by this paragraph shall not be construed as authorizing the Attorney General to seize any records or other documents other than those records or documents constituting material evidence of a violation of law. If the Attorney General seizes such records or documents, copies shall be provided the licensee within a reasonable time. The Attorney General may make available to any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency any information which he may obtain by reason of this chapter with respect to the identification of persons prohibited from purchasing or receiving firearms or ammunition who have purchased or received firearms or ammunition, together with a description of such firearms or ammunition, and he may provide information to the extent such information may be contained in the records required to be maintained by this chapter, when so requested by any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency.\n \n (2) Each licensed collector shall maintain in a bound volume the nature of which the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, records of the receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms. Such records shall include the name and address of any person to whom the collector sells or otherwise disposes of a firearm. Such collector shall not be required to submit to the Attorney General reports and information with respect to such records and the contents thereof, except as expressly required by this section.\n \n (3)\n \n (A) Each licensee shall prepare a report of multiple sales or other dispositions whenever the licensee sells or otherwise disposes of, at one time or during any five consecutive business days, two or more pistols, or revolvers, or any combination of pistols and revolvers totalling two or more, to an unlicensed person. The report shall be prepared on a form specified by the Attorney General and forwarded to the office specified thereon and to the department of State police or State law enforcement agency of the State or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction in which the sale or other disposition took place, not later than the close of business on the day that the multiple sale or other disposition occurs.\n \n (B) Except in the case of forms and contents thereof regarding a purchaser who is prohibited by subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of this title from receipt of a firearm, the department of State police or State law enforcement agency or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction shall not disclose any such form or the contents thereof to any person or entity, and shall destroy each such form and any record of the contents thereof no more than 20 days from the date such form is received. No later than the date that is 6 months after the effective date of this subparagraph, and at the end of each 6-month period thereafter, the department of State police or State law enforcement agency or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction shall certify to the Attorney General of the United States that no disclosure contrary to this subparagraph has been made and that all forms and any record of the contents thereof have been destroyed as provided in this subparagraph.\n \n (4) Where a firearms or ammunition business is discontinued and succeeded by a new licensee, the records required to be kept by this chapter shall appropriately reflect such facts and shall be delivered to the successor. Where discontinuance of the business is absolute, such records shall be delivered within thirty days after the business discontinuance to the Attorney General. However, where State law or local ordinance requires the delivery of records to other responsible authority, the Attorney General may arrange for the delivery of such records to such other responsible authority.\n \n (5)\n \n (A) Each licensee shall, when required by letter issued by the Attorney General, and until notified to the contrary in writing by the Attorney General, submit on a form specified by the Attorney General, for periods and at the times specified in such letter, all record information required to be kept by this chapter or such lesser record information as the Attorney General in such letter may specify.\n \n (B) The Attorney General may authorize such record information to be submitted in a manner other than that prescribed in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph when it is shown by a licensee that an alternate method of reporting is reasonably necessary and will not unduly hinder the effective administration of this chapter. A licensee may use an alternate method of reporting if the licensee describes the proposed alternate method of reporting and the need therefor in a letter application submitted to the Attorney General, and the Attorney General approves such alternate method of reporting.\n \n (6) Each licensee shall report the theft or loss of a firearm from the licensee's inventory or collection, within 48 hours after the theft or loss is discovered, to the Attorney General and to the appropriate local authorities.\n \n (7) Each licensee shall respond immediately to, and in no event later than 24 hours after the receipt of, a request by the Attorney General for information contained in the records required to be kept by this chapter as may be required for determining the disposition of 1 or more firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation. The requested information shall be provided orally or in writing, as the Attorney General may require. The Attorney General shall implement a system whereby the licensee can positively identify and establish that an individual requesting information via telephone is employed by and authorized by the agency to request such information.\n \n I read this statute this way:\n \n Part (g)(1) authorizes an on premises search of the FFL dealer's place of business by the AG on application to a magistrate judge. The showing is that a \"reasonable cause\" exists to believe that a violation has occurred and evidence of the violation exists on site. Now unless federal courts have interpreted this language differently, this is a much lesser standard than the \"probable cause\" required for a 4th. Amendment search warrant. The analogy would be with a traffic stop for speeding, which requires only \"reasonable, articulable suspicion.\" But, to conduct an actual search of the car the police must have more than \"reasonable cause,\" they must instead have \"probable cause\" to believe a crime has been or is being committed and the car contains evidence of the crime. \n \n But, as I said, this is for an on premises search. The statute also allows for annual on premises inspections without any showing of cause or need. Notice, however, that Part (g)(1) also has an exception that reads dealers shall not be required to submit to the Attorney General reports and information with respect to such records and the contents thereof, except as expressly required by this section. (emphasis added)\n \n One of these \"expressly required\" reporting requirements deals exclusively with multiple handgun sales to the same person in a five day period, and is found in Part (g)(3)(A)\n \n (A) Each licensee shall prepare a report of multiple sales or other dispositions whenever the licensee sells or otherwise disposes of, at one time or during any five consecutive business days, two or more pistols, or revolvers, or any combination of pistols and revolvers totalling two or more, to an unlicensed person. The report shall be prepared on a form specified by the Attorney General and forwarded to the office specified thereon and to the department of State police or State law enforcement agency of the State or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction in which the sale or other disposition took place, not later than the close of business on the day that the multiple sale or other disposition occurs. \n \n Notice this is not an on premises inspection but a \"send it to us\" reporting requirement, and that it applies to all FFL dealers, not just those on the Mexican border. I wonder how many reports of multiple handgun sales have been turned in as required, or whether these reports have helped law enforcement solve any crimes?\n \n But the very broad \"expressly required\" reporting requirement that already gives the AG authority to do what ATF is asking (and a lot more) is found in Part (g)(5)(A):\n \n (A) Each licensee shall, when required by letter issued by the Attorney General, and until notified to the contrary in writing by the Attorney General, submit on a form specified by the Attorney General, for periods and at the times specified in such letter, all record information required to be kept by this chapter or such lesser record information as the Attorney General in such letter may specify.\n \n Just what information can the Attorney general require-of any select group or indeed all FFL dealers-merely by the stroke of a commanding pen?\n \n The above language says is can be as broad as \"all such record information required to be kept by this chapter\" (meaning Chapter 44 of Title 18, sections 921-931), which includes the records specified in 923(g)(1)(A):\n \n Each licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, and licensed dealer shall maintain such records of importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms at his place of business for such period, and in such form, as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe....\n \n In other words, the AG has the authority to unilaterally demand that any FFL dealer must report all his information regarding firearm transfers for as long as the AG deems necessary. \n \n This is how I read the statute. But, as I say, I don't practice in the Federal courts. If someone else has a better reading of the statute then I invite it to be posted....",

   "MSNBC has an article that would argue otherwise. Firearms from U.S. used in Mexico drug violence - World news - Americas - Focus on Mexico - msnbc.com\n \n I'm not seeing anything about secondary market sales. Rather I'm seeing talk about straw purchasers.\n\n \n \"One yardstick, used internally by U.S. law enforcement officials but almost never publicly discussed, is what they call the &#8220;time to crime&#8221; measurement: the elapsed time between a gun&#8217;s purchase in the United States and its seizure by Mexican authorities in the course of a raid on drug traffickers. Mexican authorities routinely provide serial numbers on the weapons they seize to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) so the guns can be traced back to their original source. The shorter the time to crime, the higher the likelihood that the gun was bought directly from a U.S. gun store by &#8220;straw buyers&#8221; or other drug-cartel operatives and then smuggled across the border into Mexico. As recently as 2006, the official says, the average time to crime for guns seized in Mexico was between six and seven years, suggesting that the weapons had gone through several buyers and sellers before ending up in the hands of Mexican drug traffickers.\n \n But by this year the time-to-crime figure had dropped to less than three years, and in recent months ATF has been tracing weapons seized in Mexico with time-to-crime numbers that in some cases are as low as weeks or even days, says the law enforcement official. Such a dramatic reduction almost certainly means that the guns were initially purchased for a criminal purpose and could mean the Mexican cartels have stepped up their already aggressive efforts to obtain high powered weaponry, such as semi automatic assault rifles and pistols from the United States, the law enforcement official says.\n \n Nevertheless, another senior official at ATF disputes the suggestion that the drop indicates a stepped-up overall flow of weapons to the south. Instead, the ATF official says, it may mean only that particular kinds of weapons are being purchased for Mexican traffickers directly from U.S. gun stores, as opposed to used weapons being bought on the secondary market at U.S. gun shows or from unregulated private sellers.\"\n \n Is the Flow of U.S. Weapons to Mexican Drug Cartels Increasing Under Obama? - Newsweek",

Therefore, to identify which states are a source of a disproportionately large number of Mexican crime guns, this report controls for population. Using population as a control makes it possible to determine the rate at which states supply or &#8220;export&#8221; guns that are recovered in Mexican crimes.\n While proximity to the border appears to be a major factor affecting which states are top sources, controlling for population reveals that even among the Southwest border states, certain states export crime guns to Mexico at disproportionately higher rates. Three of the border states &#8211; Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas &#8211; each have export rates at least 169% greater than any other state and more than three times as high as the fourth border state, California.\n These differences in export rates to Mexico among the four border states may reflect differences in the way those states regulate guns: California, which has the lowest export rate, has adopted several regulations that Arizona, New Mexico and Texas have not. ATF agents have said that Arizona&#8217;s and Texas&#8217; laws make it easy to buy guns for smuggling to the cartels, while California&#8217;s do not.\n \n http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/downloads/pdf/issue_brief_mexico_2010.pdf",

Straw purchasing is a misdemeanor under state law in many states. \n \n \nAlso, what criteria should we use in defining just what qualifies as a \"straw purchase\"? Are we going to involve mens rea and require proof that the seller intentionally and deliberately sold a weapon to somebody they knew full well was prohibited from ownership in the first place?

The Type 84 make of SKS was the only type of SKS that had to be registered under the \"assault weapons\" law, all the other 16 weren't considered as such. And as we know California doesn't require registration of long guns that aren't considered \"assault weapons\". So anybody that owned a Type 81, or Type 63, or M59/66, or any of the other 16 variants of SKS rifle, couldn't be compelled to register with the state. That's how the law was, that's how it was interpreted.\n \n So unless the dealer records were searched to determine who owned a non \"assault weapon\" type SKS that wasn't registered with the state, how were all these owners found when the courts decided to rule that ALL SKS variants were included in the law after the fact?",

   "The Washington Post\n \n The Arctic ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot, according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from Consulafft, at Bergen, Norway. Reports from fishermen, seal hunters and explorers all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the Arctic zone. Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes.\n Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the gulf stream still very warm. Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the report continued, while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared.\n \n Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast shoals of herring and smelts which have never before ventured so far north, are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds. \n Within a few years it is predicted that due to the ice melt the sea will rise and make most coastal cities uninhabitable.\n ____________________________________________________\n \n Oops! Never mind. This report was from November 2, 1922, as reported by the Associated Press and published in the Washington Post - 88 YEARS AGO!\n \n \n Now consider the repetitiveness of the mass and myth of gun control lies.\n \n BTW sliiiiick, another MAIG woman mayor was convicted of felonious behavior so they keep dwindling in number.

   "  Is the U.S. to blame for gun violence in Mexico? \n Yes, we Americans who represent only about 6 percent of the world's population consume nearly 90 percent of the world's drugs and, thus, represent the key marketplace for South American cocaine and other drugs shipped via Mexico into the United States.\n\n Ahh! Finally we affix the blame EXACTLY where it belongs! Drug Users. Belly up to the bar and take credit for YOUR Carnage! I hope YOUR DRUGS are worth it! \n \n   Is the U.S. to blame for gun violence in Mexico? \nAmidst the violence, the terror, the beheadings, the senselessness of it all, it is the sheer overwhelming use of firepower by the cartels that stands out: fully automatic military-grade machine guns as high as .50 caliber, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), grenades and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) are being used in this war between the seven cartels and the government of Mexico -- as well as between the cartels and their rival factions -- for control of the \"plazas\" or distribution routes. As one organization is taken out, another quickly moves in to fill the vacuum and establish control of that plaza through violence, mayhem and intimidation. Some recent activities appear to come right out of the terror playbooks of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) or even Al Qaeda.\n \n The fact is, only a small percentage of the guns linked to drug-related violence in Mexico actually come from the United States. &#8230;. The real fact is, over 80 percent of the weapons seized at Mexican crime scenes are untraceable and never submitted to U.S. authorities. Those traceable U.S. firearms actually only represent about 17 percent of guns and weapons found at Mexican crime scenes.\n \n So where do these guns come from? On the surface, a cursory review of the high-powered military-grade seized weaponry -- grenades, RPGs, .50-caliber machine guns -- clearly indicates this weaponry is not purchased at gun shows in the United States and can't even be found commercially available to consumers in the United States. The vast majority of the weaponry used in this \"drug war\" comes into Mexico through the black market and the wide-open, porous southern border of Mexico and Guatemala. This black market emanates from a variety of global gunrunners with ties to Russian organized crime and terror groups with a firm foothold in Latin America such as the FARC, as well as to factions leftover from the civil wars in Central America during the 1980's. Chinese arms traffickers have managed to disperse weapons, particularly grenades, on the streets of Mexico. In addition, many of the Mexican military-issued, Belgian-made automatic M-16s currently in the hands of traffickers have been pilfered from military depots and the thousands who have deserted the Mexican army in recent years.\n \n The Mexican cartels have evolved into a diverse federation of narco-terrorists with a presence in 47 countries; they have direct ties to international organized crime groups in India and China for their precursor chemicals in the growing methamphetamine market, and to the Italian Calabria mafia, 'Ndrangheta, for the distribution of cocaine in the lucrative European market. Mexican cartels have diversified their criminal enterprises to include not only global drug distribution but also human smuggling, kidnapping, extortion and penetration of business supply chains -- as well as the counterfeiting of software products, music and videos. The Mexican cartels, who clearly have established a global footprint and conservatively realize annual profits approaching $50 billion (that's billion with a \"b\"), are not realistically going to establish straw buyers at U.S. gun shows when the merchants of death in Russia, China, Latin-America, Israel and South Africa are willing to peddle their wares. \n \n Americans are not fully responsible for the gun-related violence in Mexico -- but we are responsible for the creation of the world's premier drug marketplace for the cartels and their surrogates.\n \n To that end, as a society, we have a responsibility to intelligently consider solutions to this problem that we share with our neighbors to the south. \n \n James G. Conway Jr. is a former FBI special agent and program manager of FBI counterterrorism operations in Latin America.\n\n I know you ANTIS don't REALLY want to solve this problem. YOU only want to use their problems to SCAM the 2nd Amendment to our Constitution! Why do we know that to be the facts! Because NOTHING you propose will even make a dent into ANY of the Real causes and solutions. Not even a dent! But you all would be happy because you got to do damage to the 2nd Amendment. Which is, after all, Your Only Goal! \n \n That is the way I see it!\n \n So Ah, Antis! What kind of drugs would Jesus Smoke? Especially since they cause so much death, destruction and anarchy especially in Mexico. Smoke your drugs. Do it for the Children!",

   "Congressman Denny Rehberg : News Releases : Rehberg Leads Bipartisan Letter to ATF Questioning New Firearm Dealer Regulations\n \n \nWASHIGNTON, D.C. - Montana's Congressman, Denny Rehberg today sent a bipartisan letter along with 33 co-signers to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) questioning an \"emergency\" information request that will require federally licensed firearms retailers to report multiple sales of semi-automatic rifles. The proposal was included in the Federal Register and specifically calls for firearm retailers to report multiple sales, or other dispositions, of two or more .22 caliber or larger semi-automatic rifles that are capable of accepting a detachable magazine and are purchased by the same individual within five consecutive business days.\n \n \"It's not just the new rule gun advocates object to, it's the presumption that buying multiple guns is a questionable activity that ought to be monitored,\" said Rehberg, a member of the Second Amendment Task Force. \"We cross a line when the federal government starts keeping tabs on citizens who are exercising their Constitutional rights in a completely legal manner. This isn't about partisanship or politics - this is about standing up for liberty.\"\n \n Unlike previous efforts to register firearm purchases, this emergency information request can be implemented without any congressional action whatsoever.\n \n \"This effort by the ATF will do nothing to address the crime and violence in Mexico. Blaming law-abiding Americans for these problems is wrong,\" said Chris Cox, executive director for the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action. \"NRA supports legitimate efforts to stop criminal activity, but we will not stand idle while our Second Amendment is sacrificed for politics.\"\n \n The text of the full letter is below:\n \n Dear Mr. President:\n \n We write to you today regarding the emergency request from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that was published in the Federal Register on Friday December 17th, 2010. As you know, this request asks the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to approve an information collection that would require federally licensed firearm dealers to report the sales of two or more semiautomatic rifles to the same customer within a five-day period.\n \n Despite the institution of a 60-day public comment period on this change, the ATF intends to begin collecting this information as soon as January 5, 2011. We are strongly opposed to this request by the ATF, and to any further efforts to regulate the sale of firearms through emergency notices and paperwork changes that have not been properly vetted by Congress or by the affected public.\n \n Implementing the ATF's proposal would subject firearms dealers and their customers to new, onerous requirements that would inevitably track and catalogue the purchases of law-abiding gun owners. And while Congress has authorized multiple sales reporting for handguns, we have never extended this authority to other types of firearms. Expanding this power by executive decree would be an end run around Congress.\n \n Under current law, the ATF already has extensive powers to inspect the sales records of firearms dealers and investigate suspicious transactions. We encourage your Administration to reconsider this ill-conceived change to the reporting requirements, and instead utilize the ATF's existing authority to ensure that firearms dealers are in compliance with the law.\n \n Sincerely,\n",

   "Yes I do. Make \"straw purchasing\" a felony under federal law with \n mandatory prison time and require all firearm sales to go through a FFL.\n \n Three Border States \"Export\" Crime Guns at Much Higher Rates\n \n The figures on the previous page may not tell the whole story, because states with larger populations are expected to be the source of larger numbers of Mexican crime guns. Therefore, to identify which states are a source of a disproportionately large number of Mexican crime guns, this report controls for population. Using population as a control makes it possible to determine the rate at which states supply or \"export\" guns that are recovered in Mexican crimes.\n While proximity to the border appears to be a major factor affecting which states are top sources, controlling for population reveals that even among the Southwest border states, certain states export crime guns to Mexico at disproportionately higher rates. Three of the border states - Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas - each have export rates at least 169% greater than any other state and more than three times as high as the fourth border state, California.\n These differences in export rates to Mexico among the four border states may reflect differences in the way those states regulate guns: California, which has the lowest export rate, has adopted several regulations that Arizona, New Mexico and Texas have not. ATF agents have said that Arizona's and Texas' laws make it easy to buy guns for smuggling to the cartels, while California's do not.\n \n http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/downloads/pdf/issue_brief_mexico_2010.pdf\n\n \n Interesting you would stoop so low as to quote a criminal enterprise.

   "The Heckler and Koch is the Mexican Military and governments' adopted weapon of choice.\n \n Seems the HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES are all complaints against the government and not the drug dealers nor the people.\n \n Heckler & Koch probed over Mexico arms sales - The Local - m.thelocal.de\n \n H&K has an export license to Mexico, the government! Duly approved by the German government. Like the U.N. treaty calls for no matter if the government is tyrannical which always happens if only the government is armed. They don't export to drug cartels.\n \n Hillary protests the rogue government which our own government has armed these federales, police and Mexican branches of government and protests their \"human rights abuses\". Instead of blaming their own actions, they attempt to hide the truth and blame our rights and our gunshops to take the eye off of the truth. We have plenty of our own HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES from these actions ourselves; still unproven but promoted by rogue organizations and rogue government officials.",
