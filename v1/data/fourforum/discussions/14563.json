   "Romans 1.18-32 in the New King James Version says:\n \n \n18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 19 because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. 20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, 21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man-and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things. \n 24 Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, 25 who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. \n 26 For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. 27 Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due. \n 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; 29 being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, 30 backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; 32 who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them. \n- thanks to BibleGateway.com\n \n Same sex marriage has been in the news lately. It's homosexuality, which according to the Bible, is an abomination. It is sin and wickedness. There is nothing good that can be said about same sex realationships, except to say that it is symptom of a greater problem. \n \n Our Bible text says that the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against who? Against those who practice ungodliness and unrighteousness. Those that suppress the truth in unrighteousness. The text goes on to say that they are without excuse because God is clearly revealed in creation.\n \n Sometimes I sit here and watch the squirrels outside my window. I see how meticulous they are as they get ready for the winter. And then to see their coat fluff up as it get's colder. I see the insects busy doing the things they do, like the bees polinating the plants. I see the trees come to life in the spring, and die in the fall as winter approaches, except the evergreens. And I am mindful of the fact that God created all of it. By looking at creation you can know that God is. And whenever I have any doubts, I just look at creation. Sometimes near sunset I go to a park and listen to the birds as they sing. There is no greater symphony than the sounds of God's creation. Verse 20 of our text says, \"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.\" So God has made himself evident in the the things that we see in creation.\n \n Even though God has made Himself evident, the people being talked about in the text, eventhough they know by the things that are made, they ignore Him. And, look at this. Verse 23 of the text states that they, \"changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man-and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.\" Verse 25 says, \"who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.\" This is called \"idolatry.\" So the greater problem is idolatry. \n \n What is the result of this idolatry? Verses 26 & 27 states, \"For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.\" The result of idolarty is God gave them up to \"vile passions.\" In other words, homosexuality. And, according to verse 28, He \"gave them over to a debased mind,\" to do all kinds of wickedness and sin, who doing such wickedness and sin, and those who give approval to those who practice such are deserving of death. \n \n Now, how is this a message to America? Simple, America is an idolatrous nation. The church in America is an idolatrous church. America and the churches in America celebrate Christmas and Easter, which are idolatry. \n \n There are a list of sins toward the end of our text. One is covetousness, another is envy, and another is pride. Put them together and you get the worst case of greed imaginable. Let me tell you, I do not want to be near a woman when she's inflicted with these three, and she looks in the mirror and sees her first gray hair. The first thing she does is shriek, \"AH - A GRAY HAIR!!!!\" emoticon_ic She falls into a depression, emoticon_cry and calls her employer and says she can't make it today, \"I'm not feeling well.\" Then she immediatley runs out to the store to get a bottle of dye. Then when her hair turns purple, she runs to a beauty parlor and pays a hundred dollars to get it fixed. Then she goes home, curls up in a chair watching soap operas, and pouts the rest of the day. emoticon_emb Then her husband comes home not knowing what had happened that day, and says, \"Honey, how was your day?\" I would not want to be that guy. She screams, \"YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND!!!!!\" emoticon_smile\n \n Husbands, if that ever happens to you, get out of the house, get in your car, and just go. Get a motel room for a couple days. It might be safe to go home then. \n \n The problem with writing, and you not seeing me tell this story in public, is you don't hear the voice inflexion, and the humor in my voice. I think you see the point though.\n \n That is called vanity. And men are getting just as vain these days. Did you ever see that commercial where a good looking bottle blond comes to the door and asks for some milk? The guy becomes Superman. He jumps out the window, onto a truck or bus, gets to the store and picks up, \"Just For Men,\" and a gallon of milk. He gets rid of the gray hair, and comes to the door with the milk, all in 30 seconds. \n \n Americans are obsessed with appearance, and with the accumulation of things. Guys have to have a new sports car to impress the ladies. And she has to be Pamela Anderson, not Phylis Diller. Gals have to put tons of make-up on to atrract George Clooney. Us homely guys don't have a chance. And when the guys find their Pamela Anderson, and the gals find their George Clooney, they get married and experience fire and brimstone on earth. \n \n But greed doesn't just show up in pursuit of that \"perfect\" relationship. It shows up in American business practices too. There's a company that has a profit of 4 billion dollars per year, and still find the need [or the greed] to raise their rates. And, if you make a 4000 dollar loan to buy an old car, you wind up paying closer to 8000 dollars back because interest and other fees. It's in sports too. What baseball player is worth 10 million dollars per year? For that amount of money, Ryan Howard should hit 20 home runs every week, and guarantee that he will never get hurt. \n \n Greed shows up in every aspect of American life, including religion. Tell me why a church has to build a 27 million dollar building, complete with a volleyball/basketball court, and a swimming pool. And look at all the books being sold in the name of religion. And their are singers who get paid a lot of money to sing gospel music. And the price of Bibles go from 20 - 120 dollars, and maybe more by now. Then there's the sales of cruises and trips to Israel. Religion in America has become a multi-billion dollar industry. Jesus once cleared the money-changers out of the temple, and I think He should do it again.\n \n I could go on and on about the wickedness and sin in America, but I believe I made my point. How can we expect God to bless America with all this wickedness and sin in her?\n \n What do you think?\n \n emoticon_xhoho - cheers",

   "I agree with you on the money thing, but I think Romans refers to lust, the narrow pursuit of sexual pleasure at the expense of emotional relationships with a partner. I don't see a connection between men having adulterous relationships with other men because they're horny, and a long term committed, monogamous relationship between two men which may not even involve sex. \n \n I'm also not really seeing how the celebration of birth and resurrection of Our Lord and Saviour are idolatrous. Certainly there are distractions that have grown up around the celebrations, but I don't think the celebrations themselves are wrong.",

What is quoted as scripture, the inerrant word of God for some and close enough for most is made for its readers to be what they want it to be. \n \n If you go back and look at revisions and the meanings of words much of what is now directed at homosexuality was attributed to other acts consistent with Jewish law. Adultery, rape, lewd acts, promiscuity, etc all things that even today are thought a detriment to a productive stable society. \n \n So where is God? If we acknowledge he is the creator of all things, and there is a purpose for all things, then one must wonder at that purpose as nothing man has written in the Bible fits with the reality of this world. He does not interfere for some reason, he permits his words to be lost, he waits for some unknown reason while his creation is overwhelmed by his God given faults.\n \n I think our first problem is believing that uneducated fisherman who could neither read nor write and are portrayed as incompetent did not carry on the legacy very well. The subsequent leadership having such notable acts as murdering each other, running the largest bordello in history and having the remains of your predecessor exhumed, put on trial, found guilty and then thrown in a river should have some questioning how reliable they were as caretakers.",

In a body of water, each droplet of water is the same as the other. They each behave exactly the same as directed by the laws of Nature. You can't have equal portions of vinegar, bleach and water and call it pure water.\n \n Even if you say each individual is a 'separate' member of the body, each member will behave the way the head directs it to - if the head tells you killing is wrong, you can't have the right hand say it's okay sometimes and the other hand say it's always wrong.\n \n If I want to walk a straight line, my right foot will not stay put while the left steps forward. They will do as directed by my head.\n \n Otherwise, jesus and his body look and behave like this:\n http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b189/Sandycane/dr-strangelove.jpg\n Actually, that's a pretty good name for the god described in the bible - Strangelove!",

   "Romans 1.18-32 in the New King James Version says:\n \n - thanks to BibleGateway.com\n \n Same sex marriage has been in the news lately. It's homosexuality, which according to the Bible, is an abomination. It is sin and wickedness. There is nothing good that can be said about same sex realationships, except to say that it is symptom of a greater problem. \n \n Our Bible text says that the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against who? Against those who practice ungodliness and unrighteousness. Those that suppress the truth in unrighteousness. The text goes on to say that they are without excuse because God is clearly revealed in creation.\n \n Sometimes I sit here and watch the squirrels outside my window. I see how meticulous they are as they get ready for the winter. And then to see their coat fluff up as it get's colder. I see the insects busy doing the things they do, like the bees polinating the plants. I see the trees come to life in the spring, and die in the fall as winter approaches, except the evergreens. And I am mindful of the fact that God created all of it. By looking at creation you can know that God is. And whenever I have any doubts, I just look at creation. Sometimes near sunset I go to a park and listen to the birds as they sing. There is no greater symphony than the sounds of God's creation. Verse 20 of our text says, \"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.\" So God has made himself evident in the the things that we see in creation.\n \n Even though God has made Himself evident, the people being talked about in the text, eventhough they know by the things that are made, they ignore Him. And, look at this. Verse 23 of the text states that they, \"changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man-and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.\" Verse 25 says, \"who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.\" This is called \"idolatry.\" So the greater problem is idolatry. \n \n What is the result of this idolatry? Verses 26 & 27 states, \"For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.\" The result of idolarty is God gave them up to \"vile passions.\" In other words, homosexuality. And, according to verse 28, He \"gave them over to a debased mind,\" to do all kinds of wickedness and sin, who doing such wickedness and sin, and those who give approval to those who practice such are deserving of death. \n \n Now, how is this a message to America? Simple, America is an idolatrous nation. The church in America is an idolatrous church. America and the churches in America celebrate Christmas and Easter, which are idolatry. \n \n There are a list of sins toward the end of our text. One is covetousness, another is envy, and another is pride. Put them together and you get the worst case of greed imaginable. Let me tell you, I do not want to be near a woman when she's inflicted with these three, and she looks in the mirror and sees her first gray hair. The first thing she does is shriek, \"AH - A GRAY HAIR!!!!\" emoticon_ic She falls into a depression, emoticon_cry and calls her employer and says she can't make it today, \"I'm not feeling well.\" Then she immediatley runs out to the store to get a bottle of dye. Then when her hair turns purple, she runs to a beauty parlor and pays a hundred dollars to get it fixed. Then she goes home, curls up in a chair watching soap operas, and pouts the rest of the day. emoticon_emb Then her husband comes home not knowing what had happened that day, and says, \"Honey, how was your day?\" I would not want to be that guy. She screams, \"YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND!!!!!\" emoticon_smile\n \n Husbands, if that ever happens to you, get out of the house, get in your car, and just go. Get a motel room for a couple days. It might be safe to go home then. \n \n The problem with writing, and you not seeing me tell this story in public, is you don't hear the voice inflexion, and the humor in my voice. I think you see the point though.\n \n That is called vanity. And men are getting just as vain these days. Did you ever see that commercial where a good looking bottle blond comes to the door and asks for some milk? The guy becomes Superman. He jumps out the window, onto a truck or bus, gets to the store and picks up, \"Just For Men,\" and a gallon of milk. He gets rid of the gray hair, and comes to the door with the milk, all in 30 seconds. \n \n Americans are obsessed with appearance, and with the accumulation of things. Guys have to have a new sports car to impress the ladies. And she has to be Pamela Anderson, not Phylis Diller. Gals have to put tons of make-up on to atrract George Clooney. Us homely guys don't have a chance. And when the guys find their Pamela Anderson, and the gals find their George Clooney, they get married and experience fire and brimstone on earth. \n \n But greed doesn't just show up in pursuit of that \"perfect\" relationship. It shows up in American business practices too. There's a company that has a profit of 4 billion dollars per year, and still find the need [or the greed] to raise their rates. And, if you make a 4000 dollar loan to buy an old car, you wind up paying closer to 8000 dollars back because interest and other fees. It's in sports too. What baseball player is worth 10 million dollars per year? For that amount of money, Ryan Howard should hit 20 home runs every week, and guarantee that he will never get hurt. \n \n Greed shows up in every aspect of American life, including religion. Tell me why a church has to build a 27 million dollar building, complete with a volleyball/basketball court, and a swimming pool. And look at all the books being sold in the name of religion. And their are singers who get paid a lot of money to sing gospel music. And the price of Bibles go from 20 - 120 dollars, and maybe more by now. Then there's the sales of cruises and trips to Israel. Religion in America has become a multi-billion dollar industry. Jesus once cleared the money-changers out of the temple, and I think He should do it again.\n \n I could go on and on about the wickedness and sin in America, but I believe I made my point. How can we expect God to bless America with all this wickedness and sin in her?\n \n What do you think?\n \n emoticon_xhoho - cheers\n\n \n All you have said is some myth and nothing more. I could point to several Gods that are just as valid as the hate filled monster you drag up from a book of Jewish fairy tales. You hate filled Jewish fairytale book of myths has no place in the laws of a secular nation were ALL religion and no religion are equal and your God is just as equal under the law as any other god or no god.",

It is perfectly possible for people of equal intelligence to disagree about something, and even for one to be right and the other wrong. The thing is, when you discuss something, you have to actually convince others that you are right, it is not enough to just call them stupid.\n \n I see no reason to believe that God does not value speaking in tongues equally with a Quaker meeting and with a Tridentine mass as sincere forms of worship that glorify His name. The Bible records God speaking to people with tongues of fire, but also in the silence, and also through devout ritual action. We see from the variety in creation that God loves and appreciates difference and diversity. Being able to have this within one church organisation would be fantastic, and indeed you do get this level of variation within some denominations; but you haven't answered my previous question: given that people sincerely disagree sufficiently to make the daily functionning of their churches difficult, what is your solution?",

Certainly knowing the truth and rejecting it is to reject Christ, but to honestly believe something to be the truth and turn out to be mistaken? I don't think so. The church is made up of 2 billion people, most of whom honestly and sincerely believe the denomination of which they are apart is either the correct or the best guess at what God wants. I don't know of anyone who thinks another denomination is right and sticks with a different one anyway. I'm inclined to think that there are things of value to God in every denomination, just as there are things that are not of God, just as there were in the early church, just as there were among the disciples themselves.

If that hadn't been the case then Queen Mary's return to Rome would have stuck, but it didn't, or Edward's hard line protestantism would have stuck, but it didn't. God has a strange way of using human actions to produce something new. From the corruption of the mediaeval Catholic church he inspired Luther to reform it; which both produced new ways of serving God and eventually helped the Catholic church renew itself. Methodism and Quakerism and Baptistry and Presbyterianism expanded our understanding of God and our relationship with Him. From so many failings and corruptions in the church, God has produced a new flowering of faith and worship. The Second Vatican council introduced mass in local languages, because protestantism had shown the Catholic church how important it was for the members of the church to understand what was going on, and to take a personal journey of faith, rather than just regurgitating the catechism. Catholicism gave Anglicanism an appreciation for the value of religious orders, and many were founded in the 19th century. Quakerism reminded the church of the importance of social justice.",

Instead, prophecy occurs by those moved by the Holy Spirit.\n \n ...We can easily see that the Old Testament Scriptures are full of statements and phrases claiming to be the Word of God.\n \n \"Thus says the Lord\" occurs 418 times in the NASB, 413 in the KJV \n Exodus 4:22, \"Then you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says the Lord, 'Israel is My son, My first-born.'\" \n 1 Kings 11:31, \"And he said to Jeroboam, 'Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and give you ten tribes.'\" \n Isaiah 7:7, \"thus says the Lord God, 'It shall not stand nor shall it come to pass.'\" \n \"God said\" occurs 46 times in both the NASB and the KJV \n Genesis 1:3, \"Then God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light.\" \n Exodus 3:14, \"And God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM'; and He said, \"Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.\" \n Exodus 6:2-3, \"God spoke further to Moses and said to him, 'I am the Lord; and I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name, Lord, I did not make Myself known to them.'\"\n God spoke through prophets \n 1 Kings 14:18, \"And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the Lord which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet.\" \n 2 Sam. 24:11-12, \"When David arose in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, 12 'Go and speak to David, Thus the Lord says, \"I am offering you three things; choose for yourself one of them, which I may do to you.\"'\" \n Zech. 7:7, \"Are not these the words which the Lord proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\" \n The Spirit of the Lord spoke through people \n 2 Sam. 23:2, \"The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and His word was on my tongue.\" \n 1 Kings 22:24, \"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, 'How did the Spirit of the Lord pass from me to speak to you?'\" \n 2 Chron. 20:14-15, \"Then in the midst of the assembly the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite of the sons of Asaph; 15 and he said, 'Listen, all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat: thus says the Lord to you, Do not fear or be dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours but God's.'\" \n \n As you can see, the Old Testament Scriptures are clearly full of statements showing the inspiration of God through the writers. The Old Testament assumes and speaks from the perspective of divine inspiration. Should we do any less?\n \n Same thing in the New Testament.\n \n Is the Bible inspired? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry",

   "Inspired does not mean inerrant. The Bible came to us through human minds and human hands. God does not force perfection on his people. It's also not clear whether Timothy refers to just the Old Testament, the Old Testament and the Apocrpyha, or the whole Bible, given that a fair chunk of the New Testament post-dates the writing of Timothy.",

   "No-one I've met claims that God wrote the Bible. The traditionally believed authors are named in the title of most of the books in the New Testament. Some people believe that God guided the writing and compilation of the Bible such that it is inerrant, but I see no reason to support that view.\n\n Then you have never heard of Southern Baptists? Who believe the bible to be the inerrant, inspired WoG? (As EZ has explained so thoroughly)?\n So, you agree with this?: So, it's okay with god that humans actually created the book known as the bible and claim that he is the author?\n \n \nSo how do you decide if it is ok to divorce, or have an abortion? \nemoticon_frazzled Ummm, you use your brain and make an informed decision based on the Golden Rule.\n \nWhat if God really does disapprove of having women or gay people lead the church, should the church just ignore what God wants to fit in with secular law? \n emoticon_rolleyes What if god really hates the color purple? Golden Rule: if women pastors and gay people aren't hurting anyone leave them the hell alone.\n \nWhat about IVF? Or organ donation? Contraception? All of these have and continue to cause disagreements, and the 10 commandments and the golden rule don't help on their own. Is abortion murder? Is IVF (when some embryos are not used)? What about contraception? At what point do these break the 6th commandment?\n\n Golden Rule. Golden Rule. Golden Rule. Golden Rule.\n Sheesh. Why do you religious folk require a higher authority (ie your church) to tell you how to live? \n \n \nHow far do you go in keeping the sabbath? If you try hanging out laundry on a Sunday in the Western Isles, you're going to be in trouble; in Israel they have automatic doors and lights so people don't have to use a door or a light switch on a Saturday. How far is too far? What allows you to break the Sabbath observance?\nAll ridiculous and unimportant life decisions created to confuse the religious.\n \n I hang my laundry on nice sunny days. ;)",

   "2 Tim. 3:16-17 says, \"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17 that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.\" Paul who wrote this epistle was obviously referring to the entirety of the Old Testament as being inspired. The word \"inspired\" is literally \"God-breathed.\" This is an interesting phrase, since it implies that the Scriptures are from the mouth of God. \n\n \n Boy, you like to quote mine, don't you. Why don't you do the rest of the paragraph?? let's actually LOOK at it, why don't we, so we see what it ACTUALLY says.\n \n You forgot the '3:15  And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n \n Now, what scripture would Timothy know from a child??

   "God doesn't have to be angry. He chastens whom He loves.\n\n So god punishes people \"whom he loves\". You \"god\" punishes the wicked and the righteous with absolute impartiality. \n \n \nI will explain it this way. When you remove the influence of good from a people, that leaves them to their own devices, and the influence of evil, then you will reap the benefits. Those benefits include: abortion, homosexuality, greed, murders of all types, rape, etc. \n\n These \"benefits\" have existed in conjunction with \"the influence of good\" rather than existed instead of it. History does not lie. Civilizations have risen and fallen both in influence of good and influence of evil. Clearly \"god\" is not the deciding factor. Just because we all know the story of Rome does not mean that every civilization that has fallen has done so after \"turning it's back on god\". \n \n \nIf God wanted to, He could raise up people from other countries to fly planes into buildings.\n\n Who is Allah, Alex? Great, I'll take 'things a terrorist god would do' for $1600 Alex.\n \n \n He causes earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes. God is in control of the weather.\n\n Then call him up and tell him not to ruin my vacation in Rodanthe in 2 weeks. \n \n -But seriously, we know the causes of these things now. We don't have to blame them on god anymore. But for arguments sake, let's just say god does control these things...are you really contending that god will kill and injure and terrorize people indiscriminately all over the planet to punish a few wicked people among us? Grow up and stop believing in fairy tales. There is no reason why in the year 2010 anyone with at least a 3rd grade eduction should be able to honestly believe that god controls the weather or natural events like earthquakes or volcanos. \n \n \nThe stiff-necked people of this country just do not want to hear the truth.\n\n Maybe the stiff-necked people see the and hear the truth quite well, maybe it's just not your truth. Neither you nor the \"stiff-necked\" people can prove the validity of their truth...yet you see yourself and people like you as superior. That's kinda twisted. That's why we thought the Nazi's were bad people. \n \n \nFor example, conservatives don't want to hear the truth of the Middle East. The real reason we went to war with Iraq. The fact is, the oil barrons of this country and of the UK, do not want a stable Middle East. Can you just imagine a United Arab world, which is what Saddam Hussein wanted. That's why he had to go. A united Arab world controling the oil that flows out of their countries. Imagine that. So the UK and the US has been keeping the Mid East unstable. That's why, in 1948, they put Israel right in the middle of the Arab world. That was sure to keep instablility in the Mid East for a long time. There's the premise for all that we have done in the Mid East for the last 70 years, if not longer.\n\n The ME has always been unstable. Ever heard of the Crusades? Iran/Iraq, Russo-Afghan, Chechnya? Anything like that ring a bell? We had to beat Saddam back out of Kuwait in 90-91' with a large multi-national coalition after he tried to annex a neighbor! Fair to say that the ME is plenty unstable without our intervention, not because of it. \n \n \nWe can't have a real godly influence in this country. If we did, the truth would come out, and the people would not stand for what our government does.\n\n I know many atheists who not only do not stand for what out government is or does, but actually do something about it too. You don't need god to know that our government sucks. You need to know the people of the country who elected that government. \n \n \n So, we need a religion that will not make waves - enter the religious right - with guys like Jerry Falwell. So, then the religious people became fat, dumb and happy, and did not question the government. Those that do will be considered as krazy. \n\n Wonder why?
