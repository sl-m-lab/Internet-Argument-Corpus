   "Do you not think that Lincoln had a right to fortify federal property? (though I do understand that all but one fort had been vacated)*\n\n \n To have a military force within succeed land, no. This fort was right next to a port, which was intented of enforcing customs (ie tariffs)--which Lincoln suggested he would get no matter what. \n \n If one considers the union legally desolved in the south, which I happen to believe to be true, then there's no reason to have a military presence within the south. \n \n \n \nI recall the 'members of a club' argument by Southerners. They argued that they voluntarily joined this club; the United States of America, and accordingly, should they no longer wish to remain, they should be allowed to leave, and perhaps form another club.\n\n \n \n Well, this is what happened with the Constitution. It wasn't properly ratified when acted upon, according to the Articles of Confederation, ( which was the greatest law of that time). In essence they succeed from a pact. It's ironic that people will admonish a group of individuals from relieving themselves of a pact, when they got there in a similiar manner. \n \n \n \nI do believe however it would have been difficult for a nation to remain half free and half slave.\n\n \n Here's some things I read on slavery, (take them for what they're worth):\n \n *For one thing, the Fugitive Slave Act socialized the enforcement costs of slavery, thereby artificially inflating slave prices. Abolition of the Act, as would have been the reality had the Southern states been allowed to leave in peace would have caused slave prices to plummet and quickened the institution's demise.\n \n *That, coupled with a serious effort to do what every nation on the face of the earth did to end slavery during the nineteenth century - compensated emancipation - could have ended slavery peacefully. Great Britain did it in just six years time, and Americans could have followed their lead.\n \n * Of course slavery was profitable to slave owners. This government-supported system helped them confiscate the fruits of the slaves' labor. But since slave labor is inherently less efficient than free labor, and since so many resources had to be devoted to enforcing the system - most of which were the result of government interventions such as the Fugitive Slave Act, mandatory slave patrol laws, and laws that prohibited manumission - the system imposed huge burdens (\"dead weight loss,\" in the language of economics) on the rest of society. Free laborers and non-slave owners in the South (at least 80 percent of the adult population) were the primary victims of these government-imposed costs, and would have been a natural political constituency for their eventual abolition. As Hummel concluded, \"In real terms, the entire southern economy, including both whites and blacks, was less prosperous\" overall because of slavery.\n \n \n \n \n \nI recall some speculation too, about what might have happened, had the Confederate States of American won. I can't recall the 'expert' but he suggested it was likely that the CSA would have annexed Mexico.\n\n \n haa...that would have been interesting.\n \n \n \n*I studied the \"Causes of the American Civil War\" in high school, and because we had a lousy education system - the state exam at the end of the year was on the \"Course of the American Civil War\"! (which no one in my school had studied - but that's another story). I like reading about the US, (and the English Civil Wars). I have the autobiographies of both Sherman and Grant (both Ohio men). My father was born in the mid-west, too (in Indiana), so by that basis alone I'd have to side with the north :)\n\n \n I guess it's just a piece of paper...\n \n Honestly, if I was a member of the Southern States, I would have done it differently. I would have highlighted the tariffs lack of constitutional grounds in the great compromise of 1833 (much less the constitution itself). At that point I would suggested a peaceful resistance of such tariffs, as they did in the past (with an underlining understanding that a military attack would be hightlight even more so as unconstitutional). Just as George Washington admitted in the Whiskey Rebellion.\n \n In other words, I would have let Lincoln have blood on his hands. I doubt he would have killed as many civilians as he did in the war (ie 50,000), and he would have made a mockery out of his party. And maybe then perhaps, he would have lost some of the 40% whom voted him into presidency. \n \n Although it's hard to speculate how extreme Lincoln would have got; perhaps he still would break way from habeus corpeus, unconstitutionally. Thus putting an unending amount of propaganda among the public, which still reigns to this day.\n \n I'm waiting for today's parties to make an *** out of themselves...just the same. \n \n \n \n Interesting fact about Sherman:\n \n General Sherman's chief engineer, Captain O.M. Poe, advised Sherman that the bombing of Atlanta was of no military significance since the Confederate army had evacuated. Sherman commenced destroying 90 percent of all the buildings in Atlanta, killing hundreds of civilians, and then evicted the remaining 2000 citizens from their homes just as winter was arriving. It was not \"modern war\" that did this, it was William Tecumseh Sherman with the endorsement and under the orders of the Lincoln administration.

Hood (opposing him in Atlanta). Hood attacks him for blasting at a civillian site, but Sherman claims that as it was 'fortified' it was a legit target. It's killing me that I don't have them at hand, because they make interesting reading.\n \n I do also recall that Sherman never admits to making any mistakes. Reading this contrasts to Grant's memoirs (also in Penguin Classics) as Grant comes across more human - for instance he recalls that when as a lad, he was given $22 to go to town to buy a horse.\n \n His dad basically tells him \"I want you to take this $22 and see if you can buy a horse for $18, if not $18, see if you can get one for $20, and if not $20, get one for $22.\"\n So, he goes into town and goes up to the horse dealer and says \"My dad gave me this $22 and to see if I can buy a horse for $18, if not $18, I'm to see if you can get one for $20, and if not $20, to get one for $22.\"\n And Grant concludes \"Naturally enough he ended up with a $22 horse\"",

But I know you'll fail miserably if you try, so don't bother.\n\n \n Man, you got THAT right as far as bothering, NOBODY could give you any proof that would contradict what you believe, you are too close-minded to see it\n \n \n \nI said see above and apply the same logic. You conveniently failed to do so then accused me on ignoring it. \n \n \n SEE ABOVE!! LOL YOU ignore Soros and that is JUST as much of a connection as this #1 supporter of Bush you refer to-hypocrite\n \n \nProve that I have seen the ad. I also HAVE stated in the politics section that the exxergation is far fetched, but not entirely false. \n \n \n LMAO you sound like a child, I can come back with \"prove that you DIDN'T see it\" Nice try though. And as far as the latter point, you cannot bring yourself to admit when the Libs are wrong, and that makes YOU a bleeding heart Lib\n \n \nDo you really think anyone believes you?\n\n\n \n Unlike you, who requires others to validate his beliefs, I don't care if anyone else believes me",

   "And ya know what? If the Liberterian could win, I'd vote for him in a heartbeat. See, despite my toouting that Conservatives have integrity and principles and Liberals don't, Liberals HAVE shown some solidarity and that's how they win. SO, in order to win, I feel my vote for a Liberterian is a total waste. As much as you WISH I would vote for a Liberterian, I'm sorry to disappoint you, and I sure pray that other Conservatives feel the same way.\n\n \n Exactly why I'm not voting Nader. He CAN'T win. I don't really care how you are going to vote. 1 popular vote won't chance anything, however, you need to realize that Bush is not conservative and that his polices are very similar to Kerry's. \n \n \nAnd since you seem to be more knowledgeable about Presidential history, what separated Ike from Reagan?\n\n \n The word conservatism and virtually everything that belongs to it. \n \n [quote]I agree with you on the fiscally Conservative policies, but your plea for stronger alliances sends out an alarm to me. We DO have strong alliances, just not the ones of the past, and for Liberals this is a terrible blow. PLUS, Liberals don't have the confidence to go it alone when need be and therefore place TOO much emphasis on alliances[/qupte]\n \n What strong alliances? We bribed, blackmailed, and threatend 99% of the colation of the coerced. Only Britain is our ally, and even there the popular vote is aganist America. Heck, throughout our Arab allies, dislike of the US is reaching 80% or higher! What we have is hired countries, not allies. Strong alliances was major part of the conservative platform in the past, but it is no longer. So in reality, you aren't supporting conservatism, but are ALARMED by it. \n \n \nMan, you got THAT right as far as bothering, NOBODY could give you any proof that would contradict what you believe, you are too close-minded to see it\n\n \n Are you saying that Kerry did NOT condemn moveon.org? You haven't given any proof. The fact that you are ignoring 2 of the #1 employees of Bush in the past, along with one of his largest donators is quite alarming. Even if his entire cabinet was in their ranks you wouldn't say Bush was collabortating in the slightest. \n \n \nYOU ignore Soros and that is JUST as much of a connection as this #1 supporter of Bush you refer to-hypocrite\n\n \n What do you not understand about apply the same logic? I didn't say Kerry wasn't collabortating. In fact by saying to apply the same logic, Kerry COULD be collabortating, however where you only 1 link, I have three. \n \n \nI can come back with \"prove that you DIDN'T see it\" Nice try though. \n\n \n Do you understand the concept of using proof to back statments up? \n \n \nYOU a bleeding heart Lib\n\n \n See, This is why all people who disagree with the rank and file notions of the republican party are liberals. You have JUST shown my original asseration to be 100% true. Disagree with the Republican rank and file notions, and YOU WILL BE LABELED A LIBERAL. I bet you don't even KNOW what liberal means. \n \n \nUnlike you, who requires others to validate his beliefs, I don't care if anyone else believes me\n\n \n Well...you won't be bothered when no one does. \n \n \nNot responding to a post isn't always an admission of defeat, in fact it seldom is, especially posts that have your brand of arrogance and name calling. Ignoring a post can make a statement. These forums couldn't exist if everyone here childishly insisted on having the last word in most debates that they get involved in.\n\n \n Yes it is. Running away from direct challenges and refutations of your claims IS admission of defeat. That you have done MANY times here. Ignoring a post that challenges you to prove what you say is a sign of cowardice and defeat. Ignoring a post that refutes everything you have claimed is a sign of cowardice and defeat. These forums couldn't exist is people like you ran away like a crying child everytime they were prove wrong. I proved that you couldn't disprove the EPA. I proved that Rush was indeed a liar. I proved that your claims on homosexuality were false. I proved you couldn't refute anything I said. You simply ran away. \n \n \n\n Your complete oblivion of the above isn't your most serious problem however. Are you aware that there are rules for posting here, and how you break them? It would be nice if you'd check them out, and focus on them at least half as much as you do all your little obscure Bush-hate links.\n\n \n You're just as guilty. Bush hate links? PROVE IT. BUT I KNOW YOU CAN'T PROVE A SINGLE THING YOU SAY HERE SO JUST DON'T BOTHER TRYING WHEN YOU WILL FAIL.",

   "I think another perspective may be Authoritarian and non-Authoritarian. Liberals usually advocate social freedoms (non-Authoritarian). They tend to favor fewer drug laws. Many tend to want more authoritarian laws in regards to businesses. \n \n While Conservatives typically favor fewer laws regarding businesses, they tend to favor authoritarian laws concerning personal conduct. \n \n Libertarians (the Libertarian Party at least) does not want regulations on business or behavior with a couple caveats. We favor the prosecution of people that use force or fraud. Other than that, we want the government out of our lives.\n \n Authoritarians are at the other end of the spectrum. They want the government to regulate all aspects of our lives (business and personal).",
