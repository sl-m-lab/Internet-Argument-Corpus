   "I was wondering how married people got all the rights that married people enjoy via the government in the first place? How did this happen? Over time? Why did this happen? \n \n The only reason I could see the government handing out benefits, is because they needed more people to partner up and marry for some reason.\n \n Does anyone have any factual answers that make sense as to why they get the benefits they get? \n \n I think going back to how things got started is a good place to look but haven't found any answers.",

I think that when these systems were being set up, there was(is) the mentality that a married couple is a family and that the \"rights\" of a married couple are the same rights as that of blood relations.\n \n What's going on now with the gay marriage stuff is simply to get their marriage to be legally recognized so that they can have certian \"rights\" when it comes to things like social security and inheritance, etc.",
