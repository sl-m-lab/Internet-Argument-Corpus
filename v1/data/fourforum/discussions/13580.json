   "Everybody knows that Obama promised to close Guantanamo prison and he'll fulfill this promise except that there is no new place for prisoners. Well, by some source which can't be disclosed here became known that CIA in association with Pentagon is set to place some part of Guantanamo terrorism suspects in Uzbekistan. \n There are no doubts that this policy will lead to stirring up of Central Asian terrorists' organizations activity. Uzbekistan itself is going to stay prime target of Muslim terrorists! IMHO CIA prisons in Central Asia are huge challenge to regional security.",
