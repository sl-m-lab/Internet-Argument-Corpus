   "Alright, let me come back to the militia discussion again. I want to offer my opinion on the individual RKBA, how I believe it came to be recognized in the 2nd.Amendment by our Founders, and whether the right is dependent upon militia service. Agree or disagree as you will&#8230;. \n \n To start with, I believe the phrase: &#8220;A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state&#8221; is merely a statement of principle. That is, to best secure liberty we should rely upon a militia and not have a standing army.\n \n I believe that when our nation was founded there was uniform public agreement with this principle. Every state constitution of the time contained this principle. For example, Virginia&#8217;s Constitution stated it this way: &#8221;That standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty.\" (Constitution of Virginia, June 6, 1776). This is nothing more than a restatement of the 2nd. Amendment&#8217;s militia clause&#8212;that a militia and not a standing army is necessary to secure a free state. In both instances the language does not recognize or qualify a right but merely states the principle.\n \n Now I believe you cannot read the 2nd. Amendment in a vacuum. Unlike all the state constitutions, the federal Constitution contained no similar statement of militia preference over standing armies until the 2nd. Amendment was ratified. This was a real issue, particularly when you also consider the other compromises made in our Constitution. There was, for example, another interest which competed with the preference for militias&#8212;the very real need for an effective national defense force. On this point the Federalists had their way with the Constitution. Look for a moment at the federal Constitution&#8217;s broad grant of Congressional authority over both a standing army and the state militias (Art. I sec. 8):\n \n To raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years;\n To provide and maintain a navy;\n To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces;\n To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;\n To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress\n \n Consider also the constitutional grant of power to the president over both the army and the militias (Art. II sec. 2):\n \n The President shall be the commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States&#8230;.\n \n This was how the federal Constitution was presented to the people for ratification (and indeed it was ratified with these federal powers). Note again that while all of the state constitutions of the time maintained a public policy preference for militias over standing armies (similar to what I quoted from Virginia)&#8212;the federal Constitution was silent on this issue. Anti-federalists would not let the issue rest: \n \n \"It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.\" John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)\n \n The militia clause of the 2nd. Amendment is nothing more than a formal acceptance of truth contained in DeWitt&#8217;s argument. A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state&#8212;a state in which the citizen need not fear the ambitions of a would-be military tyrant. \n \n So what then did our founders believe was the best way to reach that goal? A tremendous point of contention with the proposed federal Constitution was the Article I grant of authority to Congress to arm the militias. Hamilton, for example, argued that if you wanted to see this public policy goal become reality then you must give Congress the power to make the militias a credible alternative to a standing army, including the ability to prescribe uniform arms, training, and discipline: \n \n \"This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress.\" Alexander Hamilton, Federalist #29. (note how Hamilton is actually quoting the language of Article I)\n \n Here Hamilton hits on a key weakness against the discredited collective &#8220;state&#8217;s right&#8221; interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment that Saul Cornell so cherished. If the 2nd. Amendment was intended to create a state&#8217;s right, then by its very nature it destroys an efficient system of singular uniformity in favor of permitting the several states to arm their militias as they pleased, even to the point of making their weapons and equipment incompatible with one another. Surely even Saul Cornell can see that such a system would serve only to encourage Congress to abandon hope in an effective and uniformly equipped militia and rely instead upon a national standing army. \n \n Uniformity aside, however, a particular anti-federalist fear was that the grant of federal authority over the arming, equipping and disciplining of the militia would enable a federal tyrant to corrupt the militia and subvert its power to establish his rule. Hamilton ridiculed this fear and claimed the expressly reserved power of the states to appoint officers would prevent that fear from becoming reality: \n \n \"What reasonable cause of apprehension can be inferred from a power in the Union to prescribe regulations for the militia, and to command its services when necessary, while the particular States are to have the sole and exclusive appointment of the officers? If it were possible seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable establishment under the federal government, the circumstance of the officers being in the appointment of the States ought at once to extinguish it. There can be no doubt that this circumstance will always secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia.\" Id.\n \n Patrick Henry had a response for this, and that response exposes the fallacy of the collective &#8220;state&#8217;s right&#8221; interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment. Henry countered that even if the states could control the militia by appointment of officers, the &#8220;state&#8217;s right&#8221; to arm the militias did not and never could exist because of the Supremacy clause contained in Article VI of the federal Constitution: \n \n This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\n \n In other words, the Article 1 grant of power to arm the militias effectively denied that power to the states. This entirely denies the states the power, or &#8220;right&#8221;, to arm and equip the militias. \n \n And so Patrick Henry&#8217;s responds, correctly, by noting how Congress could create a situation in which there would be nothing left worth corrupting. Article I allows Congress to create a standing army and then proceed to destroy the state militias at its leisure simply by refusing to exercise its exclusive power to arm, train, and discipline them:\n \n \"Let me here call your attention to that part which gives the Congress power 'to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States &#8212; reserving to the states, respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.' By this, sir, you see that their control over our last and best defense is unlimited. If they neglect or refuse to discipline or arm our militia, they will be useless: the states can do neither &#8212; this power being exclusively given to Congress. The power of appointing officers over men not disciplined or armed is ridiculous; so that this pretended little remains of power left to the states may, at the pleasure of Congress, be rendered nugatory.\" Patrick Henry, Speech of June 5, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, beginning page 199, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum.\n \n And this is, indeed, the very power Congress continues to wield over the militia even today. \n \n And so we come to the problem the 2nd. Amendment &#8220;right to keep and bear arms&#8221; was designed to address. On paper the Constitution gave Congress a monopoly over arms, the true badges of liberty&#8212;and this was simply unacceptable to Anti-federalists. There were several ways to address this issue.\n \n 1st&#8212;The Founders could ignore the issue and hope that power was not abused. This they most certainly did not do. \n \n 2nd&#8212;The Founders could confess a collective &#8220;my bad&#8221; and amend Article I to take away Congress&#8217; power to arm the militias. But this approach destroyed the goal of uniformity that so many Federalists (including the 2nd. Amendment&#8217;s author, Madison) felt was necessary to maintain a credible reliance on the militia system. Article I was not amended to take that exclusive power to arm the militias away from Congress.\n \n 3rd&#8212;The Founders could create a concurrent state power to arm the militias. That is, to allow the states to also provide a stockpile of militia arms to be ready if the federal government refused to provide the arms necessary for the states to fight a federal tyrant and his standing federal army. During the constitutional debates some had already suggested that Article I at least implied a concurrent arming power&#8212;although few took the implication seriously in light of the unambiguous nature of the Supremacy Clause. Patrick Henry proposed to eliminate any doubt by actually rewriting Article I (before the Constitution itself was ratified) to both create and clearly protect a concurrent arming power: \n \n \"May we not discipline and arm them, as well as Congress, if the power be concurrent? so that our militia shall have two sets of arms, double sets of regimentals, &c.; and thus, at a very great cost, we shall be doubly armed. The great object is, that every man be armed. But can the people afford to pay for double sets of arms, &c.? Every one Who is able may have a gun. But we have learned, by experience, that, necessary as it is to have arms, and though our Assembly has, by a succession of laws for many years, endeavored to have the militia completely armed, it is still far from being the case. When this power is given up to Congress without limitation or bounds, how will your militia be afraid? You trust to chance; for sure I am that that nation which shall trust its liberties in other hands cannot long exist. If gentlemen are serious when they suppose a concurrent power, where can be the impolicy to amend it? Or, in other words, to say that Congress shall not arm or discipline them, till the states Shall have refused or neglected to do it? This is my object. I only wish to bring it to what they themselves say is implied. Implication is to be the foundation of our civil liberties; and when you speak of arming the militia by a concurrence of power, you use implication. But implication will not save you, when a strong army of veterans comes upon you. You would be laughed at by the whole world, for trusting your safety implicitly to implication.\" Patrick Henry Speech of June 14, 1778.\n \n And even more problems arise if you trust merely to implication. In the same speech Henry noted that if the powers are implied as concurrent, then what would prevent Congress from claiming concurrent power to appoint officers? Implied concurrent power was the path of confusion, and if concurrent power to arm the militias was to be the solution to the problem then the language needed to be specific. One way to accomplish this goal would be to amend Article I to give the states a concurrent arming power. This would have been the best way to accomplish this goal&#8212;Amend Article I, say it clearly, and be done with it. But we know this was not done. \n \n The other way would be to create a separate &#8220;states right&#8221; amendment to that effect. This is exactly what the collective &#8220;state&#8217;s right&#8221; interpretation suggests for the 2nd. Amendment. \n \n But the argument falls very short of reality. If you do not take away the Congressional power in Article I, then you have to contend with the Supremacy Clause denying that power to others. The only way to do that short of amending Article I would require you to be very specific in announcing this exception. And this is something the Founders knew very well how to do if they wanted to&#8212;as can be seen in how specifically they wrote the exception reserving the power to the states to appoint militia officers in Article I. Yet the Founders did not say in the 2nd. Amendment &#8220;the right of the states to keep and bear arms&#8221; or &#8220;the right of the states to concurrently arm the militias.&#8221; They instead wrote &#8220;the right of the people to keep and bear arms.&#8221; And on this very point which required such specificity Cornell and other collective &#8220;state&#8217;s right&#8221; devotees have argued, in effect, that the Founders committed a typographical error&#8212;that what they really meant to say was &#8220;the right of the states.&#8221; In other words, they ask us to accept their theory by trusting &#8220;implicitly to implication.&#8221; \n \n Is there any wonder then why the vote in Heller was 9-0 against the bankrupt collective &#8220;state&#8217;s right&#8221; view? \n \n And so we come to the fourth and final alternative. If you are unwilling to prevent the Congressional monopoly over arms by also giving a taste of that power to the states, then the only other source of arms must be with the people&#8212;flowing from the right that everyone agreed they already enjoyed independently of any requirement for militia service. Listen, our Founders were educated men, and as much as they may have scorned England their education was in the classical European style of the times, which included heavy doses of classical Greek writers. They all had the opportunity to read Aristotle:\n \n \"For those who can possess and wield arms are in a position to decide whether the constitution is to continue or not.\" Aristotle, Politics, T. Sinclair Trans. 1962, p. 274.\n \n And they knew they already had an individual RKBA which they inherited from England: \n \n The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall present mention, is that of having arms for their defense, suitable to their condition and degree and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute W & M st. 2.c.2. [ie. The English Bill of Rights of 1688] and it is indeed a public allowance under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression. In these several articles consist the rights, or as they are frequently termed, the liberties of Englishmen. . . .\n \n And we have seen that these rights. . .consist, primarily, in the free enjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property. So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one or other of these rights. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the constitution of parliaments be supported in it[s] full vigor. . . .And lastly, to vindicate these rights, when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and lastly, to the right of having and using arms for self preservation and defense. Sir William Blackstone, 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, p. 136 & 140 (1st. ed. 1765, reprinted 1979).\n \n This right is far broader than a right to carry arms while a member of the militia. No American Colonist was required to be a militia member as a prerequisite to exercising his RKBA. Nothing about the American Revolution took this right away. Indeed, the Federalists threw this broad right of the people to keep and bear arms back at the Anti-Federalists when they complained of Congress&#8217; Article I power to arm the militias during the Constitutional debates:\n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.\" Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n In other words: The people have an individual RKBA, and that is enough to prevent tyranny&#8212;quit your whining about Congress having the power to disarm the militias. \n \n Now it is my belief that this Federalist argument reflects the aim of the 2nd. Amendment. Madison first paid lip service, if you will, to the cherished principle of avoiding standing armies and relying on militias: &#8220;A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.&#8221; He then sought to further appease Anti-Federalist fears by doing nothing more than recognizing the existence of the individual right RKBA&#8212;a right which he and other Federalists had already championed during the debates as the proper counterweight to the otherwise Congressional monopoly over arms: &#8220;the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.&#8221;\n \n And so in the end, since the states were not to be given the power to interfere with the uniformity of arming the militias, the only way to ensure a tyrant could not have an absolute monopoly over the badges of liberty was to protect the individual RKBA. This is exactly how Madison&#8217;s friend and fellow Federalist, Tench Coxe, described the purpose of the 2nd. Amendment: \n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1. (Emphasis added).\n \n But is this individual RKBA limited to militia service?\n \n Nothing in the history of this era suggests this limitation. The right was broader than militia service before the 2nd Amendment was drafted, and there is no evidence to suggest that the 2nd. Amendment recognized this broad right in a way that castrated it and tied it only to militia service. No matter how many times Cornell and others read it, the Amendment will never read &#8220;the right of the people to carry militia arms&#8221; or &#8220;the right of militia members to be armed.&#8221;\n \n And there is a very good reason why this absurd language was never written. To do so would transform the &#8220;right&#8221; into a privilege that Congress had the absolute power to grant or deny. For Congress continues to have the exclusive power in Article I to regulate the militia, and it alone has the authority to decide just who, or just how many people, will be members of the militia and therefore have this &#8220;privilege&#8221; to keep and bear arms. It is absurd to suggest that Madison would recognize a &#8220;right,&#8221; say that it &#8220;shall not be infringed,&#8221; and then believe it to be limited in such a way that Congress would have the exclusive power to deny it to anyone it chooses to. Even a case cited frequently by collective right fans does not engage in that fiction:\n \n The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose. This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. United States v. Cruishank (1876). 92 U.S. 542, 552 (1876). \n \n That&#8217;s because the right, like free speech, pre-existed the Constitution and its militia framework. And this is the right Madison codifies in the 2nd. Amendment&#8212;a right keep and bear arms for a lawful purpose&#8212;of which one purpose (but quite clearly not the only purpose) is militia service.\n \n There now. This is what I say about the matter. Agree or disagree as you will. \n \n ---\n \n \"On every question of construction let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what meaning can be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, conform to the probable one which was passed.\" Thomas Jefferson, The Complete Jefferson, p. 322 (1957) [Letter to William Johnson, June 12, 1823].\n \n \"And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms. . . .\" Samuel Adams, Debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87 (February 6, 1788).",

   "...and farther more explains why there is fear in those who would pervert and try to eliminate that 2A from the expressed purpose of keeping \"the people\" armed and raises fear amoung those who are predisposed to usurp the power of the very rulers of this Republic, the people.\n \n Plenty of examples of previous misuse and abuse of the States' militia power can be found throughout our past history such as the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado as one example. Indeed there are many more such as the abuse of the Federal powers in the sad instance of The Bonus Marchers led by Ike and Black Jack Pershing on vets of WWI during the last depression when the marched on the Capitol and camped out trying to collect benefits promised but wanted them earlier instead of later and was turned into a violent attack against them. In my view, this is what they ask, to use the milita as a club and an attack dog to have their way by pointing a finger and saying \"sic 'em\" on anyone who opposes their political expediency or desires chilling or eliminating human rights and the Rule of Law in this Republic. They want a force to be used as a means to their own advantage and goals to subvert government to affect the \"change\" deemed desirable even though it is opposed to our existing structure of a Republic and the Constitution.\n \n The Battle of Athens (Tennessee) is a good example of how an impromptu body of armed citizens corrected a corrupt political process and restored the rule of law by force and arms from the State National Guard Armory and privately owned arms.\n \n It is no surprise today that those who would stand the rule of law 180 degrees on it's head fear an uprising of the people and a yeoman with his rights in his hands or on his hip instills fear amoung those who would trample any of their rights by imposition of unConstitutional laws or actions. That they are angered and frustrated that they cannot have their way leads to incoherent ramblings and grasping at straws in an attempt to subvert the 2A and appeal to irrational logic and propaganda to stir fear from unwarranted claims about any reason promoted to somehow limit or diminish or entirely delete the power of the armed citizen quite content to ignore the first rule of law but deterred by the individual right of the people to keep and bear arms.\n \n You are correct in noting that \"whining\" is a poor example of citizenship and moreso a futile exercise of shame on their part knowing full well their demands are unConstitutional and has no basis in fact. Condemnation of groups opposed to political groups attempted exercise of claimed illicit excuses for full and free exercise of a Right being exercised has a chilling effect simply because the FF intended just that...\"to prevent abuse of power by government\". It is a sobering experience and all that is left is \"whining\".",

   "I agree that the Second Amendment does not protect a right of the states to arm the militia. Patrick Henry, fearing that the Federal government would fail to arm the militia, proposed adding such a right to the Constitution. The Federalists disagreed with his proposal. However, the language of the Second Amendment is quite odd for a right focused on the use of guns for private purposes. If the Second Amendment really does elevate \"above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home\" as Heller claimed then why not begin the Second Amendment with something like \"Arms being necessary to the defense of hearth and home.... \" rather than beginning the Second Amendment with a statement about a well regulated militia? Why use a term such as \"bear arms\" which often had a military meaning in a military context? Why not make it more obvious? We must also consider the historical context as well as the language of the Second Amendment. Again, the historical context that surrounded the Second Amendment seems odd for a right focused on private self defense. Most of the debates at that time relevant to the Second Amendment were concerned with the militia. \n \n A lot of the arguments that I've seen in favor of the modern \"individual\" rights view focus a lot on the weaknesses of the states' rights view and then conclude that if the states' rights view is incorrect then a right focused on the private use of guns must be correct. Historian Saul Cornell explains, \n \n \"Contemporary debate over this provision of the Bill of Rights has been cast in terms of a simple dichotomy: either the Second Amendment protects an expansive individual right similar in nature to freedom of the press or it protects a narrow right of the states to maintain a well-regulated militia...\n Framing the meaning of the Second Amendment in terms of such a simple dichotomy fits well with the politics of the modern gun control debate. The individual rights view serves the interests of gun rights advocates, while the collective rights view supports the goals of gun control.\"\n \n I agree. I think both models in this false dichotomy were manufactured to serve a particular political agenda. \n \n Historian David Konig echoes these thoughts,\n \"It is a premise of this essay that both these models are historically unsatisfactory, the products of present-day normative agendas that have polarized the debate into two competing and largely ahistorical models...\"\n \n And further explains,\n \n \"No individual right existed unrelated to service in a well-regulated militia; no effective militia could serve its purpose without an armed citizenry. This type of right may appear paradoxical to us today, but it fitted 'the inner coherence of a given system of beliefs'4 held by people in the past, and which made sense to those familiar with the concept of an individual right exercised collectively.\"\n David Thomas Konig | The Second Amendment: A Missing Transatlantic Context for the Historical Meaning of \"the Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms\" | Law and History Review, 22.1 | The History Cooperative\n \n Heller is really part of an attempt to breathe new meaning into the Second Amendment by focusing on the private use of guns because most modern Americans, unlike the Founders, don't see the value of having a right to serve in a militia well regulated by the government. Having such a right seems contradictory to them because they are so unfamiliar with the historical context and militia culture in which the Second Amendment was written. \n \n Let's consider the quote from Cruikshank that was posted above:\n \"The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose. This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.\"\n \n This quote has been used by some in an attempt to show that the right protected by the Second Amendment is not necessarily connected to militia service. Let's look at the historical context of the quote. I think the reasoning in the quote was manufactured in the post Civil War era in order to justify state infringement of the Bill of Rights. The reasoning was that if a right is not dependent on the US Constitution then it is not one of the \"the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\" that is protected against state infringement in the 14th Amendment. Besides, the militia wasn't non-existent before the US Constitution written.",

   "  V. Drafting of the Federal Bill of Rights \n When James Madison found himself cast in the unlikely role of father of the national bill of rights,[234] he was not forced to write upon a clean slate. His first step was to obtain a pamphlet which conveniently listed all state proposals, from the Pennsylvania minority onward.[235] The problem became one of editing; out of hundreds of proposals, many redundant and some questionable, a hard core of usable proposals had to be selected. The barriers to be surmounted required discarding all controversial proposals. (My synopsis for brevity  He needed to write something that could pass two-thirds of each House and three quarters of the States)\n \n Madison's decision to include a right to arms in his federal bill of rights is hardly surprising. Such a right had been demanded in virtually every call for a bill of rights; indeed, it had received twice the number of demands accorded freedom of speech.[238] Language praising the militia had received much less support, essentially having been appended to the right to arms clause in Virginia and the two following conventions.[239] But an adaptation of the Virginia/New York/North Carolina wording combining the two held unusual promise. One of Madison's major objectives was to \"bring in\" North Carolina.[240] He hoped to convince it to ratify the Constitution by offering an acceptable bill of rights. North Carolina could hardly object to a nearly verbatim acceptance of its demand.\n\n Hence, this is how the odd language of the 2nd Amendment was birthed! emoticon_smile",

   "Let's consider the quote from Cruikshank that was posted above:\n \"The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose. This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.\"\n \n This quote has been used by some in an attempt to show that the right protected by the Second Amendment is not necessarily connected to militia service. Let's look at the historical context of the quote. \n\n Bovine Excrement. Like Doc says, the Bill of Rights do not give us our rights, it only list them or enumerated, or numbered them. Lets reconsider the words of the justice in Cruikshank \"This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.\" \n  From the Constitution Society\n There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the \"right to keep and bear arms\". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. \n \n < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea \n \n < (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution. \n\n And Hamilton's writings in Federalist 28.\n   FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that \n  original right of self-defense \n which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. \n In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. \n  The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair. \n The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. \n",

   "And here is what the Obama government recognizes about our Bill of Rights.  Rights and Responsibilities  \n Fundamental Rights\n \n This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n",

   "I agree that the Second Amendment does not protect a right of the states to arm the militia. Patrick Henry, fearing that the Federal government would fail to arm the militia, proposed adding such a right to the Constitution. The Federalists disagreed with his proposal. However, the language of the Second Amendment is quite odd for a right focused on the use of guns for private purposes. If the Second Amendment really does elevate \"above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home\" as Heller claimed then why not begin the Second Amendment with something like \"Arms being necessary to the defense of hearth and home.... \" rather than beginning the Second Amendment with a statement about a well regulated militia? Why use a term such as \"bear arms\" which often had a military meaning in a military context? Why not make it more obvious? We must also consider the historical context as well as the language of the Second Amendment. Again, the historical context that surrounded the Second Amendment seems odd for a right focused on private self defense. Most of the debates at that time relevant to the Second Amendment were concerned with the militia. \n \n A lot of the arguments that I've seen in favor of the modern \"individual\" rights view focus a lot on the weaknesses of the states' rights view and then conclude that if the states' rights view is incorrect then a right focused on the private use of guns must be correct. Historian Saul Cornell explains, \n \n \"Contemporary debate over this provision of the Bill of Rights has been cast in terms of a simple dichotomy: either the Second Amendment protects an expansive individual right similar in nature to freedom of the press or it protects a narrow right of the states to maintain a well-regulated militia...\n Framing the meaning of the Second Amendment in terms of such a simple dichotomy fits well with the politics of the modern gun control debate. The individual rights view serves the interests of gun rights advocates, while the collective rights view supports the goals of gun control.\"\n \n I agree. I think both models in this false dichotomy were manufactured to serve a particular political agenda. \n \n Historian David Konig echoes these thoughts,\n \"It is a premise of this essay that both these models are historically unsatisfactory, the products of present-day normative agendas that have polarized the debate into two competing and largely ahistorical models...\"\n \n And further explains,\n \n \"No individual right existed unrelated to service in a well-regulated militia; no effective militia could serve its purpose without an armed citizenry. This type of right may appear paradoxical to us today, but it fitted 'the inner coherence of a given system of beliefs'4 held by people in the past, and which made sense to those familiar with the concept of an individual right exercised collectively.\"\n David Thomas Konig | The Second Amendment: A Missing Transatlantic Context for the Historical Meaning of \"the Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms\" | Law and History Review, 22.1 | The History Cooperative\n \n Heller is really part of an attempt to breathe new meaning into the Second Amendment by focusing on the private use of guns because most modern Americans, unlike the Founders, don't see the value of having a right to serve in a militia well regulated by the government. Having such a right seems contradictory to them because they are so unfamiliar with the historical context and militia culture in which the Second Amendment was written. \n \n Let's consider the quote from Cruikshank that was posted above:\n \"The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose. This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.\"\n \n This quote has been used by some in an attempt to show that the right protected by the Second Amendment is not necessarily connected to militia service. Let's look at the historical context of the quote. I think the reasoning in the quote was manufactured in the post Civil War era in order to justify state infringement of the Bill of Rights. The reasoning was that if a right is not dependent on the US Constitution then it is not one of the \"the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\" that is protected against state infringement in the 14th Amendment. Besides, the militia wasn't non-existent before the US Constitution written.\n\n \n You copy horse excrement from an absolute rebuttal by Bryan of Saul Cornell whose ideas were trashed by the Heller court 9-0.\n \n Your implication of self-defense is so weak you appeal to the government to tell you if you can \"have detached reflection with an upraised knife over you\". Self defense is a law of nature not of men, the Constitution acknowledged that as well as other rights \"so fundamental that some said need not be added\" but they foresaw XXXXXX such as your benefactors who would try to overthrow the rule of law.\n \n You blubber some more: I think the reasoning in the quote was manufactured in the post Civil War era in order to justify state infringement of the Bill of Rights. And fail to understand that the Preamble to the BOR and the original 10 amendments were added in 1789 and adopted by due process.\n \n Your further blubbering: The reasoning was that if a right is not dependent on the US Constitution then it is not one of the \"the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\" that is protected against state infringement in the 14th Amendment.\n Is more horse hockey. The reasoning was that it would be impossible to list every right held by the people and all were privileges or immunities which were to be protected from ALL positive law and held by \"the people\".\n \n You and your benefactors surely have to screw on their clothes each day because they, and you, are so twisted.\n \n The First 10 Amendments to the\n Constitution as Ratified by the States\n December 15, 1791\n Preamble\n Congress OF THE United States\n begun and held at the City of New York, on Wednesday\n the Fourth of March, one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine.\n \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution\n \n RESOLVED by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, two thirds of both Houses concurring, that the following Articles be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States, as Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, all or any of which Articles, when ratified by three fourths of the said Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of the said Constitution; viz.:\n \n ARTICLES in addition to, and Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, proposed by Congress, and ratified by the Legislatures of the several States, pursuant to the fifth Article of the original Constitution.\n \n Your revisionist history cannot be resolved by anything short of outright denial or obfuscation.\n \n Amendment I\n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n \n Amendment II\n A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\n \n Amendment III\n No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\n \n Amendment IV\n The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n \n Amendment V\n No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n \n Amendment VI\n In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\n \n Amendment VII\n In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\n \n Amendment VIII\n Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n \n Amendment IX\n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n \n IOW, priviledges or immunities.

   "Interesting thoughts, Galileo.\n \n \n However, the language of the Second Amendment is quite odd for a right focused on the use of guns for private purposes. If the Second Amendment really does elevate \"above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home\" as Heller claimed then why not begin the Second Amendment with something like \"Arms being necessary to the defense of hearth and home.... \" rather than beginning the Second Amendment with a statement about a well regulated militia? \n\n \n See my argument above in this thread.\n \n \n Why use a term such as \"bear arms\" which often had a military meaning in a military context? \n\n \n I disagree. The phrase is \"to keep and bear arms.\" When read as a whole it does not have a military context associated with it at all. In my experience anti-individual right supporters ignore the word \"keep\" and focus on the word \"bear\" because they think the word has a primarily military context. But quite frankly, they arrive at this result by further ignoring the wealth of contradictory uses and indeed Supreme Court interpretations of the word. It is systematic of a ideologically driven thesis that requires one to first create the answer one wants and then go off in search of evidence to support the preferred assumption-something which both sides of this debate can and have done before. Nevertheless, I have seen the research offered by those who dislike the individual rights view and who seek to force a primarily military interpretation of the word \"bear\", and the best metaphor I can apply to their research methods is this:\n \n They act like the man who walks in the front door at a crowded cocktail party and immediately stands on his toes to overlook the crowd of contradictory evidence in search of his few friends he believes may be huddled together in a back corner. The next day you ask him to tell you who was at the party and he can only name the chosen few he was seeking as soon as he walked inside. \n \n Cornell, for example, does not tell you that from the Supreme Court alone the following people were at the party: Justices Rhenquist, Breyer, Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Thomas, Scalia, Souter, and Ginsberg-all of whom have touched on the word \"bear\" in Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 130 (1998) (addressing the word \"bear\" while dealing with defining the phrase \"carries a firearm\" in a federal criminal statute)\n \n The majority opinion, written by Justice Breyer and joined by Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas touched on the word \"bear\" as in \"bear arms\" this way:\n \n Black's Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase \"carry arms or weapons\" as\n \n \"To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.\" Black's Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990). Id. at 130. \n \n And particularly note the dissent, written by Justice Ginsburg, and joined by Rhenquist, Scalia, and Souter, which adopted this same law dictionary definition and directly tied it to the Second Amendment:\n \n Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment (\"keep and bear Arms\") (emphasis added) and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: \"wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.\"\n Id at 143. (note the emphasis on \"bear\" is in the original opinion-Bryan)\n \n This is in no way a military context. Now I realize this is but one example of those partygoers who seem to have been overlooked, but I chose this one because it shows how these scholars have decided to ignore or dismiss the opinion of every currently sitting SCOTUS justice who addressed this word pre-Heller. \n \n \n Most of the debates at that time relevant to the Second Amendment were concerned with the militia. \n\n \n I would agree if this were speaking of the constitutional ratification debates. Article I Section 8 of the proposed Constitution read:\n \n The Congress shall have power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia....\n \n Federalists and Anti-federalists were in complete agreement over what Article I section 8 meant-that it gave control over the creation and arming of the state militias to Congress. Their debates were over the wisdom of this grant of power to the federal government. But that ship sailed with the ratification of the Constitution, which no one can dispute made Congress the sole provider of militia arms. The Second Amendment discussion, however, also focused on the protection of the pre-existing individual RKBA. Here are a few examples of private commentary:\n \n \"Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. . . .It contains a bill of rights [including] . . . .the right to keep and bear arms\".--Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].\n \n \"The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people\". Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 53-54 (1854) [Letter to F. I. Minoe, June 12, 1789].\n \n \"Last Monday, a string of amendments were presented to the lower house; these altogether respected personal liberty. . . .\" William Grayson, 3 Patrick Henry, p. 391 (1951) [letter from Grayson to Henry, June 12, 1789].\n \n And my oft-quoted public sales pitch for the 2nd. Amendment-that it protected an individual RKBA, published by Madison's friend Tench Coxe:\n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1 (Note Coxe commented on more than just the 2nd. Amendment in his support for the proposed Bill of Rights)\n \n See also the private response by Madison to Coxe thanking him for his writings in support of his Bill of Rights (Madison was in New York at the time):\n \n \"[Your] printed remarks enclosed are already I find in the Gazettes here. . . .[I am] therefore already indebted to the co-operation of your pen.\" James Madison, 12 Madison Papers, p. 257 (Rutland Ed. 1979) [Letter from Madison to Coxe, June 24, 1789].\n \n Cornell, by the way, has in the past weakly attempted to explain this away, including Madison's letter of thanks....\n \n \n A lot of the arguments that I've seen in favor of the modern \"individual\" rights view focus a lot on the weaknesses of the states' rights view and then conclude that if the states' rights view is incorrect then a right focused on the private use of guns must be correct. Historian Saul Cornell explains, \n \n \"Contemporary debate over this provision of the Bill of Rights has been cast in terms of a simple dichotomy: either the Second Amendment protects an expansive individual right similar in nature to freedom of the press or it protects a narrow right of the states to maintain a well-regulated militia...\n Framing the meaning of the Second Amendment in terms of such a simple dichotomy fits well with the politics of the modern gun control debate. The individual rights view serves the interests of gun rights advocates, while the collective rights view supports the goals of gun control.\" \n\n \n I have seen this argument before. I have always interpreted this as Cornell \"blinking during the standoff\" and a sign that he had lost faith in the collective right view but could not bring himself to accept the individual right view-which forced him to lead a wayward search for a middle ground hybrid collective right view. In this new view he has championed the amendment does not protect a right of the state but rather of individual militia members to possess those militia arms required to discharge their civic duty to participate in the militia. I have yet to see him consider the Article I Section 8 roadblock which states that \"the Congress shall have power,\" and not the individual citizen, over his \"right\" to have militia arms. Nor have I seen him discuss Congress' Article I section 8 power of \"organizing\" the militia-which gives Congress the absolute power to chose who may and who may not be a militia member, thereby converting militia membership itself from a right into a privilege which Congress has the total power to grant or deny. If anyone knows where I can find him addressing these flaws in his argument then please let me know. I'd like to see it. \n \n I know Konig has warmed to Cornell's idea, but he shows up to the cocktail party with an historical fiction of his own:\n \n \n And [Konig] further explains,\n \n \"No individual right existed unrelated to service in a well-regulated militia....\" \n\n \n His article contains a number of citations for his positions, but I note that this bold statement-which is so critical to both his and Cornell's thesis-is inserted in his article without any reference to any authority supporting his claim.\n \n Let me draw on an example which runs counter to his claim-that of the call to arms by the citizens of Boston while the city was under military occupation by General Gage, and what ultimately happened to these arms. I have already cited in this thread Blackstone's commentary on the individual RKBA which existed prior to the War of Independence (flowing from the English Bill of Rights of 1688), in which Blackstone speaks of the individual right unconnected with militia service. This is the right the colonists in Boston laid claim to: \n \n \"Instances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military conservators of the peace still multiply upon us, some of which are of such a nature, and have been carried to so great lengths, as must serve fully to evince that a late vote of this town, calling upon the inhabitants to provide themselves with arms for their defense, was a measure as prudent as it was legal. . . .It is a natural right which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of Rights, to keep arms for their defense; and as Mr. Blackstone observes, it is to be made use of when the sanctions of society and law are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.\" O. Dickerson ed., Boston Under Military Rule, p79 (1936) [quoting from what was at the time the most widely circulated periodical in the colonies, A Journal of the Times].\n \n Here we see the citizens of Boston arming themselves. And they are doing so as individuals who were neither connected with nor who had any duty to use these arms as members of any militia-while claiming that they had a natural right to do so. Of course, the suggestion was made by certain British authorities that it might be illegal for them to individually arm themselves like this, to which the following reply was made:\n \n \"It is certainly beyond human art and sophistry, to prove that the British subjects, to whom the privilege of possessing arms is expressly recognized by the Bill of Rights,. . .are guilty of an illegal act, in calling upon one another to be provided with them, as the law directs.\" Id. At p. 61.\n \n Konig overlooks this example as he follows in Cornell's wake at the party. If he has offered a satisfactory explanation for this example then I would like to see it. \n \n Again, I recognize that this is but one example he overlooks. I chose this one because it is by no means a trivial example. The citizens of Boston who had armed themselves were later disarmed by a trick which so shocked the conscience of the colonists that the Continental Congress chose to include it as a specific complaint against British misrule. Remember that there were a total of three Declarations issued, being, in order, the DECLARATION AND RESOLVES OF THE FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS (October 14, 1774), followed by the DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS (July 6, 1775), followed finally by the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE (July 4, 1776). The complaint I speak of is found in the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking up Arms, which was written shortly after these two events of armed conflict (which themselves involved an attempt by General Gage to seize stockpiles of colonial arms and powder):\n \n General Gage . . . sent ought from [Boston] a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked assault on the inhabitants of the said province, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great many persons, some of whom were officers and soldiers of the detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province, killing several and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country people suddenly assembled to repel this cruel aggression....\n \n The Continental Congress (through Jefferson's pen) then listed this complaint about General Gage's solution to the citizens of Boston having armed themselves contrary to his wishes:\n \n The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind....\n \n The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th. of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to '[D]eclare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial.'\n \n Now I ask the reader, can Konig maintain an aura of credibility when he does not satisfactorily address an event that not only demonstrated for all to see the universal belief of the time in an individual RKBA unconnected with militia service, but which also included a later depravation of the right which was so infamous our founders chose to include it as a declared justification for taking up arms against their sovereign? \n \n \n Heller is really part of an attempt to breathe new meaning into the Second Amendment by focusing on the private use of guns because most modern Americans, unlike the Founders, don't see the value of having a right to serve in a militia well regulated by the government. Having such a right seems contradictory to them because they are so unfamiliar with the historical context and militia culture in which the Second Amendment was written. \n\n \n Ah, but what both Cornell and Konig seem to misunderstand is that the individual right to participate in civic militia service was extinguished by the Constitution. Neither men address Article 1 Section 8's grant of control over this right to militia participation to Congress. Nor do either men seem inclined to address the Supremacy Clause of Article 6, which makes Congress' power in this field absolute. Patrick Henry saw the truth of this grant of power to Congress-that it converted the individual right to participate in militia service from a Spartan ideal of a civic virtue, a right, and a duty into a privilege which Congress can regulate and even wholly abolish. I may volunteer for militia service, but only if Congress agrees to first organize a state militia, and only if Congress allows me personally to join it, for only as long as Congress agrees to maintain it, and then only with the arms Congress chooses to provide-and no others. \n \n This is one reason why the individual RKBA is mentioned along with the militia preamble-for Miller was correct about how the militias were armed before the Constitution was adopted: \n \n And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time. U.S. v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).\n \n The source of these arms being the pre-existing right of these men to already keep and bear these arms unconnected with militia service, and which they would provide by themselves if they were called to leave the farm or workshop to participate in the militia. \n \n But as I have said with ratification of the Constitution this system was abandoned and Congress was granted total power to arm and disarm the organized state militias. After the ratification of the Constitution the only arms not subject to monopolization by Congress-and therefore available in an emergency for men to use to protect themselves and their state governments from a federal tyrant and his federal standing army-are those protected from Congress' reach by the pre-existing individual right of men to have these arms unconnected with the militia service Congress now totally controlled. \n \n Hence with the 2nd. Amendment you first see a statement of advice, if you will, for Congress to rely on the militia system and not to use its power to disband and disarm the well-regulated state militias, followed by a prohibition that should Congress abandon this advice it could not also go further and disarm the people individually. \n \n \n Let's consider the quote from Cruikshank that was posted above:\n \"The right there specified is that of bearing arms for a lawful purpose. This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.\"\n \n This quote has been used by some in an attempt to show that the right protected by the Second Amendment is not necessarily connected to militia service. Let's look at the historical context of the quote. I think the reasoning in the quote was manufactured in the post Civil War era in order to justify state infringement of the Bill of Rights. \n\n \n I disagree. There was no need to invent this justification. Barron v. Mayor of Baltimore, 32 U.S. 243 (1833) had already established the principle that the BoR only applied to the federal government and did nothing to inhibit the power of the states. And the phrase \"bearing arms for a lawful purpose\" is a clear statement that the right protects more than arms for militia only purposes. But let me assume you are right for a moment, and the unstated intent is to justify limiting the right to protection only against federal infringement. Doesn't this mean that the right still protects the individual possession of arms for \"a lawful purpose\" beyond mere militia service-which through McDonald SCOTUS can now incorporate against the states under the Due Process clause of the 14th. Amendment? \n \n No, I have to disagree with this \"we must protect the state's power to infringe the right\" interpretation. If the quoted passage were intended to justify state infringement of the right then there is absolutely no need to first define the right to be much broader than a purely militia purpose-unless a link can be drawn to show that SCOTUS felt it had to broaden the right beyond militia service before it could justify state infringement of that right.\n \n What the above quote from Cruikshank does is restate the principle that the Bill of Rights did not \"grant\" us any rights, it instead recognized and protected those individual rights which pre-existed the Constitution (like the individual RKBA). These rights were not created by the BoR. For a continuation of this theme see also Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 281-82 (1897):\n \n The law is perfectly well settled that the first ten Amendments to the Constitution, commonly known as the Bill of Rights, were not intended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply to embody certain guarantees and immunities which we had inherited from our English ancestors, and which from time immemorial had been subject to certain well recognized exceptions arising from the necessities of the case.. . .\n \n The BoR did not give birth to these individual rights, and they do not owe their existence to the BoR. All the BoR did was force the federal government to acknowledge that these rights did in fact exist. Something which Cornell is also perfectly willing to do in his writings-well at least for all but one of them.... \n \n ---\n \n We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honor, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.\n \n Our cause is Just. Our Union is Perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable. - We gratefully acknowledge, as signal instances of the Divine favor towards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this severe controversy, until we were grown up to our present strength, had been previously exercised in warlike operation, and possessed of the means of defending ourselves. With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the world, declare, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverence, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.\n \n We fight not for glory or for conquest. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.\n \n In our own native land, in defense of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it - for the protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.\n \n From the DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS (July 6, 1775)",

   "Maybe it had something to do with you bringing up Federalist 28. In context, \n the \"original right of self-defense\" is referring to rebellion against tyranny.\n\n It was good that you to notice how Hamilton used this passage in Federalist 28, as it does severe damage to your claims. The Federalist Papers were written in order to sell our Federal Constitution to We the people, and he was trying to assure We the People that if they ratified the new Constitution, our Government could not go rogue, and what was their responsibilities, if it ever did so. \n \n But the proper question is, who was doing the rebelling in Hamilton's scenario? Not We the People. After all, they are the ONLY Owners of this country, and they are the ones delegating power that they owned to the government, in order for it to do the business of We the People. It is government who rebelled against the Supreme Law of the Land and became tyrannical in Hamilton's scenario! emoticon_smile \n \n However, the post has to do with our Original Rights and who owns those rights. It is also telling the reader, in 2010, that gun ownership, and Self Defense being two of our Natural Original Rights. But it is also memorable how Hamilton defined Self Defense in this scenario. I'll grant you that! But it is Hamilton, and all of our Founding Fathers are the Radical Rebellious type, and they gave us a system in which they hoped that We the People would never have to do that ever again! That being a system of checks and balances, with all 3 branches of government acting on a check on each other, with the Armed Citizen as the final check. \n \n That is our Government properly understood.\n \n These rights are apart from Government, not given to us by the Government or the Constitution, but recognized by both as preexisting and Inalienable, and are supposed to be off limits to same, government that is.\n \n Please also note how the Obama government itself recognizes our Bill of Rights, on their very own website. Fundamental Rights they are called.  Rights and Responsibilities  \n Fundamental Rights\n \n This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n",

In my experience anti-individual right supporters ignore the word &#8220;keep&#8221; and focus on the word &#8220;bear&#8221; because they think the word has a primarily military context. But quite frankly, they arrive at this result by further ignoring the wealth of contradictory uses and indeed Supreme Court interpretations of the word. It is systematic of a ideologically driven thesis that requires one to first create the answer one wants and then go off in search of evidence to support the preferred assumption&#8212;something which both sides of this debate can and have done before. Nevertheless, I have seen the research offered by those who dislike the individual rights view and who seek to force a primarily military interpretation of the word &#8220;bear&#8221;, and the best metaphor I can apply to their research methods is this:\n \n They act like the man who walks in the front door at a crowded cocktail party and immediately stands on his toes to overlook the crowd of contradictory evidence in search of his few friends he believes may be huddled together in a back corner. The next day you ask him to tell you who was at the party and he can only name the chosen few he was seeking as soon as he walked inside. \n \n Cornell, for example, does not tell you that from the Supreme Court alone the following people were at the party: Justices Rhenquist, Breyer, Stevens, O&#8217;Connor, Kennedy, Thomas, Scalia, Souter, and Ginsberg&#8212;all of whom have touched on the word &#8220;bear&#8221; in Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 130 (1998) (addressing the word &#8220;bear&#8221; while dealing with defining the phrase &#8220;carries a firearm&#8221; in a federal criminal statute)\n \n The majority opinion, written by Justice Breyer and joined by Stevens, O&#8217;Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas touched on the word &#8220;bear&#8221; as in &#8220;bear arms&#8221; this way:\n \n Black's Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase &#8220;carry arms or weapons&#8221; as\n \n &#8220;To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.&#8221; Black's Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990). Id. at 130. \n \n And particularly note the dissent, written by Justice Ginsburg, and joined by Rhenquist, Scalia, and Souter, which adopted this same law dictionary definition and directly tied it to the Second Amendment:\n \n Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment (&#8220;keep and bear Arms&#8221;) (emphasis added) and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: &#8220;wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.&#8221;\n Id at 143. (note the emphasis on &#8220;bear&#8221; is in the original opinion&#8212;Bryan)\n \n This is in no way a military context. Now I realize this is but one example of those partygoers who seem to have been overlooked, but I chose this one because it shows how these scholars have decided to ignore or dismiss the opinion of every currently sitting SCOTUS justice who addressed this word pre-Heller. \n\n Those seem to be much more current uses of the term \"keep and bear arms\"- such as the 1990 edition of Black's Law dictionary. I realize that the English language has undergone some change since the late 18th Century. \n \n \n\n I would agree if this were speaking of the constitutional ratification debates. Article I Section 8 of the proposed Constitution read:\n \n The Congress shall have power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia&#8230;.\n \n Federalists and Anti-federalists were in complete agreement over what Article I section 8 meant&#8212;that it gave control over the creation and arming of the state militias to Congress. Their debates were over the wisdom of this grant of power to the federal government. But that ship sailed with the ratification of the Constitution, which no one can dispute made Congress the sole provider of militia arms. The Second Amendment discussion, however, also focused on the protection of the pre-existing individual RKBA. Here are a few examples of private commentary:\n \n \n \"Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. . . .It contains a bill of rights [including] . . . .the right to keep and bear arms\".--Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].\n\n In more context it is:\n \"Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. They are the fruit of much labor and research. He has hunted up all the grievances and complaints of newspapers, all the articles of conventions, and the small talk of their debates. It contains a bill of rights, the right of enjoying property, of changing the government at pleasure, freedom of the press, of conscience, of juries, exemption from general warrants, gradual increase of representatives, till the whole number, at the rate of one to every thirty thousand, shall amount to ____, and allowing two to every State, at least. This is the substance. There is too much of it. Oh! I had forgot, the right of the people to bear arms. Risum teneatis amici? [Hold your laughter, friends.] Upon the whole, it may do some good towards quieting men, who attend to sounds only, and may get the mover [Madison] some popularity, which he wishes.\"\n \n By itself, I don't see how the quote is really and argument for against a militia connection. Historian Jack Rakove comments: \n \"The real significance of this letter is that it confirms the deprecatory attitude that many, perhaps most, congressmen took toward Madison&#8217;s project of securing amendments.\"\n \n \n \n\n \"The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people\". Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 53-54 (1854) [Letter to F. I. Minoe, June 12, 1789].\n \n \"Last Monday, a string of amendments were presented to the lower house; these altogether respected personal liberty. . . .\" William Grayson, 3 Patrick Henry, p. 391 (1951) [letter from Grayson to Henry, June 12, 1789].\n \n\n Henry appears to be making a general statement about the Bill of Rights. I doubt Henry would have thought that the Tenth Amendment's protection of state powers is a personal liberty. \n \n \n\n And my oft-quoted public sales pitch for the 2nd. Amendment&#8212;that it protected an individual RKBA, published by Madison&#8217;s friend Tench Coxe:\n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1 (Note Coxe commented on more than just the 2nd. Amendment in his support for the proposed Bill of Rights)\n \n See also the private response by Madison to Coxe thanking him for his writings in support of his Bill of Rights (Madison was in New York at the time):\n \n \"[Your] printed remarks enclosed are already I find in the Gazettes here. . . .[I am] therefore already indebted to the co-operation of your pen.\" James Madison, 12 Madison Papers, p. 257 (Rutland Ed. 1979) [Letter from Madison to Coxe, June 24, 1789].\n \n Cornell, by the way, has in the past weakly attempted to explain this away, including Madison&#8217;s letter of thanks&#8230;.\n\n Madison is really expressing his appreciation to Coxe for recognizing what good a Bill of Rights could do. He thinks a Bill of Rights would help those who had been against the Constitution \"be reconciled to the Government they have opposed\". Madison does not comment specifically on Coxe's brief comment about the Second Amendment nor does it make sense he would focus on it in this context. Cornell points out that \"In 1790 there were 84 newspapers in America, which means that Coxe&#8217;s essay was ignored by more than 95% of the press... The most reasonable conclusion to draw is that Coxe&#8217;s essay was simply not very influential.\" Cornell also questions whether Coxe's statement about a \"right to keep and bear private arms\" means that people are \"protected as private citizens or are they protected because as militiamen citizens [they] were expected to provide their own weapons for militia duty?\" Regardless, of what Coxe meant, I don't think too much weight can be attached to his comment in interpreting the Second Amendment. \n \n \n\n I have seen this argument before. I have always interpreted this as Cornell &#8220;blinking during the standoff&#8221; and a sign that he had lost faith in the collective right view but could not bring himself to accept the individual right view&#8212;which forced him to lead a wayward search for a middle ground hybrid collective right view. In this new view he has championed the amendment does not protect a right of the state but rather of individual militia members to possess those militia arms required to discharge their civic duty to participate in the militia. I have yet to see him consider the Article I Section 8 roadblock which states that &#8220;the Congress shall have power,&#8221; and not the individual citizen, over his &#8220;right&#8221; to have militia arms. Nor have I seen him discuss Congress&#8217; Article I section 8 power of &#8220;organizing&#8221; the militia&#8212;which gives Congress the absolute power to chose who may and who may not be a militia member, thereby converting militia membership itself from a right into a privilege which Congress has the total power to grant or deny. If anyone knows where I can find him addressing these flaws in his argument then please let me know. I&#8217;d like to see it. \n \n I know Konig has warmed to Cornell&#8217;s idea, but he shows up to the cocktail party with an historical fiction of his own:\n \n \n \n His article contains a number of citations for his positions, but I note that this bold statement&#8212;which is so critical to both his and Cornell&#8217;s thesis&#8212;is inserted in his article without any reference to any authority supporting his claim.\n \n Let me draw on an example which runs counter to his claim&#8212;that of the call to arms by the citizens of Boston while the city was under military occupation by General Gage, and what ultimately happened to these arms. I have already cited in this thread Blackstone&#8217;s commentary on the individual RKBA which existed prior to the War of Independence (flowing from the English Bill of Rights of 1688), in which Blackstone speaks of the individual right unconnected with militia service. This is the right the colonists in Boston laid claim to: \n \n \"Instances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military conservators of the peace still multiply upon us, some of which are of such a nature, and have been carried to so great lengths, as must serve fully to evince that a late vote of this town, calling upon the inhabitants to provide themselves with arms for their defense, was a measure as prudent as it was legal. . . .It is a natural right which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of Rights, to keep arms for their defense; and as Mr. Blackstone observes, it is to be made use of when the sanctions of society and law are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.\" O. Dickerson ed., Boston Under Military Rule, p79 (1936) [quoting from what was at the time the most widely circulated periodical in the colonies, A Journal of the Times].\n \n Here we see the citizens of Boston arming themselves. And they are doing so as individuals who were neither connected with nor who had any duty to use these arms as members of any militia&#8212;while claiming that they had a natural right to do so. Of course, the suggestion was made by certain British authorities that it might be illegal for them to individually arm themselves like this, to which the following reply was made:\n \n \"It is certainly beyond human art and sophistry, to prove that the British subjects, to whom the privilege of possessing arms is expressly recognized by the Bill of Rights,. . .are guilty of an illegal act, in calling upon one another to be provided with them, as the law directs.\" Id. At p. 61.\n \n Konig overlooks this example as he follows in Cornell&#8217;s wake at the party. If he has offered a satisfactory explanation for this example then I would like to see it. \n \n Again, I recognize that this is but one example he overlooks. I chose this one because it is by no means a trivial example. The citizens of Boston who had armed themselves were later disarmed by a trick which so shocked the conscience of the colonists that the Continental Congress chose to include it as a specific complaint against British misrule. Remember that there were a total of three Declarations issued, being, in order, the DECLARATION AND RESOLVES OF THE FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS (October 14, 1774), followed by the DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS (July 6, 1775), followed finally by the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE (July 4, 1776). The complaint I speak of is found in the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking up Arms, which was written shortly after these two events of armed conflict (which themselves involved an attempt by General Gage to seize stockpiles of colonial arms and powder):\n \n General Gage . . . sent ought from [Boston] a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked assault on the inhabitants of the said province, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great many persons, some of whom were officers and soldiers of the detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province, killing several and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country people suddenly assembled to repel this cruel aggression&#8230;.\n \n The Continental Congress (through Jefferson&#8217;s pen) then listed this complaint about General Gage&#8217;s solution to the citizens of Boston having armed themselves contrary to his wishes:\n \n The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind&#8230;.\n \n The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th. of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to '[D]eclare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial.'\n \n Now I ask the reader, can Konig maintain an aura of credibility when he does not satisfactorily address an event that not only demonstrated for all to see the universal belief of the time in an individual RKBA unconnected with militia service, but which also included a later depravation of the right which was so infamous our founders chose to include it as a declared justification for taking up arms against their sovereign?\n\n The citizens of Boston were really exercising a right to rebel against an unjust ruler- a right that became unnecessary in the Founders' view once the British were defeated. Most of the Founders were quick to condemn the Shays rebellion in Massachusetts. \n \n \n\n Ah, but what both Cornell and Konig seem to misunderstand is that the individual right to participate in civic militia service was extinguished by the Constitution. Neither men address Article 1 Section 8&#8217;s grant of control over this right to militia participation to Congress. Nor do either men seem inclined to address the Supremacy Clause of Article 6, which makes Congress&#8217; power in this field absolute. Patrick Henry saw the truth of this grant of power to Congress&#8212;that it converted the individual right to participate in militia service from a Spartan ideal of a civic virtue, a right, and a duty into a privilege which Congress can regulate and even wholly abolish. I may volunteer for militia service, but only if Congress agrees to first organize a state militia, and only if Congress allows me personally to join it, for only as long as Congress agrees to maintain it, and then only with the arms Congress chooses to provide&#8212;and no others.\n \n This is one reason why the individual RKBA is mentioned along with the militia preamble&#8212;for Miller was correct about how the militias were armed before the Constitution was adopted: \n \n And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time. U.S. v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).\n \n The source of these arms being the pre-existing right of these men to already keep and bear these arms unconnected with militia service, and which they would provide by themselves if they were called to leave the farm or workshop to participate in the militia.\n \n Hence with the 2nd. Amendment you first see a statement of advice, if you will, for Congress to rely on the militia system and not to use its power to disband and disarm the well-regulated state militias, followed by a prohibition that should Congress abandon this advice it could not also go further and disarm the people individually.\n \n But as I have said with ratification of the Constitution this system was abandoned and Congress was granted total power to arm and disarm the organized state militias. After the ratification of the Constitution the only arms not subject to monopolization by Congress&#8212;and therefore available in an emergency for men to use to protect themselves and their state governments from a federal tyrant and his federal standing army&#8212;are those protected from Congress&#8217; reach by the pre-existing individual right of men to have these arms unconnected with the militia service Congress now totally controlled. \n\n I don't think that was really Henry's concern. His concern, like other anti-federalists was that the Federal Government would simply neglect the militia- that Congress would fail to sufficiently exercise its power over the militia. George also had similar fears, \"Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great-Britain, the British parliament was advised by an artful man, [Sir William Keith] who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people. That it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them. But that they should not do it openly; but to weaken them and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.[Here MR. MASON quoted sundry passages to this effect.] This was a most iniquitous project. Why should we not provide against the danger of having our militia, our real and natural strength, destroyed? The general government ought at the same time to have some such power. But we need not give them power to abolish our militia. If they neglect to arm them, and prescribe proper discipline, they will be of no use.\"\n \n What was really feared was government neglect or lack of regulation. In the world of the late 18th Century- a right to simply keep weapons at home and carry weapons around in public places would not have addressed such fears. Furthermore, there isn't much evidence that people of that time were concerned about the government outlawing such activities. At most it was a secondary concern. A right which protected citizen participation in the militia just as a citizen participated in elections and in juries as a check on government power would have made more sense. \n \n \n\n I disagree. There was no need to invent this justification. Barron v. Mayor of Baltimore, 32 U.S. 243 (1833) had already established the principle that the BoR only applied to the federal government and did nothing to inhibit the power of the staAnd the phrase &#8220;bearing arms for a lawful purpose&#8221; is a clear statement that the right protects more than arms for militia only purposes.\n \n But let me assume you are right for a moment, and the unstated intent is to justify limiting the right to protection only against federal infringement. Doesn&#8217;t this mean that the right still protects the individual possession of arms for &#8220;a lawful purpose&#8221; beyond mere militia service&#8212;which through McDonald SCOTUS can now incorporate against the states under the Due Process clause of the 14th. Amendment? \n \n No, I have to disagree with this &#8220;we must protect the state&#8217;s power to infringe the right&#8221; interpretation. If the quoted passage were intended to justify state infringement of the right then there is absolutely no need to first define the right to be much broader than a purely militia purpose&#8212;unless a link can be drawn to show that SCOTUS felt it had to broaden the right beyond militia service before it could justify state infringement of that right.\n \n What the above quote from Cruikshank does is restate the principle that the Bill of Rights did not &#8220;grant&#8221; us any rights, it instead recognized and protected those individual rights which pre-existed the Constitution (like the individual RKBA).\n\n Barron v. Baltimore was before the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment changed things. My objection is that people who oppose state infringement of the RKBA keep bringing up that quote from Cruikshank. It seems inconsistent to me. I think Cruikshank had an agenda when they said that. It really goes back to the Slaughterhouse case which differentiated between rights connected with state citizenship and rights connected with national citizenship. Rights dependent on national citizenship were protected against infringement by the states. Since the RKBA existed prior to the US Constitution it must not be one of those rights that was dependent on national citizenship the court reasoned and thus is not protected against state infringement. Of course, the English Bill of Rights protected a right of \"subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law\" but I doubt most people here would be in favor of such a pre-existing right.\n \n As for what was meant by \"bearing arms for a lawful purpose\" in Cruikshank, Saul Cornell explains:\n \"While the Court appeared to implicit acknowledge that the meaning of the term bear arms had evolved to encompass more than arms used for military purposes, this linguistic observation did not alter the meaning of the original Constitutional text. Indeed, the Court went on to assert in unambiguous terms that 'bearing arms for lawful purposes' was not identical to the right protected by the Second Amendment that linked bearing arms to participation in a well-regulated militia. In essence, the Court argued that the common-law right to keep and carry arms and the right to bear arms protected by the Second Amendment were legally distinct. The Second Amendment in their view was 'one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government.' The purpose of the amendment was to protect the state militias against federal disarmament. According to this view, states were free to enact whatever measures they deemed appropriate regarding the militia or firearms, as long as these laws were nondiscriminatory.\"",

There will always be those who will always attempt to slick us out of what is ours! \n \n Found at our Archives.  Bill of Rights \nThe fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights.\n\n \n   Alexander Hamilton on the Bill of Rights and our Unalienable Rights. Federalist Papers no. 84 \nI go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\"\n\n So to cover these possibilities they authored the ninth and tenth Amendments.\n  9th Amendment\n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n \n Rights Retained by the People \n Annotations \n Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those.\n\n   10th Amendment \n The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n \n   Preamble Bill of Rights \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution \n\n \n   FEDERALIST No. 78 \n Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental. \n",

   "Thanks Galileo. This has become a very interesting discussion (at least for me-it may bore the heck out of other people).\n \n \n Those seem to be much more current uses of the term \"keep and bear arms\"- such as the 1990 edition of Black's Law dictionary. I realize that the English language has undergone some change since the late 18th Century. \n\n \n And yet every dissenting justice in Heller adopted this term in Muscarello, and half of the Heller dissenters applied it to the late 18th Century 2nd. Amendment. \n \n \n In more context it is:\n \"Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. They are the fruit of much labor and research. He has hunted up all the grievances and complaints of newspapers, all the articles of conventions, and the small talk of their debates. It contains a bill of rights, the right of enjoying property, of changing the government at pleasure, freedom of the press, of conscience, of juries, exemption from general warrants, gradual increase of representatives, till the whole number, at the rate of one to every thirty thousand, shall amount to ____, and allowing two to every State, at least. This is the substance. There is too much of it. Oh! I had forgot, the right of the people to bear arms. Risum teneatis amici? [Hold your laughter, friends.] Upon the whole, it may do some good towards quieting men, who attend to sounds only, and may get the mover [Madison] some popularity, which he wishes.\" \n \n By itself, I don't see how the quote is really and argument for against a militia connection. Historian Jack Rakove comments: \n \"The real significance of this letter is that it confirms the deprecatory attitude that many, perhaps most, congressmen took toward Madison's project of securing amendments.\" \n\n \n Actually this is out of context for our discussion. I am addressing Fisher Ames' understanding of what the Amendment was intended to protect-not whether he felt the Amendment was necessary or even wise. I do not dispute that there were many who opposed including any Amendments protecting individual rights on the grounds that it would encourage the government to claim powers beyond those specifically enumerated. But the wisdom of having a BoR is rendered moot by its ratification. The BoR became the law of the land despite Ames' misgivings and his private grudge against Madison. If Rakove wishes to continue that argument then he is avoiding the issue I have raised. The question we are discussing is what was the right recognized by the Amendment and not whether the amendment should have been ratified. \n \n What did Fisher Ames understand about the Amendment's purpose? Ames does not argue that Madison's proposed 2nd. Amendment protects the right of the states to arm their militias. He does not argue that the proposed amendment protects only the right of men to bear military arms as part of the militias. He clearly understands that the proposed Amendment aims to protect an individual RKBA. He does not agree with the necessity of it, and his dislike of Madison leads him to mock all of his proposed Amendments-but-he clearly understands what the 2nd. Amendment intends to achieve. That is the context of the Ames quote-not whether he agrees with it, but that he understood it to protect an individual RKBA. Does Rakove (or Cornell or Konig, for that matter) argue that Fisher Ames did not understand the individual right purpose of the Amendment? \n \n \n Henry appears to be making a general statement about the Bill of Rights. I doubt Henry would agree that the Tenth Amendment's protection of state powers as a personal liberty. \n\n \n Grayson is writing to Henry and making a generalized statement about all the amendments respecting \"personal liberty.\"\n \n \n Madison is really expressing his appreciation to Coxe for recognizing what good a Bill of Rights could do. He thinks a Bill of Rights would help those who had been against the Constitution \"be reconciled to the Government they have opposed\". Madison does not comment specifically on Coxe's brief comment about the Second Amendment nor does it make sense he would focus on it in this context. Cornell points out that \"In 1790 there were 84 newspapers in America, which means that Coxe's essay was ignored by more than 95% of the press... The most reasonable conclusion to draw is that Coxe's essay was simply not very influential.\" Cornell also questions whether Coxe's statement about a \"right to keep and bear private arms\" means that people are \"protected as private citizens or are they protected because as militiamen citizens [they] were expected to provide their own weapons for militia duty?\" Regardless, of what Coxe meant, I don't think too much weight can be attached to his comment in interpreting the Second Amendment. \n\n \n Yes.\n \n This is Cornell's article I referenced when I said he \"has in the past weakly attempted to explain this away.\" It can be found here: The Second Amendment Under Fire: The Uses of History and the Politics of Gun Control\n \n Now I want to go over this article in more depth because Cornell's attempt to undercut Coxe's Remarks exposes the fallacy of his own interpretation. To start with, this was a campaign for votes, and Coxe's remarks were targeted to newspapers which covered markets where he felt the issue of passage of the BoR was in doubt. \n \n But, since Cornell places such emphasis on it, let me take his argument about the mere percentage of newspapers seriously for a moment. Of the 84 newspapers Cornell knows of, how many printed any dispute of Coxe's analysis? Zero. Note how Cornell glosses over this lack of dissent with Coxe's analysis....\n \n This is an example of one of the problems I find with Cornell's argument-it has no direct evidence to support it. He asks us to accept his argument entirely on the faith of speculative and circumstantial inference, and he asks us to ignore the direct evidence which contradicts him. I can't speak for others, but as for myself I will say that while the willful suspension of disbelief is something I will engage in to enjoy an action movie I do not believe it has any place in a discussion of history. And the truth of the matter is that both the collective states right view and his hybrid individual right view are 20th Century creations of revisionist history. In fact, Cornell's own arguments about newspaper percentages help prove this point: \n \n Of the 84 newspapers he mentions, how many printed any argument in favor of either the collective states right view or of Cornell's hybrid individual right view? Zero. Therefore (to paraphrase Cornell), can we then assume that both the collective states right view and Cornell's hybrid view \"were ignored by 100% of the press\"? The answer must be yes. Why is this? No paper printed these arguments because no one ever made them at the time. \n \n But Cornell did not stop with this weak \"newspaper percentage\" argument against Coxe's Remarks. In the article he chose to also invent and insert confusion into the text itself-and this is where he exposes the fallacy of his interpretation of the Amendment. Watch what he does now. In the cited article Cornell says:\n \n \"Supporters of the individual rights view have focused on the fact that Coxe asserted that \"the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.\" While at first glance this would seem to provide proof of an individual right, it is not clear in what capacity the people's private arms are protected. Are they protected as private citizens or are they protected because as militiamen citizens were expected to provide their own weapons for militia duty? Coxe's statement ultimately tells us little about how people understood the individual or collective nature of the right to keep and bear arms in the late-eighteenth century.\" (bold emphasis added by Bryan)\n \n Let me first say it is refreshing to see Cornell admit that at first glance words appear to mean exactly what they say. But the plain language obviously runs counter to his theory. Therefore, Cornell decides to invent ambiguity where none exists. He cannot accept the standard individual right view, so he frames the debate over the Amendment as a \"must be either or\" contest between two competing interpretations of the Amendment. For Cornell, the Amendment either protects the arms of private citizens (the standard individual right argument) or (his argument) those arms \"militiamen citizens were expected to provide\" of \"their own\" \"for militia duty.\" And therein lies the purpose behind this obfuscation-for this is how Cornell introduces the reader to his competing interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment. See again what he says:\n \n \"Are they protected as private citizens or are they protected because as militiamen citizens were expected to provide their own weapons for militia duty?\" \n \n Take this question at face value for a moment. All of Cornell's writings on the subject come down to his belief that the 2nd. Amendment \"right\" protects militiamen who participate in a system where they \"were expected to provide their own weapons for militia duty.\" The right of militia men to do just that is what Cornell argues the 2nd. Amendment protects. But this right was extinguished before the 2nd. Amendment was drafted by the earlier ratification of Article I section 8 of the Constitution: \"The Congress shall have power [t]o provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia.\" This destroyed Cornell's old system and replaced it with the power of Congress to be the sole source of militia arms. Therefore, if you accept Cornell's analysis that these are the only two viable interpretations, then the 2nd. Amendment must protect the arms of private citizens-for the \"right\" (or duty) Cornell's argument rests upon no longer exists. And so Cornell's \"either or\" argument more properly becomes \"it is either the straight individual right view or some other new theory Cornell might invent in the future-for his current one rests upon a false premise.\" \n \n \n The citizens of Boston were really exercising a right to rebel against an unjust ruler- a right that became unnecessary in the Founders' view once the British were defeated. Most of the Founders were quick to condemn the Shays rebellion in Massachusetts. \n\n \n Yes. What you term a \"right to rebel\" was made possible by private citizens who were neither members of nor in any way associated with a militia, who turned to the free exercise of their individual RKBA as private citizens, which they believed provided them with the arms necessary to exercise a \"right to rebel.\" The same individual RKBA was taken from them by the treachery of the first \"registration and secured storage scheme\" proposed in America. The scheme was universally condemned by our founders, and was thereafter ignored by Konig. \n \n \n I don't think that was really Henry's concern. His concern, like other anti-federalists was that the Federal Government would simply neglect the militia- that Congress would fail to sufficiently exercise its power over the militia. George also had similar fears, \"Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great-Britain, the British parliament was advised by an artful man, [Sir William Keith] who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people. That it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them. But that they should not do it openly; but to weaken them and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.[Here MR. MASON quoted sundry passages to this effect.] This was a most iniquitous project. Why should we not provide against the danger of having our militia, our real and natural strength, destroyed? The general government ought at the same time to have some such power. But we need not give them power to abolish our militia. If they neglect to arm them, and prescribe proper discipline, they will be of no use.\" \n\n \n This looks as though we are going back to Henry's objection to Congress' power over the militia in Article I section 8, which I have addressed earlier.\n \n \n What was really feared was government neglect or lack of regulation. In the world of the late 18th Century- a right to simply keep weapons at home and carry weapons around in public places would not have addressed such fears. Furthermore, there isn't much evidence that people of that time were concerned about the government outlawing such activities. At most it was a secondary concern. A right to protect citizen participation in the militia just as a citizen participated in elections and in juries as a check on government power would have made more sense. \n\n \n Yes, before the Constitution was adopted giving Congress the total power to neglect the militia. But if a right to protect citizen participation in the militia makes more sense, then wouldn't Tench Coxe have said so? Wouldn't the Amendment itself just have said so? Wouldn't Madison have also proposed amending Article I section 8 to take the total and sole power away from Congress and share it with the people? Didn't Madison understand that he cannot merely rely on Cornell's implication from the phrase \"the right of the people\"? Didn't Madison realize that a latter day historian's attempt to divine a secret intention from language which clearly says something different is not enough when faced with the clear and absolute command of Article I section 8 and the equally unambiguous language of the Article 6 supremacy clause? Or are we to suggest that Madison, like Cornell, was pretending the rest of the Constitution did not exist when the 2nd. Amendment was drafted? Can Cornell answer any of these questions?\n \n The issue is not what we today think would have made more sense, or what strained hypothetical interpretation we can today invent, but what was actually passed-even if Fisher Ames disliked it so much he urged us to hold our laughter at it. \n \n \n But Barron v. Baltimore was before the 14th Amendment. \n\n \n Yes it was. Barron v. Baltimore settled the question of the states being free from the reach of the BoR. The Slaughter-house cases (decided in 1873) were decided after the 14th. Amendment was adopted, and held that the Amendment did little, if anything, to alter the rationale of Barron. Cruikshank was decided in 1876-three years later. There was no need for Cruikshank to do what you suggest. And there was certainly no need to say \"bear arms for a lawful purpose,\" which takes the right out of the militia only context where the will of Congress already ruled supreme. \n -\n \n Unless \"bear arms\" itself has a military meaning. \n\n and\n \n My objection is that people who oppose state infringement of the RKBA will bring up the quote from Cruikshank. It seems inconsistent to me. I think Cruikshank had an agenda when they said that. It really goes back to the Slaughterhouse case which differentiated between rights connected with state citizenship and rights connected with national citizenship. Rights dependent on national citizenship were protected against infringement by the states. Since the RKBA existed prior to the US Constitution it must not be one of those rights that was dependent on national citizenship the court reasoned and thus is not protected against state infringement. Of course, the English Bill of Rights protected a right of \"subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law\" but I doubt most people here would be in favor of such a pre-existing right. \n\n \n See my earlier argument, and further...\n \n To return to the case of Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 281-82 (1897) that I touched on earlier and the quote I used to illustrate my point: \n \n The law is perfectly well settled that the first ten Amendments to the Constitution, commonly known as the Bill of Rights, were not intended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply to embody certain guarantees and immunities which we had inherited from our English ancestors, and which from time immemorial had been subject to certain well recognized exceptions arising from the necessities of the case.\n \n Robertson continues thus:\n \n In incorporating these principles into the fundamental law, there was no intention of disregarding the exceptions, which continued to be recognized as if they had been formally expressed. Thus, the freedom of speech and of the press (Art. I) does not permit the publication of libels, blasphemous or indecent articles, or other publications injurious to public morals or private reputation; the right of the people to keep and bear arms (Art. II) is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons; the provision that no person shall be twice put in jeopardy (Art. V) does not prevent a second trial if upon the first trial the jury failed to agree or if the verdict was set aside upon the defendant's motion, United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662, 163 U. S. 627, nor does the provision of the same article that no one shall be a witness against himself impair his obligation to testify if a prosecution against him be barred by the lapse of time, a pardon, or by statutory enactment, Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, and cases cited. Nor does the provision that an accused person shall be confronted with the witnesses against him prevent the admission of dying declarations, or the depositions of witnesses who have died since the former trial.\n \n Here again the RKBA is listed along with and is treated just the same as other BoR provisions recognizing the individual rights of private citizens. Bans on concealed carry are concerned with how private individuals carry arms. Such bans have no bearing on militia service. SCOTUS would not mention the lawfulness of this ban if it were not also talking about a right that applies to private citizens beyond mere militia service-ie. As the Cruikshank Court said it: the right to bear arms \"for a lawful purpose\" and not the right to bear arms \"for militia service.\"",

   "A few thoughts in response to what has been posted by others-\n \n I don't think it's clear from Ames' quote what he thought of the RKBA. He seems to be very casual about it and not putting a lot of thought into what he's saying. Henry's quote about the Bill of Rights protecting \"personal liberties\" seems to be a general statement about what the document contained- not necessarily applying to every part of the document. Some of the rights it protects seem less personal- such as \"the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" The Tenth Amendment protects the powers of states and the people. Tench Coxe's words seem the most convincing in favor of a non-idiomatic understanding of keeping and bearing arms. But I can find in the debates of the first Congress and earlier drafts of the Second Amendment examples of the right having a pretty clear idiomatic meaning and I think these examples carry more weight than the words of Coxe and the others. I think the language of the second part of the Amendment is possibly ambiguous. However, paired with a clarifying preamble it's pretty clear what it's talking about. \n \n The way I see it- the debate surrounding the Second Amendment was like a custody battle- each parent concerned that the other parent would not take very good care of the child. The federalists, many of them not very impressed with the militia's performance during the war, became convinced that subjecting the militia to national authority was the answer. The anti-federalists, on the other hand, were concerned that if the Constitution awarded the federal government custody of the militia that it would neglect militia. So they proposed joint custody. The federalists thought this unnecessary but included the Second Amendment as an assurance that the militia would not be neglected by the Federal government. The Federal government would pass and enforce militia laws which kept the people armed and in a condition of military readiness. Thus Mason's fears about the people being disarmed because of the central government \"totally disusing and neglecting the militia\" would not become a reality.",

   "Still doubting the Supreme Court Heller settled law huh?\n \n   The Use and Abuse of the Constitution  \nNow scholarship has come to the rescue. The past twenty-five years have witnessed a growing number of studies of the Second Amendment, and these have found overwhelming evidence that it was meant to guarantee an individual right to be armed. ..... By contrast, no contemporary evidence has been found that only a collective right for members of a militia was intended.  The evidence has convinced our leading constitutional scholars, among them Lawrence Tribe, Akhil Amar, and Leonard Levy, that the Second Amendment protects an individual right. \n \n Why does the debate over original intent continue? Lawrence Tribe, (Harvard Law School) who concluded there is an individual right after considering the new evidence, points to the \"true poignancy,\" \"the inescapable tension, for many people on both sides of this policy divide, between the reading of the Second Amendment that would advance the policies they favor and the reading of the Second Amendment to which intellectual honesty, and their own theories of constitutional interpretation, would drive them if they could bring themselves to set their policy convictions aside.\" The time has come for those who deny an individual right exists to set policy convictions aside in favor of intellectual honesty--and a more productive discussion. \n\n \n   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says,  \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n\n \n   Testimony of Eugene Volokh on the Second Amendment, Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, Sept. 23, 1998. \n 1.The Text of the Amendment Refers to an Individual Right\n \n The Second Amendment, like the First, Fourth, and Ninth Amendments, refers to a \"right of the people,\" not a right of the states or a right of the National Guard. The First Amendment guarantees the people's right to assemble; the Fourth Amendment protects the people's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures; the Ninth Amendment refers to the people's unenumerated rights. 1 These rights are clearly individual -- they protect \"the right of the people\" by protecting the right of each person. This strongly suggests that the similarly-worded Second Amendment likewise secures an individual right. \n",

It is another GUN Amendment, that also defeated such slick language being uses against the rest of our Inalienable Rights as well.\n \n So one can easily see that the Right to keep and Bear Arms was proposed, passed, and duly ratified not once, but twice! However, you wouldn't be happy even if We the People did it again for a third, fourth or even a fifth time! The simple fact is that you never will be happy about our Inalienable Right to Keep and Bear Arms or our Right to Self Defense. \n \n Dude! You are out of gas! emoticon_smile",

   "  Institute for Justice -- 14th Amendment] \n \n 2. The history and adoption of the Fourteenth\n Amendment demonstrates the Framer's specific and\n repeated concern that freedmen were being disarmed\n by state and local governments and militias, in violation\n of what those Framers understood to be an individual\n constitutional right to bear arms. In response\n to this Court's previous refusal to enforce parts of the\n Bill of Rights directly against the States, and its holding\n that blacks were not citizens of the United States\n entitled to the rights of such citizens, the Framers set\n out to remedy the inability to enforce numerous constitutional\n rights against the States by incorporating\n them into the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Identification of the evils the 39th Congress sought\n to remedy - including the disarming of freedmen -\n the parallel legislative responses to that problem, and\n the specific explanations by the Framers of the purpose\n and function of the Fourteenth Amendment, all\n demonstrate that they viewed the existing constitutional\n right to bear arms as an individual right of\n personal security. And they understood and intended\n the language of the Fourteenth Amendment to secure\n such a right against the States and various militias, not merely in the service of the very entities seeking\n to disarm and abuse the freedmen. And by accomplishing\n that goal through the identification and extension\n of the rights of national citizens, the Framers\n of the Fourteenth Amendment also clarified and defined\n the underlying rights in the Second Amendment\n as well.\n \n Whatever the basis for incorporation, however, the\n history of the Fourteenth Amendment shows that the\n right to bear arms was intended to be incorporated,\n and thus should be read as it was understood at the\n time of such incorporation. \n",

   "A few thoughts in response to what has been posted by others-\n \n I don't think it's clear from Ames' quote what he thought of the RKBA. He seems to be very casual about it and not putting a lot of thought into what he's saying. Henry's quote about the Bill of Rights protecting \"personal liberties\" seems to be a general statement about what the document contained- not necessarily applying to every part of the document. Some of the rights it protects seem less personal- such as \"the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" The Tenth Amendment protects the powers of states and the people. Tench Coxe's words seem the most convincing in favor of a non-idiomatic understanding of keeping and bearing arms. But I can find in the debates of the first Congress and earlier drafts of the Second Amendment examples of the right having a pretty clear idiomatic meaning and I think these examples carry more weight than the words of Coxe and the others. I think the language of the second part of the Amendment is possibly ambiguous. However, paired with a clarifying preamble it's pretty clear what it's talking about. \n \n The way I see it- the debate surrounding the Second Amendment was like a custody battle- each parent concerned that the other parent would not take very good care of the child. The federalists, many of them not very impressed with the militia's performance during the war, became convinced that subjecting the militia to national authority was the answer. The anti-federalists, on the other hand, were concerned that if the Constitution awarded the federal government custody of the militia that it would neglect militia. So they proposed joint custody. The federalists thought this unnecessary but included the Second Amendment as an assurance that the militia would not be neglected by the Federal government. The Federal government would pass and enforce militia laws which kept the people armed and in a condition of military readiness. Thus Mason's fears about the people being disarmed because of the central government \"totally disusing and neglecting the militia\" would not become a reality.\n\n \n Well I think we have each stated our positions and it seems we must agree to disagree. Thank you for discussing this with me amicably.",

   "Time for a thought experiment-\n \n The Second Amendment reads,\n \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n The Supreme Court claims this amendment \"elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\"\n \n Suppose, for a moment, that there was an amendment which said:\n \n \"Tobacco, being an important crop in the economy, the right of the people to smoke, shall not be infringed.\" \n \n Would it be logical for the Supreme Court to claim this amendment \"surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding responsible citizens to smoke marijuana\"?\n \n In both cases, what is elevated \"about all other interests\" is not the subject of the preamble. It seems the writers of both amendments could have done a better job if that's what was really intended.\n\n \n It would be illogical IMO. But if this is to be a comparison with the language of the 2nd. Amendment, then let me try to look at it from the logic of the two theories which compete with the standard individual RKBA theory. \n \n As for a traditional \"collective\" right to smoke similar to the \"collective right\" interpretation of the RKBA-I cannot see how the phrase \"the right of the people to smoke\" could be twisted to mean only the right of the Commonwealth of Virginia to light one up. But, then again, I cannot see how the phrase \"the right of the people\" can mean a right of the state to have arms without the same language meaning only the state can claim a right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure (for doesn't the 4th. Amendment also read \"the right of the people\" to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures?). \n \n As for Cornell's hybrid collective/individual right theory, it may be an unfair comparison for the context of the two rights is dissimilar. Congress was not first given the exclusive power to control the use and possession of tobacco. So let me assume for purposes of this argument that the context is the same-that Article I section 8 gave Congress the same exclusive power over tobacco that it already has over arming and numbering the militia. If this were the case, then I agree a \"Cornellian\" reading of this \"right to smoke\" being limited only to tobacco would make as little sense as does his strained interpretation of the RKBA-both rights are then merely a privilege which we exercise or lose at the whim of Congress. \n \n Imagine a \"right to smoke\" limited only to those who belong to a tobacco smoker's \"club,\" where Congress retained the ability at any time to abolish the \"club\" altogether, which even if it chose not to abolish then it retained the absolute power to tell me that I may or may not join the club, and if I were finally allowed to join the club then Congress had the absolute power to be my only source of tobacco, which it could provide to or withhold from me at its pleasure, and that if Congress decided not to give me any then I had no right to provide it for myself. In short, a \"right\" to participate in a tobacco smoking enabling club where the only power over the club itself, its membership, and its smoking activities not absolutely controlled by Congress was the power of the state to appoint the officers of the club. Such is the framework of a right which never has been and never will exist outside of the imagination of Cornell where the RKBA is concerned. \n \n But, since Article I Section 8 did not give Congress this total power over my \"right to smoke,\" I can see how a reading of the \"right to smoke\" amendment being limited to an individual citizen's right to have tobacco products at the very least makes more sense than Cornell's reading of the RKBA-for unlike the RKBA no one has to first take the unified power over tobacco use away from Congress to ensure that my \"right\" could be freely exercised. \n \n Yet I still think a reading of this \"right to smoke\" extending to marijuana is illogical even without Congress having the same power over it as it has over the militia. There is no historical link I can find between tobacco and marijuana other than the coincidence of sharing the same common method of ingestion. On the other hand, the RKBA and the right of self-defense have commonly been intertwined throughout history-self-defense being the far older and broader natural right and the RKBA being a more modern offshoot which supports the effective exercise of the former.",

   "According to irrefutable documentary evidence, Heller was wrong about the Second Amendment. No one is entitled to their own historical \"facts\" whether they be a Supreme Court Justice or not. Both the text and historical context of the Second Amendment disprove the Supreme Court's claims:\n \n \"Bear Arms\" means \"render military service\", as can be found in The Federalist 46. In it, if you follow the math, you will see that Madison is clear in stating that one-quarter of the population is \"able to bear arms\". (He states that the 25,000-30,000 persons (one hundredth of the whole number of souls) in a regular army are one twenty-fifth of the number \"able to bear arms\".) This makes sense only when it means one-quarter of the population is \"able to render military service\". If he meant it to mean \"able to carry weapons\", then he would be saying that only one quarter of the population was \"able to carry weapons\". That would make for a population in which three quarters were so physically handicapped that they were not \"able to carry weapons\". It is not plausible that the percentage of handicapped Americans was 75% back in 1787 or 1788.\n \n Madison is saying that one quarter of the population is \"able to bear arms\" as in \"able to render military service\", as would be the case of the ability of the 25% portion who were able-bodied males, since they were the ones who were \"able to bear arms\" (that is, \"able to render military service\"). Madison's connotation of \"able to bear arms\" must mean \"able to render military service\" and cannot mean \"able to carry weapons\". It could not mean \"able to carry weapons\", because, again, anybody with the mere ability to grip and transport a gun would be \"able to carry weapons\". Even the 75% of the population (that is, women, children, and the aged) that were not \"able to bear arms\" (that is, \"render military service\") would be \"able to carry weapons\", as long as they had hands that could grip and were able to walk.\n \n In addition, as only one example of many, the Virginia Proposed Declaration of Rights (June 27, 1788), which was intended to be an amendment to the United States Constitution, states, \"That any person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms ought to be exempted, upon payment of an equivalent to employ another to bear arms in his stead.\" Since it would be absurd for the government to require a person to pay another person to carry weapons for the personal use of the former in the former's stead, the only plausible definition of the term \"bear arms\" in Virginia, the land of both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, was \"render military service\".\n \n The Fourth Amendment uses \"people\" to refer to the general populace and \"persons\" to refer to individuals. In fact, the unamended Constitution works the same way. It uses the word \"people\" 2 times, uses the word \"persons\" 4 times, and uses the word \"person\" 16 times. I think you would agree with me that although \"persons\" is the plural of \"person\", \"people\" must mean something different than \"persons\", or the Founders would not have used both terms.\n \n The Framers were quite precise in their word usage. For example, if one looks into the evolution of the First Amendment, he will see that Madison evidently incorrectly cast the rights of free speech and freedom to write as rights of the people (that is, the general populace). That is why the First Congress, evidently seeing the error in Madison's words, recast these rights as general rights and not as rights of the people (that is, the general populace) specifically. Meanwhile, they kept the rights of assembly and petition as rights of the people (that is, the general populace).\n \n In the unamended Constitution, the right of electing the House members is that of the people (that is, the general populace). Election by the people means by the general populace. After all, not every individual votes for the winner of the election, not every individual votes in the election, and not every individual is even eligible to vote in the election to begin with.\n \n Getting back to the Fourth Amendment, it is not plausible that the Framers would use \"persons\" twice to mean \"individuals\" after having previously used the word \"people\" to mean \"individuals\". That is why in the Fifth Amendment, which encompasses the rights of accused individuals, the word \"person\" is used twice, and the word \"people\" is not used at all.\n \n In addition, since \"people\" refers to the general populace and not to individuals, \"keep\" refers to the storage of weapons by the general populace and not to the private possession of weapons by individuals. This is not inconsistent with the rest of the Constitution. The word \"keep\" is used twice in the unamended Constitution; in neither Article I, Section 5, Clause 3 nor Article I, Section 10, Clause 3 does \"keep\" in any way connote personal private possession.\n \n In addition, this connotation of \"keep\" is perpetuated in modern state statutes that provide for the keeping of National Guard weapons in public depositories.\n \n As far as the public storage of weapons two centuries ago is concerned, \"An Act directing a detachment from the Militia of the United States, and for erecting certain Arsenals\" (March 3, 1803) appropriated money for arsenals that the President was to cause \"to be furnished with such arms, ammunition, and military stores as he may deem necessary.\" \"An Act making provision for arming and equipping the whole body of the Militia of the United States\" (April 23, 1808) authorized the President \"to purchase sites for, and erect such additional arsenals and manufactories of arms, as he may deem expedient, under the limitations and restrictions now provided by law[.]\"\n \n And General Knox spoke before the House on December 10, 1794, on the deficiencies of the 1792 Militia Act. Among his statements were \"The deficiency cannot be supplied from Europe under the present circumstances. The only solid resource to obtain a supply, is the establishment of manufactories in each State.\" He stated also, \"The deficiency of arms cannot be more forcibly exemplified than that, to arm the militia lately called into service, estimated at fifteen thousand, the number of ten thousand arms have been issued from the public Arsenals.\"\n \n As for \"A well regulated Militia\", this term is repeatedly used in The Federalist Papers (Number 29), the Anti-Federalist Papers (\"John DeWitt V\" and \"Aristides\"), and Luther Martin's \"Genuine Information\" to refer to the Article I Militia in the Constitution. And 10 U.S.C. 101 and 32 U.S.C. 101 explicitly state that the National Guard is the Article I Militia. Therefore, using the mathematical principle that if A=B and C=B, then A=C, if \"A well regulated Militia\" = the Article I Militia and the National Guard = the Article I Militia, then \"A well regulated Militia\" must = the National Guard.\n \n The 1792 Militia Act was abolished in 1903. The definition of the Militia, which had been codified by that statute, has been modified by the subsequent statutes that have been adopted in place of the 1792 statute. \"Militia\" has multiple meanings based on context, but that is only in the colloquial sense. (For example, the term \"political party\" has a specific statutory meaning. One cannot simply gather a bunch of friends in his living room, plan some political activities, and be a political party in the statutory sense (even if they get on the ballot)). In the legal and statutory sense, \"Militia\" means a very specific thing, as defined by the United States Code.\n \n The National Guard is indeed the Militia. It is the same entity as the Organized State Militia of 1789 with a modern name. The Dick Act of 1903 codified the National Guard as the Organized State Militia. 10 U.S.C. 101 and 32 U.S.C. 101 (as well as U.S.C. 311) have been on the books for years and are in accordance with Congress's Article I power to organize the Militia.\n \n The National Guard, since 1916, has been part of the Army only when it is in the service of the United States. When it is not in the service of the United States, it is the Organized State Militia under the auspices of the state. This point was affirmed in both the case of Dukakis v. Department of Defense (1988-1989), which was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court, and the case of Perpich v. Department of Defense (1987-1990), which was heard and affirmed by the Supreme Court in a case that it actually got right.\n \n In terms of the \"Bill of Rights\", there are no such words on that document. Paraphrasing, they are simply the amendments to the Constitution. For example, if you go to Washington, D.C., to see the actual original document that contains the amendments that were sent to the states for ratification, you will see that there are actually 12 original amendments. The first one (relevant to increases in representation in the House of Representatives) was never ratified, and the \"second\" amendment (prohibiting members of Congress from increasing their own pay) was not ratified until 1992. (It is now the Twenty-Seventh Amendment.) These are hardly individual rights.",

Both the text and historical context of the Second Amendment disprove the Supreme Court's claims:\n\n \n SNIP\n \n What a load of bull. Like most others here, you're wrong.\n \n Your entire argument regarding \"bear arms\" is shot to pieces by the fact that the Second Amendment specifically says \"keep and bear arms\". \"Keep\" has no definition in military terms, and there would be no reason for soldiers to be armed during times of peace in colonial days, so your argument fails.\n \n Furthermore the argument that the Second Amendment has some military connection, rather than protecting an individual right of the people to be armed, would suggest that there's no right to personal property. If the guns owned by the minutemen were part of military equipment then they couldn't be owned by the people, rather just borrowed, and only for a specific event and time.\n \n The National Guard argument has been eviscerated for far longer than the existence of the Heller ruling. The National Guard works for the government, is trained by the government, is outfitted and armed by the government. To argue that the Second Amendment is about the National Guard is to suggest that the Second Amendment's true purpose is to guarantee an army for the government to wield in whatever manner it sees fit.\n \n Basically your whole argument boils down to the notion that the Bill of Rights is designed to empower the government and harm the people of the United States.",

   "  V. Drafting of the Federal Bill of Rights \n When James Madison found himself cast in the unlikely role of father of the national bill of rights,[234] he was not forced to write upon a clean slate. His first step was to obtain a pamphlet which conveniently listed all state proposals, from the Pennsylvania minority onward.[235] The problem became one of editing; out of hundreds of proposals, many redundant and some questionable, a hard core of usable proposals had to be selected. The barriers to be surmounted required discarding all controversial proposals. ....\n \n Madison's decision to include a right to arms in his federal bill of rights is hardly surprising. Such a right had been demanded in virtually every call for a bill of rights; indeed, it had received twice the number of demands accorded freedom of speech.[238] Language praising the militia had received much less support, essentially having been appended to the right to arms clause in Virginia and the two following conventions.[239] But an adaptation of the Virginia/New York/North Carolina wording combining the two held unusual promise. One of Madison's major objectives was to \"bring in\" North Carolina.[240] He hoped to convince it to ratify the Constitution by offering an acceptable bill of rights. North Carolina could hardly object to a nearly verbatim acceptance of its demand.\n \n A combination of a militia statement with individual right recognition fitted Madison's objectives perfectly. The militia statement, standing alone, would likely be unacceptable to groups typified by the Pennsylvania minority, Sam Adams and his supporters, the New Hampshire majority, and possibly Jefferson himself, all of whom had advocated an individual right to arms clause and none of whose efforts had so much as mentioned the militia. An individual right to arms clause standing alone might well have irritated militia supporters such as George Mason and possibly Richard Henry Lee, both powerful Virginians with whom Madison still had to deal and who would vote on his proposal, Mason in the Virginia legislature and Lee in the federal Senate.[241]\n",

Among his statements were \"The deficiency cannot be supplied from Europe under the present circumstances. The only solid resource to obtain a supply, is the establishment of manufactories in each State.\" He stated also, \"The deficiency of arms cannot be more forcibly exemplified than that, to arm the militia lately called into service, estimated at fifteen thousand, the number of ten thousand arms have been issued from the public Arsenals.\"\n \n As for \"A well regulated Militia\", this term is repeatedly used in The Federalist Papers (Number 29), the Anti-Federalist Papers (\"John DeWitt V\" and \"Aristides\"), and Luther Martin's \"Genuine Information\" to refer to the Article I Militia in the Constitution. And 10 U.S.C. 101 and 32 U.S.C. 101 explicitly state that the National Guard is the Article I Militia. Therefore, using the mathematical principle that if A=B and C=B, then A=C, if \"A well regulated Militia\" = the Article I Militia and the National Guard = the Article I Militia, then \"A well regulated Militia\" must = the National Guard.\n \n The 1792 Militia Act was abolished in 1903. The definition of the Militia, which had been codified by that statute, has been modified by the subsequent statutes that have been adopted in place of the 1792 statute. \"Militia\" has multiple meanings based on context, but that is only in the colloquial sense. (For example, the term \"political party\" has a specific statutory meaning. One cannot simply gather a bunch of friends in his living room, plan some political activities, and be a political party in the statutory sense (even if they get on the ballot)). In the legal and statutory sense, \"Militia\" means a very specific thing, as defined by the United States Code.\n \n The National Guard is indeed the Militia. It is the same entity as the Organized State Militia of 1789 with a modern name. The Dick Act of 1903 codified the National Guard as the Organized State Militia. 10 U.S.C. 101 and 32 U.S.C. 101 (as well as U.S.C. 311) have been on the books for years and are in accordance with Congress's Article I power to organize the Militia.\n \n The National Guard, since 1916, has been part of the Army only when it is in the service of the United States. When it is not in the service of the United States, it is the Organized State Militia under the auspices of the state. This point was affirmed in both the case of Dukakis v. Department of Defense (1988-1989), which was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court, and the case of Perpich v. Department of Defense (1987-1990), which was heard and affirmed by the Supreme Court in a case that it actually got right.\n \n In terms of the \"Bill of Rights\", there are no such words on that document. Paraphrasing, they are simply the amendments to the Constitution. For example, if you go to Washington, D.C., to see the actual original document that contains the amendments that were sent to the states for ratification, you will see that there are actually 12 original amendments. The first one (relevant to increases in representation in the House of Representatives) was never ratified, and the \"second\" amendment (prohibiting members of Congress from increasing their own pay) was not ratified until 1992. (It is now the Twenty-Seventh Amendment.) These are hardly individual rights.\n\n \n Not unlike Bryan, I am waiting for the other shoe to drop. You gloss over 10 USC 311 when you should have cited it. Why did you gloss over the militia definition?\n \n States also have militias that are NOT subject to call into the federal forces. The Governor and Adjutant General share control and appointment of officers.\n \n You seem to think only 12 original amendments were eligible for adoption despite mentioning 27? What is your illogic when the very purpose of the BOR was to remove especially those topics from further debate and control of the federal government which has only those powers mentioned and named to limit their powers in Article 1, Section 8. The 9th and 10 amendments go farther to assure all rights missed by the BOR belong to the people or the States. I see you standing firmly between the BOR which would never have led to adoption of the Constitution until they were ratified, and the few and enumerated powers of the Federal Government which has usurped powers never intended.\n \n I would like to see the rest of your speil, a man can never have enough rope...",

   "\n \"Bear Arms\" means \"render military service\", as can be found in The Federalist 46. In it, if you follow the math, you will see that Madison is clear in stating that one-quarter of the population is \"able to bear arms\". (He states that the 25,000-30,000 persons (one hundredth of the whole number of souls) in a regular army are one twenty-fifth of the number \"able to bear arms\".) This makes sense only when it means one-quarter of the population is \"able to render military service\". If he meant it to mean \"able to carry weapons\", then he would be saying that only one quarter of the population was \"able to carry weapons\". That would make for a population in which three quarters were so physically handicapped that they were not \"able to carry weapons\". It is not plausible that the percentage of handicapped Americans was 75% back in 1787 or 1788.\n \n Madison is saying that one quarter of the population is \"able to bear arms\" as in \"able to render military service\", as would be the case of the ability of the 25% portion who were able-bodied males, since they were the ones who were \"able to bear arms\" (that is, \"able to render military service\"). Madison's connotation of \"able to bear arms\" must mean \"able to render military service\" and cannot mean \"able to carry weapons\". It could not mean \"able to carry weapons\", because, again, anybody with the mere ability to grip and transport a gun would be \"able to carry weapons\". Even the 75% of the population (that is, women, children, and the aged) that were not \"able to bear arms\" (that is, \"render military service\") would be \"able to carry weapons\", as long as they had hands that could grip and were able to walk.\n \n In addition, as only one example of many, the Virginia Proposed Declaration of Rights (June 27, 1788), which was intended to be an amendment to the United States Constitution, states, \"That any person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms ought to be exempted, upon payment of an equivalent to employ another to bear arms in his stead.\" Since it would be absurd for the government to require a person to pay another person to carry weapons for the personal use of the former in the former's stead, the only plausible definition of the term \"bear arms\" in Virginia, the land of both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, was \"render military service\".\n\n Scalia's explanation of the conscientious objector clause was that certain people who were \"opposed to carrying weapons for potential violent confrontation would not be 'compelled to render military service,' in which such carrying would be required.\" The interesting thing here is that Scalia is attributing an idiomatic meaning to bear arms: bear arms means \"carrying weapons for potential violent confrontation\" rather than simply carry weapons. Although this idiomatic meaning is not limited to military use of weapons, it does seem to contradict Scalia's earlier claim about bear arms not having an idiomatic meaning. \n \n That is a good point about Federalist 46. Yes, it seems extremely improbable that Madison was saying that 75% of the American population were so handicapped that they could not even pick up a gun and carry it. \n \n \n\n The Fourth Amendment uses \"people\" to refer to the general populace and \"persons\" to refer to individuals. In fact, the unamended Constitution works the same way. It uses the word \"people\" 2 times, uses the word \"persons\" 4 times, and uses the word \"person\" 16 times. I think you would agree with me that although \"persons\" is the plural of \"person\", \"people\" must mean something different than \"persons\", or the Founders would not have used both terms.\n \n The Framers were quite precise in their word usage. For example, if one looks into the evolution of the First Amendment, he will see that Madison evidently incorrectly cast the rights of free speech and freedom to write as rights of the people (that is, the general populace). That is why the First Congress, evidently seeing the error in Madison's words, recast these rights as general rights and not as rights of the people (that is, the general populace) specifically. Meanwhile, they kept the rights of assembly and petition as rights of the people (that is, the general populace).\n \n In the unamended Constitution, the right of electing the House members is that of the people (that is, the general populace). Election by the people means by the general populace. After all, not every individual votes for the winner of the election, not every individual votes in the election, and not every individual is even eligible to vote in the election to begin with.\n \n Getting back to the Fourth Amendment, it is not plausible that the Framers would use \"persons\" twice to mean \"individuals\" after having previously used the word \"people\" to mean \"individuals\". That is why in the Fifth Amendment, which encompasses the rights of accused individuals, the word \"person\" is used twice, and the word \"people\" is not used at all.\n\n Constitutional scholar Akhil Reed Amar agrees, \"The amendment speaks of a right of 'the people' collectively rather than a right of 'persons' individually.... libertarians read 'the people' to mean atomized private persons, each hunting in his own private Idaho, rather than the citizenry acting collectively. But, when the Constitution speaks of 'the people' rather than 'persons,' the collective connotation is primary. 'We the People' in the preamble do ordain and establish the Constitution as public citizens meeting together in conventions and acting in concert, not as private individuals pursuing our respective hobbies.\"\n \n \n\n In addition, since \"people\" refers to the general populace and not to individuals, \"keep\" refers to the storage of weapons by the general populace and not to the private possession of weapons by individuals. This is not inconsistent with the rest of the Constitution. The word \"keep\" is used twice in the unamended Constitution; in neither Article I, Section 5, Clause 3 nor Article I, Section 10, Clause 3 does \"keep\" in any way connote personal private possession.\n \n In addition, this connotation of \"keep\" is perpetuated in modern state statutes that provide for the keeping of National Guard weapons in public depositories.As far as the public storage of weapons two centuries ago is concerned, \"An Act directing a detachment from the Militia of the United States, and for erecting certain Arsenals\" (March 3, 1803) appropriated money for arsenals that the President was to cause \"to be furnished with such arms, ammunition, and military stores as he may deem necessary.\" \"An Act making provision for arming and equipping the whole body of the Militia of the United States\" (April 23, 1808) authorized the President \"to purchase sites for, and erect such additional arsenals and manufactories of arms, as he may deem expedient, under the limitations and restrictions now provided by law[.]\"\n \n And General Knox spoke before the House on December 10, 1794, on the deficiencies of the 1792 Militia Act. Among his statements were \"The deficiency cannot be supplied from Europe under the present circumstances. The only solid resource to obtain a supply, is the establishment of manufactories in each State.\" He stated also, \"The deficiency of arms cannot be more forcibly exemplified than that, to arm the militia lately called into service, estimated at fifteen thousand, the number of ten thousand arms have been issued from the public Arsenals.\"\n\n An excerpt from the debates of the First Congress about the proposed Bill of Rights:\n \n \"Mr. SCOTT objected to the clause in the sixth amendment, 'No person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms.' He said, if this becomes part of the constitution, we can neither call upon such persons for services nor an equivalent; it is attended with still further difficulties, for you can never depend upon your militia. This will lead to the violation of another article in the constitution, which secures to the people the right of keeping arms, as in this case you must have recourse to a standing army. I conceive it is a matter of legislative right altogether. I know there are many sects religiously scrupulous in this respect: I am not for abridging them of any indulgence by law; my design is to guard against those who are of no religion. It is said that religion is on the decline; if this is the case, it is an argument in my favour; for when the time comes that there is no religion, persons will more generally have recourse to these pretexts to get excused.\"\n \n Mr. Scott fears that if people can get out of militia duty by falsely claiming that they are religiously scrupulous in that matter then that would lead to a violation of \"the right of keeping arms\". If keeping arms merely means personally possess weapons at home this would not make sense- those excused from militia duty could still possess their own guns at home. Mr. Scott's objection only makes sense if the right is understood as a duty to participate in the militia. \n \n \n\n As for \"A well regulated Militia\", this term is repeatedly used in The Federalist Papers (Number 29), the Anti-Federalist Papers (\"John DeWitt V\" and \"Aristides\"), and Luther Martin's \"Genuine Information\" to refer to the Article I Militia in the Constitution.

The unorganized militia is a mere statutory construct for the purpose of maintaining an appearance of compliance with the original vision that Founders such as Madison had about the militia. R. Ernest Dupuy, author of The National Guard: A Compact History, writes:\n \n \"It [1903 Militia Act also know as the Dick Act] divided American male citizenry into two classes: the National Guard (organized militia) and the Reserve Militia in which were lumped all other male citizens between the ages of 18 and 45.... as to the Reserve Militia, this legal fiction at least perpetuated the original colonial concept of universal military obligations.\"",

   "I must disagree with the vast majority of what has recently been said. I still would like to see what MBell has to say about his interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment. Still, there is a lot to be said so far and I want to do it in installments. I want to start with the collectivization of the phrase &#8220;the right of the people&#8221; in the 2nd. and (because it is the same) in the 4th. Amendment. If, as the argument seems to suggest, the use of the word &#8220;people&#8221; means only the many acting collectively, then I believe we are waiving a dismissive hand at the entire history of 4th. Amendment jurisprudence. This is how I view your argument, MBell (and also the Amar citation offered by Galileo).\n \n Now let me insert a quote here from, of all persons, Rudyard Kipling (from a poem in the story &#8220;The Elephant&#8217;s Child&#8221; in his &#8220;Just So Stories&#8221; published in 1902):\n \n I keep six honest serving-men\n (They taught me all I knew);\n Their names are What and Why and When\n And How and Where and Who.\n \n Here, then, is my counter argument....The word &#8220;people&#8221; in the Constitution answers the question of &#8220;who&#8221; and not the question of &#8220;how.&#8221; When referring to a &#8220;right,&#8221; the word &#8220;people&#8221; in the Constitution always refers to who may exercise the right&#8212;it does not define how that right must be exercised. But that is exactly what the collective right interpretation tries to. It takes the proper focus away from who can exercise the right, and it instead seeks to bind the right itself to only being exercised in a particular (ie. collective) manner. \n \n In my opinion it is a very short sighted and dangerous argument to make. Now I understand that the real aim of the collective interpretation of the phrase &#8220;the right of the people&#8221; is the 2nd. Amendment RKBA. However, because the same phrase exists in the 4th. Amendment, the collective RKBA interpreter would sacrifice the individual right view of the 4th Amendment for the sake of carrying his point on the 2nd Amendment. \n \n SCOTUS has always viewed the phrase &#8220;the right of the people&#8221; in the 4th Amendment to recognize an individual&#8217;s right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure of his individual person, his individual papers, his individual house, and his individual effects. (Indeed, it is so individualized a right that you cannot complain when the rights of other individuals are violated. If, for example, you and I are out on the town together, and you have a gun in your pocket that I used to kill a man with, and the police jump you, search you, and seize the gun in violation of the 4th. Amendment, then I have no right to keep that evidence out of any trial against me, for I do not have standing to object to an illegal search of your person.) \n \n But if the words &#8220;the right of the people&#8221; mean I can only exercise my right to &#8220;keep and bear arms&#8221; collectively as part of a militia unit, then does it not also follow that I must only have a right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure in collective meeting houses (a church, for example)? Do I lose my individual right to be free from an unreasonable search of my private residence because my expectation of privacy in that house is individualized, and not shared collectively by the body of &#8220;the people&#8221;? Is there a way the phrase &#8220;the right of the people&#8221; can mean a collective right in the 2nd., only to be transformed into a right of the individual in the 4th.?\n \n To me, the collective right argument remains an effort to force a square peg through a round hole, and this strained interpretation of the word &#8220;people&#8221; ignores the accepted SCOTUS precedent on the word. Consider, for example, the case of United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 265 (1990). In that case, A Mexican national&#8217;s private house in Mexico was searched by DEA agents, and the agents found documents which they used against him at his US drug trafficking trial. The defendant argued that the DEA search of his house violated his 4th. Amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure. SCOTUS ruled that the 4th. Amendment does not extend to protect a house in Mexico, and it further ruled that, as a Mexican national, he was not one of &#8220;the people&#8221; who could claim the protection of that individual right. Here is where the word &#8220;people&#8221; is put into proper context:\n \n  \n &#8220;the people&#8221; seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts of the Constitution. The Preamble declares that the Constitution is ordained and established by &#8220;the people of the United States.&#8221; The Second Amendment protects &#8220;the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,&#8221; and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments provide that certain rights and powers are retained by and reserved to &#8220;the people.&#8221; See also U.S. Const., Amdt. 1 (&#8220;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble&#8221;) (emphasis added); Art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 1 (&#8220;The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the people of the several States&#8221;) (emphasis added). While this textual exegesis is by no means conclusive, it suggests that &#8220;the people&#8221; protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second Amendments, and to whom rights and powers are reserved in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community. See United States ex rel. Turner v. Williams, 194 U.S. 279, 292 (1904) (Excludable alien is not entitled to First Amendment rights, because &#8220;[h]e does not become one of the people to whom these things are secured by our Constitution by an attempt to enter forbidden by law&#8221;). \n \n Thus, the word &#8220;people&#8221; refers to a category of individuals capable of laying claim to individual rights. And as I have argued, the word limits the right which follows by defining who may exercise it&#8212;not by defining how it must be exercised (ie. only as a collective body). For example, &#8220;the people&#8221; have a right to vote for a member of Congress. The word &#8220;people&#8221; does not convert this individual right into a right to vote only as part of some collective voting bloc. Instead, the use of the word &#8220;people&#8221; means that to vote I must demonstrate that I am one of &#8220;the people&#8221; entitled to cast my individual ballot (and that I am not, for example, a foreign national). And because I am one of &#8220;the people&#8221; who can vote I can exercise that choice individually to vote for whomever I personally choose, or choose not to vote at all. \n \n I am very glad to see this thread taking on new life again&#8212;but I do not agree with you, MBell and Galileo (and Amar), and I wanted to start my explanation of my disagreements here. Your comments are welcome&#8230;.",

   "Scalia's explanation of the conscientious objector clause was that certain people who were \"opposed to carrying weapons for potential violent confrontation would not be 'compelled to render military service,' in which such carrying would be required.\" The interesting thing here is that Scalia is attributing an idiomatic meaning to bear arms: bear arms means \"carrying weapons for potential violent confrontation\" rather than simply carry weapons. Although this idiomatic meaning is not limited to military use of weapons, it does seem to contradict Scalia's earlier claim about bear arms not having an idiomatic meaning. \n\n \n \n You are conflating connotation and figurative meaning. Scalia explained the difference and pointed out the absurdity of claiming \"bear arms\" is figuartive expression while leaving \"keep and\" just hanging there. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n An excerpt from the debates of the First Congress about the proposed Bill of Rights:\n \n \"Mr. SCOTT objected to the clause in the sixth amendment, 'No person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms.' He said, if this becomes part of the constitution, we can neither call upon such persons for services nor an equivalent; it is attended with still further difficulties, for you can never depend upon your militia. This will lead to the violation of another article in the constitution, which secures to the people the right of keeping arms, as in this case you must have recourse to a standing army. I conceive it is a matter of legislative right altogether. I know there are many sects religiously scrupulous in this respect: I am not for abridging them of any indulgence by law; my design is to guard against those who are of no religion. It is said that religion is on the decline; if this is the case, it is an argument in my favour; for when the time comes that there is no religion, persons will more generally have recourse to these pretexts to get excused.\"\n \n Mr. Scott fears that if people can get out of militia duty by falsely claiming that they are religiously scrupulous in that matter then that would lead to a violation of \"the right of keeping arms\". If keeping arms merely means personally possess weapons at home this would not make sense- those excused from militia duty could still possess their own guns at home. Mr. Scott's objection only makes sense if the right is understood as a duty to participate in the militia. \n\n \n \n \n \n Mr Scott seems to have feared that if the \"equivalent\" payment is not forced from those, probably falsely, claiming religious exemption from service then the fund for delinquents, which was used to purchase muskets for those too poor to provide one for themselves, would dry up, thus depriving the poor of their right to keep arms. \n \n Collective rights advocates read Scott's comment as suggesting the right to keep arms is collective, However in the same comment Scott cites the CO clause which plainly speaks of bear(ing) arms as the action of an individual, and it makes little sense to insist \"Keep\" in \"the right to keep and bear arms\" is collective while \"bear\" is individual. Scott's objection to failing to enforce the \"equivalent\" provides a clue for a more likely explanation of what he meant by \"violation of another article in the constitution, which secures to the people the right of keeping arms\".\n \n Also collectoive rights advocates seem unable to grasp the difference between a right and a duty, but early state constitutions such as PA had separate sections regarding militia duty and the right to bear arms.",

   "According to irrefutable documentary evidence, Heller was wrong about the Second Amendment. No one is entitled to their own historical \"facts\" whether they be a Supreme Court Justice or not. Both the text and historical context of the Second Amendment disprove the Supreme Court's claims:\n \n \"Bear Arms\" means \"render military service\", as can be found in The Federalist 46. In it, if you follow the math, you will see that Madison is clear in stating that one-quarter of the population is \"able to bear arms\". (He states that the 25,000-30,000 persons (one hundredth of the whole number of souls) in a regular army are one twenty-fifth of the number \"able to bear arms\".) This makes sense only when it means one-quarter of the population is \"able to render military service\". If he meant it to mean \"able to carry weapons\", then he would be saying that only one quarter of the population was \"able to carry weapons\". That would make for a population in which three quarters were so physically handicapped that they were not \"able to carry weapons\". It is not plausible that the percentage of handicapped Americans was 75% back in 1787 or 1788.\n \n Madison is saying that one quarter of the population is \"able to bear arms\" as in \"able to render military service\", as would be the case of the ability of the 25% portion who were able-bodied males, since they were the ones who were \"able to bear arms\" (that is, \"able to render military service\"). Madison's connotation of \"able to bear arms\" must mean \"able to render military service\" and cannot mean \"able to carry weapons\". It could not mean \"able to carry weapons\", because, again, anybody with the mere ability to grip and transport a gun would be \"able to carry weapons\". Even the 75% of the population (that is, women, children, and the aged) that were not \"able to bear arms\" (that is, \"render military service\") would be \"able to carry weapons\", as long as they had hands that could grip and were able to walk.\n \n In addition, as only one example of many, the Virginia Proposed Declaration of Rights (June 27, 1788), which was intended to be an amendment to the United States Constitution, states, \"That any person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms ought to be exempted, upon payment of an equivalent to employ another to bear arms in his stead.\" Since it would be absurd for the government to require a person to pay another person to carry weapons for the personal use of the former in the former's stead, the only plausible definition of the term \"bear arms\" in Virginia, the land of both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, was \"render military service\".\n \n The Fourth Amendment uses \"people\" to refer to the general populace and \"persons\" to refer to individuals. In fact, the unamended Constitution works the same way. It uses the word \"people\" 2 times, uses the word \"persons\" 4 times, and uses the word \"person\" 16 times. I think you would agree with me that although \"persons\" is the plural of \"person\", \"people\" must mean something different than \"persons\", or the Founders would not have used both terms.\n \n The Framers were quite precise in their word usage. For example, if one looks into the evolution of the First Amendment, he will see that Madison evidently incorrectly cast the rights of free speech and freedom to write as rights of the people (that is, the general populace). That is why the First Congress, evidently seeing the error in Madison's words, recast these rights as general rights and not as rights of the people (that is, the general populace) specifically. Meanwhile, they kept the rights of assembly and petition as rights of the people (that is, the general populace).\n \n In the unamended Constitution, the right of electing the House members is that of the people (that is, the general populace). Election by the people means by the general populace. After all, not every individual votes for the winner of the election, not every individual votes in the election, and not every individual is even eligible to vote in the election to begin with.\n \n Getting back to the Fourth Amendment, it is not plausible that the Framers would use \"persons\" twice to mean \"individuals\" after having previously used the word \"people\" to mean \"individuals\". That is why in the Fifth Amendment, which encompasses the rights of accused individuals, the word \"person\" is used twice, and the word \"people\" is not used at all.\n \n In addition, since \"people\" refers to the general populace and not to individuals, \"keep\" refers to the storage of weapons by the general populace and not to the private possession of weapons by individuals. This is not inconsistent with the rest of the Constitution. The word \"keep\" is used twice in the unamended Constitution; in neither Article I, Section 5, Clause 3 nor Article I, Section 10, Clause 3 does \"keep\" in any way connote personal private possession.\n \n In addition, this connotation of \"keep\" is perpetuated in modern state statutes that provide for the keeping of National Guard weapons in public depositories.\n \n As far as the public storage of weapons two centuries ago is concerned, \"An Act directing a detachment from the Militia of the United States, and for erecting certain Arsenals\" (March 3, 1803) appropriated money for arsenals that the President was to cause \"to be furnished with such arms, ammunition, and military stores as he may deem necessary.\" \"An Act making provision for arming and equipping the whole body of the Militia of the United States\" (April 23, 1808) authorized the President \"to purchase sites for, and erect such additional arsenals and manufactories of arms, as he may deem expedient, under the limitations and restrictions now provided by law[.]\"\n \n And General Knox spoke before the House on December 10, 1794, on the deficiencies of the 1792 Militia Act. Among his statements were \"The deficiency cannot be supplied from Europe under the present circumstances. The only solid resource to obtain a supply, is the establishment of manufactories in each State.\" He stated also, \"The deficiency of arms cannot be more forcibly exemplified than that, to arm the militia lately called into service, estimated at fifteen thousand, the number of ten thousand arms have been issued from the public Arsenals.\"\n \n As for \"A well regulated Militia\", this term is repeatedly used in The Federalist Papers (Number 29), the Anti-Federalist Papers (\"John DeWitt V\" and \"Aristides\"), and Luther Martin's \"Genuine Information\" to refer to the Article I Militia in the Constitution. And 10 U.S.C. 101 and 32 U.S.C. 101 explicitly state that the National Guard is the Article I Militia. Therefore, using the mathematical principle that if A=B and C=B, then A=C, if \"A well regulated Militia\" = the Article I Militia and the National Guard = the Article I Militia, then \"A well regulated Militia\" must = the National Guard.\n \n The 1792 Militia Act was abolished in 1903. The definition of the Militia, which had been codified by that statute, has been modified by the subsequent statutes that have been adopted in place of the 1792 statute. \"Militia\" has multiple meanings based on context, but that is only in the colloquial sense. (For example, the term \"political party\" has a specific statutory meaning. One cannot simply gather a bunch of friends in his living room, plan some political activities, and be a political party in the statutory sense (even if they get on the ballot)). In the legal and statutory sense, \"Militia\" means a very specific thing, as defined by the United States Code.\n \n The National Guard is indeed the Militia. It is the same entity as the Organized State Militia of 1789 with a modern name. The Dick Act of 1903 codified the National Guard as the Organized State Militia. 10 U.S.C. 101 and 32 U.S.C. 101 (as well as U.S.C. 311) have been on the books for years and are in accordance with Congress's Article I power to organize the Militia.\n \n The National Guard, since 1916, has been part of the Army only when it is in the service of the United States. When it is not in the service of the United States, it is the Organized State Militia under the auspices of the state. This point was affirmed in both the case of Dukakis v. Department of Defense (1988-1989), which was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court, and the case of Perpich v. Department of Defense (1987-1990), which was heard and affirmed by the Supreme Court in a case that it actually got right.\n \n In terms of the \"Bill of Rights\", there are no such words on that document. Paraphrasing, they are simply the amendments to the Constitution. For example, if you go to Washington, D.C., to see the actual original document that contains the amendments that were sent to the states for ratification, you will see that there are actually 12 original amendments. The first one (relevant to increases in representation in the House of Representatives) was never ratified, and the \"second\" amendment (prohibiting members of Congress from increasing their own pay) was not ratified until 1992. (It is now the Twenty-Seventh Amendment.) These are hardly individual rights.\n\n \n That sounds like GErnst hockey to me. Is that you Ernst? You want to engage me yet again and have your rump handed to you in your hat?\n \n Your MO is to show up before a SCOTUS decision and try to gain some support for your commie/facist theory? You aren't going to try to claim Judge Silberman was right in the Parker case again are you? How about your interpretation of the militia? You already fell on your own sword taking that tact. ...and here you are, back for another propaganda lesson...and a severe lashing of Constitutional acumen.\n \n How many boards are you spamming with this _____? Identify yourself and quit hiding in the dark. As your favorite socialist, FDR, said, \"you have nothing to fear except fear itself\". I will even invite GunShow over for a bit of fun :) Or did you actually quit trying to prove your propaganda since that episode?",

   "The Second Amendment is not incorporated against the States through the Fourteenth. States can restrict gun ownership. \n \n And \n Perhaps, though it would go against their stance thus far.

The point is, because of unscrupulous people trying to Hijack the Bill of Rights, and say untrue things like is now being said about the 2nd Amendment. And because Freed Slaves were being denied their 2nd Amendment Rights by bigots and racist Anti-Constitutionalists, We the People not only proposed, passed, then ratified the 2nd Amendment not only once, BUT TWICE! That being the 2nd and the 14th Amendment. However, and While they were taking care of the 2nd Amendment, they also took care of the other 13 amendments, from the unscrupulous, after seeing how you guys would try and twist the Bill of Rights right out of We the People's hands. Kind of like you guys are trying to do to our Constitution now! emoticon_smile\n \n The historical FACTS on why We the People proposed, passed, then duly ratified the 14th Amendment! \n \n freedmen = Freed Slaves.\n   Institute for Justice -- 14th Amendment \n 2. The history and adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment demonstrates the Framer&#8217;s specific and repeated concern that freedmen were being disarmed by state and local governments and militias, in violation of what those Framers understood to be an individual constitutional right to bear arms. In response to this Court&#8217;s previous refusal to enforce parts of the Bill of Rights directly against the States, and its holding that blacks were not citizens of the United States entitled to the rights of such citizens, the Framers set out to remedy the inability to enforce numerous constitutional rights against the States by incorporating them into the Fourteenth Amendment. Identification of the evils the 39th Congress sought to remedy &#8211; including the disarming of freedmen &#8211; the parallel legislative responses to that problem, and the specific explanations by the Framers of the purpose and function of the Fourteenth Amendment, all demonstrate that they viewed the existing constitutional right to bear arms as an individual right of personal security. And they understood and intended the language of the Fourteenth Amendment to secure such a right against the States and various militias, not merely in the service of the very entities seeking to disarm and abuse the freedmen. And by accomplishing that goal through the identification and extension of the rights of national citizens, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment also clarified and defined the underlying rights in the Second Amendment as well.\n \n Whatever the basis for incorporation, however, the history of the Fourteenth Amendment shows that the right to bear arms was intended to be incorporated, and thus should be read as it was understood at the time of such incorporation. \n\n \n \n   Who Will Speak for the Second Amendment?  \n It reported that Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe had shocked many colleagues by stating that individual Americans did indeed have a right to keep and bear arms.\n he is \"probably the most influential living American constitutional scholar.\" Tribe&#8217;s treatise American Constitutional Law is a standard text in many law schools and has been cited over fifty times in Supreme Court opinions.  But Tribe corrected the oversight in a new edition published in 1999. \"As someone who takes the Constitution seriously, I thought I had a responsibility to see what the Second Amendment says, and how it fits,\" Tribe explained.\n\n \n   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says,  \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n\n I smell something cooking.

   "Your point is less than clear. Who are the unscrupulous people, and how are they trying to \"hijack the Bill of Rights\"?\n\n Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

Now where does that put you? \n \n \nAs I mentioned, the Second Amendment is not incorporated against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n As I said, Holding out to the last minute? emoticon_smile \n \n But I have to ask, when We the People make an amendment, and specifically the 14th Amendment, where does the Constitution say that the Supreme Court has the Right to Incorporate it? Did We the People instruct the SC to do so? We the People ARE the Supreme Authority. If anything, We the People have already incorporated it! Now if the SC wants to make that a formality, then whatever! \n \n \nThe original Constitution was never meant to apply against the States as it was after the incorporation of most of the Bill of Rights, so you're being contradictory by labelling some people \"anti-constitutionalists\" yet apparently anticipating the incorporation of the Second Amendment. Incorporation itself can be labelled \"anti-constitutional\".\n\n Where does the Constitution say that? Do you have any Founding documents to back that up? \n \n Here is what I see.\n   \n The Declaration of Independence \n When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\n\n Do you expect everyone to believe that We the People believed that their Federal Rights were Inalienable, and their State Rights were not? Is that what you are saying? Did you not say \"The original Constitution was never meant to apply against the States\" \n \n Do you expect everyone to believe that We the People were dead set against the Federal Government enslaving them? but it was OK for the States to do so? \n I also find things like this from our National Archives!\n   The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n i Alexander Hamilton 1775\n \n The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment,. or musty records. They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself,  and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power.\n \n Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to a fair and speedy trial&#8211;the ringing phrases that inventory some of Americans' most treasured personal freedoms&#8211;were not initially part of the U.S. Constitution. At the Constitutional Convention, the proposal to include a bill of rights was considered and defeated. The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution as the first ten amendments on December 15, 1791.\n \n The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights.\n\n And Here the Obama government recognizes this. \n \n  Rights and Responsibilities  \n Fundamental Rights\n \n This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n\n And here our Government recognizes: \n  Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people \n Democracies rest on the principle that government exists to serve the people. In other words, the people are citizens of the democratic state, not its subjects.\n \n These are the principles on which we are to read our Founding documents and these are the principles on which we are governed by the consent of the governed. \n \n So now, where do you stand? Or are you going to remain totally noncommittal?",

   "You are conflating connotation and figurative meaning. Scalia explained the difference and pointed out the absurdity of claiming \"bear arms\" is figuartive expression while leaving \"keep and\" just hanging there.\n\n Two possibilities here:\n 1) the whole phrase \"keep and bear arms\" could be an idiom meaning militia service\n 2) it could be an example of a zeugma (a figure of speech in which a word relates to other words in the same sentence in different ways)\n \n Examples:\n \"You are free to execute your laws, and your citizens, as you see fit.\"\n (Star Trek: The Next Generation)\n \n \"He took his coat and his leave.\"\n \n \n\n Mr Scott seems to have feared that if the \"equivalent\" payment is not forced from those, probably falsely, claiming religious exemption from service then the fund for delinquents, which was used to purchase muskets for those too poor to provide one for themselves, would dry up, thus depriving the poor of their right to keep arms.\n \n Collective rights advocates read Scott's comment as suggesting the right to keep arms is collective, However in the same comment Scott cites the CO clause which plainly speaks of bear(ing) arms as the action of an individual, and it makes little sense to insist \"Keep\" in \"the right to keep and bear arms\" is collective while \"bear\" is individual. Scott's objection to failing to enforce the \"equivalent\" provides a clue for a more likely explanation of what he meant by \"violation of another article in the constitution, which secures to the people the right of keeping arms\".\n \n Also collectoive rights advocates seem unable to grasp the difference between a right and a duty, but early state constitutions such as PA had separate sections regarding militia duty and the right to bear arms.\n\n If Scott thought that he could have advocated that a requirement to pay an equivalent be added as Mr. Jackson did. Furthermore, I don't know of any evidence that the Founders thought that poor people should be provided with arms by the government for their own private purposes. \n \n Blackstone said,\n \"Now the rights of persons that are commanded to be observed by the municipal law are of two sorts; first, such as are due from every citizen, which are usually called civil duties; and, secondly, such as belong to him, which is the more popular acceptation of rights or jura.\"\n \n So duties could be viewed as rights in that time period. The proposed CO clause would only make sense if the right protected by the Second Amendment is a duty. If the Second Amendment merely protects a right to keep guns at home and tote them around then debate about a CO clause is irrelevant.",

   "A lot of what is currently being argued has already been dealt with in Heller, so I want to go back to Heller to cite how it deals with these issues:\n \n \n\n Two possibilities here:\n 1) the whole phrase \"keep and bear arms\" could be an idiom meaning militia service\n 2) it could be an example of a zeugma (a figure of speech in which a word relates to other words in the same sentence in different ways)\n \n\n \n This is essentially what Justice Stevens argued in Heller. The response was:\n \n Finally, JUSTICE STEVENS suggests that \"keep and bear Arms\" was some sort of term of art, presumably akin to \"hue and cry\" or \"cease and desist.\" (This suggestion usefully evades the problem that there is no evidence whatsoever to support a military reading of \"keep arms.\") JUSTICE STEVENS believes that the unitary meaning of [Slip Op. 18] \"keep and bear Arms\" is established by the Second Amendment's calling it a \"right\" (singular) rather than \"rights\" (plural). See post, at 16. There is nothing to this. State constitutions of the founding period routinely grouped multiple (related) guarantees under a singular \"right,\" and the First Amendment protects the \"right [singular] of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" See, e.g., Pa. Declaration of Rights \u00a7\u00a7 IX, XII, XVI, in 5 Thorpe 3083-3084; Ohio Const., Arts. VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 19 (1802), in id., at 2910-2911.14 And even if \"keep and bear Arms\" were a unitary phrase, we find no evidence that it bore a military meaning. Although the phrase was not at all common (which would be unusual for a term of art), we have found instances of its use with a clearly nonmilitary connotation. In a 1780 debate in the House of Lords, for example, Lord Richmond described an order to disarm private citizens (not militia members) as \"a violation of the constitutional right of Protestant subjects to keep and bear arms for their own defense.\" 49 The London Magazine or Gentleman's Monthly Intelligencer 467 (1780). In response, another member of Parliament referred to \"the right of bearing arms for personal defence,\" making clear that no special military meaning for \"keep and bear arms\" was intended in the discussion. Id., at 467-468. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 17-18 (2008)\n \n Turning back to \"keep\" and \"bear\"....\n \n Samuel Johnson's 1773 dictionary defined \"keep\" this way: \"[t]o retain; not to lose,\" and \"[t]o have in custody.\" Webster's defined it this way: \"[t]o hold; to retain in one's power or possession.\"\n \n Heller dealt further with the word \"keep\" thus:\n \n The phrase \"keep arms\" was not prevalent in the written documents of the founding period that we have found, but there are a few examples, all of which favor viewing the right to \"keep Arms\" as an individual right unconnected with militia service. William Blackstone, for example, wrote that Catholics convicted of not attending service in the Church of England suffered certain penalties, one of which was that they were not permitted to \"keep arms in their houses.\" 4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 55 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone); see also 1 W. & M., c. 15, \u00a7 4, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 422 (1689) (\"[N]o Papist . . . shall or may have or keep in his House . . . any Arms . . . \"); 1 Hawkins, Treatise on the Pleas of the Crown 26 (1771) (similar). Petitioners point to militia laws of the founding period that required militia members to \"keep\" arms in connection with militia service, and they conclude from this that the phrase \"keep Arms\" has a militia-related connotation. See Brief for Petitioners 16-17 (citing laws of Delaware, New Jersey, and Virginia). This is rather like saying that, since there are many statutes that authorize aggrieved employees to \"file complaints\" with federal agencies, the phrase \"file complaints\" has an employment-related connotation. \"Keep arms\" was simply a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone else. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 9 (2008)\n \n And see the content of the footnote that followed this argument citing several non-military examples:\n \n See, e.g., 3 A Compleat Collection of State-Tryals 185 (1719) (\"Hath not every Subject power to keep Arms, as well as Servants in his House for defence of his Person?\"); T. Wood, A New Institute of the Imperial or Civil Law 282 (1730) (\"Those are guilty of publick Force, who keep Arms in their Houses, and make use of them otherwise than upon Journeys or Hunting, or for Sale . . .\"); A Collection of All the Acts of Assembly, Now in Force, in the Colony of Virginia 596 (1733) (\"Free Negros, Mulattos, or Indians, and Owners of Slaves, seated at Frontier Plantations, may obtain Licence from a Justice of Peace, for keeping Arms, &c;\"); J. Ayliffe, A New Pandect of Roman Civil Law 195 (1734) (\"Yet a Person might keep Arms in his House, or on his Estate, on the Account of Hunting, Navigation, Travelling, and on the Score of Selling them in the way of Trade or Commerce, or such Arms as accrued to him by way of Inheritance\"); J. Trusler, A Concise View of the Common Law and Statute Law of England 270 (1781) (\"if [papists] keep arms in their houses, such arms may be seized by a justice of the peace\"); Some Considerations on the Game Laws 54 (1796) (\"Who has been deprived by [the law] of keeping arms for his own defence? What law forbids the veriest pauper, if he can raise a sum sufficient for the purchase of it, from mounting his Gun on his Chimney Piece . . . ?\"); 3 B. Wilson, The Works of the Honourable James Wilson 84 (1804) (with reference to state constitutional right: \"This is one of our many renewals of the Saxon regulations. 'They were bound,' says Mr. Selden, 'to keep arms for the preservation of the kingdom, and of their own person'\"); W. Duer, Outlines of the Constitutional Jurisprudence of the United States 31-32 (1833) (with reference to colonists' English rights: \"The right of every individual to keep arms for his defence, suitable to his condition and degree; which was the public allowance, under due restrictions of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation\"); 3 R. Burn, Justice of the Peace and the Parish Officer 88 (1815) (\"It is, however, laid down by Serjeant Hawkins, . . . that if a lessee, after the end of the term, keep arms in his house to oppose the entry of the lessor, . . .\"); State v. Dempsey, 31 N. C. 384, 385 (1849) (citing 1840 state law making it a misdemeanor for a member of certain racial groups \"to carry about his person or keep in his house any shot gun or other arms\"). District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 64 (2008)\n \n Thus \"keep\" is quite different from \"bear.\" Those same dictionary sources cited above also define \"bear\" as \"carry.\" And even today Black's Law Dictionary defines \"carry arms or weapons\" as:\n \n \"To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.\" Black's Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).\n \n Souter-who dissented in Heller-even agreed (before Heller) with Scalia and Ginsburg that this is the definition of the word \"bear\" in the Second Amendment:\n \n Surely a most familiar meaning [of the word \"carry\"-Bryan] is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment (\"keep and bear Arms\") (emphasis added) and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: \"wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.\" Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 143 (1998) (Ginsburg, dissenting, joined by both Scalia and Souter)\n \n None of this has any requirement of militia service. True, the words \"bear arms\" are used at times in a military context. Heller correctly acknowledges this. What both MBell and the dissent argue, however, is that this must be the only possible context-when the evidence clearly shows otherwise. In doing so, they both chose to focus on circumstantial evidence (uses of \"bear arms\" in a military context in other writings) while ignoring the direct evidence of the words of the founders, such as Tench Coxe:\n \n As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms. Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1.\n \n But even setting aside what the founders actually said there is considerable evidence that the phrase \"bear arms\" has far more than a military only meaning-even enough to overcome a claim that the military only context is \"irrefutable.\" Again from the portion of Heller MBell has ignored: \n \n At the time of the founding, as now, to \"bear\" meant to \"carry.\" See Johnson 161; Webster; T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1796); 2 Oxford English Dictionary 20 (2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter Oxford). When used with \"arms,\" however, the term has a meaning that refers to carrying for a particular purpose - confrontation. In Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125 (1998), in the course of analyzing the meaning of \"carries a firearm\" in a federal criminal statute, JUSTICE GINSBURG wrote that \"[s]urely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment . . . indicate[s]: 'wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.'\" Id., at 143 (dissenting opinion) [Slip Op. 11] (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1998)). We think that JUSTICE GINSBURG accurately captured the natural meaning of \"bear arms.\" Although the phrase implies that the carrying of the weapon is for the purpose of \"offensive or defensive action,\" it in no way connotes participation in a structured military organization.\n \n From our review of founding-era sources, we conclude that this natural meaning was also the meaning that \"bear arms\" had in the 18th century. In numerous instances, \"bear arms\" was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. The most prominent examples are those most relevant to the Second Amendment: Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens to \"bear arms in defense of themselves and the state\" or \"bear arms in defense of himself and the state.\" 8 It is clear from those formulations that \"bear arms\" did not refer only to carrying [Slip Op. 12] a weapon in an organized military unit. Justice James Wilson interpreted the Pennsylvania Constitution's arms-bearing right, for example, as a recognition of the natural right of defense \"of one's person or house\" - what he called the law of \"self preservation.\" 2 Collected Works of James Wilson 1142, and n. x (K. Hall & M. Hall eds. 2007) (citing Pa. Const., Art. IX, \u00a7 21 (1790)); see also T. Walker, Introduction to American Law 198 (1837) (\"Thus the right of self-defence [is] guaranteed by the [Ohio] constitution\"); see also id., at 157 (equating Second Amendment with that provision of the Ohio Constitution). That was also the interpretation of those state constitutional provisions adopted by pre-Civil War state courts.9 These provisions demonstrate - again, in the most analogous linguistic context - that \"bear arms\" was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia.\n \n The phrase \"bear Arms\" also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight\" or \"to wage war.\" See Linguists' Brief 18; post, at 11 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition \"against,\" which was in turn followed by the target of the hostilities. See 2 Oxford 21. (That is how, for example, our Declaration of Independence \u00b6 28, used the phrase: \"He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country . . . .\") Every example given by petitioners' amici for the idiomatic meaning of \"bear arms\" [Slip Op. 13] from the founding period either includes the preposition \"against\" or is not clearly idiomatic. See Linguists' Brief 18-23. Without the preposition, \"bear arms\" normally meant (as it continues to mean today) what JUSTICE GINSBURG's opinion in Muscarello said.\n \n In any event, the meaning of \"bear arms\" that petitioners and JUSTICE STEVENS propose is not even the (sometimes) idiomatic meaning. Rather, they manufacture a hybrid definition, whereby \"bear arms\" connotes the actual carrying of arms (and therefore is not really an idiom) but only in the service of an organized militia. No dictionary has ever adopted that definition, and we have been apprised of no source that indicates that it carried that meaning at the time of the founding. But it is easy to see why petitioners and the dissent are driven to the hybrid definition. Giving \"bear Arms\" its idiomatic meaning would cause the protected right to consist of the right to be a soldier or to wage war - an absurdity that no commentator has ever endorsed. See L. Levy, Origins of the Bill of Rights 135 (1999). Worse still, the phrase \"keep and bear Arms\" would be incoherent. The word \"Arms\" would have two different meanings at once: \"weapons\" (as the object of \"keep\") and (as the object of \"bear\") one-half of an idiom. It would be rather like saying \"He filled and kicked the bucket\" to mean \"He filled the bucket and died.\" Grotesque.\n \n Petitioners justify their limitation of \"bear arms\" to the military context by pointing out the unremarkable fact that it was often used in that context - the same mistake they made with respect to \"keep arms.\" It is especially unremarkable that the phrase was often used in a military context in the federal legal sources (such as records of congressional debate) that have been the focus of petitioners' inquiry. Those sources would have had little occasion to use it except in discussions about the standing army and the militia. And the phrases used primarily in those [Slip Op. 14] military discussions include not only \"bear arms\" but also \"carry arms,\" \"possess arms,\" and \"have arms\" - though no one thinks that those other phrases also had special military meanings. See Barnett, Was the Right to Keep and Bear Arms Conditioned on Service in an Organized Militia?, 83 Tex. L. Rev. 237, 261 (2004). The common references to those \"fit to bear arms\" in congressional discussions about the militia are matched by use of the same phrase in the few nonmilitary federal contexts where the concept would be relevant. See, e.g., 30 Journals of Continental Congress 349-351 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1934). Other legal sources frequently used \"bear arms\" in nonmilitary contexts.10 Cunningham's legal dictionary, cited above, [Slip Op. 15] gave as an example of its usage a sentence unrelated to military affairs (\"Servants and labourers shall use bows and arrows on Sundays, &c; and not bear other arms\"). And if one looks beyond legal sources, \"bear arms\" was frequently used in nonmilitary contexts. See Cramer & Olson, What Did \"Bear Arms\" Mean in the Second Amendment?, 6 Georgetown J. L. & Pub. Pol'y (forthcoming Sept. 2008), online at http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1086176* (as visited June 24, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (identifying numerous nonmilitary uses of \"bear arms\" from the founding period).\n \n JUSTICE STEVENS points to a study by amici supposedly showing that the phrase \"bear arms\" was most frequently used in the military context. See post, at 12-13, n. 9; Linguists' Brief 24. Of course, as we have said, the fact that the phrase was commonly used in a particular context does not show that it is limited to that context, and, in any event, we have given many sources where the phrase was used in nonmilitary contexts. Moreover, the study's collection appears to include (who knows how many times) the idiomatic phrase \"bear arms against,\" which is irrelevant. The amici also dismiss examples such as \"'bear arms . . . for the purpose of killing game'\" because those uses are \"expressly qualified.\" Linguists' Brief 24. (JUSTICE STEVENS uses the same excuse for dismissing the state constitutional provisions analogous to the Second Amendment that identify private-use purposes for which the individual right can be asserted. See post, at 12.) That analysis is faulty. A purposive qualifying phrase that contradicts the word or phrase it modifies is unknown this side of the looking glass (except, apparently, in some courses on Linguistics). If \"bear arms\" means, as we think, simply the carrying of arms, a modifier can limit the purpose of the carriage (\"for the purpose of self-defense\" or \"to make war against the King\"). But if \"bear arms\" means, as the petitioners and the dissent think, the [Slip Op. 16] carrying of arms only for military purposes, one simply cannot add \"for the purpose of killing game.\" The right \"to carry arms in the militia for the purpose of killing game\" is worthy of the mad hatter. Thus, these purposive qualifying phrases positively establish that \"to bear arms\" is not limited to military use. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 10-16 (2008)\n \n Here is the footnote of amendments using \"bear arms\" in a dual military and private context:\n \n See Pa. Declaration of Rights \u00a7 XIII, in 5 Thorpe 3083 (\"That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state. . . \"); Vt. Declaration of Rights \u00a7 XV, in 6 id., at 3741 (\"That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the State. . .\"); Ky. Const., Art.

XIII, \u00a7 3 (1820), in 4 id., at 2150, 2163 (\"[T]hat their right to bear arms in defence of themselves and of the State cannot be questioned\"). See generally Volokh, State Constitutional Rights to Keep and Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. & Politics 191 (2006). District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 64 (2008)\n \n And the footnote which lists several other examples of the phrase \"bear arms\" meaning more than a military context:\n \n [I]See J. Brydall, Privilegia Magnatud apud Anglos 14 (1704) (Privilege XXXIII) (\"In the 21st Year of King Edward the Third, a Proclamation Issued, that no Person should bear any Arms within London, and the Suburbs\"); J. Bond, A Compleat Guide to Justices of the Peace 43 (1707) (\"Sheriffs, and all other Officers in executing their Offices, and all other persons pursuing Hu[e] and Cry may lawfully bear arms\"); 1 An Abridgment of the Public Statutes in Force and Use Relative to Scotland (1755) (entry for \"Arms\": \"And if any person above described shall have in his custody, use, or bear arms, being thereof convicted before one justice of peace, or other judge competent, summarily, he shall for the first offense forfeit all such arms\" (quoting 1 Geo. 1, c. 54, \u00a7 1)); Statute Law of Scotland Abridged 132-133 (2d ed. 1769) (\"Acts for disarming the highlands\" but \"exempting those who have particular licenses to bear arms\"); E. de Vattel, The Law of Nations, or, Principles of the Law of Nature 144 (1792) (\"Since custom has allowed persons of rank and gentlemen of the army to bear arms in time of peace, strict care should be taken that none but these should be allowed to wear swords\"); E. Roche, Proceedings of a Court-Martial, Held at the Council-Chamber, in the City of Cork 3 (1798) (charge VI: \"With having held traitorous conferences, and with having conspired, with the like intent, for the purpose of attacking and despoiling of the arms of several of the King's subjects, qualified by law to bear arms\"); C. Humphreys, A Compendium of the Common Law in force in Kentucky 482 (1822) (\"n this country the constitution guaranties to all persons the right to bear arms; then it can only be a crime to exercise this right in such a manner, as to terrify people unnecessarily\"). District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 64 (2008)\n \n Concerning the CO clause, Heller dealt with it this way:\n \n [I]JUSTICE STEVENS places great weight on James Madison's inclusion of a conscientious-objector clause in his original draft of the Second Amendment: \"but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms, shall be compelled to render military service in person.\" Creating the Bill of Rights 12 (H. Veit, K. Bowling, & C. Bickford eds. 1991) (hereinafter Veit). He argues that this clause establishes that the drafters of the Second Amendment intended \"bear Arms\" to refer only to military service. See post, at 26. It is always perilous to derive the meaning of an adopted provision from another provision deleted in the drafting process.12 In any case, what JUSTICE STEVENS would conclude from the deleted provision does not follow. It was not meant to exempt from military service those who [Slip Op. 17] objected to going to war but had no scruples about personal gunfights. Quakers opposed the use of arms not just for militia service, but for any violent purpose whatsoever - so much so that Quaker frontiersmen were forbidden to use arms to defend their families, even though \"n such circumstances the temptation to seize a hunting rifle or knife in self-defense . . . must sometimes have been almost overwhelming.\" P. Brock, Pacifism in the United States 359 (1968); see M. Hirst, The Quakers in Peace and War 336-339 (1923); 3 T. Clarkson, Portraiture of Quakerism 103-104 (3d ed. 1807). The Pennsylvania Militia Act of 1757 exempted from service those \"scrupling the use of arms\" - a phrase that no one contends had an idiomatic meaning. See 5 Stat. at Large of Pa. 613 (J. Mitchell & H. Flanders eds. 1898) (emphasis added). Thus, the most natural interpretation of Madison's deleted text is that those opposed to carrying weapons for potential violent confrontation would not be \"compelled to render military service,\" in which such carrying would be required. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 16-17 (2008)\n \n Of course all this is in the eye of the beholder. MBell sees his argument as \"irrefutable evidence.\" I see it as a \"refuted assumption\" based upon the \"historical facts\" cited in Heller which MBell ignores. \n \n Having said this, I would still like to see how MBell defines the 2nd. Amendment....",

   "Sigma. I said none of what you claim I said. Do you actually think that the readers of these post will think I said them, because you claim I did? I think you are being purposefully obtuse as to win a debate.\n \n My ONLY point is that, Inalienable Rights are Not Inalienable if the States can take them away from you!\n\n \n The Constitution established the national government, not the State governments. The rights in question are protected from infringement by the government established by that Constitution.\n \n And yes, you did say those things. You want to completely take away the people's ability to decide if they wish to restrict gun ownership. Yet, at the same time, you exalt \"the people's will\" as paramount importance. You celebrate incorporation but also rail against \"anticonstitutionalists\". These positions are contradictory.\n \n \n\n It is unfathomable to even consider the possibility that People who fought their Very Own Government, which happen to have the Most Powerful Army the World had Ever Known, in order to win their Freedoms, and distrusted a Federal Government So Much that they would not ratify a This Federal Government Unless a promise of a Bill of Rights would be a guarantee of those Rights, would then turn around and say, However, the States can do whatever they want, when the States themselves Have A Bill of Rights in their Constitutions as well! The concept of Inalienable Rights are riddled all through our Governments, and founding documents.\n\n \n The Bill of Rights did guarantee their rights would not be taken away by the very thing they were creating with the Constitution. I haven't seen anything to indicate they feared the power of their State governments. \n \n In fact, Madison admited that the State governments were viewed in a more positive light: Besides this security (the Bill of Rights), there is a great probability that such a declaration in the federal system would be enforced; because the State Legislatures will jealously and closely watch the operations of this Government, and be able to resist with more effect every assumption of power, than any other power on earth can do; and the greatest opponents to a Federal Government admit the State Legislatures to be sure guardians of the people's liberty\n \n The Bill of Rights were bulwarks against Federal power, not State power. The States were meant to be pretty autonomous.\n \n \n\n And in case anyone STILL didn't know that our Rights are also guaranteed against State usurpation, the 14th Amendment fixed that bit of Legal Sophistry forever! \n \n It says, in so many words, Well, Of Course, Inalienable Rights means that the States cannot take them away! Well Duh!\n\n \n The Virginia convention for the ratification of the Constitution even attempted to solve the problem ultimately led to the Ninth Amendment: That those clauses which declare that Congress shall not exercise certain powers be not interpreted in any manner whatsoever to extend the powers of Congress. But that they may be construed either as making exceptions to the specified powers where this shall be the case, or otherwise as inserted merely for greater caution.\n \n The Ninth Amendment, again, was meant to ensure that the enumeration of rights in the Bill of Rights did not imply that Congress had rights not listed within itself. Not the State governments.\n \n \n\n Right now, We the People are in the process of fixing an Over reaching government. See Heller! 39 states, 250 Congressional Representatives, and our Vice President signed briefs trying to set the Bill of Rights 2nd Amendment Inalienable Rights record straight. \n \n Next is the McDonald decision! After that, We the People will know who is lying!\n\n \n DC is not a State so the Heller decision does not apply to our point. It applied the Second Amendment to a Federal enclave, which is legitimate to do. It is not legitimate to apply the Second Amendment to a State.",

   "The Bill of Rights did guarantee their rights would not be taken away by the very thing they were creating with the Constitution.  I haven't seen anything to indicate they feared the power of their State governments. \n\n   FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that  original right of self-defense  which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense.  The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair.  The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. The natural strength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater than in a small, and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny. \n\n If a State has the power to disarm the inhabitant, how can one carry out what Hamilton calls the Original Right of Self Defense? \n \n Again. I think you are acting in bad faith,   and maybe you are not aware of the bad principle that you seek to set! (See comments by Lawrence Tribe and Alan Dershowitz) \n \n But there again, maybe you are exactly aware of what you are doing to the Bill of Rights! emoticon_smile \n \n Either way, the 14th Amendment Kills your argument! Your argument is dead, and the 14th Amendment puts an end to your greatest hopes and prayers, that you have a way to disarm us! \n \n But do have a nice day anyway! emoticon_smile\n \n \n\n The constitution was written to limit the power of gov't and to ensure all rights to the people. Government does not possess 'rights' but 'enumerated powers' and only those enumerated. The theory that gov't possess 'rights' and then can curtail or ration those rights to the people as they deem necessary for their own security is ludicrous to say the least!\n",

   "\n If a State has the power to disarm the inhabitant, how can one carry out what Hamilton calls the Original Right of Self Defense?\n\n \n That quotation was meant to show the downfalls of multiple confederacies rather than the system being proposed, and is completely in accord to my quotation of Madison. Hamilton goes on to say:\n \n \nIt may safely be received as an axiom in our political system, that the State governments will, in all possible contingencies, afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the national authority. Projects of usurpation cannot be masked under pretenses so likely to escape the penetration of select bodies of men, as of the people at large. The legislatures will have better means of information. They can discover the danger at a distance; and possessing all the organs of civil power, and the confidence of the people, they can at once adopt a regular plan of opposition, in which they can combine all the resources of the community.

When will the time arrive that the federal government can raise and maintain an army capable of erecting a despotism over the great body of the people of an immense empire, who are in a situation, through the medium of their State governments, to take measures for their own defense, with all the celerity, regularity, and system of independent nations?\n\n \n States were referred to as \"independent nations\" and that defense of depotism takes place \"through the medium of their State governments\". Your quotation does nothing to refute that State governments were viewed as bastions of liberty, not something to be restrained by the Constitution. National authority was feared, not the State governments.\n \n Your source actually supports the collective interpretation of the Second Amendment since his point is in perfect accord with the language of the first part of the Amendment: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State. Your source supports the notion that the purpose of the Second Amendment was to enumerate the right of the people to defend their State against the Federal government.\n \n \n\n Either way, the 14th Amendment Kills your argument! Your argument is dead, and the 14th Amendment puts an end to your greatest hopes and prayers, that you have a way to disarm us! \n \n\n \n My argument is that incorporation of the Bill of Rights goes against what the Constitution originally established.

   "Sigma. You are out of line with your interpretation. Just because Hamilton covers most every situation does not mean that this does not cover State Usurpation. The Original Right of Self Defense, he says. First of all, Our Constitution&#8217;s Bill of Rights does not give us anything! It is an enumeration of, (Enumeration = Numbered ) a recognition of, preexisting Rights, and the Constitution&#8217;s Bill of Rights just recognizes that they are Inalienable and are therefore protected! \n   9th Amendment \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n\n \n He doesn&#8217;t say, Well, God gave you that Right, well, humm, well, except if it is the state that is the usurper. Then you are totally messed up, cause the State trumps all Inalienable Rights! Ludicrous! \n \n Link   From the Constitution Society \n There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the \"right to keep and bear arms\". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. \n \n < (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea \n \n < (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution. \n\n \n So how did a people who believed all of this, and wrote the Right to Keep and Bear Arms into 44 State Constitutions, just all of a sudden say they didn&#8217;t meant it, We lost our minds and the State could enslave you and take away all of your rights! \n \n And what of the same parallels of our Right to Keep and Bear Arms in all of those State Constitutions? How do you explain Ohio's inclusion of the words Inalienable and Rights that Preexisted the Constitution in our Ohio founding Documents? Don't you feel a little like you are on thin ice, when you have 44 States with this same model? How Weird? No? \n \n I do, however, note your objection to the 14th Amendment in our Bill of Rights! I did hear you that you don&#8217;t like it, and you want it gone from our Constitution. What other parts of our Bill of Rights don&#8217;t you like, an wish to take from us by Slick Tricks, and Sophistry, I might add? \n \n Can the State take away our Rights to Freedom of Speech, or to peacefully assemble? How about Freedom of religion, or trial by jury, or to be secure in our possessions and personal effects? If you are correct, they are all in jeopardy under your theory of government, and the warning Harvard Professors Tribe and Dershowitz is ever louder than any time before in our history! \n \n Either our Rights are Inalienable, or they are just privileges granted by a benevolent government, and are about to be ALL taken from us. \n \n I also think you are trying your best to slide in some kind of argument, any argument, in order make it seem like you have a point, when you do not. At some point you are going to start to look ridiculous! Personally I think you have reached that point! \n \n   The Ohio Constitution '-- \u00a7 1.01 Inalienable Rights \n All men are, by nature, free and independent, and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and seeking and obtaining happiness and safety. \n \n and here is another of them.\n   \u00a7 1.04 Bearing arms; standing armies; military powers (1851) \n The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security; but standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and shall not be kept up; and the military shall be in strict subordination to the civil power. \n \n \n And here is it further defined.\n   Sec. 9.68. \n (A) The individual right to keep and bear arms, being a fundamental individual right that predates the United States Constitution and Ohio Constitution, ..\n\n \n I'll leave you with a few more quote. \n   What the Framers said about our Second Amendment -- Rights to Keep and Bear Arms \n \"O sir, we should have fine times, indeed, if, to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people! Your arms, wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone ...\"\n -- Patrick Henry, Elliot p. 3:50-53, in Virginia Ratifying Convention demanding a guarantee of the right to bear arms\n \n \"The people are not to be disarmed of their weapons. They are left in full possession of them.\"\n -- Zacharia Johnson, delegate to Virginia Ratifying Convention, Elliot, 3:645-6\n \n \"Certainly one of the chief guarantees of freedom under any government, no matter how popular and respected, is the right of citizens to keep and bear arms ... The right of citizens to bear arms is just one guarantee against arbitrary government, one more safeguard, against the tyranny which now appears remote in America but which historically has proven to be always possible.\"\n -- Hubert H. Humphrey, Senator, Vice President, 22 October 1959\n \n \"The militia is the natural defense of a free country against sudden foreign invasions, domestic insurrections, and domestic usurpation of power by rulers. The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of the republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally ... enable the people to resist and triumph over them.\"\n -- Joseph Story, Supreme Court Justice, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, p. 3:746-7, 1833\n \n \" ... most attractive to Americans, the possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave, it being the ultimate means by which freedom was to be preserved.\"\n -- James Burgh, 18th century English Libertarian writer, Shalhope, The Ideological Origins of the Second Amendment, p.604\n",

   "The Constitution established the national government, not the State governments. The rights in question are protected from infringement by the government established by that Constitution.\n\n \n OhBS! Guaranteed to every State a Republican form of government. Rights such as those listed were deemed inalienable and belonged by the grace of G-d to each citizen. The powers, not rights are inherent and listed to each branch of government both Federal and State. Actually the powers of all three branches of government are listed. You, as a citizen, have no power nor right to demand anything from an equal citizen...that is what the guns are for...also. Self-defense from hucksters like you.\n \n \nAnd yes, you did say those things. You want to completely take away the people's ability to decide if they wish to restrict gun ownership.\n \n \n This is not a democracy nor a mobocracy. The powers of government are limited and few. The rights of the people are numerous and many. If you think you can dictate to your fellow citizens and measure the rights they should have you are full of it. The XVII amendment is an example of taking the ambassadors that were meant to be selected by the State Legislators but was abolished to be elected at large and that is why they don't represent the State nor the People any more. They represent the Federal Government and your rights have been whittled down where you once had control through the congress of your own State. (but you aren't an American so why should you care?)\n \n \nYet, at the same time, you exalt \"the people's will\" as paramount importance. You celebrate incorporation but also rail against \"anticonstitutionalists\". These positions are contradictory.\n\n \n He didn't say that, you did! The people have the right and the duty to reign in their governments which are still bound by the enumerated duties in the Federal and State compacts.\n \n \nThe Bill of Rights did guarantee their rights would not be taken away by the very thing they were creating with the Constitution. I haven't seen anything to indicate they feared the power of their State governments.\n\n \n That is too bad, our FF did and mentioned this very subject many times. That is why we have a Republican form of government with those duties enumerated at all levels of government, both State and Federal. When your elected Federal Congress acts with disreguard to 80% of the peoples' wishes at the Federal level you still claim you are represented? LOL\n \n I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States( United States Constitution - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia )\n against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; So help me God! \n \n Thus that status of the constitution never varies because each elected, appointed official, both State and Federal as well as the military take that oath. That is the establishment clause! You ever take the oath goober? :)\n \n \nIn fact, Madison admited that the State governments were viewed in a more positive light: Besides this security (the Bill of Rights), there is a great probability that such a declaration in the federal system would be enforced; because the State Legislatures will jealously and closely watch the operations of this Government, and be able to resist with more effect every assumption of power, than any other power on earth can do; and the greatest opponents to a Federal Government admit the State Legislatures to be sure guardians of the people's liberty\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nThe Bill of Rights were bulwarks against Federal power, not State power. The States were meant to be pretty autonomous.\n\n \n To follow the Constitution(s) and remain a Republican form of government. If you haven't noticed, the government doesn't grant rights. That is why we have written Constitutions.\n \n \nThe Virginia convention for the ratification of the Constitution even attempted to solve the problem ultimately led to the Ninth Amendment: That those clauses which declare that Congress shall not exercise certain powers be not interpreted in any manner whatsoever to extend the powers of Congress. But that they may be construed either as making exceptions to the specified powers where this shall be the case, or otherwise as inserted merely for greater caution.\n\n \n Uh, huh, but you want to use a majority vote to override that which cannot be changed. The BOR applies to everyone who is a citizen and beyond the reach of any majority or tyrant. This is the method you wish to prevail.\n \n \nThe Ninth Amendment, again, was meant to ensure that the enumeration of rights in the Bill of Rights did not imply that Congress had rights not listed within itself. Not the State governments.\n\n \n If you will read the Constitution, those rights apply to the citizens and not government. The articles I, II, and III lists the powers of the 3 branches of government. The IXth amendment reserved the rights to the people first, then or the States and who are the States but the people? Get it out of your head that any government has rights, they do not. \n \n \nDC is not a State so the Heller decision does not apply to our point. It applied the Second Amendment to a Federal enclave, which is legitimate to do. It is not legitimate to apply the Second Amendment to a State.\n\n \n 44 OF THE STATES DO HAVE THE WORDS OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. The second Amendment as ruled by Heller and a host of other cases also.\n \n I am thinking more of euthenasia for your condition, the suffering you are going through is ruining your quality of life. It is the humane thing to do :)",

That incorporation is happening is part of my argument, it does not defeat it. Your accusation is out of place. Whether you are disarmed is by the will of the people, which you purport to celebrate. Or do you no longer believe the will of the people to be important?\n\n \n I don't know where you get those ideas but they were not from the debates on Hamiltonian theory of government.\n \n \nIt is in dealing with the States, however, that Hamilton's strong national and centralizing feelings come out most vividly. His plan provided that all governors of States should be appointed by the President, to hold during good behavior, and that they should have an absolute veto on all laws passed by the State Legislatures, and that all officers of the State militia should hold commissions from the United States. This arrangement would have crushed the States, but Hamilton was too strongly national and centralizing in his views to trouble himself on that score. He believed from his past experience that the peril to the future of the country lay in the powers and rights of States. From that quarter the danger and the subsequent civil war certainly came, but whether Hamilton's plan, if it had been adopted in 1787, would not have led to earlier and greater evils among a people wholly unprepared for a strong central government, is, to say the least, highly problematic. It is worth remembering, however, that Madison at this period believed most thoroughly that the central government should possess an absolute veto on all State laws.-(Writings of Madison, i., 285, 288, 347, and 355.) He thought this power absolutely essential for the new government, and he also believed in the principle of a property qualification for the electors of the upper branch of the Legislature (Ibid., 187).\n \n We cannot suppose that Hamilton believed for a moment that his plan as it stood, especially with its radical measures in regard to the States, had the least chance of success. He introduced it as an antidote to the loose, inefficient scheme known as the New Jersey plan, and also, undoubtedly, to strengthen and invigorate the tone of the convention. He followed it up with a speech of remarkable ability, occupying five hours in delivery, which arrested the attention of the convention and had a marked effect upon its action. The plan and the speech certainly had the effect most desired by their author. They served to kill off the New Jersey plan and led to the adoption of more energetic principles. Soon after his speech Hamilton left the convention. He was perfectly helpless there, as his two colleagues, Yates and Lansing, always cast the vote of New York against his views, and he did not return until the close of the proceedings, when he signed his name to the Constitution as adopted. The meagre record of his speeches which follows is drawn from the reports made by Yates and Madison, and in each instance the source is indicated. Even these fragments have never been brought together before, and they serve to throw a great deal of light upon Madison's views upon government and upon the formation of the Constitution.\n \n **********\n \n * - Following is one of those \"rights\" that Mr. Hamilton obviously considered the \"citizens in every other State\" are \"entitled\" to:\n \n \"If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, (Notice the use of the word CITIZENS - NOT MILITIA!), without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair. The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo. The smaller the extent of the territory, the more difficult will it be for the people to form a regular or systematic plan of opposition, and the more easy will it be to defeat their early efforts. Intelligence can be more speedily obtained of their preparations and movements, and the military force in the possession of the usurpers can be more rapidly directed against the part where the opposition has begun. In this situation there must be a peculiar coincidence of circumstances to insure success to the popular resistance.\"\n \n - Alexander Hamilton, Federalist #28.\n \n And here are some quotations of a similar nature from Mr. Hamilton prior to the Constitution:\n \n \"Self-preservation is the first principle of our nature. When our lives and properties are at stake, it would be foolish and unnatural to refrain from such measures as might preserve them because they would be detrimental to others. . . . . . that the united strength of the several members might give stability and security to the whole body, and each respective member; so that one part cannot encroach upon another without becoming a common enemy, and eventually endangering the safety and happiness of all the other parts.\"\n - Alexander Hamilton, The Works of Alexander Hamilton - \"A FULL VINDICATION.\", Dec. 15, 1774, ed. Henry Cabot Lodge (Federal Edition) (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1904). In 12 vols. Vol. 1.\n \n \"You, Sir, triumph in the supposed illegality of this body; but, granting your supposition were true, it would be a matter of no real importance. When the first principles of civil society are violated, and the rights of a whole people are invaded, the common forms of municipal law are not to be regarded. Men may then betake themselves to the law of nature; and, if they but conform their actions, to that standard, all cavils against them, betray either ignorance or dishonesty. There are some events in society, to which human laws cannot extend; but when applied to them lose all their force and efficacy. In short, when human laws contradict or discountenance the means, which are necessary to preserve the essential rights of any society, they defeat the proper end of all laws, and so become null and void.\"\n \n - Alexander Hamilton, The Farmer Refuted, 23 Feb. 1775, Papers 1:86--89, 121--22, 135--36.\n \n\n \n The Supreme Court ruled 9 to zip that the 2A is an individual right and has nothing to do with collective rights nor militia rights.",

   "Two possibilities here:\n 1) the whole phrase \"keep and bear arms\" could be an idiom meaning militia service\n 2) it could be an example of a zeugma (a figure of speech in which a word relates to other words in the same sentence in different ways)\n \n Examples:\n \"You are free to execute your laws, and your citizens, as you see fit.\"\n (Star Trek: The Next Generation)\n \n \"He took his coat and his leave.\".\n\n \n \n If the phrase \"Keep and bear arms\" were an idiom, one would think there would have been more examples of the phrase in use at that time.

The PA constitution has provisions for both duty to serve and Right to bear arms, A provision from Address of PA Minority contains defense of state as well as hunting so clearly both individual and collective purposes. Also the often recited quotes from James Wilson (descibing PA Right to bear arms provision) and Roger Sherman (arguing against CO provision during debates on first militia act) point to both individual and collective purposes. \n \n Furthermore if one continues reading Blackstone from where you left off it is clear he was not making an either/or division.\n \n \"Both may indeed be comprized in this latter division; for, as all social duties are of a relative nature, at the same time that they are due from one man, or set of men, they must also be due to another. But I apprehend it will be more clear and easy, to consider many of them as duties required from, rather than as rights belonging to, particular persons. Thus, for instance, allegiance is usually, and therefore most easily, considered as the duty of the people, and protection as the duty of the magistrate; and yet they are, reciprocally, the rights as well as duties of each other. Allegiance is the right of the magistrate, and protection the right of the people.\"\n \n my emphasis",

You act like that is a good thing! emoticon_smile\n \n Like another anti-gun poster we have dealt with before on the issue of our Founding Fathers employed gun registration, it appears that you are going argue a point, any point, till one has to decide weather or not to keep pushing forth their proofs, (over and over again) thus making one look just as stubborn and foolish, as the one pushing a bad position! \n \n As I said earlier, Legal Sophists had pushed our predecessors to the point where they HAD no choice but to amend the Constitution, in order to put an end to the heresy that you, Galileo, and M Bell are pushing to this very day! \n \n It NEVER STOPS with you Anti-Constitutionalists! \n \n The citizens of this country ARE the ONLY owners of this country, and they proposed, passed, and duly ratified The 14th Amendment to put a fork into the heresy you guys are still preaching. It is the Law of the Land!\n \n The 14 Amendment, makes all of your argument, Galileo's and M Bells too, Dead Meat! \n \n The citizens of this country did not buy the BS then, nor did they think that the courts, to include the Supreme Court, were correct in the treatment of this Constitutional Bill of Rights matter! They totally rebuked those who made the contrary laws, the courts, to include the Supreme Court, by the passage of the 14th Amendment! Oh, and by the way, the ratifiers of the 14 also rebuked you too! \n \n Personally, I don't think the Supreme Court liked the fact that We the People stuck their thumb into their eye, overruling them by the passage of the 14th, and came up with the scam of incorporation! Thus the SC, saying under their breaths, Yeah, we will take it under advisement, Dork Wads! However, like everyone else, they are forced to Obey the Constitution We the People make! We are the ONLY owners of this Country. Like Congress and the President, they also work for us.   We the People are the final arbiters of this Constitution. (See Federalist 78) It is NOT the other way around! \n \n I know it probably galls you that the very thing you HATE, the 2nd Amendment,   was the very catalyst that finally caused them to amend the Constitution, yet again.  Thus making the 2nd Amendment the ONLY amendment that was proposed, passed, and duly ratified, not only once, but now twice! \n \n Very soon, the Supreme Court is going to stick their thumb into your eye by incorporating the 2nd Amendment, thus finally administering the justice that We the People produced for themselves when they ratified the 14 Amendment, and making the States toe the Constitutional line!\n \n It is the Law. Constitutional law! The Supreme Law of the Land! All we ask is for everyone to Obey it! Citizens, Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches too!",

   "No, only the Federal powers are specified by the Constitution.\n \n \n U.S. Constitution | LII / Legal Information Institute\n You don't know doodly squat do you?\n \n \nYes, the powers of the Federal government are limited and few.\n\n \n There have been a lot of INTRUSIONS and EXTENSIONS by claiming more than those enumerated by twisting , say the commerce clause.\n \n \nState powers are not enumerated by the Constitution. Federal powers are.\n\n \n Even your hero Akhil Amar doesn't attempt that claim.\n \n \nYes, he did say all of those things. He put great importance upon the \"people's will\" while advocating that we take away the people's ability to decide on the subject of gun control (through incorporation of the Second Amendment). He celebrates incorporation while negatively referring to \"unconsitutionalists\". These are contradictory positions.\n\n \n Oh, really? Exactly what rights does the 2A bind if not the States? ...the Second Amendment as \"a declaration that a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state.\"\n \n Rawles Commentaries - Politically, a maxim like the preamble to the Second Amendment could warn the people of any state to be wary of any legislature, even a state legislature, that sought to disarm them. [62] Judicially, maxims drawn from the Bill of Rights could generate a set of rules of construction-what we would call today \"clear statement rules\"-obliging a state legislature to speak with unmistakable clarity before trenching on a right \"declared\" in the U.S. Constitution. And in the hands of a strong believer in fundamental or natural rights, the \"declaratory\" view of the Bill could have even more far-reaching consequences.\n \n As modern day legal positivists, we tend to view the Bill as creating or conferring legal rights. But the congressional resolution accompanying the Bill explicitly described some of its provisions as \"declaratory.\" [63] To a nineteenth-century believer in natural rights, the Bill was not simply an enactment of We the People as the Sovereign Legislature bringing new legal rights into existence, but a declaratory judgment by We the People as the Sovereign High Court that certain natural or fundamental rights already existed. [64] Under this view, the [Page 1207]\n \n First Amendment was not merely an interpretation of the positive law code of the original Constitution, declaring that Congress lacked Article I, Section 8 enumerated power to regulate religion or suppress speech; the Amendment was also a declaration that certain fundamental \"rights\" and \"freedoms\"-of assembly, petition, speech, press, and religious exercise-preexisted the Constitution. Why else, it might be asked, did the Amendment speak of \"the\" freedom of speech, implying a preexisting entitlement? [65] The Ninth and Tenth Amendments did more than make explicit rules of construction for interpreting the Constitution as a positive law code; they also declared that certain \"rights\" and \"powers\" were retained by \"the people\" and \"reserved\" to them in contradistinction to \"states.\" - cited by Amar.\n \n \nThis was simply untrue before the Fourteenth Amendment changed how the Constitution functioned.\n\n \n PROOF? Something you are always lacking other than making wild claims you pulled out of your, er...Hat.\n \n \nSo what?\n\n \n So you got cut :) Your attempt to limit any view but your own by taking out of context one of the Federalist Papers when the discussion is much more than that. You begin by discussing the 14th Amendment which repeats the BOR and dispute that people of the states are the ones who possess the rights, the people regardless of what State they are in and citizens in D.C. are also \"the people\" and \"citizens\" who possess those rights no matter where they may be. Trying to excuse a ruling on the 'right of the people' because D.C. is not a state is about as ridiculous and absurd as you can get and still see past the end of your nose :)",

   "Let me talk for a moment again about the 14th. Amendment. The amendment is inextricably linked to the RKBA. We all know that after legal slavery was abolished the former slaveholding states (mine included) attempted to create a system of de facto slavery. The denial of the black man's individual RKBA was one of the aims of this system. Consider these examples brought to the attention of Congress:\n \n [concerning the State of Kentucky] \"the civil law prohibits the colored man from bearing arms. . .their arms are taken from them by the civil authorities. . . .Thus, the right of the people to keep and bear arms as provided in the Constitution is infringed. . .\" Executive Document #30, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, pp. 233 and 236 (1866) [from the Report of the Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau]. [bold emphasis added]\n \n [from Mississippi's \"Act to Regulate the Relation of Master and Apprentice Relative to Freedmen, Free Negroes, and Mulattoes.\"] \"That no freedman, free negro or mulatto. . .not licensed to do so by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie knife. . .\" Laws of Mississippi, 1865, p. 165 (November 29, 1865).\n \n How were laws like this viewed by Congress? \"Northern Republicans professed to see this new legislation at the South the virtual re-enslavement of the Negroes.\" J. Burgess, Reconstruction and the Constitution, 1866-1876, p. 51-52 (1902).\n \n The complaints were not limited to the mere passage of laws, however:\n \n \"In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages on them. . . .\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 40 (December 13, 1865) [Speech of Senator Henry Wilson (Republican-Massachusetts)]\n \n Yet another Senator complained that the Mississippi state militia would roam throughout the state and habitually \"hang some freedmen or search negro houses for arms.\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, Senate Report Number 30, p. 813 (February 13, 1866) [Speech of Senator Lyman Trumball (Republican-Illinois)]\n \n Now here is where Sigma is right-the Bill of Rights has no application to the actions of the states. And throughout all of this evidence gathering it was understood in Congress that the BoR was indeed powerless to stop this state-sponsored oppression of the black man's RKBA, his right to vote, his right of free speech and assembly, etc. This is the atmosphere surrounding the passage of the 14th. Amendment: \n \n All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. United States Constitution, 14th. Amendment, Section 1.\n \n Now a lot has been said about the view of one of the principle house sponsors, Congressman John Bingham-and with good reason. Justice Hugo Black (who held the view that the 14th. totally incorporated the BoR) called Bingham \"the Madison\" of the 14th. Amendment. Bingham didn't begin his career with the 14th. Amendment, however. He was a firebrand abolitionist before the civil war. Consider, for example, the following portion of one of his speeches: \n \n You may call the State which enslaves and sells its own children, and menaces the hand which feeds and clothes and shelters it, republican; but truth, and history, and God's eternal justice, will call it despotism, equally criminal and equally odious, whether sanctioned by one or many, by a single tyrant or by the million . . . . CONG. GLOBE, 34th Cong., 3d Sess. 140 (Jan. 13, 1857)\n \n And he was widely acknowledged to be a very powerful speaker:\n \n John A. Bingham suddenly electrified the House by the first thoroughgoing pronouncement we have had of abolition principles. . . . Mr. Bingham speaks forcibly and with the heat of suppressed passion; he trots out anti-slavery quotations from Thomas Jefferson, and seems to have all of the weapon extracts of Republican argument worn smooth to his hand by long use. N.Y. TIMES, Jan. 16, 1860, at 1\n \n This in turn caused him to be looked upon as a natural leader in the fight for the 14th. Amendment. Some revisionist historians (Saul Cornell among them) have sought to cast doubt on the Bingham's intention for the 14th. Amendment-or that he was deliberately not plain enough when he described what its purpose was:\n \n \n Saul Cornell's argument is that Bingham and other Republicans backed down from their original claims about the proposed amendment in order to sell it to to the American people. As a result, \"For the average man or woman on the street listening to one of Bingham's addresses, the Fourteenth Amendment probably seemed to do little more than require states to treat citizens equally.\" .\n\n \n Yet Bingham made his position plain at the time:\n \n \"The proposition pending before the House is simply a proposition to arm the Congress of the United States, by the consent of the people of the United States, with the power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution today\". Congressional Globe, U.S. House of Reprsentatives, February 28, 1866, p. 1088\n \n And this was the prevailing view of the Amendment in the house, particularly as applied to the 2nd. Amendment individual RKBA. See, for example:\n \n \"Sir, I find in the Constitution of the United States an article which declares that \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" For myself, I shall insist that the reconstructed rebels of Mississippi respect the Constitution in their local laws. . . .\"Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, p. 1838 (April 7, 1866) [Speech of congressman Sindey Clarke (Republican-Kansas)]. [bold emphasis added]\n \n \"The Constitution clearly describes that to be a republican form of government for which it was expressly framed. A government. . .where \"no law shall be made prohibiting a free exercise of religion;\". . .where \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed;\"\". . . Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 2, p. 1266 (March 24, 1866) [Speech of congressman Roswell Hart (Republican-New York)] [bold emphasis added]\n \n \"Make the colored man a citizen of the United States and he has every right which you or I have as citizens of the United States under the laws and Constitution of the United States. . . .He has a defined status; he has a country and a home; a right to defend himself and his wife and children; a right to bear arms. . . .\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 2, p. 1266 (March 8, 1866) [Speech of congressman Henry J. Raymond (Republican-New York)] [bold emphasis added]\n \n And we are not talking here about a right of the black man to \"keep and bear arms\" in a militia, under white officers appointed by a white dominated state government, alongside other white men, so he can join in as they \"hang some freedmen or search negro houses for arms.\" We are talking about the black man's individual RKBA.\n \n Additionally, Cornell should also know there was very little doubt expressed about the purpose of the Amendment in the Senate. See, for example, the speech of the Senate sponsor, Jacob Howard:\n \n \"To these privileges and immunities should be added the personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution; such as the freedom of speech and of the press; the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances, a right appertaining to each and all the people; the right to keep and to bear arms; the right to be exempted from the quartering of soldiers in a house without the consent of the owner; the right to be exempt from unreasonable searches and seizures, and from any search or seizure except by virtue of a warrant issued upon a formal oath or affidavit; the right of an accused person to be informed of the nature of the accusation against him, and his right to be tried by an impartial jury of the vicinage; and also the right to be secure against excessive bail and against cruel and unusual punishments.. . .[A]ll these immunities, privileges, rights, thus guarantied by the Constitution or recognized by it, are secured to the citizens solely as a citizen of the United States and as a party in their courts. They do not operate in the slightest degree as a restraint or prohibition upon State legislation. . . .The great object of the first section of this amendment is, therefore, to restrain the power of the States and compel them at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees...\"Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 3, p. 2765 (May 23, 1866) [Speech of Senator Jacob M. Howard (Republican-Michigan)] [bold emphasis added] Note this quote was also cited by Justices Black and Duncan in their concurring opinion in Duncan v. LOUISIANA, 391 U.S. 145, 167 (1968), which held that the 14th. Amendment required the states to honor a defendant's 6th. Amendment right to trial by jury in criminal cases.\n \n How did the Senate react to Senator Howard's description of the Amendment? \"In the entire Senate debate on the Fourteenth Amendment, running from May 23 to June 8, not a single senator challenged Senator Howard's declaration that Section 1 made the first eight amendments enforceable against the states.\" Irving Bryant, The Bill of Rights, p. 337 (1965). [bold emphasis added]\n \n I see no backing down here, Mr. Cornell.\n \n Finally, for those who doubt Bingham's commitment to this view, let me cite him again some five years after the Amendment's passage: \n \n \"These eight articles [ Bingham recited the first 8 Amendments in the Bill of Rights-Bryan] I have shown never were limitations upon the power of the States; until made so by the fourteenth amendment. The words of that amendment, \"no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,\" are an express prohibition upon every State of the Union, which may be enforced under existing law s of Congress, and such other law s for their better enforcement as Congress may make.\" Cong. Globe, 42nd Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, Appendix, March 31, 1871 p. 84 (emphasis added)\n \n Interestingly, Bingham believed the \"privileges and immunities\" clause effected a total incorporation of the BoR. SCOTUS rejected that position in the Slaughterhouse Cases the following year, and we had to wait about half a century for SCOTUS to put its toe back into the water of incorporation with the incremental process of selective incorporation through the \"due process\" clause. \n \n McDonald brings this very issue back with an argument for SCOTUS to overrule Slaughterhouse and give the P&I clause the effect Bingham and others said it had. SCOTUS seems unwilling to accept the invitation, however, and appears to be too committed to the decades old process of selective incorporation through the 14th. Amendment's \"due process\" clause. Yet it may be six in one, a half dozen as far as the 2nd. Amendment is concerned. I believe SCOTUS will use McDonald to incorporate the RKBA under the due process clause. \n \n Let me shift gears now....\n \n \n Yes, he did say all of those things. He put great importance upon the \"people's will\" while advocating that we take away the people's ability to decide on the subject of gun control (through incorporation of the Second Amendment). He celebrates incorporation while negatively referring to \"unconsitutionalists\". These are contradictory positions. \n\n \n Sigma, I for one believe in respecting the \"will of the people,\" and yet I also argue for incorporation of the 2nd. Amendment individual RKBA. But this does not make my argument inconsistent, for I do not believe that respecting the \"people's will\" extends to mob rule. \n \n God forbid that we ever suffer another substantial Islamic terrorist attack. But if we did, and if the majority of Americans were outraged enough to demand a law that banned Islam and made it a crime to practice that religion, then would you support it, Sigma, as the \"people's will\"?\n \n You see, unlike Socrates, I've no taste for hemlock, and I am glad we have a Constitution that puts individual rights beyond the tyranny of an irritated majority. Our founders chose to recognize certain fundamental individual liberties in the Bill of Rights to prevent the government from trampling upon them under the excuse that it is the \"will of the majority.\" I believe majority rule must be tempered by a respect for individual liberty, and I am fond of this quote: \n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.\n \n It is not the role of a simple majority, whether it be of the people or of judges, to decide whether a right protected in our constitution is really worth having any more. We would be in a sad way indeed if the core fundamental rights contained in the Bill of Rights were subject to being turned on and off like tap water at the whim of a simple majority. Therefore, although I support the democratic theory of majority rule, I am not prepared to equate it with unbridled mob rule. If we don't like a portion of the Constitution, or we find it inadequate, then there is a clear path of Amendment that can cure the problem-and I believe nothing short of that process should be required.",

   "A little remedial, but apparently still needed.\n \n Actually, we live in a Republic, and not a Democracy, and there are some very good and important differences between the two. In a Republic the rights of the minority are protected by the rule of law. In our case by our Constitution, and it&#8217;s Bill of Rights, with Rights our Founding Fathers called Inalienable Rights, or given by God. Inalienable Rights that mortal man cannot give to you, nor can they ever be taken away from you by him.\n \n We live by the rule of law, not the rule of the majority. In a Democracy, with a simple majority, the majority can decide to kill you, and take away everything you and your family owns, just because they have more than 50% of the people who agree with them. OK, A very drastic example I know, but an accurate example. Like in Brazil see: Link   BRAZIL VOTE SHOWS CITIZENS THE WORLD OVER CHOOSE FIREARM FREEDOM OVER FALSE SECURITY  In a Democracy form of Government, the majority can easily take away all of your Rights. \n \n In our Republic, the Rule of Law, our Constitution says, it does not matter what percentage of the people agree with you! Inalienable Rights for everyone exist weather or not anyone agrees with your rights! \n \n Our Founders mentioned God given Rights. Does that mean you have to believe in God to have Inalienable Rights? What if no one believes in God at all? Can they then cancel our Inalienable Rights? The answer is thankfully No, and here is why. Here is the way our Founding Fathers put it in Link   The Declaration of Independence  \n When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. \n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. --That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; \n \n \n &#8220;which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them&#8221; Thomas Jefferson said. So even if one does not believe in God, our Natural Inalienable Rights stand. \n \n Natural law, what is a Natural law? What defines a Natural Law? Example: In Nature, even the weakest animal tries to defend its self either by fight or flight or both, so Self Defense is so defined as a Natural Law! It is something that is hard-wired into our DNA by either God or by Nature. \n \n   The Constitution Society says:  \n There is considerable confusion about the legal theory underlying the \"right to keep and bear arms\". This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. \n \n (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. The Constitution recognizes such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea \n \n (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution. \n \n \n \n   Preamble to THE BILL OF RIGHTS  \n The Conventions of a number of the States having, at the time of adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added, and as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution; \n \n &#8220;declaratory and restrictive clauses&#8221; it says. Restrictive against who? Government. That is who. Barack Obama correctly refers to the Bill of Rights as a list on negative Rights against government. Declaratory or declaration, and restrictive or restriction. So if one reads the Bill of Rights as our Founding Fathers intended, each Bill of Right&#8217;s meaning is easy to understand. But first, there is something each of us knows with every fiber of our being. This is that the government, should not have, and is not to have power to infringe on our God given unalienable Rights. That just makes sense. Each of us can feel that, and know that should be true. So that is another example of a Natural law. And in fact, that is the design of the government that our Founding Fathers created. So with this principle in mind and the preamble in mind, lets look at the 2nd Amendment. \n \n The declaratory part (Heller calls it a prefatory Claus.) A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, The Restriction: the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. If one first reads the preamble, and that is why our founders put it there, it is so simple that every child can easily understand what our Founders intended.\n \n Our Founding Fathers were not silent on this question of lack of power by the Government either. \n \n Link   Alexander Hamilton on the Bill of Rights and our Unalienable Rights. Federalist Papers no. 84  \n I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers, which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\" \n\n Many unscrupulous people Can and Will usurp our God Given Inalienable Rights if we allow them. Freedom is something we constantly need to protect. Thomas Jefferson said it this way, &#8220;The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.&#8221; \n \n Link   9th Amendment  \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n \n Rights Retained by the People \n Annotations  \n Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. \n \n Link   10th Amendment  \n [b] The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. \n\n \n Our Founding Fathers Just finished winning their freedoms from the most powerful army in the world. Their intent for the 2nd Amendment is easy to understand. Our government was set up as a system of checks and balances, with the armed citizen being the final check on any possibility of a rogue Government or official.  [b] The purpose for the 2nd and our Natural Right is spelled our here, despite what the Antis will tell you.  That is again, common sense if we remember that our Founders threw off a tyrannical government that had the most powerful army the world had even known. So it is easy to understand that part of Hamilton's belief that is inherent in the Natural Right of Self Defense, is that the citizens be armed, as many of our Founders believed. \n  What the Framers said about our Second Amendment -- Rights to Keep and Bear Arms \n \"Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American...[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.\" \n --Tenche Coxe, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.\n\n Now can anyone seriously tell me that our Founding Fathers would have let a Tyrannical State government disarm them? \n \n \n   HAMILTON mentions the Original Right of Self Defense One can see more here ",

   "No, but if I did not support banning Islam then I could not honestly say I champion the \"people's will\". However, you and others in this thread say that you respect or champion or celebrate the \"people's will\" and then work to take the \"people's will\" out of the equation. That is contradictory and, frankly, dishonest.\n \n As for the rest of your post, you certainly don't need to lay down the dangers of majority rule or the reason for needing to have other goals. The bottom line, though, is that you cannot both say you respect the people's will while suppressing the people's will for that other goal. In that case, you've supplied your own will in their place.\n\n \n It seems we must agree to disagree. I believe that if we allow government to take up the &#8220;people&#8217;s will&#8221; as a sword against individual rights then we allow our government to become bereft of value and instead become an instrument that is very dangerous to individual rights and liberty. \n \n The &#8220;will of the people&#8221; was, after all, a constant justification for racism throughout our nation&#8217;s history. Didn&#8217;t Governor Wallace wrap himself in the not-so-sacred claim he was doing the &#8220;people&#8217;s will&#8221; when he fought desegregation? Wasn&#8217;t the &#8220;people&#8217;s will&#8221; cited as justification for the many &#8220;black codes&#8221; that were passed in the reconstructed south to create de facto slavery&#8212;including the many laws denying the black man his individual RKBA? Wasn&#8217;t it the cry of the &#8220;people&#8217;s will&#8221; that justified the disarmament and internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry in World War II? Wasn&#8217;t it the &#8220;people&#8217;s will&#8221; that effectively denied the Native American his individual RKBA until the late 1970s?\n \n Now I&#8217;m not suggesting, Sigma, that your disagreement with me places you intentionally on the wrong side of this history. Rather, I think our current disagreement comes from your more general and non-racially motivated unwillingness to accept this principle of our Constitutional form of government: That majority rule is limited to respecting individual rights&#8212;and that those rights were enshrined into our Constitution by the Bill of Rights. For the life of me I cannot understand your inability to fairly consider this most basic concept of ordered liberty. I realize that to this point you have refused to take my word for it, so let me offer some other examples of what you suggest is a &#8220;contradictory and, frankly, dishonest&#8221; opinion: \n \n &#8220;We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding &#8220;interest-balancing&#8221; approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government &#8212; even the Third Branch of Government &#8212; the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges' assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an &#8220;interest-balancing&#8221; approach to the prohibition of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie. See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclosure of state secrets, but not for the expression of extremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very product of an interest-balancing by the people &#8212; which JUSTICE BREYER would now conduct for them anew.&#8221; District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 62-63 (2008)\n \n But perhaps you do not favor this individual RKBA opinion? I don&#8217;t know, for you have avoided discussing your opinion on the merits of an individual RKBA&#8212;as you are certainly entitled to do. But there are some who may read this passage from Heller who do not like the individual RKBA, and for that reason they may have a more obvious bias and different reasons for dismissing the constitutional principle than you have. So for them (and perhaps for you, Sigma), let me offer a few more examples in rebuttal of your view:\n \n &#8220;These precious rights were fixed in our Constitution only after centuries of persecution and struggle. And in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, they were secured &#8220;for ages to come, and . . . designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it,&#8221; Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 387 (1821).&#8221;  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 442 (1966)\n \n And:\n \n &#8220;The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.&#8221; West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943)\n \n And, from a Heller dissenter:\n \n &#8220;...the purpose of a written Constitution and its Bill of Rights. That purpose, of course, is to ensure that certain principles will not be sacrificed to expediency; these are enshrined as principles of fundamental law beyond the reach of governmental officials or legislative majorities.&#8221; Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 556 (1984) (Justice Stevens, dissenting)\n \n And finally, from that same Heller dissenter, this time with a bit of asperity:\n \n &#8220;&#8230;it is far better to permit some individuals to make incorrect decisions than to deny all individuals the right to make decisions that have a profound effect upon their destiny. Arguably a very primitive society would have been protected from evil by a rule against eating apples; a majority familiar with Adam's experience might favor such a rule. But the lawmakers who placed a special premium on the protection of individual liberty have recognized that certain values are more important than the will of a transient majority.&#8221; Thornburgh v. American Coll. of Obst. & Gyn., 476 U.S. 747, 781-782 (1986) (Justice Stevens, dissenting)\n \n No let me say, Sigma, that I understand your misgivings. I understand you believe that I am denying the &#8220;people&#8217;s will&#8221; so that I might substitute my &#8220;own will in their place.&#8221; But as I have said I believe your argument is based upon a misunderstanding of constitutional law. You argue that it must be &#8220;either or&#8221; when my real argument is &#8220;neither.&#8221; Neither I nor some transient and amorphous simple majority of &#8220;the people&#8221; has the authority to deny others their rights by claiming it is our &#8220;will&#8221; that it be so. When it comes to protected constitutional rights, neither I nor they have the ability to assume the commanding voice of Yul Brynner and declare &#8220;so let it be written, so let it be done&#8221;&#8212;outside of the amendment process. You are, of course, free to offer the comments of others wiser than either of us to convince me this is not a foundational principle of American democracy. But until you do so I must respectfully decline to modify my position merely because your failure to understand it causes you to label it &#8220;dishonest.&#8221; \n \n Sigma, I don&#8217;t know whether or not you support an individual RKBA reading of the 2nd. Amendment. If you do, then you have found a friend. If you do not, then you have not found an enemy. I merely point out that Constitutional rights are greater than either of us&#8212;and no right is subject to attack absent the amendment process without imperiling every other right. If you don&#8217;t like the RKBA, fine. I only ask that you don&#8217;t get caught holding the match when the will of your supposed simple majority demands we should burn down the house to roast the pig. \n \n --\n \n &#8220;Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.&#8221; Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (Justice Brandeis, dissenting).",

   "...and as far as mayor 'dealie' wanting to appeal to foreign law to justify his second amendment crusade against the RKBA,\n \n \nSome Concerns about the Supremacy Clause\n There has been some debate as to whether or not some of the basic principles of the United States Constitution, such as the country's system of government or Bill of Rights, could be affected by an ambitious treaty. In the 1950s, a Constitutional Amendment known as the Bricker Amendment was proposed in response to such fears. This proposed amendment would have mandated that all American treaties shall not conflict with the manifest powers granted to the Federal Government.\n \n Subsequent Federal court cases such as Seery v. United States, 127 F. Supp. 601 (Court of Claims, 1955), Diggs v. Schultz, 470 F.2d 461 (1972), and Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957), over the course of time, established in legal decisions most of the limitations that had been proposed by the Bricker Amendment.[5]\n \n\n \n That has already been brought up and tended to.

   "It's tyrannical if it violates the Constitution. And don't even try the old argument that the Second Amendment doesn't apply to the states, that's bull****. No matter what the state, they're all members of the union of the United States of America. They have absolutely no leeway is playing pick and choose with the Constitution, they don't get to say that they'll recognize some of the rights while ignoring the others that they don't like. It simply doesn't work that way. Either all of the rights apply and the states are duty bound to recognize them, or absolutely none of them apply at all. Those are the only two choices in the matter. It's not rocket science.\n\n \n As I've said before: The Constitution lays down what the Federal government may do and what the States may not. Outside the specific restrictions, State governments were able to legislate as they please.\n \n It was argued that the Bill of Rights was unneeded because, after all, how can the Government whose power is strictly defined restrict rights it has no access to? However, that reasoning cannot possibly apply to the States because State power was not strictly defined by the Constitution. The States, and people, simply have whatever power was not specifically given to the Federal government. There is no reasoning that has been given or posted that assures the Bill of Rights was meant to apply to the States, and specific evidence that explicitly said that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the States prior to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n \n \n\n Your train of thought, that the Second Amendment doesn't apply to the states simply because the formality of officially incorporating it under the 14th Amendment hasn't yet occurred, is the same kind of nonsense reasoning[...]\n\n \n It was also the reasoning of the fourth Supreme Court. John Marshall repeatedly confirmed the supremacy of federal law over state law, yet even he lay down the opinion that the Bill of Rights was a restriction only on Congress and not on the several States. In Barron v. Baltimore he wrote that: The constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for the government of the individual states",

I believe that if we allow government to take up the &#8220;people&#8217;s will&#8221; as a sword against individual rights then we allow our government to become bereft of value and instead become an instrument that is very dangerous to individual rights and liberty.\n\n \n I don't think you understood my point. I am not saying the \"people's will\" is a good thing or should be followed all the time or even at all. I am pointing out that you and others in this thread are holding the contradictory positions that they champion the \"people's will\" while working to take the people's will out of the decision-making process.\n \n \n\n Now I&#8217;m not suggesting, Sigma, that your disagreement with me places you intentionally on the wrong side of this history.

For the life of me I cannot understand your inability to fairly consider this most basic concept of ordered liberty.

I'll try to clarify. Your quotations express this sentiment: the lawmakers who placed a special premium on the protection of individual liberty have recognized that certain values are more important than the will of a transient majority. They are honest about what they are trying to do, which is take the people's will out of the equation and substitute their own values and goals.\n \n If your position was owning a gun is too important an issue to be subject to the people's will so we want to take it out of their hands then it would be a consistent and honest position.

That's quite a claim, do you have any evidence?\n\n I opened this current part of the thread with this.\n   Institute for Justice -- 14th Amendment \n 2. The history and adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment demonstrates the Framer's specific and repeated concern that freedmen were being disarmed by state and local governments and militias, in violation of what those Framers understood to be an individual constitutional right to bear arms. In response to this Court's previous refusal to enforce parts of the Bill of Rights directly against the States, and its holding that blacks were not citizens of the United States entitled to the rights of such citizens, the Framers set out to remedy the inability to enforce numerous constitutional rights against the States by incorporating them into the Fourteenth Amendment. Identification of the evils the 39th Congress sought to remedy - including the disarming of freedmen - the parallel legislative responses to that problem, and the specific explanations by the Framers of the purpose and function of the Fourteenth Amendment, all demonstrate that they viewed the existing constitutional right to bear arms as an individual right of personal security. And they understood and intended the language of the Fourteenth Amendment to secure such a right against the States and various militias, not merely in the service of the very entities seeking to disarm and abuse the freedmen. And by accomplishing that goal through the identification and extension of the rights of national citizens, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment also clarified and defined the underlying rights in the Second Amendment as well.\n \n Whatever the basis for incorporation, however, the history of the Fourteenth Amendment shows that the right to bear arms was intended to be incorporated, and thus should be read as it was understood at the time of such incorporation. \n",

   "All States have the same laws? That's quite a claim to make. Do you have any evidence?\n\n That was an error, I changed it to read Both the State and the Federal protected rights were the same, before you posted but obviously not before you read it. \n \n \nThe Commerce Clause, Article I Section 8: The Congress shall have power [...] To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes;\n \n I'm not sure how this relates to the founders believing it was unnecessary and dangerous to include a Bill of Rights.\n\n In our Founders vernacular To regulate commerce mean to keep regular. \n   Well Regulated\" Doesn't Mean What Most People Think It Does -- Denton Bramwell, Aug 6, 2007 \n In Item 1, Anne Newport Royall commented in 1822 that Huntsville, Alabama was\n becoming quite civilized and prosperous, with a \"fine fire engine\" and a \"well regulated company\". I suppose one could make the case that the firefighters were especially subject to rules and laws, but the passage is more coherent if read, \"They have a very fine fire engine, and a properly operating company.\" \n \n William Thackary's 1848 novel (item 4) uses the term \"well-regulated person\". The story is that of Major Dobbin, who had been remiss in visiting his family. Thackary's comment is to the effect that any well-regulated person would blame the major for this.\n \n Clearly, in this context, well-regulated has nothing to do with government rules and laws. It can only be interpreted as \"properly operating\" or \"ideal state\". In 1861, author George Curtis (item 5), has one of his characters, apparently a moneyhungry person, praising his son for being sensible, and carefully considering money in making his marriage plans. He states that \"every well-regulated person considers the matter from a pecuniary point of view.\" Again, this cannot logically be interpreted as a person especially subject to government control. It can only be read as \"properly operating\".\n \n Edmund Yates certainly has to be accepted as an articulate and educated writer, quite capable of properly expressing his meaning. In 1884 (item 6), he references a person who was apparently not \"strictly well-regulated\". The context makes any reading other that \"properly operating\" or \"in his ideal state\" impossible.\n \n One of the most telling items is from 1834, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (item 8). Here we have a discussion of people who rose up against \"encroachments of the Crown\", i.e., active rebellion, while maintaining or restoring their \"well-regulated organization.\"\n \n Clearly, these were people who were actively shaking off government encroachment, not people in subjection to the rule of law. Yet they had, and maintained, a \"well-regulated organization.\" Again, the \"subject to government laws and rules\" interpretation is impossible. The passage must be read as \"properly functioning\" or \"in its ideal state\".\n \n In reviewing older writings, I have made no effort to select those that favor the \"properly functioning\" or \"ideal state\" interpretation. As nearly as I can tell, the items I have listed are a good representation of the old use of the term. They stand in sharp contrast to our modern use.\n",

Do you have evidence that this is true across the board?\n\n No right can be thought of as absolute. No one can yell Fire in a theater without the belief that their is an actual fire. That is the common understanding of limits. We don't issue guns to prisoners. There are limits. \n \n Properly understood, Governments must show cause that what they ask for is necessary, and that law is specifically and narrowly tailored to meet the required objective, without overburdening the Constitution.\n \n We currently have <   The \"Unregulated\" Gun  \n \"Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate guns-more than 88,000 words. Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n We the People have bent over backwards in allowing what the Police say they need in order to be safe as it relates to gun laws. We have not been unreasonable! However, what can be taken has a limit.

Most of them want it all!\n \n As citizens, legislators, courts, police and military we cannot in good conscious allow the wholesale dismantlement of our Fundamental Rights structure. Many in the above positions have taken an oath to protect our Constitution from all enemies both foreign and domestic. There is a point in which we cannot go! That also is a point common sense, that all Americans respect. \n \n Recent polling of We the People on gun law questions says that is true. We the American People Get that. \n \nAlright...?

   "I don't think you understood my point. I am not saying the \"people's will\" is a good thing or should be followed all the time or even at all. I am pointing out that you and others in this thread are holding the contradictory positions that they champion the \"people's will\" while working to take the people's will out of the decision-making process.\n \n \n \n Again, you don't seem to understand what I am saying. I'll try to clarify. Your quotations express this sentiment: the lawmakers who placed a special premium on the protection of individual liberty have recognized that certain values are more important than the will of a transient majority. They are honest about what they are trying to do, which is take the people's will out of the equation and substitute their own values and goals.\n \n If your position was owning a gun is too important an issue to be subject to the people's will so we want to take it out of their hands then it would be a consistent and honest position. However, instead, you try to walk the line and say that you champion the people's will while taking the decision out of their hands. That is a dishonest and contradictory approach.\n\n \n \n Sigma, I appreciate your attempt to spin it for me and clarify what I have said. But let me say this: I hope you don't consider this to be an application for a job as my publicist, because I must say the interview is not going so well for you. I have always felt that Bryan is the best spokesman for Bryan, and your attempts to tell me what I really must have said have done nothing to convince me otherwise.\n \n Sigma, your argument has become absurd. I do not think you realize how much your continued desire to misunderstand what I am saying erodes your credibility. Allow me to explain the petard I find you have hoisted yourself upon.\n \n Here is your latest summary of your understanding of my argument:\n \n \n If your position was the Second Amendment is too important to be subject to the people's will so we want to take it out of their hands then it would be a consistent and honest position. However, instead, you try to walk the line and say that you champion the people's will while taking the decision out of their hands. That is a dishonest and contradictory approach. \n\n \n (yeah, I saw it and copied it before you edited it to read \"If your position was owning a gun is too important an issue to be subject to the people's will so we want to take it out of their hands....\" You must learn to be quicker on the edit button. By the way, why did you edit out the claim that I have not been talking about the 2nd. Amendment?)\n \n And so you argue again that I am dishonest and contradictory because you say I am merely substituting my current values (edited to read a mere desire to own a gun) for those of a supposed current majority. Either you do not understand, or (more likely), you pretend not to understand that I am saying both sets of \"wills\" are bound by the requirement to respect the rights contained in the Bill of Rights. \n \n You said \"If your position was the second amendment....\" Were you really arguing that I have not been talking about the 2nd. Amendment (before you took it back)? \n \n Sigma, absent a claim of honest misunderstanding brought about by incredibly low intelligence, your argument about what I am saying is patently false. \n \n You know full well that the line of this argument began without me. I am sure you remember that the discussion started between you and another blogger over incorporation of the 2nd. Amendment against the states. You correctly pointed out it was an amendment within the Bill of Rights which has not been incorporated yet. You argued that those who favored incorporation of the 2nd. Amendment were substituting their will for the will of the people. Please correct me if I have not accurately described where the issue stood when I entered the discussion.\n \n I got into the discussion at that point, and I said this:\n \n \n Sigma, I for one believe in respecting the \"will of the people,\" and yet I also argue for incorporation of the 2nd. Amendment individual RKBA. (bold emphasis added) \n\n \n Did you not understand that I was talking about the 2nd. Amendment?\n \n \n You see, unlike Socrates, I've no taste for hemlock, and I am glad we have a Constitution that puts individual rights beyond the tyranny of an irritated majority. Our founders chose to recognize certain fundamental individual liberties in the Bill of Rights to prevent the government from trampling upon them under the excuse that it is the \"will of the majority.\" (bold emphasis added) \n\n \n Did you not understand that I was talking about the entire body of the Bill of Rights here? Now it is true that at this point I turned to the Bill of Rights as a whole, and I did not mention at that time the fact that the 2nd. Amendment is found in the Bill of Rights. But since you had already conceded that point I felt it unnecessary. I continued with a quote\n \n \n I believe majority rule must be tempered by a respect for individual liberty, and I am fond of this quote: \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921. (bold emphasis added) \n\n \n Did you not understand that Justice Cardozo is talking about individual rights enshrined in our Constitution here? \n \n \nIt is not the role of a simple majority, whether it be of the people or of judges, to decide whether a right protected in our constitution is really worth having any more. We would be in a sad way indeed if the core fundamental rights contained in the Bill of Rights were subject to being turned on and off like tap water at the whim of a simple majority. Therefore, although I support the democratic theory of majority rule, I am not prepared to equate it with unbridled mob rule. If we don't like a portion of the Constitution, or we find it inadequate, then there is a clear path of Amendment that can cure the problem-and I believe nothing short of that process should be required. (bold emphasis added) \n\n \n Did you not understand that I am talking about the Bill of Rights here? You pretended that I was not talking about constitutional rights at all, but that I was only talking in a vacumm about competing value systems-and that I was dishonest for substituting my personal values for those of \"the people\":\n \n \nThe bottom line, though, is that you cannot both say you respect the people's will while suppressing the people's will for that other goal. In that case, you've supplied your own will in their place.\n\n \n And so I tried to clarify for you the point again:\n \n \n No let me say, Sigma, that I understand your misgivings. I understand you believe that I am denying the \"people's will\" so that I might substitute my \"own will in their place.\" But as I have said I believe your argument is based upon a misunderstanding of constitutional law. You argue that it must be \"either or\" when my real argument is \"neither.\" Neither I nor some transient and amorphous simple majority of \"the people\" has the authority to deny others their rights by claiming it is our \"will\" that it be so. When it comes to protected constitutional rights, neither I nor they have the ability to assume the commanding voice of Yul Brynner and declare \"so let it be written, so let it be done\"-outside of the amendment process. (bold emphasis added) \n\n \n Did you fail to understand that I was not talking about a simple battle between my will and the will of a fictional majority? Did you not understand that I was saying both were constrained to recognize and respect the rights enshrined in our Bill of Rights? I did say this:\n \n \n I merely point out that Constitutional rights are greater than either of us-and no right is subject to attack absent the amendment process without imperiling every other right. If you don't like the RKBA, fine. I only ask that you don't get caught holding the match when the will of your supposed simple majority demands we should burn down the house to roast the pig. \n\n \n Do you again pretend that I am not talking about the Bill of Rights and the 2nd. Amendment here?\n \n And then there is this which you just quoted back to me:\n \n \n Now I'm not suggesting, Sigma, that your disagreement with me places you intentionally on the wrong side of this history. Rather, I think our current disagreement comes from your more general and non-racially motivated unwillingness to accept this principle of our Constitutional form of government: That majority rule is limited to respecting individual rights-and that those rights were enshrined into our Constitution by the Bill of Rights. For the life of me I cannot understand your inability to fairly consider this most basic concept of ordered liberty. (bold emphasis added) \n\n \n Do you pretend that I am not talking about the rights found in the Bill of Rights here?\n \n I even pulled other quotes on this fundamental concept. Setting aside Heller for a moment, I cited the following:\n \n \nThese precious rights were fixed in our Constitution only after centuries of persecution and struggle. And in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, they were secured \"for ages to come, and . . . designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it,\" Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 387 (1821).\" Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 442 (1966) (bold emphasis added) \n\n \n \n \"The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\" West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943) (bold emphasis added) \n\n \n \n \"...the purpose of a written Constitution and its Bill of Rights. That purpose, of course, is to ensure that certain principles will not be sacrificed to expediency; these are enshrined as principles of fundamental law beyond the reach of governmental officials or legislative majorities.\" Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 556 (1984) (Justice Stevens, dissenting) (bold emphasis added) \n\n \n \n \"...it is far better to permit some individuals to make incorrect decisions than to deny all individuals the right to make decisions that have a profound effect upon their destiny. Arguably a very primitive society would have been protected from evil by a rule against eating apples; a majority familiar with Adam's experience might favor such a rule. But the lawmakers who placed a special premium on the protection of individual liberty have recognized that certain values are more important than the will of a transient majority.\" Thornburgh v. American Coll. of Obst. & Gyn., 476 U.S. 747, 781-782 (1986) (Justice Stevens, dissenting) (bold emphasis added) \n\n \n Now you tell me you read them, and this is what you come away with:\n \n \n Again, you don't seem to understand what I am saying. I'll try to clarify. Your quotations express this sentiment: the lawmakers who placed a special premium on the protection of individual liberty have recognized that certain values are more important than the will of a transient majority. They are honest about what they are trying to do, which is take the people's will out of the equation and substitute their own values and goals. (bold emphasis added)\n\n \n Now Sigma, I do not believe you are so blissfully free of the ravages of intelligence that you cannot understand these quotes. You know very well that these quotes are talking about the individual liberties protected by the Bill of Rights. You know very well these quotes are not talking about taking \"the people's will out of the equation and substitute their own values and goals.\" It is dishonest, and it should be beneath you, to claim otherwise. And so your attempt to clarify your position is nothing more than an attempt to invite me to join into your willing self-deception about both of our arguments. And yet you wish so badly to keep up this fa\u00e7ade that you seize upon one portion of one of the quotes so that you can take it out of context and declare: Aha! Your quotes are saying what I wish to believe they are saying! Don't you see how dishonest this is? \n \n So let me try one last time to state my position in manner you cannot fail to misapprehend. I gave serious thought to creating a Dr. Seuss rhyme around it to simplify it, but in the end I did not want to insult your intelligence. As I said, I believe the quality you are lacking is honesty, not intelligence. \n \n I do in fact believe that the 2nd. Amendment individual RKBA is enshrined in the Bill of Rights. I do in fact believe that every right found within the Bill of Rights was enshrined there to place them beyond the tyranny of an irritated majority. I do in fact believe that the only way the will of \"the people\" can take away this right is by the supermajority process of amendment. I do not seek to elevate my will above the will of your alleged majority. I do in fact believe that neither my will nor the will of a fictional simple majority justifies taking a bottle of whiteout to the constitution to eliminate portions either I or they do not like. \n \n Sigma, I am enjoying our debate, but I fear we are in danger of it getting away from us. I do not know how you can give me any confidence that you are being honest with me when you cannot be honest with yourself. You are proving the truth of the statement that no man is more blind than the man who willingly shuts his eyes and refuses to accept what he knows is confronting him. I am sorry if you are finding it difficult to undermine what I am saying. I am sorry if I ever force you to admit that you are not right all the time as your tag claims. But I do ask that you stop pretending to misunderstand me. I know it is easier to create your own opponent so you can put words into his mouth and make sure he says nothing but what you can easily refute. But you must realize the victories that flow from that battlefield are hollow and false, and I hope you now realize that when you publically engage in that process you damage your credibility in the eyes of all who witness it. \n \n Stop looking for windmills to tilt at, Sigma. I would much rather have you debate me on what you know I actually say rather than on what you wish to pretend I have said.",

   "Sometimes, because I know what I mean and you may not, emoticon_smile let me try and explain the States Rights thing. Neithr States, Cities or even my wife, controls Inalenable Rights. \n \n When the 10th Amendment says rights belonging to the State or the People, Inalienable Rights could not possibly be included under the purview of any government. \n \n Logic dictates, and we have countless documents and statements from our Founders, that show that our Founding Fathers felt that Inalienable Rights could never be taken away!\n Here Hamilton says so. Found at our National Archives.  The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n Alexander Hamilton 1775\n \n The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchment,. or musty records. They are written with a sun beam in whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself, \n  and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power. \n\n \n And here our Obama Government records this:\n  Rights and Responsibilities  \n Fundamental Rights\n \n This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n\n \n Other than the concept of Inalienable Rights, and with this understanding of what our Founders set up, now read the 10th Amendment and we will be simpatico! Inalienable Rights that our Founding Fathers allowed to be taken away means that our Founders would have had to be schizophrenic.\n \n However, other then these, our States have a greater latitude as long as the people of that State Delegates that authority. \n \n This is the correct understanding and the problem that the 14th Amendment fixed. The concept of Inalienable Rights.",

It really shows your character and hurts your cause....and I'm huge on gun rights and never agree with Sigma.\n \n This is pitiful.\n\n \n You are quite right to change the subject, Steeeeve. It's become a waste of my time to argue with Sigma over his desire to misunderstand what I have said. I wish MBell would return so we could have a talk. But you're here now, so let me talk to you.... \n \n \n I find myself in an odd place; agreeing with Sigma. It is without a doubt true the bill of rights didn't apply to the states prior to incorporation. It is also true that the constitution is a document to set up a federal government...it mentions relationships between federal and state but it is primarily federal powers only. In fact the 10th amendment makes this very clear and if you read a history of the 9th and 10th amendment it would be even more clear. As an example of what I'm talking about, it should be undoubtedly clear with the 1st amendment that 1st amendment didn't apply to the states. It starts with \"Congress shall make no law\". \n\n \n This I agree with. One of the cases you might want to look at that explains this (and deals with the 2nd. Amendment is Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886).\n \n \n Now, I'd go even further and say incorporation goes against what the constitution says but that is a different topic. \n\n \n I disagree. There are many, many decisions that lay out the constitutionality of incorporation through the 14th's due process clause. I will cite you some if you wish.\n \n \n The 14th amendment came along much later and in my opinion didn't incorporate jack. However, the courts seem to think so thats how you got your incorporated rights...of which the 2nd amendment hasn't been incorporated yet. \n\n \n I'm going to disagree with the first part, and agree with the second part. I have already addressed the issue of the intent of the 14th. Amendment in this thread. I welcome your comments on what I have said. I do agree that the 2nd. has not been incorporated yet. Neither has the 3rd, for that matter. And the reason is the same-no case has come along (until McDonald) that forces SCOTUS to deal with incorporating these amendments. \n \n In 1872 Slaughterhouse came down and SCOTUS agreed with you-in so far as the P&I clause goes. The path of \"selective incorporation\" through the due process clause has taken much longer to develop. SCOTUS first disagreed with your \"didn't incorporate jack\" view of the 14th. in 1925, when it used the due process clause of the 14th. to incorporate the 1st amendment right of free speech against the states. Thereafter, SCOTUS began a slow but steady assault on your view of no incorporation: freedom of assembly (1937), freedom of religion (1940), the 4th. Amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure (1949, although no exclusionary rule remedy for violation incorporated until 1961), the 5th. Amendment freedoms from self-incrimination (1964) and double jeopardy (1969), the 6th. amendment rights to public trial and notice of accusations against you (1948), right to counsel (1963), to confront and cross examine your accuser (1965), speedy trial and production of witnesses on your own behalf (1967), trial by jury (1968), and the 8th. Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishments (1962). \n \n Of course, all of the cases that incorporated these rights could represent an unconstitutional interpretation of the 14th. Amendment's due process clause--and be in effect a sort of long drawn out judicdial usurpation of the Constitution. \n \n If you feel that way, then I invite you to tell me why you would think so.\n \n We had a few SCOTUS decisions handed down today, but McDonald was not one of them. Monday is the last day of the June term of court, and I feel reasonably certain that on Monday we will find out if the high tide of incorporation through the due process clause will reach the 2nd. Amendment individual RKBA. \n \n While we wait for what most people see as an inevitable incorporation decision, let me ask everyone this: If McDonald is used to incorporate the 2nd. Amendment, then what do you feel will be the effect of incorporation on state laws?\n \n I do not think the effect will be anywhere near as great as some either hope or fear, but I invite others to express their opinion.",

   "\n (yeah, I saw it and copied it before you edited it to read \"If your position was owning a gun is too important an issue to be subject to the people's will so we want to take it out of their hands....\" You must learn to be quicker on the edit button. By the way, why did you edit out the claim that I have not been talking about the 2nd. Amendment?)\n\n \n I am not claiming that the overarching issue is not the Second Amendment, but since the issue incorporation against the States, the particular liberty that you want to protect is owning a gun. The edit was for clarity, and to emphasize the similarity between the quote which mentions individual liberty and the actual liberty you're looking to protect.\n \n I assume that was the reason for your self-quotes.\n \n \n\n And so you argue again that I am dishonest and contradictory because you say I am merely substituting my current values (edited to read a mere desire to own a gun) for those of a supposed current majority. Either you do not understand, or (more likely), you pretend not to understand that I am saying both sets of \"wills\" are bound by the requirement to respect the rights contained in the Bill of Rights.\n\n \n Why do you assume I don't understand that? I am not trying to trivialize the reasoning behind your values, or the reasoning behind the lawmakers goals or even the desires of this fictional majority. I thought it would be an obvious (perhaps even banal) point that you would think you're right and that this majority that disagrees with you is wrong. You want your will to prevail and the desires of the majority to be frustrated. \n \n I am simply pointing out that you cannot say you champion the \"people's will\" at the same time that you want your will to prevail instead of and contrary to the \"people's will\". To do so is a contradictory and dishonest position.\n \n \n\n Now Sigma, I do not believe you are so blissfully free of the ravages of intelligence that you cannot understand these quotes. You know very well that these quotes are talking about the individual liberties protected by the Bill of Rights. You know very well these quotes are not talking about taking \"the people's will out of the equation and substitute their own values and goals.\"\n\n \n Of course they are. Who else are they and you protecting individual liberties from, except the majority (either through direct democracy or from representatives of the people)? Before incorporation, these individual liberties (read: owning a gun since that's the liberty we're talking about) are subject to the \"people's will\", and they want to take the \"people's will\" out of the equation in regards to these individual liberties. In their view (and your view), these individual liberties are more important than the \"people's will\". \n \n However, you and others in this thread want to say that you champion the people's will at the same time, which is very dishonest and contradictory to do.\n \n \n\n I do in fact believe that the 2nd. Amendment individual RKBA is enshrined in the Bill of Rights. I do in fact believe that every right found within the Bill of Rights was enshrined there to place them beyond the tyranny of an irritated majority. I do in fact believe that the only way the will of \"the people\" can take away this right is by the supermajority process of amendment. I do not seek to elevate my will above the will of your alleged majority. I do in fact believe that neither my will nor the will of a fictional simple majority justifies taking a bottle of whiteout to the constitution to eliminate portions either I or they do not like.\n\n \n We're talking about incorporation, though. Currently, owning a gun is subject to the \"people's will\" in the various States. You want that to change. You want the \"people's will\" to be taken out of the equation. There is no other way that can be interpreted as far as I can tell.",

The real question to me is do you undo 70+ years of legal doctrine or do you, at some point, let stare decisis rule the day. At this point I would probably concede that Justice Scalia is right in that we should use \"state decisis\" if the ruling would be so devastating to out legal system that it would cause serious problems and overwhelming number of legal challenges.

   "Well I stated the thread on a slightly different topic, but all threads get hijacked to some degree, and since I believe we are on the eve of SCOTUS deciding the issue of 2nd. Amendment incorporation then I don't mind the discussion. I anticipate we will have to start a new thread just for McDonald, no matter how the court rules. I think we will find out Monday.\n \n My opinion is that the 14th. was expressly intended to incorporate the first 8 amendments in the Bill of Rights. I've already given some of my reasoning in this thread so I don't need to offer it again. Let me just say I disagree with you here, Steeeeve.\n \n \n If it is incorporated AND you apply the original meaning of the amendment than you could really invalidate many gun restriction laws. \n\n \n See I disagree again, but this may be two topics. If SCOTUS incorporated the 2nd., and if it went further and ruled the 2nd. was a fundamental and that right the test for infringement of the core of the right is \"strict scrutiny,\" then I still do not see many laws being in jeopardy.

Assumption three is simplistic, overbroad, incorrect, and requires some evidence from you that shows you understand how incorporation will work to thwart the will of the people. Both of your conclusions are likewise incorrect. \n \n I&#8217;ll offer to tell you why you are incorrect if you agree to accept my previous offer. Quid pro quo, Dr. Lecter. \n \n I see you now profess a love for the virtue of honesty, and rather than besmirch your honor you must decline to talk with someone who is &#8220;dishonest.&#8221; Would this be an attack of conscience?

Fortunately for me your conscience was still gone walkabout, and you were capable of talking with me this third time even though I had become &#8220;very&#8221; dishonest. \n \n And yes, I was persistent. I continued the discussion again, and in this last attempt at discussing things with me you rewarded my persistence by downgrading me. \n \n \n someone that I feel is being dishonest and contradictory. \n\n \n So in this fourth installment of our discussion I&#8217;m back to just being &#8220;dishonest and contradictory.&#8221; But, even though it was not Good Friday we find that your conscience has suddenly made a reappearance, if only temporarily.\n \n \n I cannot really have a discussion with someone that I feel is being dishonest and contradictory. \n\n \n Really? Isn&#8217;t that what you have been doing? This is the fourth time you have made this claim, and the fourth time you have condescended to talk with me despite this claim.

No, it is not an attack of conscience, Sigma. The only thing that is different from the other times you have condescended to answer me is that this time I asked your opinion of the actual issues involved in this thread. I did so because you have deliberately avoided discussing them so far. And I find that it is only when I ask you to tell me your views on the issues that you suddenly blanch and fall silent&#8212;all while attempting to justify this demurrer with the pretense of virtue. I see now this virtue of yours comes and goes at your convenience. If the issue is something you feel capable of talking about, then you will talk with me no matter whether I am &#8220;dishonest&#8221; or &#8220;very dishonest.&#8221; But if the subject is something you feel incapable of discussing, then you claim that it is piety and not timidity which guides your actions. \n \n Why not say &#8220;I&#8217;m done talking with you altogether&#8221; or &#8220;this is the last thing I have to say on that issue, Bryan. Don&#8217;t respond for my conscience tells me that I cannot talk anymore with someone who is dishonest?&#8221; \n \n No, it is only when I seek to probe your mind that you turn shy and virtuous. \n \n Sigma, be honest with yourself. Here is where we both know the issue lies between us: It is very easy to stay in the stands and throw empty beer cups at those in the arena. You know this from experience, for you have done quite enough of this. It is another thing entirely to enter the arena, tell the participants what you believe, and then defend those beliefs from cross-examination. That is what I asked you to do, and you have instead chosen to leave me in possession of the field. \n \n Discretion is not the better part of valor, Sigma. I know you delight in calling me dishonest&#8212;you have made this comment in every reply to me. If you truly believe this, then I cannot understand why you will not jump at the opportunity to further prove this point you seem so sure of. Would not a discussion of our (possibly) competing views on the issues involved in this thread give you a much wider opportunity to expose my dishonesty? \n \n Sigma, if you truly believe that I am armed with dishonest opinions, then I say &#8220;Molon Labe.&#8221;\n \n -- \n \n \"Let the man of learning, the man of lettered leisure, beware of that XXXXX and cheap temptation to pose to himself and to others as a cynic, as the man who has outgrown emotions and beliefs, the man to whom good and evil are as one. The poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer. There are many men who feel a kind of twisted pride in cynicism; there are many who confine themselves to criticism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even attempt. There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief toward all that is great and lofty, whether in achievement or in that noble effort which, even if it fails, comes to second achievement. A cynical habit of thought and speech, a readiness to criticise work which the critic himself never tries to perform, an intellectual aloofness which will not accept contact with life's realities - all these are marks, not as the possessor would fain to think, of superiority but of weakness. They mark the men unfit to bear their part painfully in the stern strife of living, who seek, in the affection of contempt for the achievements of others, to hide from others and from themselves in their own weakness. The r\u00f4le is easy; there is none easier, save only the r\u00f4le of the man who sneers alike at both criticism and performance. \n It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world. Among the free peoples who govern themselves there is but a small field of usefulness open for the men of cloistered life who shrink from contact with their fellows. Still less room is there for those who deride of slight what is done by those who actually bear the brunt of the day; nor yet for those others who always profess that they would like to take action, if only the conditions of life were not exactly what they actually are. The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be a cynic, or fop, or voluptuary. There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder. Well for these men if they succeed; well also, though not so well, if they fail, given only that they have nobly ventured, and have put forth all their heart and strength. It is war-worn Hotspur, spent with hard fighting, he of the many errors and valiant end, over whose memory we love to linger, not over the memory of the young lord who \"but for the vile guns would have been a valiant soldier.\"&#8212;from Theodore Roosevelt&#8217;s speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, April 23, 1910, entitled \"Citizenship in a Republic\"",

Just to be clear, you don't believe that incorporation of the Second Amendment against the States will prevent legislation that restricts gun ownership and use in any way, shape and form?

My comment on not having a discussion was referring to your invitation to expound upon my views about the Second Amendment and incorporation. The discussion we're having is to establish whether your position is contradictory and dishonest in the first place, since that would be the basis of such a discussion. To establish this, we examine the assumptions since if they are correct then the conclusions follow.

   "Well, historically a bit more than that. Remember the government, any government of ours has but 3 duties: Protect property, preserve contracts and provide for the rule of law...that would be the Constitution, federal, that bound all the states.\n\n \n The legal justification used, at least in his first inaugural address, was that:  It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void, and that acts of violence within any State or States against the authority of the United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances. Meaning that States cannot lawfully dissolve the union between themselves and the Federal government.\n \n Surely the Constitution binds the States, but not the Bill of Rights. Since we're talking about the Civil War, perhaps Lincoln can resolve the dispute: I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so [...] [t]hat the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power[...]\n \n \n\n Next question: when did the XIVth amendment pass?\n\n \n I don't know, offhand.

The XIVth amendment gave them the basic rights by applying the first 8 amendments to the slaves and declared them citizrens. Bryan has written some good pieces about how the court came to the idea of selective incorporation.\n \n There is many things that happened when the Southern legislators were prevented from convening; the XIV,XV,XVI, XVIIth amendments were deemed to be ratified by then Secretary of State, Knox.

That was for all the folks and not just black folks. Even I once commented that it (XIVth) amendment freed the slaves and made slaves of us all.\n \n Recall the: Article VII - Ratification Documents\n The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same\n \n Amendment 14 - Citizenship Rights. Ratified 7/9/1868. Note History\n \n 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \n 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n \n 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n \n 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n \n 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article\n \n \n \n The Supremacy Clause is a clause in the United States Constitution, Article VI, Clause 2. This clause asserts and establishes the Constitution, the federal laws made in pursuance of the Constitution, and treaties made by the United States with foreign nations as \"the Supreme Law of the Land\" (using modern capitalization). The text of Article VI, Clause 2, establishes these as the highest form of law in the American legal system, both in the Federal courts and in all of the State courts, mandating that all state judges shall uphold them, even if there are state laws or state constitutions that conflict with the powers of the Federal government. (Note that the word \"shall\" is used here and in the language of the law, which makes it a necessity, a compulsion.) \n MORE: Supremacy Clause: West's Encyclopedia of American Law (Full Article) from Answers.com\n \n Some Concerns about the Supremacy Clause\n There has been some debate as to whether or not some of the basic principles of the United States Constitution, such as the country's system of government or Bill of Rights, could be affected by an ambitious treaty. In the 1950s, a Constitutional Amendment known as the Bricker Amendment was proposed in response to such fears. This proposed amendment would have mandated that all American treaties shall not conflict with the manifest powers granted to the Federal Government.\n \n Subsequent Federal court cases such as Seery v. United States, 127 F. Supp. 601 (Court of Claims, 1955), Diggs v. Schultz, 470 F.2d 461 (1972), and Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957), over the course of time, established in legal decisions most of the limitations that had been proposed by the Bricker Amendment.[5] \n \n By this time, the Supreme Court was very busy :) Out of desparation, they turned to the XIVth amendment to lay out the rights of \"the citizens of the several states so there would be no confusion in relation to the Supremacy Clause.\n \n That is why there is still a need to incorporate the 2A into the XIVth amendment so all the citizens will have those rights protected from all the States.\n \n You did pretty good sitting through the examination :) But, we have hijacked the thread. I hope other people don't mind and look at the issue a bit differently. With any government, there is a tendency to expand and with each expansion comes a contraction of rights. Our solution is the Supremacy Clause and getting our rights incorporated into that against all States. That is the important reason for incorporation against the States.",

The States thought the same thing you do and the Supreme court made it certain that their rulings were applicable to the States. As I said, it took 100 years for them to clear that mess up so there will be no doubt as to applicability.

   "Very well then Sigma. If finishing this discussion can in any way be seen as a precondition to taking up my offer then here is my response. This time I'll make it as plain as I can for you, Sigma. My position has not changed. I favor incorporation. I favor it knowing full well that it would impose an outer limit on laws a state could enact-just as it currently does with the federal government. I do champion majority rule within the limits of respecting the individual liberties recognized in my Constitution. \n \n Your belief, stated many times now, is that such a position is contradictory-and therefore whoever says they favor both is being dishonest. And here is why we disagree, Sigma: The fundamental difference between us in this discussion is that I am talking about majority rule while your argument is founded upon a belief in unfettered mob rule. You believe that if a person favors majority rule (which you equate with mob rule) then individual liberty must be sacrificed at the transient demand of the current majority. This of course suggests that individual liberties must come and go at a whim. That is why I said I do not favor giving anyone the power to turn my liberties on and off like tap water. \n \n Therefore, I plead guilty to being contradictory. I contradict, and I reject, your simplistic view of majority rule-precisely because your view of majority rule takes that ideal to such an illogical extreme that it becomes unfettered mob rule, which is something our founders rejected with the passage of a Bill of Rights. \n \n This absolutist mob rule view of yours is every bit as illogically extreme, and false, as the absolutist interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment-which argues the words \"shall not be infringed\" means no gun regulation laws whatsoever. I trust you do not believe that would be the effect of incorporation. But, I don't know because you have no desire to expose your view on the matter-as is your absolute right-since at this point your fictional unfettered mob rule majority has not demanded that you sacrifice your right to remain silent on the issue. (By the way, although I favor majority rule, I would stand with you and oppose a majority demand that we start an inquisition and put you to the rack to find out your answer.) Do you still not see how illogically extreme your majority rule position is, Sigma? Do you not see how I can champion majority rule and still say it must have some limitation?\n \n Here is where we reach another dilemma, Sigma. I also suggest that your position within this discussion is also contradictory unless you are willing to apply this same view of yours to rights within the BoR other than the 2nd. Amendment RKBA. You cannot tell me you possibly hold this same illogical belief in unfettered mob rule when it involves other rights, like free speech, freedom of religion, trial by jury, or any other right recognized in the BoR. \n Now, as for the third time being the charm with my offer to you. Before you posted your last I predicted to another that you would again return to the claim I am dishonest and use that as the excuse for declining my offer again. To that other person, let me say this: Making such an easy prediction is no proof of a gift for prophecy.... \n \n I'll make the same offer again, Sigma. You are free to decline it again now that I have answered your questions. \n \n So cling to your belief, Sigma. Call me dishonest again and again to your heart's content. Just at least acknowledge that I disagree with your view, and that I am willing to accept the judgment of all others-not only on this issue, but also for prejudging you and deliberately making you an offer which I predicted you would never accept.",

I don't know why you equate majority rule with mob rule -- not me; you have done this. The system we have now, while not precisely democracy, certainly is supposed to be the majority opinion when voting on issues or people into office. I was referring to the system we have in place at this moment when I referred to the \"people's will\".\n \n So, then, why do you equate that with mob rule?\n \n \nMy position has not changed. I favor incorporation. I favor it knowing full well that it would impose an outer limit on laws a state could enact&#8212;just as it currently does with the federal government. I do champion majority rule within the limits of respecting the individual liberties recognized in my Constitution.\n\n \n Since you misrepresented my point, I cannot say you concede on the issue.\n \n Then we reach the crux of this particular point. You favor incorporation, knowing full well that it imposes an outer limit on the legislation the people of the several States can put in place. A rather stringent limit, given the language of the Amendment I might add, but that is beside the point. And then you state you champion majority rule. The dissonance between those two statements is rather large, Bryan. You are absolutely right when you claim that liberties can be at the mercy of the majority when the majority has the power to put people into office and change laws through directly democratic tools they have in various States. When you favor the people's will then you favor the people's ability to do these things. So, then, when you act to protect those liberties from the people you want to take away the people's ability to legislate in those areas.\n \n So, then, you claim you want to protect liberties but are unwilling to accept that you necessarily take away the \"people's will\" in that area? The contradiction should be apparent.\n \n \n\n This absolutist mob rule view of yours is every bit as illogically extreme, and false, as the absolutist interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment&#8212;which argues the words &#8220;shall not be infringed&#8221; means no gun regulation laws whatsoever. I trust you do not believe that would be the effect of incorporation.\n\n \n lol, of course that is what it means. There is literally no other meaning if you read the words as they are written. That has not been how it has thus far been interpreted, though, since other things besides the Constitution itself are taken into consideration. So far. However, again, that is beside the point.\n \n \nHere is where we reach another dilemma, Sigma.

There are many rights I want to remove from the power of the majority. The difference is that I don't claim to champion the people's will on those issues. You do. That is why your position is contradictory and dishonest. I hope that this makes it clearer for you.\n \n \nJust at least acknowledge that I disagree with your view, and that I am willing to accept the judgment of all others&#8212;not only on this issue, but also for prejudging you and deliberately making you an offer which I predicted you would never accept.\n\n \n Yes, it is clear you disagree with me. The \"judgment of all others\" is pretty laughable in this forum, as there seem to be few people self-aware enough to even understand the point ;) However, I am aware of the fact that you likely are unwilling to back down even if you came to see my point since you appear to be invested in your claim of truth. It seems to me that your post was an attempt to still be right in your own mind while satisfying my claim at the same time.",

I was referring to the system we have in place at this moment when I referred to the \"people's will\". \n\n \n I see. The you agree that the system we have in place now, while \"supposed to be the majority opinion when voting on issues,\" does limit the will of the people by requiring respect for the rights of free speech, press, assembly, religion; to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, right to remain silent, to trial by jury, to be free from cruel and unusual punishments, etc. And, in the federal system, the RKBA is a limitation-which will be enforced against the states tomorrow unless I am very mistaken. \n \n \n lol, of course that is what it means. There is literally no other meaning if you read the words as they are written. That has not been how it has thus far been interpreted, though, since other things besides the Constitution itself are taken into consideration. So far. However, again, that is beside the point. \n\n \n I thought you would say this. So you agree \"of course that is what it means.\" Now my question is whether you believe it should be interpreted that way and, if not, then in what way?\n \n Now we are headed back to the subjects in my offer to you-and here is your chance to expound upon them. You may, of course, decline again. And you may justify the refusal by again saying that it is \"beside the point.\" But I have noticed you don't say things unless you feel there is a point to be made with them. And I have noticed the \"that's beside the point\" comment is your way of saying something which you think is important enough to the discussion to bring up-but which you will not defend if challenged. But perhaps I'm wrong and these comments really don't pertain to our discussion. If so, then is there a reason why you keep injecting things into the discussion that have no point? \n \n \n You favor incorporation, knowing full well that it imposes an outer limit on the legislation the people of the several States can put in place. A rather stringent limit, given the language of the Amendment I might add, but that is beside the point. \n\n \n Ok then. Here is the heart of the final real disagreement between us. You assume I agree with you that incorporation will impose a \"rather stringent limit.\" We could have avoided all of this back and forth if you would have clarified this from the start. \n \n I simply do not agree that incorporation will impose \"a rather stringent limit.\" Indeed, I see nothing coming in McDonald that will change SCOTUS' clear comments to the contrary in Heller. You are aware that no right is held absolute, regardless of the language used-and that Heller reaffirmed this. And I am sure you are not suggesting that if incorporation happens then I could pre-order my personal tank and nuke. Heller does not suggest this, and McDonald will not change that view. Please, take a look at the post I made to Steeeeve linking the majority of gun regulations in my state. They represent the will of the people in my state. When (I hope) incorporation happens tomorrow there will undoubtedly be some challenges to these laws. In my opinion there is not one that I can't defend as constitutional when the time comes. In my opinion incorporation will not have the tremendous domino effect on the laws passed by the states pursuant to the will of the people. The cases I have read in the federal 4th. Circuit interpreting Heller show this will not be the case. The head of the Brady campaign said most challenges to state laws will fail, and for once in my life I agree with him. \n Since you \"might add\" by bringing it up, what do you believe the \"rather stringent limits\" to be? Why do you think your \"stringent limits\" must flow \"given the language of the amendment\"? Will you at least be willing to explain this comment?\n \n Please don't come back again with \"that is beside the point.\" As I said earlier, it is the qualifier I see you use when you want to make a statement that you think is important enough to add to our discussion but which you would rather not have to explain why you think so. In this case it is very much the point, for our differing opinions on how incorporation will affect the ability of the people to pass laws is the issue between us.\n \n Please take up my offer to discuss this issue. Tomorrow we will know what SCOTUS says, and tomorrow night I should be able to post my thoughts on McDonald. I would like to hear you offer yours, because I think that will clear up the matter between us.\n \n \n There are many rights I want to remove from the power of the majority. The difference is that I don't claim to champion the people's will on those issues. You do. That is why your position is contradictory and dishonest. I hope that this makes it clearer for you. \n\n \n Clear as mud. Please tell me that I have not wasted so much time arguing with you because we disagree over the right and wrong usage of the word \"champion.\" I have never said that my definition of champion of the will of the people makes me a slave to their will in all things. Have I not always said that I champion the peoples will, but that I do so only within the limits of the framework of our Constitution? I cannot believe we have been arguing like this merely because I disagree with your belief that I cannot use the word \"champion\" unless I am willing to acquiesce to the will of the people in all things, regardless of the limits on the people's will found in the Constitution. If you insist that this must be only acceptable use of the word, then please do not use the word on me. I have never been a \"my country, right or wrong\" person. Nor will I be one where the will of the people seeks to take away an individual right. But then I have been saying this from the start.....Dear God, what a foolish thing for us to have argued so much about. \n \n Now you have brought up another issue. Which rights do you not favor protecting from the whim of a temporary majority? Would the 2nd. Amendment RKBA be one of them?\n \n \n The \"judgment of all others\" is pretty laughable in this forum, as there seem to be few people self-aware enough to even understand the point. \n\n \n Yes, I'm still not sure you do-but I have tried once again to explain it. A bit of advice, though: The above quote is akin to claiming you are like Christ come to cleanse the temple and grace the unwashed masses with your brilliance. I would recommend at least some display of that superior intellect before you suggest your wisdom is like shining pearls being cast here before the swine.",

   "\"Living constitution\" means many things to many people. \nI think it is rather clear what \"living constitution\" means. I point is, the whole \"fundamental rights\" thing was the first step in manipulating the constitution. \"Only those rights so fundamental\" to the citizens were considered to be protected beyond simple due process which led to the whole \"scrutiny\" level thing. We are up to like 3-4 levels of that now. This was never the intent or meaning of the 14th amendment and as such I reject it immediately.\n \n \nFundamental rights and scrutiny tests are (good or bad according to your view) with us to stay.\nWell so are a lot of things that are wrong with the constitution. I don't think it would be a gut wrenching departure to get rid of scrutiny tests and fundamental rights rulings (unlike incorporation). \n \n \nThe important thing for me is to see whether SCOTUS will keep faith with preceding case law and declare the RKBA fundamental, and choose to use the most restrictive \"strict scrutiny\" test for infringement. \nRight, and I can't support that because it is an \"ends justify the means\" type of thinking. We you are going to say the 14th amendment protects fundamental rights to the point where \"strict scrutiny\" must apply then that means someone has to decide what those fundamental rights are. Naturally it would be 9 people. Now how do the nine judges decide? Well, you really have no basis since it is a newish concept. Even more so since rights change. What you end up with (to keep this short) is nine people making value decisions based upon personal preferences...aka a legislative decision. \n \n Meanwhile, if you just accept incorporation all you had to do was look at the meaning of the 2nd amendment and apply that to the states. The same things the federal government can or can't do would be the same as what the states can or can't do. Simple as that. It does mean many less gun laws though.",

I've given you my opinion. You have chosen to reject it-as you are free to do. \n \n Now, what is your opinion on incorporation of the 2nd. Amendment RKBA?\n \n \n \"Should\" is a value judgement. It is not my area of concern. \n\n \n Another evasion. I was asking your opinion of a subject you and I were discussing. Do you mean your own opinion is not a matter of concern to you, or the entire issue is of no concern to you? Whichever it is, it concerned you enough at the time to mention it. I'm just asking why. I don't understand this reticence, Sigma. These are your words, after all. I only ask you why you use them. Why is it so difficult to tell me what you think? \n \n \n I did when I pointed out that, as written, the Amendment allows no restrictions whatsoever. Whether it is currently interpreted that way is immaterial. \n\n \n Then why mention it at all if it is immaterial? Should I start ignoring you altogether if you wish to post things that are immaterial? No, it was material enough to your argument to mention it.

That was why I said \"in all things.\" Now you have clarified what you meant by saying \"protecting liberties takes away the people's ability to legislate in those areas alone.\" \n And on that point, I find myself in perfect agreement with you. \n \n Oh, and I think you missed this one again....\n \n \n Now you have brought up another issue.

Amendment RKBA be one of them? \n\n \n I ask them again because I believe you do have something material to add here. Are you willing to answer these questions? \n \n Sigma, I am only asking you to explain your own words. I've done the same for you, even if you still reject my explanation. A discussion involves people sharing their competing (and sometimes similar) views. Please, Sigma, don't further waste my time by throwing out comments that you want me to consider as material to your explanations-only to run from them and claim they really were not material when I ask why you said these things. There are no sticks and stones here. It's just words-and we may even be able to agree on some things. \n \n \n I'm not talking about intellect. I'm talking about self-reflection and the ability to admit their wrong or even stop long enough to consider the point. \n\n \n Again a rewording when challenged-but I'm not sure that changes the claim you make to superior intellect. In any event, all I am saying about it is I believe it should require some demonstration of proof before acceptance of the fact can be commanded.\n \n But assuming for a moment this rewording is what you meant in the first place....Doesn't your tag line speak volumes about your willingness to do the same? \n \n I once had a judge tell me \"I'm not always right but I am never in doubt.\" It seems you believe you must be \"always right and never in doubt\"-which leads you to a certain belief that those who disagree with you must be wrong. \n \n Now, if you will excuse me, I need to read McDonald.....",

   "Back to the &#8220;it must be all or nothing&#8221; view of a champion of majority rule. I&#8217;ve given you my opinion. You have chosen to reject it&#8212;as you are free to do. \n [...]\n Why is it so hard to accept that someone favors majority rule within the limits imposed by the Bill of Rights?\n\n \n Because favoring the imposition of limits upon majority rule does not favor majority rule. It is an oxymoron; a contradiction is inherent in that position. Since, in the matter of the ownership and use of guns, you favor the imposition of limits on the people's will while stating you champion the people's will, your position is contradictory and dishonest.\n \n \n\n Now, what is your opinion on incorporation of the 2nd. Amendment RKBA?\n [...]\n Another evasion. I was asking your opinion of a subject you and I were discussing. Do you mean your own opinion is not a matter of concern to you, or the entire issue is of no concern to you?\n\n \n My own opinion is not a matter of concern in this discussion, which is to establish whether or not your position is contradictory and dishonest. That is an argument of fact, not a value debate.\n \n \nThen why mention it at all if it is immaterial?\n\n \n The statement that, as written, the Amendment allows no restrictions whatsoever is material to my reply to your point. Whether or not the current interpretation views it that way is immaterial. I mention it to draw a division between the two.\n \n \nI know you have an opinion on the merits of Heller&#8217;s interpretation. I&#8217;m just asking, again, that you share them with us.\n [...]\n Are you willing to answer these questions? \n\n \n I know you're asking that. However, as I said, since you seem incapable of admitting that protecting the ability to own a gun necessarily prevents the people from restricting gun ownership to the extent the people are currently able to do, then you seem incapable also of having any honest discussion.\n \n It is a basic and obvious point, and you are fiercely disputing it.\n \n \nSigma, I am only asking you to explain your own words. I&#8217;ve done the same for you, even if you still reject my explanation.\n\n \n That's an obvious requirement, given we're discussing your position. I've explained every accusation against you.\n \n \nAgain a rewording when challenged&#8212;but I&#8217;m not sure that changes the claim you make to superior intellect. In any event, all I am saying about it is I believe it should require some demonstration of proof before acceptance of the fact can be commanded.\n\n \n Again an obvious requirement since you misunderstood the original construction. I would have to reword what I said to clarify what I said. It's an observation of posters I have had discussions with. Why would I have need of any other person to accept my personal observations? I mention it as a way to inform you that your statment about the judgement of others is not compelling to me.\n \n \n\n Now, if you will excuse me, I need to read McDonald\n\n \n You might want to pay close attention to this portion: \n JUSTICE BREYER is correct that incorporation ofthe Second Amendment right will to some extent limit the legislative freedom of the States[...] Incorporation always restricts experimentation and local variations\n [...]\n [T]he enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.\n \n Incorporation necessarily restricts the people's ability to express their will. Do you yet see the connection? The position that you champion the people's will while favoring incorporation of the Second Amendment are incompatible.",

   "\n \n \nYet the Government they created had no power to stop the States.\n\n \n \nOf course it did.\n \n The simple fact that the Constitution promises to always provide a republican form of government instills a power to keep that promise. . . .\n\n \n I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing. The guarantee of a particular form of government is a far cry from specifying every liberty the States must protect.\n \n Perhaps you can clarify the connection.\n\n \n As I said, I am relating the focus placed by SCOTUS on the citizen's right to arms and its federal protection status independent of the 2nd Amendment.\n \n This principle was explained in PRESSER v. STATE OF ILLINOIS, 116 U.S. 252 (1886).\n \n A quick summary: A private group desired to have an armed drill and march within city limits but state militia law forbade \"bodies of men to associate together as military organizations, or to drill or parade with arms in cities and towns unless authorized by law...\" The question before SCOTUS was if that particular section of Illinois militia law was in violation of the federal 2nd Amendment. In answering that question the Court referred to its last 2nd Amendment case where it held that the 2nd Amendment was not binding on the states and the right to arms was not granted by the Constitution:\n [*]\"We think it clear that the sections under consideration, which only forbid bodies of men to associate together as military organizations, or to drill or parade with arms in cities and towns unless authorized by law, do not infringe the right of the people to keep and bear arms. But a conclusive answer to the contention that this amendment prohibits the legislation in question lies in the fact that the amendment is a limitation only upon the power of congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state. It was so held by this court in the case of U. S. v. Cruikshank, in which the chief justice, in delivering the judgment of the court, said that the right of the people to keep and bear arms 'is not a right granted by the constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed, but this, as has been seen, means no more than that it shall not be infringed by congress. This is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government, . . . \"\n So, the Court reaffirms the 2nd Amendment does not operate upon state law, it does not restrict state action and even if it did, the particular statue under inspection in Presser would not violate the 2nd Amendment.\n \n But the Court goes further; since the \"right of the people to keep and bear arms\" secured by the 2nd Amendment does not flow from the Amendment and the right's existence is not dependent in any manner upon the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, a question is raised . . . \n \n  Is there a federal liberty protection interest of the right independent of the 2nd Amendment? \n \n The Presser Court expounds on fundamental, founding principle . . . \n [*]\"It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the states, and, in view of this prerogative of the general government, as well as of its general powers, the states cannot, even laying the constitutional provision in question out of view, prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms, so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security, and disable the people from performing their duty to the general government. But, as already stated, we think it clear that the sections under consideration do not have this effect.\"\n This explains a mingled dependence on the same resource, (armed citizens), in the reverse of what is called nowadays \"states rights.\" The states are barred from disarming the citizens because those armed citizens are also the resource upon which the security of the federal government depends.\n \n This is interesting also because it says that mandate against states disarming citizens exists without reference to the 2nd Amendment (\"even laying the constitutional provision in question out of view\") and the protection of the right exists in two planes. It exists in the \"general powers\" (those laid out specifically in the Constitution) and in the \"prerogative of the general government.\" That word, prerogative, describes a underlying principle of our Constitutional Republic.\n \n Because the Constitution promises to the states to forever provide a republican form of government, a power is thus granted by inference to keep that promise, to secure the continuance of our fundamental, founding principles. The classical republican principles that the founders embraced had, and the government they then established has, as one of its most fundamental components, an armed citizenry (\"it is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable . . .\" as SCOTUS puts it).\n \n The federal government then, in keeping that republican promise, can not allow any state to act in a un-republican fashion, such as disarming the citizens. Understand also that the principle works both ways; the federal government can not act to disarm the citizens because the states rely on those people for their security.\n \n The simple promise of Article IV, \u00a7 4 encompasses a tremendous breadth of federal and state governmental action that must conform to principle. The right of the people to keep and bear arms as just a sliver of the pie.",
