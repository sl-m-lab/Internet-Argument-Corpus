   "http://www.zeitgeistmovie.com/\n \n STATEMENT FROM WEBSITE\n \n \n \nZeitgeist was created as a non-profit filmiac expression to inspire people to start looking at the world from a more critical perspective and to understand that very often things are not what the population at large think they are. The information in Zeitgeist was established over a year long period \n of research and the current Source page on this site lists the basic sources used / referenced.\n \n Soon, an Interactive Transcript will be online with detailed footnotes and links so exact sourcesand further research can be relayed.\n \n Now, it's important to point out that there is a tendency to simply disbelieve things that are counter to our understanding, without the necessary research performed. For example, some information contained in Part 1 and Part 3, specifically, is not obtained by simple keyword searches on the Internet. You have to dig deeper. For instance, very often people who look up \"Horus\" or \"The Federal Reserve\" on the Internet draw their conclusions from very general or biased sources. Online encyclopedias or text book Encyclopedias often do not contain the information contained in Zeitgeist. However, if one takes the time to read the sources provided, they will find that what is being presented is based on documented evidence. Any corrections, clarifications & further points regarding the film are found on the Clarifications page.\n \n That being said, It is my hope that people will not take what is said\n in the film as the truth, but find out for themselves, for truth is not told, it is realized. \n \n Thank You\n \n \n \n This is an interesting documentary that I think people should watch.\n However, if you're offended by criticisms of religion, the \"War on\n Terror\" or our government than you should beware. Of course there are\n factual errors in this film and the film makers have taken artistic\n liberties with some of the information. Instead of taking it for face\n value, people should watch it and investigate on their own to weed out\n the truth. I think of it more as an example of the greed that rules\n this country and the indoctrination of fear that keeps American\n citizens pliant and willing to accept whatever they're told. Many\n things presented in this film (which was released online for free)\n I've never seen before and were very intriguing. Of course the people\n behind this film do have an agenda...what is it? If it is just to\n promote a liberal point of view why not make money off of it like\n Michael Moore? Instead, they're presenting this material for free.\n \n I'm not a conspiracy nut but I do believe that the\n current administration that is running this country is corrupt.\n Anyways, this is a two hour film so those of you who have time to\n watch it...I'd like to hear your opinion.\n \n P.S. this was posted in the General Forum but nobody seems to give a shite so I re-posted it under this forum as much of what this film has to say is political. I gave this film to many of my friends but they either don't have time to watch it or don't really seem to care...they want to keep their heads in the sand. I'm really dissapointed at the lack of response I've received. I'm not claiming that this film is entirely true (they claim it is not in their statement) but I was hoping that it would at least inspire some sort of dialogue........",

   "I think that the reason that people didn't reply is because they either already know most if not all that the movie shows, or they think it's utter nonsense and don't wish to discuss it.\n \n I myself haven't seen the movie, but I know what it's about. This doesn't mean that I agree with all of it, but the general premise is fairly correct.\n Unfortunately people these days don't wish to acknowledge truths that are at odds with the way that they've been told the world works. That's because it would mean that they'd have to reevaluate all the things that they think they know and that takes time and effort, something that people these days don't want to do because they're lazy.\n \n We're at the stage where people have either accepted reality or choose to live on in ignorance forever.",

I didn't know all the things that our founding fathers said about the big shot bankers destroying our country with the Federal Reserve etc.\n \n I'm not saying you should believe everything in this film, even the makers say that you shouldn't. I've struggled with wondering if I should endorse this film because it seems like you can't trust anybody anymore. Everybody seems to lie and it's scary. I don't even know if I can trust Zeitgeist but I'd rather open my eyes to the POSSIBILITY that some of this is true rather than keep my eyes closed and allow the people in power to control my thinking.\n \n \nSo nobody seems to give a ####.

Why do you have no intention to see this movie? Are you afraid it might change some of your thinking about the world? Would you see a film that exposed lies and hypocrisies from the democrats but won't see one that exposes the people you align yourself with? \n \n What is normal? A citizen who puts on their blinders to any possibility of change? Someone who accepts what a large book tells them? Someone who accepts what the ruling powers tell them? To me a normal person is one who questions our government, which is actually what we are supposed to do. Religious keeps people afraid, war keeps people angry, and money keeps people in power. Don't you see it?\n \n Baron, your comments are depressing. They make me think that this country has no hope.",
