   "Dec 27, 2006 - BOSTON (Reuters) - In a setback to gay marriage opponents, Massachusetts' highest court said on Wednesday it would not require a vote on a proposed constitutional amendment that could lead to a ban on gay marriage in the only U.S. state where it is legal.\n \n Acting on a lawsuit spearheaded by Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the state's Judicial Court said it could not force another branch of government to act after lawmakers recessed last month without deciding to put the gay marriage issue on the ballot. \n \n \"Beyond resorting to aspirational language that relies on the presumptive good faith of elected representatives, there is no presently articulated judicial remedy for the Legislature's indifference to, or defiance of, its constitutional duties,\" the court wrote in its decision.http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=2754361\n \n \n There is extreme irony in the fact that the anti-gay marriage advocates sue to make the legislator do something, yet earlier complained when the courts exhibited \"judicial activism\" when they told the legislator to do something...\n Boggles the mind...",

It's more of a privilege; we go along with it because we know disabled people are better off--we feel it's the moral thing to do. But disabled people didn't try to redefine an institution to get that, either, as you are doing. I understand your arguing that because we give disability (which isn't specified as a right), that we should give gay marriage (which isn't specified as a right). But that's not necessarily true. We don't take just anyone who comes along and give them something they demand as a right just because people are on disability. You're trying to change the subject here--the point is that people don't just automatically get something just because someone else has it. I don't get to claim a lot of things: disability, social security, etc. There are reasons people get those, and if society at some point decides to redefine marriage so that you can get it, so be it, but it's not happening (which is, of course, why your movement tries to use the courts as a means to an end to get what it wants rather than allow democracy to run it's course).",

I see it as how YOUR side can't seem to get the legal and constitutional arguments right.\n The courts have made a variety of rulings based on the constitutional issues involved, but in the end when I hear your side try to argue constitutional issues, a lot of it just blatantly ignores the constitutional issues and instead proceeds with an inane stand-point of denial. \"Well, that can't be the case because then X, Y, and Z would happen.\"\n But then you thoroughly fail to get the COMPLETE ARGUMENT whereby X, Y, and Z are addressed by the FULL ARGUMENT of \"that\".\n \n \n \nYes, voting is a right, but guess what: 15 year olds can't vote in American elections.

Age discrimination DOES exist in this country.\n And below the age of 18, a LOT of rights are restricted on the legitimate state interest of maturity.\n Citizens of Zimbabwe? Citizenship is another legitimate state interest.\n \n You say \"get it\" but the only thing I get is that you're putting up lame road-blocks to ignore the FULL ISSUE of what I'm talking about.\n It's funny how you continually avoid the words \"legitimate state interest\".\n What I am talking about IS HOW the governmnent interprets the constitution and addresses the issue of rights.\n \n Over and over again, THIS is the drivel I see from too many on your side. You ignore the issue of the 14th amendment and \"legitimate state interests\" with the pretense that if we recognize these things as rights, then it means unbridled access with no exceptions.\n \n Quite frankly, it demonstrates a thorough deficiency on your side to recognize the logistics of the constitution.

I could say \"societal view of marriage is two people\" and ignore the gender issue altogether like you ignore the existence of the race issue.\n \n \n \nYOU used the term \"fundamental right\" in the post I was reponding to. I was merely repeating your language... \n\n If you're mirroring my usage, then you would realize that the use of the word \"fundamental\" is not a key issue, and thus your argument is moot unless you are prepared to show more proof than you are capable.\n The word \"fundamental\" was put there by Loving v Virginia. That justifies my usage of the term.\n If you want to drop your argument, be my guest.\n \n \n \nMassachusetts is the ONLY case you can really point to, and it's probably going to be overturned the way things are going there.\n\n No. It won't.\n There is a possibility that the state could adopt an AMENDMENT, but not \"overturned\".\n Because as I've held all along, an AMENDMENT is the only thing which prevents the constitutional requirement.

It said what shouldn't have needed to be said.\n\n \n Ah, \"unnecessary\". Your opinion, since apparently most people didn't think it was unnecessary at all given that it was passed and that takes the will of the people. The thing is, the 15th is only one in a number of rights-guaranteeing amendments: do you also think the 1st amendment was unnecessary? How about the 19th? What you don't get is that the historical precendent IS to use amendments to guarantee rights. That's why NONE of these amendments are \"unnecessary\" including the 15th.\n \n And you seem to think the 15th was unnecessary because of the 14th, but in fact, they are about 2 different issues. The 15th was about voting. The 14th was about due process and equal protection. Even a basic reading of the amendments makes this clear, so apparently you haven't read them in quite some time.\n \n Which brings me to the next point ...\n \n The fact that some (apparently yourself included) viewing the 14th as an 'amendment-to-end-all-amendments'. It's fascinating that some people tend to take anything they want recongnized as a right and just invoke the 14th because it happens to be worded more generally than the other amendments. If anything, IT'S the poorly done amendment rather than the 15th, because it speaks in such general terms that people try to think it covers things like same-sex marriage when it never mentions marriage of any kind at all!! You use the 14th to try and make the case for same-sex marriage, but in fact the 14th is not what guarantees opposite-sex marriage to begin with because opposite-sex marriage existed before the 14th! What gives marriage benefits it's status as a 'right' is society's value of it, not an amendment. The same thing that makes us give things like disability and social security to some people. But because that standard is set, and because you want the guarantee of marriage to be codified somehow (even if by the courts requiring it), then the onus is on you and your movement to see to it that such an amendment is put in place ... just like it was in the case of women and black people.\n \n If your rights are truly being infringed as you say they are, then take care of it: get an amendment passed to take care of the situation. It worked for women. It worked for blacks. It worked for older teenagers (the 26th). Why are you so scared to do it in an historically precedented way?? Hmm? emoticon_xangel \n \n \nAnd on another level, can you acknowledge how interracial marriage was viewed as a right WITHOUT an amendment?\n Oh wait. You pull off that trick by COMPLETELY IGNORING the social context whereby a majority, by a margin of 3 to 1, viewed race as a requirement for marriage.\n\n \n No, other races could still marry: they just wanted them to marry each other. You see the fundamental view of marriage was still there (that it was between a man and a woman). But same-sex marriage is totally new and different--it seeks to completely redefine marriage. That's why people see the issue differently than interracial marriage. And that's why your \"marriage\" movement is being limted in most cases to civil unions and is probably going to fail in Massachusetts. \n \n \nConsidering you typically don't even respond to my actual argument, I don't see a need to come up with anything better.\n\n \n Considering you typically don't even realize you've been responded to (because you only want to be responded to YOUR way), I don't really care what you want to come up with. (shrug)\n \n \nAGAIN you reply to ONLY PART of the argument.\n Yes. Anybody \"could claim any sort of arrangement\" as a right of marriage.\n But whether or not it can be prevented by the government rests on the existence of the LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST. If there is a legitimate state interest for the discrimination to exist, then preventing it is illegal.\n\n \n Then you're shifting your argument. The issue now is no longer about the 14th amendment (which was your first basis) but rather about whether it's in the state's interest to give gays marriage. I say no way. It's not in the state's interest to redefine marriage at all, and IS in the state's interest to keep marriage what it has been from day one in this country: opposite-sex. Apparently most agree with me. And society does get to decide what's in it's interests, after all. \n \n Also, you're jumping the gun by claiming there is discrimination in the first place; you have the same right to marry as anyone else: you can marry a woman just as easily as I can. (I'm assuming you are male.) It's just that you want to marry a completely different way than everyone else. Well, guess what ... you may not get to do that, because that's not marriage. Anymore than someone being wed to a crowd, or his sister, or whatever other arrangement you could come up with.\n \n \nThe courts have made a variety of rulings based on the constitutional issues involved\n\n \n Like interracial marriage (Loving)? Nope, that's not same-sex marriage. What else ya' got? You have no real precedent for same-sex marriage, because it redefines marriage. That's what you never seem to get. And it's why states aren't adopting your ideas.\n \n \nYou ignore the issue of the 14th\n\n \n See above, about your all-powerful amendment. With your wide open view of it, it might as well be a constitution in and of itself. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \namendment and \"legitimate state interests\" with the pretense that if we recognize these things as rights, then it means unbridled access with no exceptions.\n\n \n Well, when you argue with no limits given to what you want, then what do you expect people to think? What LIMITS are you willing to put on marriage? Why should we draw the line RIGHT PAST merely two types of couples since you're opening the pandora's box of moving the line to begin with? Think about it. For once.\n \n \nQuite frankly, it demonstrates a thorough deficiency on your side to recognize the logistics of the constitution. And even when it's patiently explained to you, you still refuse to address it.\n\n \n Bullsh**. You're just sour grapes that most people don't see it way you do and so you portray disagreement as deficiency. Par for the course for you, because it's just another case of you trying to make up for a weak and unaccepted argument with ad hominem. Sorry, but you don't hold the monopoly on constitutional interpretation, no matter how much you arrogantly think you do. :) \n \n \nI don't see how you can keep claiming this when it is PROVEN FALSE.\n Back in 1967, \"societal views of marriage\" meant SAME RACE MARRIAGE ONLY, by an overwhelming majority that supercedes that seen today against gay marriage. By a margin of 3 to 1, people DISAPPROVED of interracial marriage. Society \"viewed\" marriage as \"between a man and a woman of the same race\".\n The way you IGNORE the fact that RACE WAS A KEY FACTOR in their recognition of marriage can be used in my favor too.\n\n \n LOL. Foundit, YOU'RE the one trying to act as though this is somehow something other than a race issue. It's those who argue the opposite point on this that emphasize that it was about race!\n \n \nIf you're mirroring my usage, then you would realize that the use of the word \"fundamental\" is not a key issue, and thus your argument is moot unless you are prepared to show more proof than you are capable.\n\n \n My argument is not based on the word \"fundamental\" anymore than yours is. I was just repeating your use of the word; stop quibbling over every little thing here. If you don't like the word \"fundamental\" being used in this discussion then don't use it.\n \n \nThe word \"fundamental\" was put there by Loving v Virginia. That justifies my usage of the term.\n\n \n You just said your use of the term is not a key issue. Make up your mind, already! \n \n \nThere is a possibility that the state could adopt an AMENDMENT, but not \"overturned\". Because as I've held all along, an AMENDMENT is the only thing which prevents the constitutional requirement. WHY do you think your side is soooooo DESPARATE to get amendments in place???\n\n \n Actually, as I explained above, an amendment is what YOU should be pursuing. They're just trying to keep you from using a constitutional loophole to your advantage (the fact that those who wrote their constitution never imagined someone actually wanting to get married to someone of the same sex. THAT\\'S the only reason it\\'s not there. The same reason they didn\\'t bother to say that marrying 5 wives is not allowed, or marrying 2 year olds. They assumed they would never NEED to address such silly matters as those and same-sex marriage.\n \n \nThe 14th amendment guarantees equality, but that equality can be discriminated against if a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST exists for doing so.The 14th amendment guarantees equality, but that equality can be discriminated against if a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST exists for doing so.The 14th amendment guarantees equality, but that equality can be discriminated against if a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST exists for doing so.\n\n \n And again you try to use the 14th as the all-powerful amendment capable of addressing any possible situation that could ever come up. Why not just start a petition to get rid of the rest of the constitution and let the 14th be the only thing that\\'s left? Because by the way you try to use it, we don\\'t even need the rest of the constitution.",
