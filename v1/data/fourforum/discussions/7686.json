Makes sense from a NHS point of view, but without nationalised health care it does seem a bit odd.\n \n The first I think is there for the 'ooh look at the baby!' aspect, tagged on as one of those 'good idea at the time' amendments. Unless of course it was standard practise for everyone with a means to alerted the parent if something has gone wrong with development, the rare cases where a heart or brain doesn't form and the death of the baby is unpreventable. Or as a way of ensuring that the fetus hasn' reached a certain stage of development - though then it would make sense just to have it over the period of weeks that this stage would fall under.\n \n The third is probably to stop people getting abortions, and to clear up the occasionaly wierdness that happens when an injury causes a miscarriage but the other was going to abort - same sort of thing as having it still being illegal to shoot people as they comit suicide.",

Instead both parents, the father as well as the mother, owe them support and protection from harm.\n 5.

   "National Platform of the Libertarian Party\n Adopted in Convention, July 2, 2006, Portland Oregon Official Website\n \n \nI.8 Reproductive Rights\n \n The Issue: The tragedies caused by unplanned, unwanted pregnancies are aggravated and sometimes created by government policies of censorship, restriction, regulation and prohibition.\n Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good-faith views on both sides, we believe that government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration.\n \n The Principle: Individual rights should not be denied nor abridged on the basis of sex, age, dependency, or location. Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for other people's abortions, nor should any government or individual force a woman to have an abortion. It is the right and obligation of the pregnant woman regardless of age, not the state, to decide the desirability or appropriateness of prenatal testing, Caesarean births, fetal surgery, voluntary surrogacy arrangements and/or home births.\n \n Solutions: We oppose government actions that either compel or prohibit abortion, sterilization or any other form of birth control. Specifically we condemn the practice of forced sterilization of welfare recipients, or of mentally retarded or \"genetically defective\" individual. We support the voluntary exchange of goods, services or information regarding human sexuality, reproduction, birth control or related medical or biological technologies. We oppose government laws and policies that restrict the opportunity to choose alternatives to abortion.\n \n Transitional Action: We support an end to all subsidies for childbearing or child prevention built into our present laws.\n \n",
