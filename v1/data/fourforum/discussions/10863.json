Or 'faith', for that matter.\n \n I do have to wonder: are you genuinely, heart-attack serious in your belief that the multiple meanings of the word 'evolution' are sinister in nature and purpose? Because it strikes me as odd that members of a conspiracy dedicated to the misleading use of a term would endlessly, repeatedly, patiently (and as time goes by, less patiently) explain in excruciating detail the important differences between the uses of that term.\n \n Take me, for instance: are you prepared to tell me to my face that I'm being deceptive when I talk about evolution?

So when people say evolution isn't atheistic, you see it as proof that it is atheistic and evolutionists are liars. When umpteen independent scientific disciplines all corroborate the tentative predictions of evolutionary theory, it's proof that evolution has pervaded all of science and that all scientists are liars. When scientists say that I.D. is religiously motivated pseudoscience and produce documentary evidence to that effect, it's proof that I.D. is really good science and scientists want to suppress it because they're scared.\n \n Just for a moment, pretend your conspiracy theory is nonsense. Doesn't all the wealth of evidence admit another explanation? That common descent is a fact, evolutionary theory is robustly supported by multiple scientific disciplines because it's right, that I.D. has no demonstrable scientific merit, isn't widely supported, is religiously motivated, and hasn't earned its place in the science classroom alongside E=MC2?\n \n Compare the two scenarios, and ask yourself: which demands the existence of the fewest conspiratorial liars to prop it up? And in which scenario do the conspirators have the clearest, most obvious, and self-declared motivation to behave as they are? Seriously, now: you're prepared to take the utter lack of atheist trappings within evolutionary biology as evidence of a vast, silent conspiracy, so why ignore the public statements of sites like AIG and I.D organisations to the effect that they have an agenda of bringing religion to the forefront of scientific endeavour?

How many other words have evolving definitions such as this word does?\n \n \nTake me, for instance: are you prepared to tell me to my face that I'm being deceptive when I talk about evolution? Can you point to anything I've ever written on the subject that seems intentionally misleading? Have I equivocated - or have I rather expended considerable effort in the service of clarity?\n\n \n I would never call you deceptive or intentionally misleading at all Peeling. But I do consider you a victim who is a true believer in the great lie of evolution. Just as we make certain leaps of faith that although certain aspects of Creation can't be proven scientifically, so do evolutionists do the same exact thing. Only they do it under the guise of a constantly evolving science, thus the constantly changing definition.\n \n \nThe feeling I get is that it doesn't matter a wet slap what anyone says or does, you'll interpret it according to the requirements of your pet conspiracy theory. So when people say evolution isn't atheistic, you see it as proof that it is atheistic and evolutionists are liars.

When scientists say that I.D. is religiously motivated pseudoscience and produce documentary evidence to that effect, it's proof that I.D. is really good science and scientists want to suppress it because they're scared.\n\n \n Just as you make certain assumptions that never change regarding evo, so does the Creationist hold that certain absolutes exist regarding Creation, such as a personal God created all that is. We understand science can't prove God which is a huge stumbling block for the evolutionist, but isn't one at all for us because we can see the spiritual which evades the scientific perspective at all levels of understanding. \n \n And ID would insist that it is evolution that's the atheistically motivated pseudo science, so we will continue to disagree there also.\n \n \nJust for a moment, pretend your conspiracy theory is nonsense. Doesn't all the wealth of evidence admit another explanation? That common descent is a fact, evolutionary theory is robustly supported by multiple scientific disciplines because it's right, that I.D. has no demonstrable scientific merit, isn't widely supported, is religiously motivated, and hasn't earned its place in the science classroom alongside E=MC2?\n\n \n If the foundation upon which evo is based is false, such as the age of the Earth and the interpretation of fossil information. Then all of the conclusions that are derived from those original faulty conclusions is as wrong as wrong can be, and as deceptive as deceptive can be. So common descent is not a fact at all. It's a hope that is pursued with a vengeance. But in no way is factually provable at all.\n \n \nCompare the two scenarios, and ask yourself: which demands the existence of the fewest conspiratorial liars to prop it up? And in which scenario do the conspirators have the clearest, most obvious, and self-declared motivation to behave as they are? Seriously, now: you're prepared to take the utter lack of atheist trappings within evolutionary biology as evidence of a vast, silent conspiracy, so why ignore the public statements of sites like AIG and I.D organisations to the effect that they have an agenda of bringing religion to the forefront of scientific endeavour? They come right out and announce their unscientific bias and conspiratorial intent! It's the foundation of their recruiting drive! Doesn't that ring any alarm bells?\n\n \n This argument is totally fallacious Peeling, as it attempts to promote a motive to deceive by the Creationists while stating that evolutionists could have no such motive due to the alleged impersonal nature of the scientific endeavor. Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it. The reality that you are blind to what believers see so clearly is that apart from Christ, it is impossible to see the spiritual battle humanity is fighting. \n \n So we understand the deceptions that evo offers are designed to keep people like you focussed on Mans intellect rather than believing God through faith in His scriptural promises found in the bible. I consider your beliefs (evolutionists) as shallow and juvenile as they can be because you're actually simple enough to trust mans intellect regarding things that happened 14-20 billion years ago allegedly, as you admittedly base them on scientific predictions which are derived at by doing experiments which are set up and based on other predictions, simply because you know that no real and confirmable evidence exists from that time period. \n \n You base everything you believe regarding evo on the big bang first happening. But you can't prove the big bang actually happened at all. But based on certain assumption which are based on certain predictions. Now I realize I've taken my argument back to the big bang belief in the beginning of time. But I could just as easily skip that aspect of your scientific assumptions and start at 300 million years ago, or 200 million years ago, or at 65 million years ago when you predict the great dino extinction that's assumed to have been caused by a huge comet impact. \n \n It doesn't really matter where we start with the imaginary predictions you rely so faithfully on for your World view, as they are all based on ABSOLUTELY UNPROVABLE ASSUMPTIONS WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM MAKING ABSOLUTELY UNPROVABLE CONCLUSIONS WHICH ARE BASED ON ABSOLUTELY UNVERIFIABLE PREDICTIONS THAT DETERMINE THE EXPERIMENTS YOU MAKE THAT CAUSE YOU TO COME TO YOUR FAULTY, AND VERY MISLEADING RESULTS.",

Actually, the high road is to point out the gross stupidity of creationism as science. You just think that it is insulting. It's not.\n \nThe facts don't NEED insults to be facts; science doesn't need evangelism and crusading to be science.\nThat's true, and scientists are still doing science.

What have you been smoking. Scientists have been pointing out the idiocy of creation science for as long as I can remember, and that goes back a ways.

How many other words have evolving definitions such as this word does?\n\n I'm pleased you find it telling, because I was in fact telling you something.\n \n What is there to 'admit'? Have I ever denied the fact? Have I ever been less than straightforward about the various uses of the word, from strict biological definitions to the catch-all layman's term? What exactly are you reading into this? And what word hasn't 'evolved' additional meanings? Cool. Bad. Slick. Shiny. \n \n Do we have to be careful about using the word evolution to avoid confusion? Sure, which is why I've tried to distinguish common descent from evolutionary theory, for instance. So what? The only people practicing equivocation are those seeking to lump abiogenesis in with evolution, or cosmology in with biological evolution: they're genuinely attempting to distort the meaning of the word in order to bring irrelevant and emotive argumentation into play.\n \nI would never call you deceptive or intentionally misleading at all Peeling. But I do consider you a victim who is a true believer in the great lie of evolution. Just as we make certain leaps of faith that although certain aspects of Creation can't be proven scientifically, so do evolutionists do the same exact thing. Only they do it under the guise of a constantly evolving science, thus the constantly changing definition.\n\n You are welcome to your faith, and you can use it to believe whatever you like, but this continuing misconception of yours that (on the subject of evolution) we're exchanging beliefs and opinions of equal merit can only be counterproductive. Evidence inevitably weighs in, and apart from a single chapter in a single book all of it is landing on my side. Either the whole world is lying to me, or that one chapter is allegorical, misinterpreted or just plain wrong. It does not require faith, bias or belief to be convinced when the evidence is overwhelming. You proudly proclaim you have the faith, the bias, necessary - that's fine; as I said you're welcome to it. But don't make the mistake of assuming everyone forms their opinions the same way.\n \nJust as you make certain assumptions that never change regarding evo,\n\n Such as? Please, name one: an actual assumption. Something I just take for granted that you don't.\n \n so does the Creationist hold that certain absolutes exist regarding Creation, such as a personal God created all that is. We understand science can't prove God which is a huge stumbling block for the evolutionist, but isn't one at all for us because we can see the spiritual with evades the scientific perspective at all levels of understanding. \n\n So it's not about what's scientifically correct - or in other words, the real natural history of earth as determined by multiple independent avenues of scientific endeavour. What's important is that we teach the correct spiritual message, regardless of accuracy - the correct message being... yours?\n \nAnd ID would insist that it is evolution that's the atheistically motivated pseudo science, so we will continue to disagree there also.\n\n Again, simple disagreement does not confer equal merit upon the contending opinions. I can link to documentary evidence - from the ID movement itself - that ID is religiously inspired and explicitly unscientific in nature. Can you do the same? Can you link to any valuable scientific results that have emerged from ID research?\n \nIf the foundation upon which evo is based is false, such as the age of the Earth and the interpretation of fossil information. Then all of the conclusions that are derived from those original faulty conclusions is as wrong as wrong can be, and as deceptive as deceptive can be.\n\n And if wishes were horses...\n \n You've no evidence, AA. None at all. Nothing in the natural world disputes the great age of the earth. Don't you find that in the least bit remarkable, if it really is a few thousand years old? Wouldn't something fail to jibe? Read my challenge in the debate section: why doesn't our earth look like the one in my thought experiment?\n \nThis argument is totally fallacious Peeling, as it attempts to promote a motive to deceive by the Creationists while stating that evolutionists could have no such motive due to the alleged impersonal nature of the scientific endeavor.\n\n I stated nothing; I merely asked you (or rather marc) to consider the options impartially and assess the scale and plausibility of the conspiracies each entail. Factor in the explicitly advertised intentions of the I.D movement and related sites such as AIG, and it's not hard to pick a winner. Either the small group of religiously motivated people saying they're engaged in an unscientific hearts-and-minds campaign to push religion to the forefront of science are engaged in an unscientific hearts-and-minds campaign to push religion to the forefront of science, or the vast, vast majority of scientists of all religions and none are all engaged in an unscientific hearts-and-minds campaign to push atheism to the forefront of science, despite vigorous denials, zero evidence, and no definable motive.\n \nThe reality that you are blind to that believers see so clearly is that apart from Christ, it is impossible to see the spiritual battle humanity is fighting.\n\n Again, you make my point more eloquently than I could ever hope to achieve unaided. \n \n What relevance has this imagined 'spiritual battle' to the evidence of an evolutionary natural history? You're completely caught up in the righteousness of what you believe we should teach people is the history of life on earth, and don't seem to give a damn whether it's actually right or not. You don't care about truth, as derived from observing god's creation directly, only Truth, as defined by your belief in a book written by men.\n \nYou base everything you believe regarding evo on the big bang first happening.\n\n Um, no... :)\n \nBut I could just as easily skip that aspect of your scientific assumptions and start at 300 million years ago, or 200 million years ago, or at 65 million years ago when you predict the great dino extinction that's assumed to have been caused by a huge comet impact.\n\n We don't predict it, we observe it, in the fossil and geological record. And yes, you could start 300 million years ago, because the earth was here 300 million years ago, all six thousand million million million dinosaur-encrusted tons of it.\n \nIt doesn't really matter where we start with the imaginary predictions you rely so faithfully on for your World view, as they are all based on ABSOLUTELY UNPROVABLE ASSUMPTIONS WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM MAKING ABSOLUTELY UNPROVABLE CONCLUSIONS WHICH ARE BASED ON ABSOLUTELY UNVERIFIABLE PREDICTIONS THAT DETERMINE THE EXPERIMENTS YOU MAKE THAT CAUSE YOU TO COME TO YOUR FAULTY, AND VERY MISLEADING CONCLUSIONS.\n\n And yet, and yet... all these unprovable assumptions and unprovable conclusions and unverifiable predictions, all this faulty and misleading nonsense based on nothing more substantial than a desire to deny the existence of god... keeps paying off. :)",

   "But common descent is your word Peeling. And this is what gets so frustrating about debating with you because you're as slippery as the evolution you debate.\n\n Doing my best to be clear and accurate is not slipperiness. If your arguments are failing to find purchase, there are other possible explanations :)\n \nHere you are accusing me\n\n Um, no, I think you just accused yourself. I didn't mention you and did not in fact have you in mind when I wrote that paragraph. But if you feel the accusation does apply to you, I won't argue the point.\n \nDoesn't this aspect of common descent clearly imply that since the earliest organisms appeared 3.9 billion years ago and we descended from them commonly that they are tied together with the separate science you now refer to as abiogenesis? Now go on and squirm out of that in your usual way Peeling.\n\n Are those fields related? In the same way as electricity generation and computer programming are related, sure. But just as computer programming concerns itself with what you do once you've got electricity, so evolution speaks to the processes by which first 'life' became what we see around us. It does not speak to the non-biological processes which brought about that first life - whatever they may have been.\n \n Don't for a moment think I'm washing my hands of abiogenesis - I'll happily natter on about that until the cows come home. Protocells in particular are just - well, let's say it's telling that when we hypothesise what conditions may have prevailed back in those early days, and reproduce them in the lab, we don't get nothing at all, which is what you'd expect if science was all the things you called it in your last post, but rather we get budding, self-replicating double-layered membranes capable of sequestering molecules from the environment.\n \n Interesting, but not evolution, which is the relevant point to take away.\n \nWhat is remarkable is that you believe the great age of the Earth without any absolute supportable evidence that is foolproof. What appears to be may not be as it appears at all. What I marvel at is that you ignore any questions you can't answer and assume you're right because of it.\n\n The estimated age of the earth itself is derived from multiple independent sources, not counting the vast array of 'lower bound' values derived from geological formations across the planet.\n \n What's marvellous here is your application of double standards. You find the painstakingly-verified, multiply-sourced estimates of the earth's age wanting, for reasons you never explain but insist are terribly convincing, yet invest absolute, unquestioning faith in an old book containing no less than two conflicting creation myths.\n \n You recently had ample opportunity to challenge the evidence and pose questions - did I ignore a single point, a single question? It's saddening and a little hurtful, frankly, after the hours I spent researching and composing the posts in that discussion, to see you revising history like this. I was friendly, polite, enthusiastic; I went into any amount of detail - yet here, to make some throwaway point you'll p*ss all over that time and effort without a second thought and call me 'slippery', 'shallow', 'juvenile' into the bargain. Thanks a bunch.\n \nI never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling.\n\n To be fair, you kind of stepped into marc's shoes by deciding to answer for him. If you don't believe in a conspiracy, you might want to step out of them again :)\n \nI very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it. \n\n It does happen - relatively rarely - and is inevitably exposed by other scientists looking to make a name for themselves by spotting inconsistencies, fallacies or fraud and doing better science. That's the beauty of the system; that's why it works, and that's why it ought not to be polluted by zealots seeking to preserve certain ideas as sacred; exempt from scrutiny.\n \n \nYeah, right. Again you rewrite the definitions you previously relied on to define your science. Respond to this without just editing it out then, if you can, Peeling. http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/defense_of_evolution.html \n \n One of the crucial \"predictions\" of evolutionary theory is that one should find a general progression of increasingly diverse and complex life forms when one traces the fossil record through progressively higher strata of sedimentary rock.\n \n And...\n \n A second \"prediction\" of evolution is that the fossil record should yield transitional forms. \n \n Interesting how first a crucial prediction, and then a second prediction is so forthcoming from a link who's content you will surely agree with on all counts.\n\n Go back and look at what my \"we don't predict\" statement was a response to. Here it is again:\n \nwhen you predict the great dino extinction that's assumed to have been caused by a huge comet impact.\n\n \nWe don't predict it, we observe it, \n\n There's no ambiguity here: I was clearly talking about the cometary extinction event we observe in the fossil and geological record. Of course evolutionary theory makes predictions - very very good ones, which is why it's a good theory. I wholeheartedly endorse the quotes you provide. But the extinction of the dinosaurs isn't a prediction - why would evolutionary theory predict comets? Or is this me being slippery again, reminding you of the conversation we actually had?\n \nYou continue to deceive yourself my friend. How can false interpretations pay off anything more than ignorance and dead ends down dark alley's of lies and self deception in the end of lifes journey for knowledge and wisdom?\n\n ...typed the ever-so-slightly insufferable man into his multi-gigahertz desktop PC ;)\n \n All joking aside, the scientific method really does work; the proof is all around us. And when we apply that method to investigating the natural history of this planet, it yields testable, predictive, useful results. If our conclusions about evolution were wrong, that wouldn't happen - just as your PC wouldn't work if we were wrong about the principles upon which it is based.\n \n What really puzzles me is why you even care. What on earth has evolution got to do with Jesus or the message of salvation propagated in his name? Why can't we be special for what we are, and never mind what we were? Why are you so keen to shackle your valuable spiritual message to a useless millstone of a creation myth that can only drag it down into obscurity?",

   "By the same token, so is the word 'mine'. Or 'keep'. Or 'faith', for that matter.\n \n I do have to wonder: are you genuinely, heart-attack serious in your belief that the multiple meanings of the word 'evolution' are sinister in nature and purpose? \n\n \n YES - I believe that largely because every time I engage with someone here about evolution, they claim that evolution does not have multiple meanings. Why do they do that? Are they afraid of something? Do they have something to hide? Is there dishonesty involved? Surely you noticed it - it was a big part of the problem in finding an opponent for the \"evolution is atheistic\" debate that you finally agreed to. \n \n \nBecause it strikes me as odd that members of a conspiracy dedicated to the misleading use of a term would endlessly, repeatedly, patiently (and as time goes by, less patiently) explain in excruciating detail the important differences between the uses of that term. \n\n \n They've said that \"evolution\" has a simple scientific meaning, and all the atheistic extrapolation from it is just personal opinions, and doesn't alter the definition. \n \n Intelligent Design also has a simple definition. It is a science that studies signs of intelligence - it purports to find signs of intelligence in biological systems. Immediately saying that studies for intelligence is not science is false, because it's a basic in archeology, when the archeologist unearths a curiously shaped object. A first concern is to find out if it occurred naturally, or if it was intelligently designed by an ancient civilization. When evolutionists claim that ID is religion in disguise, they show their double standard. They don't allow anyone who extrapolates ID into religion the same free pass they give anyone who extrapolates evolution into atheism. \n \n \nTake me, for instance: are you prepared to tell me to my face that I'm being deceptive when I talk about evolution? Can you point to anything I've ever written on the subject that seems intentionally misleading? Have I equivocated - or have I rather expended considerable effort in the service of clarity? \n\n \n Yes, I can. In our formal debate, you finished up your first post like this;\n \n \nOriginally posted by peeling) Is the Pope an atheist? No, marc: he's a catholic. \n\n \n That was your intentionally misleading statement, with some mocking thrown in. You know that the Pope (and all Catholics) don't have the same definition of evolution as militant atheists like Richard Dawkins. So I did what I've done several times here, only probably better than I ever have in the free-for-all forums, with careful wording, descriptive links etc, to PROVE that evolution does in fact have several different meanings, when it comes to all of its applications. You then conceded by saying this;\n \n \nOriginally Posted by peeling)\n Marc himself acknowledges that 'evolution' has many shades of meaning, from the biologically specific 'change in allele frequencies over time' to more general terms describing gradual change in any system. \n\n \n I PROVED IT TO YOU, AND YOU RESPONDED AS IF YOU PROVED IT TO ME!!!! You got a free pass on it in the judgement at these forums, (big surprise emoticon_rolleyes ) but the main problem I have is when the subject comes up now in the free-for-all forums, I am told that evolution has only one meaning, called names, and am required to prove it yet again. It's no wonder that in the 'trash Marc' thread in the ringside forum, one poster thought our formal debate should be deleted - wasn't worth the bandwidth. \n \n \nThe feeling I get is that it doesn't matter a wet slap what anyone says or does, you'll interpret it according to the requirements of your pet conspiracy theory. \n\n \n That's because since our formal debate, so far several atheist books, and one evolution questioning movie, have clearly shown that the \"pet conspiracy theory\" you attribute to only me, is actually a widespread FACT. \"Conspiracy\" is a little too much of an emotional word to be accurate. (I'm sure that's why you use it) The word \"agenda\" is much more accurate. Here's how it's worded on the back flap (book description) in the 2007 book \"God, The Failed Hypothesis, How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist\"; \n \n \nStenger concludes, after reflecting on the long history of misrepresentation and manipulation of scientific fact regarding God, that our world actually is worse off as a result of religious faith. \n\n \n So religion must be systematically abandoned and eradicated, not completely, just enough to be out of the public and political realm, leaving atheism as king. It's not my pet theory that evolutionists are saying that, it's a fact that they are saying that. \n \n \nSo when people say evolution isn't atheistic, you see it as proof that it is atheistic and evolutionists are liars. \n\n \n That is correct. Recent books and movies really are showing it. It always depends however, on what the definition of evolution is in any given week. \n \n \nWhen umpteen independent scientific disciplines all corroborate the tentative predictions of evolutionary theory, it's proof that evolution has pervaded all of science and that all scientists are liars.\n\n \n Umpteen scientific disciplines can be dwarfed by emotion and money, both of which saturate evolutionary study. But not all scientists are evolutionists as you seem to suggest, it only seems that way, because many who don't bow at the altar of evolution suddenly seem to find themselves out of a job, and have a difficult time finding another. \n \n \nWhen scientists say that I.D. is religiously motivated pseudoscience and produce documentary evidence to that effect, it's proof that I.D. is really good science and scientists want to suppress it because they're scared. \n\n \n It's not necessarily proof that ID is really good science, it indicates that some definitions of evolution are motivated by atheism and deserve the same label of pseudoscience. To label ID as pseudoscience while permitting atheistic/evolution pseudoscience is a double standard. \n \n \nJust for a moment, pretend your conspiracy theory is nonsense. \n\n \n That's difficult to do, as the evidence continues to pour in, but I'll try. \n \n \nDoesn't all the wealth of evidence admit another explanation? That common descent is a fact, evolutionary theory is robustly supported by multiple scientific disciplines because it's right, that I.D. has no demonstrable scientific merit, isn't widely supported, is religiously motivated, and hasn't earned its place in the science classroom alongside E=MC2? \n\n \n The wealth of evidence comes up short, no matter how hard I try, and the main reason is this; The more laughable (by todays standards) Darwin's lack of knowledge of the simplest forms of life becomes / the more details todays science learns about the simplest forms of life becomes, the more glaring the scientific community's inability to address origins becomes. That means less demonstrable scientific merit for evolution. \n \n There's no way to keep human imperfection out of the equation, when it comes to speculation about origins. If atheistic speculation is considered science, the playing field needs to be level, in a pluralistic society. \n \n \n \nCompare the two scenarios, and ask yourself: which demands the existence of the fewest conspiratorial liars to prop it up? \n\n \n It is equal, because of the origins problem that looms larger and larger for evolutionists. \n \n \nAnd in which scenario do the conspirators have the clearest, most obvious, and self-declared motivation to behave as they are? Seriously, now: you're prepared to take the utter lack of atheist trappings within evolutionary biology as evidence of a vast, silent conspiracy, \n\n \n I disagree that there is a lack of them. The movie that I just saw indicates that there is more discrimination against those who question evolution in U.S. universities than in foreign universities. If I remember right you are from Europe, I have no idea if you have now, or ever will have access to this movie. If you do, I hope you'll watch it. \n \n \n \n so why ignore the public statements of sites like AIG and I.D organisations to the effect that they have an agenda of bringing religion to the forefront of scientific endeavour? They come right out and announce their unscientific bias and conspiratorial intent! It's the foundation of their recruiting drive! Doesn't that ring any alarm bells?\n\n \n You'd have to show me their announcements of bias and conspiratorial intent, before I'd agree that they are as bad as you imply, but I have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of ID for religious purposes far more than atheists admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purposes. Why? Because Christians have guidelines about lying. They do have beliefs in a higher power that could discipline them for it, in this life or the next. Atheism has no such guidelines, and it's obvious that different atheists have a more broad range about the acceptance of lying among themselves. I know there are a few atheists who post here, and some more well known atheists who comment on these things (Michael Ruse for one) who really do take an avoidance of lying seriously. But there are other atheists who make careers of lying. \"Edward Current\", Bill Maher, immediately come to mind.",

   "You know, I'm an evolutionist too, but I do think there's entirely too much vitriol toward creationists out there right now. I rarely read a post, blog article, or editorial where ID'ers aren't insulted and intentionally belittled. People are making heroes out of hateful people like Dawkins who seem to get a lot of glee out of belittling and insulting people. For some unfortunate reason, a lot of scientists seem to have moved from being fact-driven, objective observers to being what amounts to belligerent ideologues. I haven't seen Expelled yet, but I think that's part of what it's trying to get across, according to what I've read. This change in tact by scientists is too bad, because I think evolution and the facts would be better served by taking the high road. The facts don't NEED insults to be facts; science doesn't need evangelism and crusading to be science. If scientists think that it does, then these scientists must think it's pretty weak science to begin with. I think this new culture of ridicule among scientists is probably doing as much to hurt what they think of as a cause, rather than helping it.\n\n \n Well stated.

   "YES - I believe that largely because every time I engage with someone here about evolution, they claim that evolution does not have multiple meanings. Why do they do that? Are they afraid of something? Do they have something to hide? Is there dishonesty involved? Surely you noticed it - it was a big part of the problem in finding an opponent for the \"evolution is atheistic\" debate that you finally agreed to.\n\n Quite the reverse: you had trouble finding an opponent precisely because you weren't prepared to agree in advance which of the various meanings and usages of the word 'evolution' the debate was about. Nobody was saying the word only had one meaning; they just wanted you to pick one.\n \nThey've said that \"evolution\" has a simple scientific meaning, and all the atheistic extrapolation from it is just personal opinions, and doesn't alter the definition.\n\n They said that biological evolution has a simple scientific definition, and they were right. That term is often shortened to simply 'evolution', especially by practicing scientists - just as the word 'grip' is used without confusion on the set of a film, despite it having a different meaning to that employed in other fields.\n \n The fundamental problem was this: you wanted to argue your case based on vague popular or layman's usages of the term. But the word evolution is 'popularly' used by creationists to refer to everything up to and including cosmology and the big bang, and among them holds strong connotations of atheism. They're wrong to use the word like that, but they do, which makes it a de facto usage of the term. What you were effectively demanding was that your opponent prove the word evolution has no atheistic connotations to anyone, which is clearly impossible, and utterly irrelevant to the question of whether biological evolution or common descent - the real issue creationists care about - is atheistic or not.\n \n \nIntelligent Design also has a simple definition. It is a science that studies signs of intelligence - it purports to find signs of intelligence in biological systems. Immediately saying that studies for intelligence is not science is false, because it's a basic in archeology, when the archeologist unearths a curiously shaped object. A first concern is to find out if it occurred naturally, or if it was intelligently designed by an ancient civilization.\n\n Although this superficially sounds like a reasonable argument, it isn't.\n \n When archaeologists unearth a curiously shaped object, they have a very clear idea of a) the natural forces at work in the vicinity, and b) the capabilities, motivations and thought-processes of the potential 'designers' they're interested in: humans. If they find a stone arrowhead, for instance, they can recognise the signs of tooling and sharpening, they can recognise a familiar purpose, and simultaneously discount the various known naturalistic processes from having produced it unaided. They are not detecting design, they are detecting the hand and mind of a specific, known designer - in effect, they are positively detecting a particular kind of known naturalistic force (human ingenuity) at work.\n \n In the past, false 'design' positives have inspired myths of supernatural or superhuman beings. The Giant's Causeway, for instance, is so anomalously regular as to look designed - until you discover the naturalistic process that produces it.\n \n And that's I.D's failure in a nutshell: it's method of 'detecting design' is nothing of the sort. What it 'detects' might be design, but it's much more likely to be 'detecting' lack of knowledge on the part of the person performing the test. If that person doesn't currently know of a naturalistic process that could produce what they're observing, the test will 'detect' design. \n \n That's why I.D. is not analogous to archaeology: human activity is a known process and its hallmarks can be identified. I.D claims to be able to positively detect the hallmarks of an entirely arbitrary designer, whose motivations and capabilities are completely unknown - which is logically impossible. If you don't know what this designer could or would do, you can't possibly construct a positive test to detect his activity.\n \n I.D. would have detected design in the Giant's Causeway had its real origin not already been known. If you don't know the natural process that produces it, it's trivially easy to frame the problem such that the odds against the formation occurring by chance exceed the 'universal probability bound' - thus design is proved. At which point, I.D declares the case closed: design, therefore designer.\n \nWhen evolutionists claim that ID is religion in disguise, they show their double standard. They don't allow anyone who extrapolates ID into religion the same free pass they give anyone who extrapolates evolution into atheism. \n\n I.D. isn't a religion. It's not a science, either, but it's not a religion. It's a PR tool being used by certain religious people, with the publicly avowed intent of injecting Jesus into the scientific mainstream and inducing a sea-change whereby everything in science is interpreted through a scriptural filter. It's similar to parasitism: get inside the body of a healthy host where it's warm and safe.\n \n In a way, you're presenting a false dichotomy. Science isn't atheistic by default, just because it's not religious. A doughnut isn't religious; that doesn't make it atheistic either. Science is a methodology for learning about the natural world, and a highly effective one at that. Our evolutionary history is written through this planet like words through a stick of rock - therefore, science can speak to it. What consequences that has for your spiritual beliefs and their underpinnings is not science's fault.\n \nThat was your intentionally misleading statement, with some mocking thrown in.\n\n marc, the debate is over. We rested our respective cases; I do not intend to rehash the whole thing now so you can work through your 'should have saids'.\n \nbut the main problem I have is when the subject comes up now in the free-for-all forums, I am told that evolution has only one meaning, called names, and am required to prove it yet again. It's no wonder that in the 'trash Marc' thread in the ringside forum, one poster thought our formal debate should be deleted - wasn't worth the bandwidth.\n\n If anyone is saying that the word evolution - not biological evolution - only has one meaning, point them at a dictionary - or me for that matter - for correction.\n \nThat's because since our formal debate, so far several atheist books, and one evolution questioning movie, have clearly shown that the \"pet conspiracy theory\" you attribute to only me, is actually a widespread FACT. \"Conspiracy\" is a little too much of an emotional word to be accurate. (I'm sure that's why you use it) The word \"agenda\" is much more accurate. Here's how it's worded on the back flap (book description) in the 2007 book \"God, The Failed Hypothesis, How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist\";\n\n What, you mean atheists really exist? And they say things? Are they... are they outside, right now? ;)\n \n Interestingly, I just read this little snippet in a review:\n \nIn God: The Failed Hypothesis, Stenger argues that science has advanced sufficiently to make a definitive statement on the existence - or nonexistence - of the traditional Judeo-Christian-Islamic God. He invites readers to put their minds and the scientific method to work to test this claim.\n\n Imagine you are raised by your mother, who tells you your father was a great man who accomplished many things but died not long after you were born. Later on, you try to find out about this great man but can detect no trace or mention of him or his alleged deeds. It looks very much like your mother was having you on. Clearly you did have a father, but the father you thought you had doesn't exist, and never did. He could still, coincidentally, have been a great man and accomplished amazing things, but that doesn't make your mother right; she was just making stuff up.\n \n That's one possible perspective: a continued belief in a god but treating the universe itself as his holy book, learning from that rather than the works of men. Another is to ignore Stenger completely and continue to reconcile knowledge with faith as best you can. Heck, if you can accommodate the Trinity you can put up with pretty much anything ;)\n \n Personally, I'm content to be an atheist. I think if there is a god, he's far too well hidden for us to detect, and if he wants us to think he doesn't exist, who am I to argue? :)\n \nSo religion must be systematically abandoned and eradicated, not completely, just enough to be out of the public and political realm, leaving atheism as king. It's not my pet theory that evolutionists are saying that, it's a fact that they are saying that.\n\n Was he perhaps wearing a red cardigan when he wrote that? Because I have this pet theory that people with red cardigans are promoting atheism in the public and political realm, and I'd love to have it confirmed as a fact.\n \n When I watch the news, and see someone interviewed, I'm always mildly irritated by the little caption they attach: \"Joe Bloggs, smoker\"; \"Jane Middlemiss, motorist\" - like these titles somehow define the person. Stenger is a person, who has personally come to certain conclusions by using his brain and the scientific method. I'm quite sure he is convinced by the evidence supporting evolution - so what? So's Jyoshu.\n \n His views regarding the detrimental influence of religion are nothing to do with evolution and everything to do with the influence of religion. If religion did nothing but give out free pies on a Friday afternoon, I'm sanguine he wouldn't have a bad thing to say about it.\n \nThat is correct. Recent books and movies really are showing it. It always depends however, on what the definition of evolution is in any given week. \n\n Translation: I have to give these square pegs a taste of the lathe and a good solid whack before they'll slot into the round hole.\n \n I really don't think you should be surprised, given the rather tense state of affairs at the moment, that some atheists are standing up and saying \"You know what, I'm sick of sitting quietly and minding my own business while religion hobnail-boots it all over the world whipping otherwise pleasant people into a state of violent hysteria. I'm sick of watching incompetent politicians profess their faith and preening under the adulation that elicits. Just what use is religion? Let's stop treating it as a given that religion is good and noble and worthy, and take a proper look at what it's achieved and the damage it's caused.\"\n \nUmpteen scientific disciplines can be dwarfed by emotion and money, both of which saturate evolutionary study.\n\n Because it works. How much money is pumped into microchip design and production? IBM engineers must be so corrupt; the temptation to lie about quantum theory so they can pretend to offer faster processors must be overwhelming! And don't get me started on the evolutionary algorithms they use - clear evidence of atheist bias and lying. As if evolution could design better microchips!\n \n Research based on evolutionary theory is well funded because there's massive potential for return on investment. Who funds ICR? If you're so keen to follow the money, at least do it consistently.\n \nBut not all scientists are evolutionists as you seem to suggest, it only seems that way, because many who don't bow at the altar of evolution suddenly seem to find themselves out of a job, and have a difficult time finding another.\n\n I didn't say all scientists accept evolution. I said the vast majority do. Care to substantiate your other allegations?\n \n That said, I expect that in some very specific cases a disinclination to apply evolutionary theory would make a person incompatible with a particular role. But the same could be said for almost any stance. If your day-to-day job entails the forensic investigation of crime scenes, a fervent belief in poltergeist activity might impair your effectiveness somewhat :)\n \n At the end of the day, evolutionary theory has proved itself effective, and has opened up a rich vein of scientific enquiry that yields valuable results on a daily basis. Results are important to both businesses and academic institutions. Who do they want to fund and put in charge of equipment and lab space capable of mining that vein? Probably not someone who believes against all available evidence that the vein isn't there. I'd fire someone working in my gold mine if they didn't believe in gold. If they want to spend their time proving gold doesn't exist, they can find some other sucker to pay for it.\n \n \nIt's not necessarily proof that ID is really good science, it indicates that some definitions of evolution are motivated by atheism and deserve the same label of pseudoscience. To label ID as pseudoscience while permitting atheistic/evolution pseudoscience is a double standard. \n\n Pardon? Because scientists say ID is pseudoscience, that indicates that some of evolution is pseudoscience too? If you say I smell bad, does that mean you smell bad too?\n \nThe wealth of evidence comes up short, no matter how hard I try, and the main reason is this; The more laughable (by todays standards) Darwin's lack of knowledge of the simplest forms of life becomes / the more details todays science learns about the simplest forms of life becomes, the more glaring the scientific community's inability to address origins becomes. That means less demonstrable scientific merit for evolution. \n\n And there it is in black and off-white: you can't find any fault with common descent or evolution, so you shoehorn in something to which evolution does not speak.\n \n Evolution is not about origin of first life. Take it off the table. Now look again. Earliest forms of life: single cells. Then simple agglomerations (sponges), then progressively more specialisation (flatworms), and on and on and on. Evolution. A nested hierarchy of forms and genetics. Atavisms. Vestigial features. The evidence is all right there, yet because we haven't yet reached back three and a half billion years and created an accurate pre-cellular picture (you really ought to check out protocells though) you declare the whole edifice insubstantial. That's like saying we should acquit a murderer because the tens of thousands of pieces of evidence indicating his guilt mean nothing if we can't tell how many cornflakes he had for breakfast.\n \n Ok, it's not quite like that. Obviously the origin of life is a fascinating subject and not an insignificant detail. Let me rephrase, then: the murderer commited his crime with a weapon whose origin is indeterminate. So far, nobody has a full picture of how the murderer came by this weapon. Fascinating, intriguing, important even - but irrelevant to the question of whether he commited the crime, for which the evidence is overwhelming.\n \nThere's no way to keep human imperfection out of the equation, when it comes to speculation about origins.\n\n Irrelevant. The same could be said for any scientific discipline (scientists can get passionate about very obscure matters). So long as you forbid treating any hypothesis as sacred, there will always be someone willing to challenge it, either because they're neutral on the topic and feel it hasn't been given proper treatment, or have a different bias. It doesn't matter, because in the end they have to play by the rules: the scientific method.\n \n I.D abandons the scientific method. It has produced no useful results and largely refused to take part in the 'trial by fire' peer review process through which all scientific ideas - however oddball they may have seemed at first, like evolution - must pass. Instead, I.D. produces populist 'sciencey' books and goes straight for the classroom jugular. They go for the lay-person and the kids - I know you have your 'agenda' explanation for that, but isn't there a simpler and more straightforward one? One that tallies with I.D's avowed intent? Please, name one branch of science that has debuted in the classroom before ever producing results.\n \nIt is equal, because of the origins problem that looms larger and larger for evolutionists.\n\n Incorrect. See analogy above: it doesn't matter how first life got started because evolution only speaks to subsequent events. \n \nYou'd have to show me their announcements of bias and conspiratorial intent, before I'd agree that they are as bad as you imply, but I have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of ID for religious purposes far more than atheists admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purposes. Why? Because Christians have guidelines about lying.\n\n I feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind?\n \nThey do have beliefs in a higher power that could discipline them for it, in this life or the next. Atheism has no such guidelines, and it's obvious that different atheists have a more broad range about the acceptance of lying among themselves. I know there are a few atheists who post here, and some more well known atheists who comment on these things (Michael Ruse for one) who really do take an avoidance of lying seriously. But there are other atheists who make careers of lying. \"Edward Current\", Bill Maher, immediately come to mind.\n\n I'm not going to engage you on this, marc, I'm really not. It won't matter how many Christians I show to be liars, you'll just say they can't be true Christians, because Christians have guidelines about lying - and round and round we go.\n \n I could equally say that no true atheist lies, because atheists have stronger inherent moral values - evidenced by their ability to behave themselves despite not believing there's a divine CCTV camera on them 24-7.",

   "Quite the reverse: you had trouble finding an opponent precisely because you weren't prepared to agree in advance which of the various meanings and usages of the word 'evolution' the debate was about. Nobody was saying the word only had one meaning; they just wanted you to pick one. \n\n \n If you'll read the challange thread you'll see that they did not acknowledge various meanings and usages in any way. They only had one definition, \"change in allele frequencies over time\". \n \n \nThey said that biological evolution has a simple scientific definition, and they were right. That term is often shortened to simply 'evolution', especially by practicing scientists - just as the word 'grip' is used without confusion on the set of a film, despite it having a different meaning to that employed in other fields.\n \n The fundamental problem was this: you wanted to argue your case based on vague popular or layman's usages of the term. \n\n \n Because what inspired my argument/debate challange was the Questions for both sides thread, it was full of vague/popular laymans usages of the term, and you can't blame only me for it, since I didn't start the thread, and since I was only about 1/10 of all the broad usages of the term going on in that thread, the rest were coming from evolutionists. Please read its opening post (by an evolutionist) - you're not going to find much about biology there. \n \n \nBut the word evolution is 'popularly' used by creationists to refer to everything up to and including cosmology and the big bang, and among them holds strong connotations of atheism. They're wrong to use the word like that, but they do, which makes it a de facto usage of the term. \n\n \n So you're saying creationists are the only ones who do that? Check out this thread - the first 12 posts were all by evolutionists. Post #1 was only about biological evolution. Post #2 touched on biology, and quickly moved on to geology and paleontology, in a seamless and unnoticeable fashion. Poster #1's response in post #4 made no reference to it - I'm sure he didn't even notice it. If this looks slightly familiar to you, it's because the last three sentences before this one were just copy/pastes of what I've shown you before. So it seems that evolutionists don't always have a monopoly on \"endlessly, repeatedly, patiently, and as time goes by, less patiently\" explaining things in excruciating detail. \n \n Creationists aren't the only ones that blend the word evolution with cosmology, the big bang, geology, paleontology, or even worldviews and philosophy. Will you admit that or not? \n \n \nWhat you were effectively demanding was that your opponent prove the word evolution has no atheistic connotations to anyone, which is clearly impossible, and utterly irrelevant to the question of whether biological evolution or common descent - the real issue creationists care about - is atheistic or not. \n\n \n I was seeking a discussion about evolution being atheistic concerning its general use and understanding to everyone, as we see that anyone is likely to introduce it/use it in a general way, a way that encompases all its sub-catagories. I got what I wanted, you and I did it, and it's there for anyone to read. \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough this superficially sounds like a reasonable argument, it isn't.\n \n When archaeologists unearth a curiously shaped object, they have a very clear idea of a) the natural forces at work in the vicinity, and b) the capabilities, motivations and thought-processes of the potential 'designers' they're interested in: humans. If they find a stone arrowhead, for instance, they can recognise the signs of tooling and sharpening, they can recognise a familiar purpose, and simultaneously discount the various known naturalistic processes from having produced it unaided. They are not detecting design, they are detecting the hand and mind of a specific, known designer - in effect, they are positively detecting a particular kind of known naturalistic force (human ingenuity) at work. \n\n \n I'll partially concede that point. You're saying that archeologists know more about the capabilities, motivations, and thought processes, of the people of ancient civilizations, more than Christians can know the capabilities, motivations, and thought processes of God. Many Christians can make a pretty good case for knowing the capabilities, motivations, thought processes of God by Bible study, but a good case can be made that it's not comparable to the history of ancient civilizations. The Bible explains nothing about Gods mechanical methods to a comparable degree of our knowledge of past generations mechanical methods. But I still believe the ID community can explain how design can be detected in biology, without any knowledge of the designer. \n \n (I'm going to post my response in multiple posts, my computer has trouble with one long one)",

   "In the past, false 'design' positives have inspired myths of supernatural or superhuman beings. The Giant's Causeway, for instance, is so anomalously regular as to look designed - until you discover the naturalistic process that produces it.\n \n And that's I.D's failure in a nutshell: it's method of 'detecting design' is nothing of the sort. What it 'detects' might be design, but it's much more likely to be 'detecting' lack of knowledge on the part of the person performing the test. If that person doesn't currently know of a naturalistic process that could produce what they're observing, the test will 'detect' design. \n \n That's why I.D. is not analogous to archaeology: human activity is a known process and its hallmarks can be identified. I.D claims to be able to positively detect the hallmarks of an entirely arbitrary designer, whose motivations and capabilities are completely unknown - which is logically impossible. If you don't know what this designer could or would do, you can't possibly construct a positive test to detect his activity.\n \n I.D. would have detected design in the Giant's Causeway had its real origin not already been known. If you don't know the natural process that produces it, it's trivially easy to frame the problem such that the odds against the formation occurring by chance exceed the 'universal probability bound' - thus design is proved. At which point, I.D declares the case closed: design, therefore designer. \n\n \n Is it not equally likely that by disregarding design or any possibility of the supernatural, the lack of that significant thought process takes the evolutionist down only one path that's narrow enough to make it trivially easy to theorize that everything happens by nothing but naturalistic processes? At which point, science declares the case closed? Naturalism, therefore, no God, God is irrelevant, or, last but not least, \"I believe in some god (wink wink, nod nod)\". I know the worn out response - \"that's all science can do\" and that would be acceptable, if science was building on something as testable and repeatable and observable as naturalistic origins, something it can't do. And I know the worn out response to that too - no evidence that it didn't arise naturally, so God must have done it, is the \"God of the gaps\" fallacy. As Michael Behe has said, \"all that is is a question begging insult meant to stop the flow of argument before it has barely started\". There seem to be a lot of magic wands for silencing discussion of ID.\n \n \nI.D. isn't a religion. It's not a science, either, but it's not a religion. It's a PR tool being used by certain religious people, with the publicly avowed intent of injecting Jesus into the scientific mainstream and inducing a sea-change whereby everything in science is interpreted through a scriptural filter. It's similar to parasitism: get inside the body of a healthy host where it's warm and safe. \n \n In a way, you're presenting a false dichotomy. Science isn't atheistic by default, just because it's not religious. A doughnut isn't religious; that doesn't make it atheistic either. Science is a methodology for learning about the natural world, and a highly effective one at that. \n\n \n I understand that it's an effective one, some sub-catagories of it that is. And other sub-catagories, or broad generalizations of it, can also be a PR tool used by atheists, with the intent of injecting atheism into the scientific mainstream and inducing a sea-change where many things political are interpreted through an atheistic filter. It's mocked as the EAC by atheists, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening. \n \n Physicist Steven Weinberg; \"I personally feel that the teaching of modern science is corrosive of religious belief, and I'm all for that.\" If scientists can destroy the influence of religion on young people, \"then I think it may be the most important contribution that we can make.\" \n \n E.O. Wilson; If religion...can be systematically analyzed and explained as a product of the brain's evolution, its power as an external source of morality will be gone forever.\" \n \n I know that's only their personal opinions, but those opinions aren't staying in their own little worlds. Open minded people can read between a lot of lines and see it throughout evolution. \n \n \nOur evolutionary history is written through this planet like words through a stick of rock - therefore, science can speak to it. What consequences that has for your spiritual beliefs and their underpinnings is not science's fault.\n\n \n That's only your worldview. I can switch your words around to show another worldview, but I won't bother..\n \n \nmarc, the debate is over. We rested our respective cases; I do not intend to rehash the whole thing now so you can work through your 'should have saids'. \n\n \n Where did I say anything about what I should have said? You asked me for an example of where you expended less-than-considerable effort in the service of clarity, and I showed you where it was. That particular debate is over, but the subject isn't going away, in fact it is evolving, considering the number of books, and now a movie, that have appeared since we had our debate. All I did was repeat the very true phrase from the movie; \"evolution is a slippery word\", and it wasn't directed at you, but you came a-running. You may be confusing what you consider my \"should have saids\" to my responses to new information, and changes concerning the subject. You've implied that only creationists make the slippery word slide, and this thread alone makes it so clear how evolutionists do it too. \n \n \nIf anyone is saying that the word evolution - not biological evolution - only has one meaning, point them at a dictionary - or me for that matter - for correction. \n\n \n Well then maybe I've accomplished something here by inspiring you to do that, because you sure weren't doing that a year ago, to the authors of posts 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 9, 10, etc etc etc in this thread. \n \n \nWhat, you mean atheists really exist? And they say things? Are they... are they outside, right now? ;) \n\n \n Yes, they're outside, they're in academics, they're writing books, they're teaching very small children, they're lining politicians pockets, they're filing lawsuits challenging tradition and morals, they're in a lot of places. \n \n \nInterestingly, I just read this little snippet in a review:\n \n Imagine you are raised by your mother, who tells you your father was a great man who accomplished many things but died not long after you were born. Later on, you try to find out about this great man but can detect no trace or mention of him or his alleged deeds. It looks very much like your mother was having you on. Clearly you did have a father, but the father you thought you had doesn't exist, and never did. He could still, coincidentally, have been a great man and accomplished amazing things, but that doesn't make your mother right; she was just making stuff up.\n \n That's one possible perspective: a continued belief in a god but treating the universe itself as his holy book, learning from that rather than the works of men. \n\n \n That would be fine if science were the only source of knowledge. That's one of the things about this subject that seems to be evolving - more and more scientists seem to be thinking that it is, making them the top-dogs, giving them more and more authority over the lives of the non-scientists. \n \n \n \nPersonally, I'm content to be an atheist. I think if there is a god, he's far too well hidden for us to detect, and if he wants us to think he doesn't exist, who am I to argue? :) \n\n \n He may not be that hidden, if you'd look somewhere besides science for him. If he wanted us to think he didn't exist, he may have avoided allowing the 66 book Bible to be the most carefully preserved writings in all of history, or his Son to be the most written about person who ever lived. \n \n \nWhen I watch the news, and see someone interviewed, I'm always mildly irritated by the little caption they attach: \"Joe Bloggs, smoker\"; \"Jane Middlemiss, motorist\" - like these titles somehow define the person. Stenger is a person, who has personally come to certain conclusions by using his brain and the scientific method. I'm quite sure he is convinced by the evidence supporting evolution - so what? So's Jyoshu. \n\n \n But what he is doing is taking evolution (considered a \"fact\") adding it to a theory (there is no god) and trying to convice his reader that he has added; fact + theory = fact. Evolution seems to do that in it's subcatagories. How do we distinguish the difference between the validity of when it's done in a subcatagory vs when it's done concerning the general term? \n \n Do you get equally irritatied by the little captions under the names of Kent Hovind, or Michael Behe, or Ben Stein, or William Dembski? Why the double standard? Why not let them be individuals also? Why not let them come to certain conclusions without attacking captions, or ideologies? Why the fear in letting future generations be exposed to their path of thinking? \n \n \nHis views regarding the detrimental influence of religion are nothing to do with evolution and everything to do with the influence of religion. If religion did nothing but give out free pies on a Friday afternoon, I'm sanguine he wouldn't have a bad thing to say about it. \n\n \n Wrong, as E.O. Wilson made clear above. They have plenty to do with evolution if evolution can be used as a weapon against them.\n \n (to be continued)",

   "I really don't think you should be surprised, given the rather tense state of affairs at the moment, that some atheists are standing up and saying \"You know what, I'm sick of sitting quietly and minding my own business while religion hobnail-boots it all over the world whipping otherwise pleasant people into a state of violent hysteria. I'm sick of watching incompetent politicians profess their faith and preening under the adulation that elicits. Just what use is religion? Let's stop treating it as a given that religion is good and noble and worthy, and take a proper look at what it's achieved and the damage it's caused.\" \n\n \n They have every right to do that, but it needs to kept completely in the philosophical realm. Should we let atheists add facts plus theories and get facts, and not allow religious people to do the same thing? \n \n \nBecause it works. How much money is pumped into microchip design and production? IBM engineers must be so corrupt; the temptation to lie about quantum theory so they can pretend to offer faster processors must be overwhelming! And don't get me started on the evolutionary algorithms they use - clear evidence of atheist bias and lying. As if evolution could design better microchips! \n\n \n I've seen that claim from only one other poster here before, in a similar vague way. I'd like to see some detail, explained in laymans terms, about exactly which products we have, that we would not have without theories about RM-NS evolution. \n \n \nResearch based on evolutionary theory is well funded because there's massive potential for return on investment. Who funds ICR? If you're so keen to follow the money, at least do it consistently. \n\n \n In a thread on these forums from two years ago, there was this thread about an expedition to find \"Tiktaalik roseae\", it appeared to be an atheist, evolutionist dream. I'd like to know what that exploration did to provide \"return on investment\" more than ID studies would. \n \n \nI didn't say all scientists accept evolution. I said the vast majority do. Care to substantiate your other allegations?\n \n That said, I expect that in some very specific cases a disinclination to apply evolutionary theory would make a person incompatible with a particular role. But the same could be said for almost any stance. If your day-to-day job entails the forensic investigation of crime scenes, a fervent belief in poltergeist activity might impair your effectiveness somewhat :) \n \n At the end of the day, evolutionary theory has proved itself effective, and has opened up a rich vein of scientific enquiry that yields valuable results on a daily basis. Results are important to both businesses and academic institutions. Who do they want to fund and put in charge of equipment and lab space capable of mining that vein? Probably not someone who believes against all available evidence that the vein isn't there. I'd fire someone working in my gold mine if they didn't believe in gold. If they want to spend their time proving gold doesn't exist, they can find some other sucker to pay for it. \n\n \n If you were an atheist administrator in a university, would you fire someone who thought junkets in search of Tiktaalik roseae's just might be a waste of public money? \n \n \nPardon? Because scientists say ID is pseudoscience, that indicates that some of evolution is pseudoscience too? If you say I smell bad, does that mean you smell bad too? \n\n \n If some scientists declare themselves judges of pseudoscience, other judges with equal scientific credentials (even if they're in the minority) have a right to examine the prevailing opinion of science, and make conclusions about its possibility of pseudoscience. If I say you smell bad, and YOUR NOSE tells you that I smell bad, you don't deserve to be politically, or publicly discriminated against for telling me that. \n \n \nAnd there it is in black and off-white: you can't find any fault with common descent or evolution, so you shoehorn in something to which evolution does not speak. \n\n \n And ID does not speak of a designer. \n \n \nEvolution is not about origin of first life. Take it off the table. Now look again. Earliest forms of life: single cells. Then simple agglomerations (sponges), then progressively more specialisation (flatworms), and on and on and on. Evolution. A nested hierarchy of forms and genetics. Atavisms. Vestigial features. The evidence is all right there, yet because we haven't yet reached back three and a half billion years and created an accurate pre-cellular picture (you really ought to check out protocells though) you declare the whole edifice insubstantial. That's like saying we should acquit a murderer because the tens of thousands of pieces of evidence indicating his guilt mean nothing if we can't tell how many cornflakes he had for breakfast. \n\n \n It's not insubstantial, but its not substantial enough to not be questioned. \n \n \nOk, it's not quite like that. Obviously the origin of life is a fascinating subject and not an insignificant detail. Let me rephrase, then: the murderer commited his crime with a weapon whose origin is indeterminate. So far, nobody has a full picture of how the murderer came by this weapon. Fascinating, intriguing, important even - but irrelevant to the question of whether he commited the crime, for which the evidence is overwhelming. \n\n \n That's a tricky analogy, the one object used by a person in a crime, with all his intentions and thought processes, is far more irrelevant than origins are to evolution. \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000) There's no way to keep human imperfection out of the equation, when it comes to speculation about origins. \n\n \n \nIrrelevant. The same could be said for any scientific discipline (scientists can get passionate about very obscure matters). So long as you forbid treating any hypothesis as sacred, there will always be someone willing to challenge it, either because they're neutral on the topic and feel it hasn't been given proper treatment, or have a different bias. It doesn't matter, because in the end they have to play by the rules: the scientific method. \n\n \n The emotion and panic attack that resulted from the book \"Darwin's Black Box\" didn't look like a defined set of rules with nothing but open inquiry as their guide. It was really interesting to me that Behe was nowhere to be found in the movie \"Expelled\". He probably would have more interesting stories than just about anyone concerning discrimination. Maybe he'd rather not get involved in the politics of the matter, by being in the movie. Or maybe someone suggested he stay out of it, in a convincing way. \n \n \nI.D abandons the scientific method. It has produced no useful results and largely refused to take part in the 'trial by fire' peer review process through which all scientific ideas - however oddball they may have seemed at first, like evolution - must pass. Instead, I.D. produces populist 'sciencey' books and goes straight for the classroom jugular. They go for the lay-person and the kids - I know you have your 'agenda' explanation for that, but isn't there a simpler and more straightforward one? One that tallies with I.D's avowed intent? Please, name one branch of science that has debuted in the classroom before ever producing results. \n\n \n Could be easier to name one that has produced results, and has been blocked from the classroom. No matter how much they lie, the biological community is still coming to terms with Michael Behe's work. But the fact remains that ID fails regularly to get the recognition it seeks in court case after court case. I can't make a case for it as well as those much more qualified people who have failed, so I'm not going to attempt it yet again. Though I don't agree with everything he says about it, the following columnist inspires thought about it, particularly the last two paragraphs;\n \n \nThe problem with evolution is not that it is unscientific but that it is routinely taught in textbooks and in the classroom in an atheist way. Textbooks frequently go beyond the scientific evidence to make metaphysical claims about how evolution renders the idea of a Creator superfluous. my book What's So Great About Christianity provides several examples of this. \n \n Most Christians don't care whether the eye evolved by natural selection or whether Darwin's theories can account for macroevolution or only microevolution. What they care about is that evolution is being used to deny God as the creator. For those who are concerned about this atheism masquerading as science, there is a better way. Instead of trying to get unscientific ID theories included in the classroom, a better strategy would be to get the unscientific atheist propaganda out. \n\n \n As long as there is scientific uncertainty, there is going to be unscientific propaganda. I would rather see competition and debate between the propaganda of evolution and the propaganda of ID, rather than a monopoly by the evolutionists, with the possibility of government police action to reign in the atheism. It seems to me that evolutionists would too, but the best idea for them is for neither one to happen. They're enjoying having it both ways now, but with each victory they get over ID, the more the arrogance increases, the more religion is discriminated against, the more Weinbergs and Wilsons toot their horns, the closer the day comes when it could be reigned in, when the public has had enough of it. On a radio interview I heard the other day, Ben Stein said he is not finished with this subject. \n \n The question is, will old, traditional Christians die off, being replaced by indoctrinated public school students, at a rate that harmonizes with the increase in arrogance, the increase in power, that science increases into. \n \n \nIncorrect. See analogy above: it doesn't matter how first life got started because evolution only speaks to subsequent events. \n\n \n It matters if enough people think it does. If enough people think the question of origins justifies exploration of other yet unexplored paths\n \n \nI feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind? \n\n \n I'm sure you do. Many times when conservatives or Christians have a good argument about something, a \"fallacy\" is made up and applied to it. In the 80's, there was this guy named Ronald Reagan. He had quite a following - Reaganomics and all that. \"What can we do about this guy? He's messing up all our big-government liberalism\". Hey, lets make a fallacy!! He used to be an actor, he's a good lookin dude, lets call it the argument by personal charm\"!! Anything he says is to be discarded, just because he has charm! Then later, when John Edwards / Barrack Obama come on the scene, that fallacy no longer applies!! It gets turned off like a switch! \n \n When creationists get tired of hearing how detrimental religion is to society, and clearly show how Darwinist thinking harmonizes with Nazism, it's simply called \"argumentum ad Hitlerum\" and then the debate about it is over! There is no such thing as \"argumentum ad anti-religionum\", we don't recognize that one! In 20 or 30 years, when theistic evolutionists are no longer useful for godless evolution, it will become an advantage for evolutionists to declare that NO TRUE EVOLUTIONIST COULD BELIEVE IN GOD, and the No True Scotsman fallacy will be out dated, switched off. \n \n \nI'm not going to engage you on this, marc, I'm really not. It won't matter how many Christians I show to be liars, you'll just say they can't be true Christians, because Christians have guidelines about lying - and round and round we go.\n \n I could equally say that no true atheist lies, because atheists have stronger inherent moral values - evidenced by their ability to behave themselves despite not believing there's a divine CCTV camera on them 24-7.\n\n \n Yes, we've gone about as far as we can go, but it's been fun. emoticon_xagree",

They only had one definition, \"change in allele frequencies over time\". \n\n I double checked, and all anyone asked was that that be the definition used in the debate. Doesn't that request in itself imply knowledge of other definitions, necessitating such a clarification?\n \nOnly if we use the following definitions for ... Evolution.\n Evolution:\n : The change in allele frequencies over time\n\n \nWhat \"we use\" is determined by our posts in the debate.\n\n \n \nBecause what inspired my argument/debate challange was the Questions for both sides thread, it was full of vague/popular laymans usages of the term, and you can't blame only me for it, since I didn't start the thread, and since I was only about 1/10 of all the broad usages of the term going on in that thread, the rest were coming from evolutionists. Please read its opening post (by an evolutionist) - you're not going to find much about biology there. \n\n The OP concerns people's motives for propounding their views, and juxtaposes evolution with creationism. The only context in which such a contrast is meaningful is the layman's use of 'evolution' to refer to common descent. Allele frequency change, after all, isn't incompatible with creationism.\n \n \nSo you're saying creationists are the only ones who do that? Check out this thread - the first 12 posts were all by evolutionists. Post #1 was only about biological evolution. Post #2 touched on biology, and quickly moved on to geology and paleontology, in a seamless and unnoticeable fashion.\n\n Mmm. Thing is, a lot of what we know about evolution (common descent) is derived from paleontology and geology: dating of strata tells us timescales and confirms the ordering of the nested hierarchy of forms. So we know evolution (common descent) happened, we know it took a long time, and we know the order in which forms developed, all of which are incompatible with literal genesis. How we know those things involves paleontology, geology and so on, but what it adds up to is information regarding evolution.\n \n One genuine non-sequitur in there is the great flood - although it's possible to apply evolutionary theory to conclude that it didn't happen the principle evidence is geological.\n \nPoster #1's response in post #4 made no reference to it - I'm sure he didn't even notice it. \n\n Probably not, because there's nothing to notice. Our picture of the evolutionary history of life on earth is informed by many branches of science, from chemistry and physics to paleontology and geology - even cosmology has a few words to say regarding the source of certain necessary materials. So what? Wouldn't geology and paleontology refuting evolution be a bigger story than those sciences contributing complementary useful data?\n \nCreationists aren't the only ones that blend the word evolution with cosmology, the big bang, geology, paleontology, or even worldviews and philosophy. Will you admit that or not? \n\n Well, no, frankly. \n \n If I ask 'How long did common descent take to reach this point? Can we confirm the nested hierarchy of forms to be sure of the order in which they arose? Where did these chemical elements come from?' and turn to other sciences to corroborate or inform my understanding, I'm not blending  the word evolution with anything. And if I use the word evolution (change over time) to describe the development of the cosmos post big-bang, I'm not 'blending' anything either. I'm using an appropriate term with an applicable dictionary definition. Conflating those terms, ignoring the differences in meaning, and trying to paint a picture of something insidious overtaking science - that's the job of a politically and religiously motivated creationist.\n \n If you're skeptical, bear in mind that of late, in response to just this kind of accusation, I've done my best to explicitly delineate meaning and avoid the generic term wherever possible. You'll also notice my arguments haven't otherwise changed in the slightest - could I do that if my 'agenda' genuinely depended upon the equivocation you describe?\n \n \nI was seeking a discussion about evolution being atheistic concerning its general use and understanding to everyone, as we see that anyone is likely to introduce it/use it in a general way, a way that encompases all its sub-catagories. I got what I wanted, you and I did it, and it's there for anyone to read.\n\n And do you think you achieved something worthwhile? You showed some atheists talking about evolution, and you showed some scientific sites explaining that evolution was not atheistic, which you interpreted as evidence - not of disagreement, but of intent to dissemble.\n \n Would you accept a similar interpretation of your relationship with the Catholic church? The latter being some kind of smokescreen to hide their true intentions until creationists manage to get their way and install religion in the science classroom?\n \n \nI'll partially concede that point. ... But I still believe the ID community can explain how design can be detected in biology, without any knowledge of the designer. \n\n But you'll concede that such a 'test' can only be negative in form, yes? Logically, you cannot positively test for something if you have no idea what it looks like. \n \n If you ask me \"Is there a sploing in this room?\" I can't actually look for a sploing, can I? I can only itemise the contents of the room and hazard a guess that anything I can't identify might be a sploing. But even if I find something unidentifiable, how can I know it's a sploing?\n \n That's I.D in a nutshell: holding up unidentified items and declaring they have found what they were looking for. First it was the eye, then haemoglobin, then bacterial flagella - the claims have got more sciencey-sounding, with numbers and impressive terms like 'specified complexity' to make it sound like they're on the same page as real science, but at the end of the day it's Paley's watch all over again: pick something biological for which no naturalistic history yet exists, construct some arbitrary 'random chance' scenario cherry picked to exceed their own universal probability bound, observe that it does exceed that bound, and declare that they have detected design.\n \n Do you appreciate the weakness of that reasoning? If your 'random chance' scenario is bull, either because of bias or honest ignorance, your detection of design is bull. Go back to the Giant's Causeway example - if you pick a 'chance' scenario based on random freeze-thaw cracking, it'll exceed the universal probability bound with ease. Therefore, design. Same applies to Dembski's treatment of flagella: he assumes that the only possible naturalistic history is the spontaneous and simultaneous formation and integration of all parts as-is, calculates some odds for that and thus 'detects design'.\n \n Don't take my word for it. Watch I.D evolve emoticon_xclown over the next few years. The examples of design they're using now will quitely be retired as their naturalistic formation is explained by hard-working scientists, and new ones will take their place.",

   "Is it not equally likely that by disregarding design or any possibility of the supernatural, the lack of that significant thought process takes the evolutionist down only one path that&#8217;s narrow enough to make it trivially easy to theorize that everything happens by nothing but naturalistic processes?\n\n 'Equally likely' is tricky. Certainly it's possible that a naturalistic methodology will miss supernatural influence or design, but to estimate the likelihood of that one would need to know the odds of supernatural influence being present in the first place. On the other hand, how can we gauge the odds of our being ignorant of some naturalistic process? All we can say with certainty is that there have been many natural forces and processes of which we have been ignorant, historically; the hypothesis of ignorance has a proven track record of success.\n \n But the real question is, what do you want science to do differently? It sounds very polite and even-handed to advocate 'considering' supernatural influence or design, but what do you want scientists to do beyond saying: \"Well, that might have been a miracle. Or design. Yep. Ummm.... Miller time, then?\"\n \n They might be right, completely by accident, but it's far more likely that they'd be wrong - in which case, we've just lost the opportunity to learn something. Surely it's better to hunt for what we can recognise: a plausible naturalistic explanation. Plausible is the important word there; Sherlock Holmes's motto does not apply. Scientists don't say \"Well, there's a quintillion-to-one chance we're right but it must have happened because the alternative is a miracle\". They say instead 'We don't know.'\n \nThere seem to be a lot of magic wands for silencing discussion of ID.\n\n Which is the spin Behe et al naturally put on things. They play on your notion of fairness, of giving equal time to conflicting opinions. Notice that they never actually come out and say what it is they're being prevented from bringing to the table. Nor do they produce anything of practical or academic value, despite being generously funded.\n \nI know that's only their personal opinions, but those opinions aren't staying in their own little worlds.\n\n None of which makes evolutionary theory unscientific or incorrect, or turns I.D. into good science. Like I said, if religion wasn't such a cause for concern in its own right, nobody would care, and you wouldn't get thoughtful people standing up to demand it be brought to book, and using the scientific method to question it. Aggressive, anti-science creationism in its guise as I.D is a rallying point for concerned scientists. Violence perpetrated in the name of god is another. The simple idea of a deity or creator is not.\n \nThat&#8217;s only your worldview. I can switch your words around to show another worldview, but I won&#8217;t bother..\n\n No, no, be my guest!\n \n The truth is you can do no such thing. If we were to destroy all scientific and religious knowledge and start afresh, we would rediscover evolution and common descent as surely as we would rediscover the earth's trajectory around the sun, because the evidence for them all is hardwired into our reality. Can you say the same about your beliefs? Sure, we might well reinvent the idea of a deity - a surrogate all-father is always going to appeal to human nature - and around that belief would accrue myths and stories, and in another couple of thousand years people like yourself would insist those specific myths and stories were the Truth, and as it became gradually clearer that you were wrong, we might well end up having the same disputes as we do today. Repeat the whole process again, and again - it will always come down to the same science, the same results, vs whatever myths happen to predominate at the time.\n \n \nWhere did I say anything about what I should have said? You asked me for an example of where you expended less-than-considerable effort in the service of clarity, and I showed you where it was. \n\n Really? Me pointing out that the catholic church isn't an atheist organisation yet subscribes to an evolutionary natural history wasn't clear or relevant? All I did was take them at their word - you were the one inventing twisted interpretations in which the church was lying to avoid conflict - in direct contradiction of your own recent claim that christians have stronger guidelines against lying.\n \nYou&#8217;ve implied that only creationists make the slippery word slide, and this thread alone makes it so clear how evolutionists do it too.\n\n I doubt many unbiased readers will reach that conclusion. I've been very, very straightforward about evolution and its meanings, while you have sought at every turn to equivocate and avoid those distinct meanings - just as you did in our debate.\n \nWell then maybe I&#8217;ve accomplished something here by inspiring you to do that, because you sure weren&#8217;t doing that a year ago, to the authors of posts 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 9, 10, etc etc etc in this thread. \n\n I didn't need to say anything in that thread, because all your opponents were doing was pointing out that you wouldn't agree to a definition. They offered several options: evolutionary theory, biological evolution - you weren't interested. You wanted to invent your own meaning of the word 'evolution' defined according to your cherry-picked associations with atheism.\n \n What's interesting is that you could have debated and won any number of more specific resolutions, but you wanted to equivocate. You wanted to win a debate called \"Evolution is Atheistic\", and you didn't really care what the substance of that debate had to be for you to win. Appearances are everything :)\n \nYes, they&#8217;re outside, they&#8217;re in academics, they&#8217;re writing books, they&#8217;re teaching very small children, they&#8217;re lining politicians pockets, they&#8217;re filing lawsuits challenging tradition and morals, they&#8217;re in a lot of places.\n\n Well, at least they're keeping busy.\n \nHe may not be that hidden, if you'd look somewhere besides science for him.\n\n You don't look at science, you look with it.\n \nIf he wanted us to think he didn't exist, he may have avoided allowing the 66 book Bible to be the most carefully preserved writings in all of history, or his Son to be the most written about person who ever lived.\n\n But whichever book that happened to be, you could say the same thing :) It's a completely unverifiable claim that stacks up poorly against the observation that there will inevitably be a most carefully preserved writing, and a most written-about person.\n \nBut what he is doing is taking evolution (considered a \"fact\") adding it to a theory (there is no god) and trying to convice his reader that he has added; fact + theory = fact.\n\n Not exactly: hypothesis + fact = confirmed hypothesis. Don't forget, he is talking about the Judeo-Christian god, the one with which his readers are likely to be most familiar. I expect his argument runs along the lines that since the facts contradict the bible in many important respects, we cannot interpret the latter as literal truth. And since its claim to authority is bound up with it being literal truth, what justification do we have for reinterpreting it and still calling it truth, still calling it authoritative? We've moved from \"because the bible says so\" to \"because I can make the bible say so\", which is much less compelling.\n \nDo you get equally irritatied by the little captions under the names of Kent Hovind, or Michael Behe, or Ben Stein, or William Dembski? Why the double standard? Why not let them be individuals also? Why not let them come to certain conclusions without attacking captions, or ideologies?\n\n The caption in question presumably being 'creationist'? Interesting question.\n \n I had never heard of the term 'evolutionist' until I joined these boards and had the word hurled at me, so I've never really given it much credence. If I'm an 'ist' I'm a scientist; evolution is just one of the things science tells us has happened. I find the subject endlessly fascinating, but not to the exclusion of all else, and I don't attach any philosophical importance or sense of identity to evolution specifically. I'd have been on the same side when the church picked a fight with Galileo, and for the same reasons. So when I see scientists demoted to 'evolutionists', dragged down to the level of the single-issue pressure groups beseiging them, I feel a pang of empathy.\n \n Perhaps I am wrong to feel comfortable thinking of Hovind, Dembski and Behe as all being 'creationists'. Certainly their methods differ in sophistication - but the motivation and the goal is the same. Is that sufficient?\n \n Like I said: interesting question. I think on reflection I'm irritated by 'evolutionist' because of the implication that one is motivated to defend evolutionary theory specifically, rather than the scientific method that produced it. Call me a scientist instead and you'll hear no argument. At the same time, I feel justified in using the term 'creationist' in the same way as I would use the term 'homeopath' or 'spiritualist': a definable branch of anti-science whose practitioners constitute a special-interest group. I'm perfectly prepared to be pigeonholed, so long as it's the right hole. Is 'creationist' the wrong hole for Dembski, Behe and Hovind?\n \nWhy the fear in letting future generations be exposed to their path of thinking?\n\n Because it hasn't proved itself worthwhile, and the avowed motivation and intent of the I.D. movement is at odds with the very principles that make science useful. What justification can you give for including I.D in science classrooms that wouldn't also apply to spiritualism? Shouldn't we at least teach the controversy about ghosts?\n \nWrong, as E.O. Wilson made clear above.\n\n We weren't talking about Wilson, so why am I wrong?",

   "I double checked, and all anyone asked was that that be the definition used in the debate. Doesn't that request in itself imply knowledge of other definitions, necessitating such a clarification? \n\n \n Not clarification, elimination. If they had knowledge of other definitions, they weren't seeking to focus on only one to clarify the others, they were seeking to eliminate the others. I was seeking an overall, broad definition of evolution, because that's what the \"questions for both sides\" thread was about, it was what obvious_child's subsequent taunt thread was about, and it was clearly what my challenge thread was about. My challenge directly followed obvious_child's taunt thread, and his taunt thread directly followed the \"questions for both sides\" thread. \n \n \nThe OP concerns people's motives for propounding their views, and juxtaposes evolution with creationism. The only context in which such a contrast is meaningful is the layman's use of 'evolution' to refer to common descent. Allele frequency change, after all, isn't incompatible with creationism. \n\n \n That's it exactly, allele frequency change doesn't go into the controversy concerning worldviews like common descent does, because common descent gets involved with questions of man not being one bit different than animals, of their being no defined time or place of original sin, no Adam and Eve, etc. \n \n It's what makes the word evolution so slippery, when someone like myself wants to explore all the ideologies and extrapolations of evolution concerning politics, someone immediately wants to reduce it to a biological discussion only. \n \n \nMmm. Thing is, a lot of what we know about evolution (common descent) is derived from paleontology and geology: dating of strata tells us timescales and confirms the ordering of the nested hierarchy of forms. So we know evolution (common descent) happened, we know it took a long time, and we know the order in which forms developed, all of which are incompatible with literal genesis. How we know those things involves paleontology, geology and so on, but what it adds up to is information regarding evolution. \n\n \n And this is how worldviews are formed and maintained, in your words, concerns peoples motives for propounding their views, and juxtaposes evolution with creationism. It was that thread, the \"questions for both sides\" thread, that inspired the evolutionists to taunt me about evolution being atheistic, and consequently inspired me to start the above referenced challenge thread, where it was insisted that \"change in allele frequencies over time\" was the only definition acceptable in any debate with me about evolution being atheistic. The dishonesty on their part was clear. \n \n \nProbably not, because there's nothing to notice. Our picture of the evolutionary history of life on earth is informed by many branches of science, from chemistry and physics to paleontology and geology - even cosmology has a few words to say regarding the source of certain necessary materials. So what? Wouldn't geology and paleontology refuting evolution be a bigger story than those sciences contributing complementary useful data?\n\n \n Well, the possibility of them refuting evolution isn't really the issue since no one is saying that, it's the current way they compliment it that makes them part of the issue, when having discussions like the \"questions for both sides\" thread. \n \n \nWell, no, frankly. \n \n If I ask 'How long did common descent take to reach this point? Can we confirm the nested hierarchy of forms to be sure of the order in which they arose? Where did these chemical elements come from?' and turn to other sciences to corroborate or inform my understanding, I'm not blending  the word evolution with anything. And if I use the word evolution (change over time) to describe the development of the cosmos post big-bang, I'm not 'blending' anything either. I'm using an appropriate term with an applicable dictionary definition. Conflating those terms, ignoring the differences in meaning, and trying to paint a picture of something insidious overtaking science - that's the job of a politically and religiously motivated creationist. \n\n \n It works both ways! Conflating those terms, and trying to paint an innocent picture of evolution, is often the job of a politically motivated evolutionist. The proof is in my above referenced challenge thread. \n \n Your earlier example of what creationists were doing was no more dishonest than what certain evolutionists were doing here in trying to dishonestly narrow the definition of the word \"evolution\". \n \n \nIf you're skeptical, bear in mind that of late, in response to just this kind of accusation, I've done my best to explicitly delineate meaning and avoid the generic term wherever possible. You'll also notice my arguments haven't otherwise changed in the slightest - could I do that if my 'agenda' genuinely depended upon the equivocation you describe? \n\n \n I'll concede that you've done that somewhat, and it's helping make our little discussion here interesting, don't you think? \n \n \nAnd do you think you achieved something worthwhile? You showed some atheists talking about evolution, and you showed some scientific sites explaining that evolution was not atheistic, which you interpreted as evidence - not of disagreement, but of intent to dissemble. \n\n \n You said you didn't want to rehash that debate, and I don't either. The main thing I achieved was an enjoyable experience of putting it together and seeing what I could do with it. Of the 5 formals I've done, I thought it was one of my best if not THE best. Yet I was criticized for it far more than I was any other. Not necessarily a bad thing in something so divisive and emotional, especially considering that I'm seeing several points I made being corroborated in a movie made one year later. \n \n \nBut you'll concede that such a 'test' can only be negative in form, yes? Logically, you cannot positively test for something if you have no idea what it looks like. \n\n \n No more of a negative form than tests made by evolutionists. Evolutionists don't know what naturalistic origins look like either. And you'll tell me that evolutionists don't directly test for them. And I'll tell you that IDists don't directly test for a designer. \n \n \nIf you ask me \"Is there a sploing in this room?\" I can't actually look for a sploing, can I? I can only itemise the contents of the room and hazard a guess that anything I can't identify might be a sploing. But even if I find something unidentifiable, how can I know it's a sploing?\n \n That's I.D in a nutshell: holding up unidentified items and declaring they have found what they were looking for. First it was the eye, then haemoglobin, then bacterial flagella - the claims have got more sciencey-sounding, with numbers and impressive terms like 'specified complexity' to make it sound like they're on the same page as real science, but at the end of the day it's Paley's watch all over again: pick something biological for which no naturalistic history yet exists, construct some arbitrary 'random chance' scenario cherry picked to exceed their own universal probability bound, observe that it does exceed that bound, and declare that they have detected design.\n \n Do you appreciate the weakness of that reasoning? If your 'random chance' scenario is bull, either because of bias or honest ignorance, your detection of design is bull. Go back to the Giant's Causeway example - if you pick a 'chance' scenario based on random freeze-thaw cracking, it'll exceed the universal probability bound with ease. \n\n \n I think you're misrepresenting UPB. Whatever happens from freeze thaw cracking isn't going to result in something as complex as life, something that has so many parts that have to work together perfectly, or quickly, completely deteriorate. \n \n \nTherefore, design. Same applies to Dembski's treatment of flagella: he assumes that the only possible naturalistic history is the spontaneous and simultaneous formation and integration of all parts as-is, calculates some odds for that and thus 'detects design'.\n \n Don't take my word for it. Watch I.D evolve emoticon_xclown over the next few years. The examples of design they're using now will quitely be retired as their naturalistic formation is explained by hard-working scientists, and new ones will take their place.\n\n \n We shall see! :) Again, it's interesting to me that Michael Behe wasn't in the expelled movie. I honestly believe it's because he is working hard, and is not going to allow a public appearance like that to cloud what he may be able to unveil in the future.",

Certainly it's possible that a naturalistic methodology will miss supernatural influence or design, but to estimate the likelihood of that one would need to know the odds of supernatural influence being present in the first place. On the other hand, how can we gauge the odds of our being ignorant of some naturalistic process? All we can say with certainty is that there have been many natural forces and processes of which we have been ignorant, historically; the hypothesis of ignorance has a proven track record of success.\n \n But the real question is, what do you want science to do differently? It sounds very polite and even-handed to advocate 'considering' supernatural influence or design, but what do you want scientists to do beyond saying: \"Well, that might have been a miracle. Or design. Yep. Ummm.... Miller time, then?\" \n\n \n I'd expect them to crash and raid the party of those toasting the Millers at all the atheist celebrations of Tikaalik roseae. :)\n \n \nThey might be right, completely by accident, but it's far more likely that they'd be wrong - in which case, we've just lost the opportunity to learn something. \n\n \n Why is it far more likely they'd be wrong? You're giving me the impression that you have discarded ID only by glancing very quickly at it, without checking on even the very basics of it. And it seems like most of science has done that. It's an imperfect human thing, not an open inquiry thing. As was pointed out in the movie Expelled, many in science want to make it appear like the thinking starts with science, and worldviews (usually atheist) result from it. But reality is that thinking starts with worldviews, and the scientific paths of study result from that. \n \n \nSurely it's better to hunt for what we can recognise: a plausible naturalistic explanation. Plausible is the important word there; Sherlock Holmes's motto does not apply. Scientists don't say \"Well, there's a quintillion-to-one chance we're right but it must have happened because the alternative is a miracle\". They say instead 'We don't know.' \n\n \n That's where we have to agree to disagree. Those who represent science aren't unbiased enough to say \"I don't know\" often enough. They launch into their personal ideology, often in a seamless and unnoticeable fashion. \n \n \nWhich is the spin Behe et al naturally put on things. They play on your notion of fairness, of giving equal time to conflicting opinions. Notice that they never actually come out and say what it is they're being prevented from bringing to the table. Nor do they produce anything of practical or academic value, despite being generously funded. \n\n \n They do, you just don't notice. Here are five that Dembski lists;\n \n 1] Lay out reliable criteria for detecting intelligence\n 2] Apply these criteria to biological systems\n 3] Show that these criteria effectively rule out material mechanisms.\n 4] Reconceptualize evolutionary biology within a design-theoretic framework. \n 5] Inspire a fruitful program of biological research that is uniquely design-theoretic. \n \n In his detail of number 4, Dembski states; \"Intelligent design continues to look for function where nonteleological approaches to evolution attribute clumsiness or incompetence.\" He's saying, and it makes perfect sense to me, that ID could continue a path of exploration that Darwinism would abandon. \n \n He continues after number 5; \"Where are we with these five tasks facing intelligent design? At present most of the discussion centers on tasks 1, 2, and 3.\" He predicts advancement on these in the next 5 years. Then, \"as for 4 and 5, 4 is just starting and 5 remains a promissory note. Intelligent design, like evolutionary biology, has its own promissory notes. The difference is that intelligent design is only now being tried whereas evolutionary biology has been thoroughly tried and found wanting.\" \n \n It's a new kind of science. To declare that there can't be any, that we already know of all of them, is not open inquiry, and it should be in true science. But as I said, if it can't win in the courts, it's a little ridiculous for non-scientist me to try to make a case for it here. But I have to wonder, does it fail in the courts ONLY because of the masterful way evolutionists constantly switch the definition of evolution around? \n \n \nNone of which makes evolutionary theory unscientific or incorrect, or turns I.D. into good science. Like I said, if religion wasn't such a cause for concern in its own right, nobody would care, and you wouldn't get thoughtful people standing up to demand it be brought to book, and using the scientific method to question it. Aggressive, anti-science creationism in its guise as I.D is a rallying point for concerned scientists. Violence perpetrated in the name of god is another. The simple idea of a deity or creator is not. \n\n \n And aggressive, anti religion atheism in its guise as evolution is a rallying point for concerned members of some general societies. \n \nOriginally posted by marc90000\n That's only your worldview. I can switch your words around to show another worldview, but I won't bother.. \n\n \n \nNo, no, be my guest!\n\n \n Okay, you said;\n \nOriginally posted by peeling) Our evolutionary history is written through this planet like words through a stick of rock - therefore, science can speak to it. What consequences that has for your spiritual beliefs and their underpinnings is not science's fault. \n\n \n How about; God's record of creation displays a marvelous and clear consistency throughout. From the symphony of the creation week in Genesis to the promise of a new heaven and new earth in Revelation, and all the fulfilled prophesy in between, and characteristics of man today. What consequences that has for your Darwinist beliefs is not my fault, or God's fault. \n \n \nThe truth is you can do no such thing. If we were to destroy all scientific and religious knowledge and start afresh, we would rediscover evolution and common descent as surely as we would rediscover the earth's trajectory around the sun, because the evidence for them all is hardwired into our reality. Can you say the same about your beliefs? Sure, we might well reinvent the idea of a deity - a surrogate all-father is always going to appeal to human nature - and around that belief would accrue myths and stories, and in another couple of thousand years people like yourself would insist those specific myths and stories were the Truth, and as it became gradually clearer that you were wrong, we might well end up having the same disputes as we do today. Repeat the whole process again, and again - it will always come down to the same science, the same results, vs whatever myths happen to predominate at the time. \n\n \n You do have a lot of confidence in your 150 year old myth, in spite of all it's gaps. Your \"same science and same results\" do seem to have their ups and downs however. Your gaps have narrowed some in that 150 years, but they've also widened a lot in those 150 years. (complexity of life, origins) It's part of the dispute.",

   "Really? Me pointing out that the catholic church isn't an atheist organisation yet subscribes to an evolutionary natural history wasn't clear or relevant? All I did was take them at their word - you were the one inventing twisted interpretations in which the church was lying to avoid conflict - in direct contradiction of your own recent claim that christians have stronger guidelines against lying. \n\n \n It was early in the debate, and it was before I clarified the definitions problem, something I don't think you expected me to do. Now that we've gotten beyond that in an even more clear way, we can say that when atheists joyously point towards the Catholic church and say \"see, they believe in evolution\" when they actually conditionally accept \"change in allele frequencies over time\" , not \"common descent\" as in no Adam and Eve, no difference between humans and animals, no original sin, no purpose, etc. that they (the atheists) aren't being completely honest. \n \n I never accused Catholics of lying. To avoid saying something is not lying. \n \n \n \n \nI doubt many unbiased readers will reach that conclusion. I've been very, very straightforward about evolution and its meanings, while you have sought at every turn to equivocate and avoid those distinct meanings - just as you did in our debate. \n\n \n Haha - that's where we have to agree to disagree. \n \n \nI didn't need to say anything in that thread, because all your opponents were doing was pointing out that you wouldn't agree to a definition. They offered several options: evolutionary theory, biological evolution - you weren't interested. You wanted to invent your own meaning of the word 'evolution' defined according to your cherry-picked associations with atheism.\n\n \n See, you're not being very straightforward. The dispute between religion and evolution is more than just a matter of right and wrong. It involves worldviews, the nature of reality and the way members of a society interact with each other. I was interested in discussing the philosophy of evolution, not the mechanics of evolution. Just like the \"questions for both sides\" thread started out, before it got messy.\n \n \nWhat's interesting is that you could have debated and won any number of more specific resolutions, but you wanted to equivocate. You wanted to win a debate called \"Evolution is Atheistic\", and you didn't really care what the substance of that debate had to be for you to win. Appearances are everything :) \n\n \n \"And won\"?? At this place? You know full well that nobody but nooooooobody would have accepted a more specific resolution that I would have had a chance at winning. It was like pulling teeth to get you to accept the general one we did do! I'm still waiting for the first evolutionist to put forward a formal debate resolution that accepts a burden of proof for some philosophical claim of evolution, like \"God is a delusion\" - man has no soul - morality comes from nature, etc. It follows perfectly that the evolutionists that are afraid to propose and accept a burden of proof are the same evolutionists who are going refuse to accept any negative that isn't stacked in their favor. \n \n \nYou don't look at science, you look with it. \n\n \n You don't even look with science, when it comes to some subjects. Love, hate, foundations of morality, etc. but your claim of \"if he wants us to think he doesn't exist\" got me to thinking of a good way to explain it. The first thought I have of course, is if he provided the slightest bit more of scientific evidence for his existence, the world would be completely different than it is today. But I get daily emails from \"notreligion.com\" and a partial c/p of what it said today may be in order;\n \n \nYou know, loving someone who doesn't love you back can be so painful. Ever been there? Maybe you've loved someone romantically who didn't share your feelings. Or you've loved a child who repeatedly turned his back on you. \n Whatever the situation, love that's not reciprocated is maybe the most difficult love of all. I suppose God could've programmed us to love each other and Him, perfectly and completely--but that's not love; that's automation. \n No, God created us to love by choice. You can choose to love other people or you can choose not to. You can choose to love God...or not. There's great joy in the first choice, but incredible pain in the second. But it's pretty much all up to you. \n So, Jesus will never force you to love Him. He'll never pressure you into having a relationship with Him. But why wouldn't you? \n\n \n We're not robots, we can make our choices. As I said before, it's all been written down, and not in a science book. \n \n \nThe caption in question presumably being 'creationist'? Interesting question.\n \n I had never heard of the term 'evolutionist' until I joined these boards and had the word hurled at me, so I've never really given it much credence. If I'm an 'ist' I'm a scientist; evolution is just one of the things science tells us has happened.

Certainly their methods differ in sophistication - but the motivation and the goal is the same. Is that sufficient?\n \n Like I said: interesting question. I think on reflection I'm irritated by 'evolutionist' because of the implication that one is motivated to defend evolutionary theory specifically, rather than the scientific method that produced it.\n\n \n Well, if what I said above is true, (about the worldview coming before the science) the evolutionist is motivated to defend evolutionary because they harmonize with his personal metaphysical or ideological evolutionary views. I understand that evolutionists don't like the word evolutionism, because it shows a relationship between the science they want to pursue, and their worldview. \n \n \nCall me a scientist instead and you'll hear no argument. At the same time, I feel justified in using the term 'creationist' in the same way as I would use the term 'homeopath' or 'spiritualist': a definable branch of anti-science whose practitioners constitute a special-interest group. I'm perfectly prepared to be pigeonholed, so long as it's the right hole. Is 'creationist' the wrong hole for Dembski, Behe and Hovind? \n\n \n It's probably right. But politically \"progressive\" atheists is the right hole for most who oppose ID. It's a hole just as deep as the one occupied by Dembski & Behe. Too many evolutionists don't want to be pigeonholed, they want to be neutral & perfect, and have their brand of neutrality and perfection established in society - established in political decisions. \n \n \nBecause it hasn't proved itself worthwhile, and the avowed motivation and intent of the I.D. movement is at odds with the very principles that make science useful. What justification can you give for including I.D in science classrooms that wouldn't also apply to spiritualism? Shouldn't we at least teach the controversy about ghosts? \n\n \n Again, you don't show enough open inquiry about ID. I'd like for you to address the claim that ID could explore scientific paths that evolution may abandon. \n \n \nWe weren't talking about Wilson, so why am I wrong?\n\n \n Are you being slippery? You said his (Stengers) \"views regarding the detrimental influence of religion are nothing to do with evolution and everything to do with the influence of religion\", as if evolution wasn't a weapon. I was referring to Stenger in a general way, to show how he and others like him use science/evolution as a weapon against religion. You were implying that him and others like him only oppose religion, and their opposition had nothing to do with evolution. Wilson made it clear that it can have something to do with science/evolution.",

   "Indeed ... what term do you suggest people use to describe someone who holds to the view of evolution, if not 'evolutionist'? \"Scientist\" is too broad because there are plenty of scientists that are in fields for which they aren't even involved in this area of science all that much. It's pretty much a necessity to do so if the issue is going to be discussed.

Here are 10 reasons why theistic evolution is a deception and a lie. \n \n http://christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c015.html\n 10 Dangers of Theistic Evolution\n \n The atheistic formula for evolution is:\n \n Evolution = matter + evolutionary factors (chance and necessity + mutation + selection + isolation + death) + very long time periods.\n In the theistic evolutionary view, God is added:\n \n Theistic evolution = matter + evolutionary factors (chance and necessity + mutation + selection + isolation + death) + very long time periods + God.\n In the theistic evolutionary system, God is not the omnipotent Lord of all things, whose Word has to be taken seriously by all men, but He is integrated into the evolutionary philosophy. This leads to 10 dangers for Christians.1\n Danger NO. 1... Misrepresentation of the Nature of God\n \n The Bible reveals God to us as our Father in Heaven, who is absolutely perfect (Matthew 5:48), holy (Isaiah 6:3), and omnipotent (Jeremiah 32:17). The Apostle John tells us that \"God is love,\" \"light\", and \"life\" (1 John 4:16; 1:5; 1:1-2). When this God creates something, His work is described as \"very good\" (Genesis 1:31) and \"perfect\" (Deuteronomy 32:4).\n \n Theistic evolution gives a false representation of the nature of God because death and ghastliness are ascribed to the Creator as principles of creation. (Progressive creationism, likewise, allows for millions of years of death and horror before sin.)\n \n Danger NO. 2... God becomes a God of the Gaps\n \n The Bible states that God is the Prime Cause of all things. \"But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things... and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him\" (1 Corinthians 8:6).\n \n However, in theistic evolution the only workspace allotted to God is that part of nature which evolution cannot \"explain\" with the means presently at its disposal. In this way He is reduced to being a \"god of the gaps\" for those phenomena about which there are doubts. This leads to the view that \"God is therefore not absolute, but He Himself has evolved - He is evolution\".2\n \n Danger NO. 3... Denial of Central Biblical Teachings\n \n The entire Bible bears witness that we are dealing with a source of truth authored by God (2 Timothy 3:16), with the Old Testament as the indispensable \"ramp\" leading to the New Testament, like an access road leads to a motor freeway (John 5:39). The biblical creation account should not be regarded as a myth, a parable, or an Allegory, but as a historical report, because:\n \n Biological, astronomical and anthropological facts are given in didactic [teaching] form.\n In the Ten Commandments God bases the six working days and one day of rest on the same time-span as that described in the creation account (Exodus 20:8-11).\n In the New Testament Jesus referred to facts of the creation (e.g. Matthew 19:4-5).\n Nowhere in the Bible are there any indications that the creation account should be understood in any other way than as a factual report.\n The doctrine of theistic evolution undermines this basic way of reading the Bible, as vouched for by Jesus, the prophets and the Apostles. Events reported in the Bible are reduced to mythical imagery, and an understanding of the message of the Bible as being true in word and meaning is lost.\n \n Danger NO. 4... Loss of the Way for Finding God\n \n The Bible describes man as being completely ensnared by sin after Adam's fall (Romans 7:18-19). Only those persons who realize that they are sinful and lost will seek the Savior who \"came to save that which was lost\" (Luke 19:10).\n \n However, evolution knows no sin in the biblical sense of missing one's purpose (in relation to God). Sin is made meaningless, and that is exactly the opposite of what the Holy Spirit does - He declares sin to be sinful. If sin is seen as a harmless evolutionary factor, then one has lost the key for finding God, which is not resolved by adding \"God\" to the evolutionary scenario.\n \n Danger NO. 5... The Doctrine of God's Incarnation is Undermined\n \n The incarnation of God through His Son Jesus Christ is one of the basic teachings of the Bible. The Bible states that \"The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us\" (John 1:14), \"Christ Jesus... was made in the likeness of men\" (Philippians 2:5-7).\n \n The idea of evolution undermines this foundation of our salvation. Evolutionist Hoimar von Ditfurth discusses the incompatibility of Jesus' incarnation and evolutionary thought: \"Consideration of evolution inevitably forces us to a critical review... of Christian formulations. This clearly holds for the central Christian concept of the 'incarnation' of God... \".3\n \n Danger NO. 6... The Biblical Basis of Jesus' Work of Redemption Is Mythologized\n \n The Bible teaches that the first man's fall into sin was a real event and that this was the direct cause of sin in the world: \"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned\" (Romans 5:12).\n \n Theistic evolution does not acknowledge Adam as the first man, nor that he was created directly from \"the dust of the ground\" by God (Genesis 2:17). Most theistic evolutionists regard the creation account as being merely a mythical tale, albeit with some spiritual significance. However, the sinner Adam and the Savior Jesus are linked together in the Bible - Romans 5:16-18. Thus any view which mythologizes Adam undermines the biblical basis of Jesus' work of redemption.\n \n Danger NO. 7... Loss of Biblical Chronology\n \n The Bible provides us with a time-scale for history and this underlies a proper understanding of the Bible. This time-scale includes:\n \n The time-scale cannot be extended indefinitely into the past, nor into the future. There is a well-defined beginning in Genesis 1:1, as well as a moment when physical time will end (Matthew 24:14).\n The total duration of creation was six days (Exodus 20:11).\n The age of the universe may be estimated in terms of the genealogies recorded in the Bible (but note that it can not be calculated exactly). It is of the order of several thousand years, not billions.\n Galatians 4:4 points out the most outstanding event in the world's history: \"But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son.\" This happened nearly 2,000 years ago.\n The return of Christ in power and glory is the greatest expected future event.\n Supporters of theistic evolution (and progressive creation) disregard the biblically given measures of time in favor of evolutionist time-scales involving billions of years both past and future (for which there are no convincing physical grounds). This can lead to two errors:\n \n Not all statements of the Bible are to be taken seriously.\n Vigilance concerning the second coming of Jesus may be lost.\n Danger NO. 8... Loss of Creation Concepts\n \n Certain essential creation concepts are taught in the Bible. These include:\n \n God created matter without using any available material.\n God created the earth first, and on the fourth day He added the moon, the solar system, our local galaxy, and all other star systems. This sequence conflicts with all ideas of \"cosmic evolution,\" such as the \"big bang\" cosmology.\n Theistic evolution ignores all such biblical creation principles and replaces them with evolutionary notions, thereby contradicting and opposing God's omnipotent acts of creation.\n \n Danger NO. 9... Misrepresentation of Reality\n \n The Bible carries the seal of truth, and all its pronouncements are authoritative - whether they deal with questions of faith and salvation, daily living, or matters of scientific importance.\n \n Evolutionists brush all this aside, e.g. Richard Dawkins says, \"Nearly all peoples have developed their own creation myth, and the Genesis story is just the one that happened to have been adopted by one particular tribe of Middle Eastern herders. It has no more special status than the belief of a particular West African tribe that the world was created from the excrement of ants\".4\n \n If evolution is false, then numerous sciences have embraced false testimony. Whenever these sciences conform with evolutionary views, they misrepresent reality. How much more then a theology which departs from what the Bible says and embraces evolution!\n \n Danger NO. 10... Missing the Purpose\n \n In no other historical book do we find so many and such valuable statements of purpose for man as in the Bible. For example:\n \n Man is God's purpose in creation (Genesis 1:27-28).\n Man is the purpose of God's plan of redemption (Isaiah 53:5).\n Man is the purpose of the mission of God's Son (1 John 4:9).\n We are the purpose of God's inheritance (Titus 3:7).\n Heaven is our destination (1 Peter 1:4).\n However, the very thought of purposefulness is anathema to evolutionists. \"Evolutionary adaptations never follow a purposeful program, they thus can not be regarded as teleonomical.\"5 Thus a belief system such as theistic evolution that marries purposefulness with non-purposefulness is a contradiction in terms.\n \n CONCLUSION\n \n The doctrines of creation and evolution are so strongly divergent that reconciliation is totally impossible. The theistic evolutionists attempt to integrate the two doctrines; however such syncretism reduces the message of the Bible to insignificance. The conclusion is inevitable: There is no support for theistic evolution in the Bible.",

Which puts us in the slightly awkward position of not being able to call anyone anything :)\n \n That given, I'd say the same thing to marc but in a different way:\n \n Marc, whenever someone voices concern about religion, the first thing you seem to do is check whether that person also accepts evolutionary theory. From this correlation you fallaciously assume causation. Unless you can positively link evolutionary theory with the concerns voiced, you have no grounds for slotting the speaker into your 'evolutionary atheist agenda'.\n \n When I talk about Behe, Dembski and Hovind, I do not label them as 'creationists' (poor term thought it may be) lightly. All three have publicly declared their motivations, and I.D itself can readily be linked to biblical creationism via an explicit paper trail.",

   "They have every right to do that, but it needs to kept completely in the philosophical realm. Should we let atheists add facts plus theories and get facts, and not allow religious people to do the same thing? \n\n I'm not sure what you mean by this. Surely the point of an attempt to objectively debunk religion's alleged value is that it be objective, cite facts, perform studies, apply the scientific method, rather than merely making philosophical pronouncements.\n \n For instance, the study that showed the almost global invariance of moral values regardless of religion, and also showed that children were far less likely to tolerate or approve of an <insert holy book here< description of atrocity if it was stripped of its 'holy' hallmarks - isn't that relevant information?\n \nI've seen that claim from only one other poster here before, in a similar vague way. I'd like to see some detail, explained in laymans terms, about exactly which products we have, that we would not have without theories about RM-NS evolution.\n\n Can I broaden the topic to include the rest of the Modern Synthesis, or must I talk only about applications involving RM and NS? If the latter, it's very likely parts of the computer you're using to read this were developed using RM/NS principles derived from observations of nature. When a problem is too complex to solve by design, we turn to evolutionary processes.\n \nIn a thread on these forums from two years ago, there was this thread about an expedition to find \"Tiktaalik roseae\", it appeared to be an atheist, evolutionist dream. I'd like to know what that exploration did to provide \"return on investment\" more than ID studies would. \n\n In terms of increasing our scientific knowledge about our own natural history, and robustly confirming our theories of common descent, it was a triumph. The solid kicking it gave YEC is a triumph for science over pseudoscience, not atheism over religion. It's worth making the effort to appreciate that distinction: that creationism/ID (apologies to jyoshu but I haven't had time to come up with an alternative term) is neither religion nor science, but a deceitful PR exercise whose failures should be celebrated by science and religion alike.\n \nIf you were an atheist administrator in a university, would you fire someone who thought junkets in search of Tiktaalik roseae's just might be a waste of public money?\n\n Why would I need to be an atheist specifically, and in what possible scenario would firing someone be on the cards?\n \n Most puzzling of all, though, is your utter disregard for the significance of the finding of Tiktaalik. It seems that to you, it's all about whether the decision to look for it was biased in some way, and who its discovery pleased most - what earthly relevance does that have to the find itself? It was a huge vindication of evolutionary theory, period.\n \nIf some scientists declare themselves judges of pseudoscience, other judges with equal scientific credentials (even if they're in the minority) have a right to examine the prevailing opinion of science, and make conclusions about its possibility of pseudoscience.\n\n Absolutely. But it doesn't make them automatically right, which seemed to be your implication. Anyway, I'm happy to agree that all science is and must be open to challenge, so if that's all you meant to say, we can leave it at that.\n \nAnd ID does not speak of a designer. \n\n That depends where you look :) Depending upon the audience, its advocates can be quite candid on the subject.\n \n However, that's only relevant to establishing the political/religious underpinnings of the movement, not to its status as bad science. Ironically enough, their careful omission of any specification of a designer is one thing that prevents it from being favourably compared to sciences like archaeology, as we've already discussed.\n \nIt's not insubstantial, but its not substantial enough to not be questioned.\n\n In principle, certainly - nothing should ever be held inviolate. In practice, however, a truly immense volume of evidence has accumulated in favour of - say - common descent, evidence that is routinely confirmed and reconfirmed on a daily basis by scientists applying the theory in their day-to-day work. In the judgement of pretty much all professionals in the field, the widespread and continual application of the theory is sufficient safeguard against undetected errors. Let me be clear: I'm not saying it must be true just because it's popular. Imagine you build a machine, and you test it and test it and test it and it passes every test, and then you sell millions of them and they get used every day without failing - which is the more stringent test? Clearly the latter, yes? Ask any massively multiplayer game developer.\n \n So it is with common descent and evolutionary theory. They were not formulated and then put on a pedestal to be admired, they were formulated, tested, and put to work, and that day-to-day application is far more likely to expose any inherent weakness than further bouts of 'testing'.\n \n \nThat's a tricky analogy, the one object used by a person in a crime, with all his intentions and thought processes, is far more irrelevant than origins are to evolution. \n\n I agree it's hard to find the appropriate analogy - so try this one instead: imagine I'm a member of some remote tribe living at the south pole, totally cut off from civilisation. One day I encounter a modern SUV out in the snowfields. My utter incomprehension as to its nature, purpose or origin, or that such a concept as a 'factory' even exists, would not prevent me from observing the tracks it left and surmising that it came from over there. Evolution is the journey life has been on; we've followed the tracks in the snow. Maybe we'll one day find the factory; maybe the tracks will become too faint. Doesn't matter: the evidence of the journey itself is incontrovertible.\n \nCould be easier to name one that has produced results, and has been blocked from the classroom. No matter how much they lie, the biological community is still coming to terms with Michael Behe's work.\n\n So they have to be lying in order for you to be right? Seems to happen a lot, that :)\n \n Behe's work on irreducible complexity is fundamentally flawed because it ignores proven evolutionary pathways by which IC mechanisms can form. You can download simulations of just such processes - I'll look them up for you when I get a chance. These simulations apply mutation and selection, always favouring the fittest, and flag up when IC solutions arise. \n \n How does it work? In essence, an increasingly complex solution evolves stepwise, and then evolves - again, stepwise - into a simpler and ultimately IC form. Picture a ball in a bucket, hanging somewhere high up. Behe argues that since the bottom of the bucket is solid, the ball could not have originated lower down and moved up into it, but must have been created where it is now...\n \n \nBut the fact remains that ID fails regularly to get the recognition it seeks in court case after court case.\n\n For which there are two explanations: either it's not, in fact, good science, or there's a conspiracy to suppress it which includes the judiciary. I can try and nudge you in the more plausible direction, but I can't force you.\n \n \nAs long as there is scientific uncertainty, there is going to be unscientific propaganda. I would rather see competition and debate between the propaganda of evolution and the propaganda of ID\n\n The appeal to 'fair play' is hard to ignore, isn't it? But the fact remains, evolution achieved its dual status of fact and theory through sheer hard graft and rigorous, punishing testing and peer review. Not lightly or whimsically is it foisted upon schoolchildren. I.D. wants to circumvent all that, avoid doing good science or producing results, yet claim equal scientific status.\n \n I.D is welcome in a religious or philosophical class - that is its place. It is no more appropriate for the science classroom than it is for the gym - it's simply not earned its place there.\n \nIt matters if enough people think it does. If enough people think the question of origins justifies exploration of other yet unexplored paths\n\n What's unexplored about the 'path' that says 'god did it'? I just explored the sum total of it in three words, and what did we learn? \n \n Why don't we ask the more interesting question how did god do it, and look for evidence to support our hypotheses? See, it's not about whether god exists or was involved, what you don't like is what science has to say about how it happened.\n \n \nI'm sure you do. Many times when conservatives or Christians have a good argument about something, a \"fallacy\" is made up and applied to it.\n\n It's not your christianity or conservatism that makes you vulnerable to fallacious reasoning. Fallacies are nothing more nor less than logical errors in reasoning or argument. \n \nWhen creationists get tired of hearing how detrimental religion is to society, and clearly show how Darwinist thinking harmonizes with Nazism, it's simply called \"argumentum ad Hitlerum\" and then the debate about it is over!\n\n And Hitler's frequent Christian exhortations in his speeches, his leveraging of religious fervour to incite his people, and the long-established concept of a 'favoured people' throughout the bible are just irrelevant details? :)\n \n It's an interesting topic; I'd love to discuss it in depth sometime. Rest assured, the fallacy to which you refer is not how such discussions end, it is how spurious and hysterical connections with Hitler in an effort to smear an opponent are dealt with.\n \n There is no such thing as \"argumentum ad anti-religionum\", we don't recognize that one! In 20 or 30 years, when theistic evolutionists are no longer useful for godless evolution, it will become an advantage for evolutionists to declare that NO TRUE EVOLUTIONIST COULD BELIEVE IN GOD, and the No True Scotsman fallacy will be out dated, switched off. \n\n Why? It's still a logical fallacy, because evolution does not prohibit the existence of a god.",

   "I was seeking an overall, broad definition of \n evolution,\n\n Why? Is there an overall, broad definition of the word 'might'? You presume the existence of that which you seek to prove: a definition of 'evolution' which encompasses atheism.\n \nThat's it exactly, allele frequency change doesn't go into the controversy concerning worldviews like common descent does, because common descent gets involved with questions of man not being one bit different than animals, of their being no defined time or place of original sin, no Adam and Eve, etc. \n\n Then you should have started the debate 'Common Descent is Atheistic', and I'd have won that one instead ;)\n \nIt's what makes the word evolution so slippery, when someone like myself wants to explore all the ideologies and extrapolations of evolution concerning politics, someone immediately wants to reduce it to a biological discussion only.\n\n I don't think it's unreasonable for people to want to know what they're going to be debating. You saw what happened when I went in blind - I expected you to at least start to formulate a definition in your first post, and when you didn't I had to try and cover every interpretation I could think of.\n \nwhere it was insisted that \"change in allele frequencies over time\" was the only definition acceptable in any debate with me about evolution being atheistic. The dishonesty on their part was clear. \n\n You're revising history again. You were explicitly offered evolutionary theory as an acceptable debating point in addition to the biological definition.\n \nIt works both ways! Conflating those terms, and trying to paint an innocent picture of evolution, is often the job of a politically motivated evolutionist. The proof is in my above referenced challenge thread. \n\n How is distinguishing between terms conflating them? This is nonsense.\n \nI'll concede that you've done that somewhat, and it's helping make our little discussion here interesting, don't you think? \n\n Thanks - and yes, it is. Possibly because it denies you your favourite soap-box :)\n \nNo more of a negative form than tests made by evolutionists. Evolutionists don't know what naturalistic origins look like either. And you'll tell me that evolutionists don't directly test for them. And I'll tell you that IDists don't directly test for a designer.\n\n I can see why you might think that, but you're confusing origins with history. Evolution doesn't speak to origins. I.D doesn't speak to origins either, because it talks about where life's 'information' came from while ignoring the question of where the inferred designer's 'information' came from. Rather, both speak to part of the history of life. \n \n I.D postulates a discontinuous natural history, one in which living molecules were shaped by an entity or entities unknown, with capabilities and motivations unknown. No positive test for such interference can be made, because you don't know what you're looking for. All you can do is seize upon events or formations for which no plausible naturalistic history yet exists and hope you're right.\n \n Evolutionary theory postulates a continuous natural history of life - just as all scientific theories postulate a continuous natural history of their subject, out of necessity. Hypotheses as to how a particular structure or creature formed - what its natural history was - can be positively tested.\n \n Tiktaalik was a positive test. I.D. could never have predicted the existence of that fossil: a designer of unknown capacity and motivation has no rules by which he must abide, so there was no requirement for that species to have ever lived. Evolutionary theory, on the other hand, required that species to have lived. Thus a positive prediction was made (according to our theory, we will find X if we look in Y), and confirmed.\n \n I.D's predictions are unfailingly negative: we will never find a naturalistic explanation for X.\n \nI think you're misrepresenting UPB. Whatever happens from freeze thaw cracking isn't going to result in something as complex as life, something that has so many parts that have to work together perfectly, or quickly, completely deteriorate.\n\n But that's exactly the point! I.D. doesn't work, numerically, unless you factor in your own prejudices as to what is and is not designed. You've just said as much: I shouldn't 'break' the UPB by feeding in values that make the Giant's Causeway look designed because it wasn't designed. On the other hand, it's ok to feed values into the UPB that result in life looking like it was designed, because life was designed.\n \n There's nothing in I.D. to stop me feeding in values that make the Giant's Causeway look designed other than my pre-existing knowledge of a naturalistic process that could produce them. So why shouldn't the same apply to Dembski's analysis of living structures?",

   "I&#8217;d expect them to crash and raid the party of those toasting the Millers at all the atheist celebrations of Tikaalik roseae. :)\n\n Nice :) You get the point though: where does 'considering' supernatural intervention or design get you? What do you do next? \n \n If it were some hitherto unknown natural force that was being proposed, you could devise tests to confirm your suspicions and explore its parameters. But when considering a supposed miraculous occurrence, there's no reason to believe the event can be recreated, or that variations to the initial conditions would translate into consistent variations on the output. All you can do once you've considered supernatural intervention is decide whether or not is has occurred, and the only tools at your disposal to help make that decision are naturalistic. In short you have to try and make sure that there are no naturalistic explanations.\n \n But that's exactly what you would have been doing even if you hadn't considered the supernatural: you'd still be pounding away trying to find naturalistic explanations.\n \n What it comes down to, then, is whether we should allow scientists to just decide, based on nothing more than personal preference, to stop looking and declare the case closed in favour of the supernatural. At the moment, we simply say that science doesn't yet have an answer for X - which is the literal truth. Anyone is free to take a chip at it and see if they can uncover something profound. If we alter the methodology as you propose, what authority or degree of certainty do we attach to these arbitrary cries of 'uncle'? How much value should we attach to inferences drawn from them?\n \n I can't see what value this change adds to the scientific method. All I can see are downsides, and a vast, vast increase in the potential for personal prejudice to send us down useless lines of enquiry - and no reason to ever end those lines of enquiry, since further miraculous intervention could always be invoked to plug the holes.\n \nWhy is it far more likely they&#8217;d be wrong?\n\n Extrapolation of past experience.\n \nYou&#8217;re giving me the impression that you have discarded ID only by glancing very quickly at it, without checking on even the very basics of it. \n\n Then I must apologise, for such is not the case. I have devoted considerable time to understanding its claims and arguments, particularly from a mathematical perspective - a field with which I am not unaquainted.\n \nAnd it seems like most of science has done that. It&#8217;s an imperfect human thing, not an open inquiry thing. As was pointed out in the movie Expelled, many in science want to make it appear like the thinking starts with science, and worldviews (usually atheist) result from it. But reality is that thinking starts with worldviews, and the scientific paths of study result from that.\n\n And you won't believe me if I demur, based on personal experience? I was brought up in typical Christian fashion, attended sunday school, happily accepted all the stories - I had no reason not to, after all. I didn't go to the trouble of believing them, any more than I went to the trouble of believing there was a table and four chairs in our kitchen; so far as I was concerned, that's simply what had happened. I prayed from time to time, and with complete sincerity.\n \n I won't bore you with the full story, but the upshot is that I realised I would rather appreciate what I know and what I don't know, and to what degree of certainty, and I saw no satisfaction to be found in religion. I see ignorance as an opportunity to learn, not convenient shelf-space to fill with imaginings. The shallowness and circularity of religion's supposed answers, the faulty logic and near-constant subliminal message to stop thinking and just believe were very offputting. At no point did I ever want there to be no god. But it became clear that whatever god might be, it wasn't to be found in the warped anthropological mirror of the bible or any other holy book. Emotional crutch, parasitic meme, method of mass control, catalyst of division and violent disagreement, repository of morals both sensible and silly - religion is many things to many people and none of them require the involvement of a real deity.\n \nThat&#8217;s where we have to agree to disagree. Those who represent science aren&#8217;t unbiased enough to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; often enough. They launch into their personal ideology, often in a seamless and unnoticeable fashion. \n\n Then how come you notice it? :)\n \n Seriously, though, I don't see that happening. Observer error, maybe, but I've read a lot of scientific papers without coming across it.\n \nThey do, you just don&#8217;t notice. Here are five that Dembski lists;\n 1] Lay out reliable criteria for detecting intelligence\n\n Which he has thus far failed to do, which makes the rest of his list somewhat moot.\n \nIn his detail of number 4, Dembski states; &#8220;Intelligent design continues to look for function where nonteleological approaches to evolution attribute clumsiness or incompetence.&#8221; He&#8217;s saying, and it makes perfect sense to me, that ID could continue a path of exploration that Darwinism would abandon.\n\n That's not borne out by the evidence, however. A hypothesis of non-function is readily testable - excise the relevant material and observe the result. On top of that there are methods for estimating the likely presence of unknown function based on the principles of the Modern Synthesis, eg degree of genetic conservation. I.D's blanket presumption of function is a blunt tool indeed by comparison.\n \nThe difference is that intelligent design is only now being tried whereas evolutionary biology has been thoroughly tried and found wanting.\n\n Big words, for a man stuck in the starting blocks. \n \n By 'found wanting' he is merely reiterating the god of the gaps argument. Whenever we learn something, we inevitably discover there is more to learn about. Thus what we know, and what we know we don't know, both increase as a result of scientific enquiry. That doesn't mean we're getting dumber :)\n \n \nIt&#8217;s a new kind of science. To declare that there can&#8217;t be any, that we already know of all of them, is not open inquiry, and it should be in true science.\n\n Science is a methodology. There aren't 'kinds' of it. There are different avenues of investigation, but they all apply the scientific method. That's what 'should be' in true science.\n \nBut as I said, if it can&#8217;t win in the courts, it&#8217;s a little ridiculous for non-scientist me to try to make a case for it here. But I have to wonder, does it fail in the courts ONLY because of the masterful way evolutionists constantly switch the definition of evolution around?\n\n Or maybe it's the paper trail linking creationism and I.D, its abandonment of the scientific method, and its enduring fruitlessness. You have to admit, it's at least possible.\n \nAnd aggressive, anti religion atheism in its guise as evolution is a rallying point for concerned members of some general societies.\n\n Aggressive, anti religion atheism, sure - there's certainly a dialogue to be had between the various parties. Maybe those atheists are right - I think it would be premature to give religion a free pass. But you're tilting at windmills with evolution. \n \n \nHow about; God&#8217;s record of creation displays a marvelous and clear consistency throughout.\n\n What, in both conflicting creation myths? :)\n \nFrom the symphony of the creation week in Genesis to the promise of a new heaven and new earth in Revelation, and all the fulfilled prophesy in between, and characteristics of man today. What consequences that has for your Darwinist beliefs is not my fault, or God&#8217;s fault. \n\n See? That's not the same thing I said at all. The authority of a single book does not compare to that of nature itself, and nature speaks of an evolutionary history - a long, long evolutionary history. Burn your books and I'll burn mine, and we'll see whose truth remains invariant in five thousand years ;)\n \nYou do have a lot of confidence in your 150 year old myth, in spite of all it&#8217;s gaps.\n\n That would be 'rigorously tested theory', and it's not the 150 year old version I pay attention to anyway. Do I have confidence that it's perfectly accurate? Of course not; that would be mad. Do I have confidence it's a more accurate explanation than it was ten years ago, and will be more accurate still in another decade? Absolutely. Do I have confidence that common descent is a fact? Again, absolutely.\n \nYour &#8220;same science and same results&#8221; do seem to have their ups and downs however. Your gaps have narrowed some in that 150 years, but they&#8217;ve also widened a lot in those 150 years. (complexity of life, origins) It&#8217;s part of the dispute.\n\n There's a difference between a gap widening and us getting a clearer picture of how wide it always was. The former implies a decrease in knowledge whereas the latter is an increase. And seriously, check out protocells; they're brilliant.\n \n Ok *puff puff* I'll try and get to the rest of your posts tomorrow. Take care!",

   "Danger NO. 1&#8230; Misrepresentation of the Nature of God\n \n The Bible reveals God to us as our Father in Heaven, who is absolutely perfect (Matthew 5:48), holy (Isaiah 6:3), and omnipotent (Jeremiah 32:17). The Apostle John tells us that &#8220;God is love,&#8221; &#8220;light&#8221;, and &#8220;life&#8221; (1 John 4:16; 1:5; 1:1-2). When this God creates something, His work is described as &#8220;very good&#8221; (Genesis 1:31) and &#8220;perfect&#8221; (Deuteronomy 32:4).\n\n \n So? This begs the question. Why is the on-going process of evolution not 'good'? Because species die out? God uses bad events for longer-term greater purposes all the time. The Bible indicates that \"ALL things work together for good to them that love God and are called according to His purpose.\" That includes tragedy, and it includes the fact that other species died out and now we're here.\n \n \nTheistic evolution gives a false representation of the nature of God because death and ghastliness are ascribed to the Creator as principles of creation. (Progressive creationism, likewise, allows for millions of years of death and horror before sin.)\n\n \n At some point, humankind started becoming accountable to God. You just need to get past your narrow view of how God brought human kind as we now know it into existence. The process demonstrated of Adam being created is a figurative way to represent the way humanity came about.\n \n \nDanger NO. 2&#8230; God becomes a God of the Gaps\n \n The Bible states that God is the Prime Cause of all things. &#8220;But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things&#8230; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him&#8221; (1 Corinthians 8:6).\n \n However, in theistic evolution the only workspace allotted to God is that part of nature which evolution cannot &#8220;explain&#8221;\n\n \n This is flat out not true. Just because we can explain how God did something doesn't mean God is not the one behind it. In fact, your assessment is quite the very opposite if the way theistic evolution really is. We attribute other events in nature to God all the time--there's no reason we can't attribute evolution.\n \n \nDanger NO. 3&#8230; Denial of Central Biblical Teachings\n \n The entire Bible bears witness that we are dealing with a source of truth authored by God (2 Timothy 3:16), with the Old Testament as the indispensable &#8220;ramp&#8221; leading to the New Testament, like an access road leads to a motor freeway (John 5:39). The biblical creation account should not be regarded as a myth, a parable, or an Allegory, but as a historical report, because\n\n \n Truth and literalism are not necessarily the same thing. It can be 'truth' without being a literal account of history in every way.\n \n Come on, Archie. Use your 'noggin that God gave you here, a bit. Do you really think the sun went backwards the sky during a battle (as the acct. in the Bible says)? That didn't literally happen. If it had, it would mean the earth suddenly and very quickly reversed its spin, and you can rest assured there would have been earth-wide cataclysmic effects if that had happened. Your approach seems to be to take everything the Bible says literally, and then indicate that it's only Real Truth(TM) if we take that approach. Literalism and truth are not synonymous. Heck, we KNOW some of the accounts in the Bible are figurative because Jesus told figurative stories. Who are you to say Jesus wasn't imparting Truth in his words just because they weren't literal events?\n \n \nNowhere in the Bible are there any indications that the creation account should be understood in any other way than as a factual report.\n\n \n You CAN'T 'understand' it that way and remain honest about it. As a story in and of itself, it is self-contradictory. 'Days' before the mechanism for days and nights are in place, in the story. And that self-contradicting nature should be a signal to you that God doesn't necessarily intend you to take it literally. \n \n \nThe doctrine of theistic evolution undermines this basic way of reading the Bible, as vouched for by Jesus\n\n \n It certainly undermines literalistic reading, yes, but Jesus never said you have to read it literally. That is a falsehood on your part.\n \n \nthe prophets and the Apostles. Events reported in the Bible are reduced to mythical imagery\n\n \n [Shrug] Jesus Himself used mythical imagery to teach Truth(TM). They were called parables. You're operating on the erroneous premise that using a figurative story to teach a lesson of truth is a bad thing.\n \n \nand an understanding of the message of the Bible as being true in word and meaning is lost.\n\n \n Only if you use literalism and Truth(TM) interchangeably, which, of course is a bad approach, cause by doing that you say that Jesus' own stories aren't Truth.\n \n \nDanger NO. 4&#8230; Loss of the Way for Finding God\n \n The Bible describes man as being completely ensnared by sin after Adam's fall (Romans 7:18-19). Only those persons who realize that they are sinful and lost will seek the Savior who &#8220;came to save that which was lost&#8221; (Luke 19:10).\n However, evolution knows no sin in the biblical sense of missing one's purpose (in relation to God). \n\n \n No, sin is a reality whether there was a literal piece of fruit eaten or not. People do bad things, Archie. The story of the fruit is there to teach us that there is sin, not to teach us literal dogma of how sin came about. The reality of sin doesn't disappear by understanding the Adam and Eve story figuratively. What you are missing is that the figurative story teaches about sin, by using, well ... a figurative story. Just like Jesus taught about the Kingdom of God by using figurative stories (parables).\n \n \nDanger NO. 5&#8230; The Doctrine of God's Incarnation is Undermined The incarnation of God through His Son Jesus Christ is one of the basic teachings of the Bible. The Bible states that &#8220;The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us&#8221; (John 1:14), &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8230; was made in the likeness of men&#8221; (Philippians 2:5-7).\n\n \n So Jesus came as a man. The process of how God created humankind is a separate issue. How does evolution render these passages you quote ineffective? Be specific and pertinent, please.\n \n \nDanger NO. 6&#8230; The Biblical Basis of Jesus' Work of Redemption Is Mythologized\n \n The Bible teaches that the first man's fall into sin was a real event and that this was the direct cause of sin in the world: &#8220;Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned&#8221; (Romans 5:12). Theistic evolution does not acknowledge Adam as the first man, nor that he was created directly from &#8220;the dust of the ground&#8221; by God (Genesis 2:17). Most theistic evolutionists regard the creation account as being merely a mythical tale, albeit with some spiritual significance. However, the sinner Adam and the Savior Jesus are linked together in the Bible - Romans 5:16-18. Thus any view which mythologizes Adam undermines the biblical basis of Jesus' work of redemption.\n\n \n That's the literal approach, yes. I tend to think it's more reasonable to view the passage as a way to figuratively represent the sinfulness of humankind. You're missing the forest for the trees here. \n \n \nDanger NO. 7&#8230; Loss of Biblical Chronology\n The Bible provides us with a time-scale for history and this underlies a proper understanding of the Bible. This time-scale includes: The time-scale cannot be extended indefinitely into the past, nor into the future. There is a well-defined beginning in Genesis 1:1, as well as a moment when physical time will end (Matthew 24:14).\n\n \n Sure it can. The only way it doesn't work is if you approach the creation event as lasting a real 6 days rather than a long, billions of years process.\n \n \nDanger NO. 8&#8230; Loss of Creation Concepts Certain essential creation concepts are taught in the Bible. These include: God created matter without using any available material. God created the earth first, and on the fourth day He added the moon, the solar system, our local galaxy, and all other star systems. This sequence conflicts with all ideas of &#8220;cosmic evolution,&#8221; such as the &#8220;big bang&#8221; cosmology.\n\n \n That's an emphasis you've added to the text. There's nowhere in the text that it says \"Hey, it's crucial for you to emphasize the idea that God creates out of nothing.\" There's certainly nothing in the Genesis acct saying that's some central truth that needs to be elevated. But either way, evolution doesn't address the point at which matter and energy come into existence. \n \n \nDanger NO. 9&#8230; Misrepresentation of Reality The Bible carries the seal of truth, and all its pronouncements are authoritative - whether they deal with questions of faith and salvation, daily living, or matters of scientific importance.\n\n \n This is nothing more than an example of begging the question. You say it misrepresents reality; I say it represents reality. You say potayto, I say potahto.\n \n \nDanger NO. 10&#8230; Missing the Purpose In no other historical book do we find so many and such valuable statements of purpose for man as in the Bible. For example:\n \n Man is God's purpose in creation (Genesis 1:27-28).\n Man is the purpose of God's plan of redemption (Isaiah 53:5).\n Man is the purpose of the mission of God's Son (1 John 4:9).\n We are the purpose of God's inheritance (Titus 3:7).\n Heaven is our destination (1 Peter 1:4).\n However, the very thought of purposefulness is anathema to evolutionists. &#8220;Evolutionary adaptations never follow a purposeful program, they thus can not be regarded as teleonomical.&#8221;5 Thus a belief system such as theistic evolution that marries purposefulness with non-purposefulness is a contradiction in terms.\n\n \n Evolution as a process isn't out to answer the question of purpose. It's nothing more than an observable process. It no more misses \"purpose\" observing any other natural process. And I see no reason that evolution contradicts things like \"we are God's purpose in creation\" or \"man is the purpose of the plan of redemption.\"",

   "It was early in the debate, and it was before I clarified the definitions problem, something I don&#8217;t think you expected me to do. Now that we&#8217;ve gotten beyond that in an even more clear way, we can say that when atheists joyously point towards the Catholic church and say &#8220;see, they believe in evolution&#8221; when they actually conditionally accept &#8220;change in allele frequencies over time&#8221; , not &#8220;common descent&#8221; as in no Adam and Eve, no difference between humans and animals, no original sin, no purpose, etc. that they (the atheists) aren&#8217;t being completely honest.\n\n Obviously, anyone who tries to portray the Catholic church's position as indistinguishable from that of atheists is barking up the wrong tree; no argument there. But who exactly is doing that? Certainly I never have. Nor is the Church's position on evolution what you claim it to be. Worth a read: reconciliation of polygenism (multiple first humans) with Adam and Eve, standing firm on the origin of the soul while explicitly accepting hominid evolution from lower forms, explicit criticism of I.D as non-science. These are thoughtful and dedicated theologians convinced by their study of the evidence - is it really appropriate for you to hand-wave away their pronouncements?\n \nI never accused Catholics of lying. To avoid saying something is not lying. \n\n You accused them of dissembling, of appeasment, effectively betraying their faith for the sake of a quiet life. If that doesn't strictly constitute 'lying', it's certainly no better.\n \nThe dispute between religion and evolution is more than just a matter of right and wrong. It involves worldviews, the nature of reality and the way members of a society interact with each other. I was interested in discussing the philosophy of evolution, not the mechanics of evolution. Just like the &#8220;questions for both sides&#8221; thread started out, before it got messy.\n\n I understand completely. The problem we have in engaging in such a discussion is that you seem locked into a belief that evolution is a product of a philosophy rather than a methodology. This prevents us amicably exploring the ways in which evolution can be co-opted by certain philosophies and accommodated into others, and how those philosophies interact in the wider world.\n \n \n&#8220;And won&#8221;?? At this place? You know full well that nobody but nooooooobody would have accepted a more specific resolution that I would have had a chance at winning.\n\n So you were keeping things vague to give your opponent a chance? Nice of you :)\n \nYou don&#8217;t even look with science, when it comes to some subjects. Love, hate, foundations of morality, etc.\n\n Why not? The foundations of morality are a fascinating topic. Studies show that the world over, within all communities, exists more or less the same distribution of moral compasses. Religion overlays some tribalistic 'club rules' - war paint to aid identification of like by like, ritual bonding etc - but in terms of moral influence essentially just shuffles other people into the different mental categories to which our innate morals already apply. A peaceful, inclusive religion encourages believers to treat everyone as a friend and neighbour - others might foster a degree of aloofness.\n \nWe&#8217;re not robots, we can make our choices. As I said before, it&#8217;s all been written down, and not in a science book.\n\n Well, I went down that path with Easyrider once: the innate incompatibility between freedom of choice and prophecy. Something for another time, perhaps.\n \nWell, if what I said above is true, (about the worldview coming before the science) the evolutionist is motivated to defend evolutionary because they harmonize with his personal metaphysical or ideological evolutionary views. I understand that evolutionists don&#8217;t like the word evolutionism, because it shows a relationship between the science they want to pursue, and their worldview.\n\n And if it isn't true? What if evolution is simply the product of a naturalistic methodology, not a philosophy? \n \nIt&#8217;s probably right. But politically &#8220;progressive&#8221; atheists is the right hole for most who oppose ID. It&#8217;s a hole just as deep as the one occupied by Dembski & Behe. Too many evolutionists don&#8217;t want to be pigeonholed, they want to be neutral & perfect, and have their brand of neutrality and perfection established in society &#8211; established in political decisions.\n\n I don't know where you're getting your numbers - do you? I.D - or rather its undeserved insertion into the science classroom is broadly opposed by scientists of all faiths, on entirely logical, rational grounds.\n \nAgain, you don&#8217;t show enough open inquiry about ID. I'd like for you to address the claim that ID could explore scientific paths that evolution may abandon. \n\n I believe I've done this now, in an earlier post.\n \nAre you being slippery?\n\n Um, no... we were discussing Stenger, as you freely admit: \n \nYou said his (Stengers) &#8220;views regarding the detrimental influence of religion are nothing to do with evolution and everything to do with the influence of religion&#8221;, as if evolution wasn&#8217;t a weapon.\n\n Which, by the way, is a non-sequitur. Evolution may be wielded however he likes - it doesn't make evolution responsible for his views regarding the detrimental influence of religion, which was the substance of my reply.\n \nI was referring to Stenger in a general way,\n\n My reply concerned Stenger's statements. If you don't believe they - and thus my reply - speak to the bigger picture, why post them?\n \n \n Now that I've caught up, I think we need to take a moment to regroup and focus. Based on everything that's been said, here's how I see our respective positions:\n \n You proceed from the assumption that evolution is a product of a particular 'worldview', specifically an atheist worldview. You've said as much several times, how 'the reality is' that worldview always comes first.\n \n Based on that assumption, you reason that 'evolution' must attempt to speak to origins, since atheism requires a naturalistic origin of life. Possibly you reason that since evolution is the product of atheism, its very foundation must be the naturalistic origin of life. You then observe that abiogenesis is very much in its infancy as a branch of science, and conclude that evolution is a sham: its most vital component is missing and therefore the whole glittering edifice is really nothing more than conjecture and wishful thinking. And from that you reason that its prominence in science cannot be based upon merit but instead be the result of an aggressive socio/political atheist agenda.\n \n Have I got that about right?\n \n Ok. While the reasoning you've applied to get from A to B is fine, your foundational assumption has led you astray - garbage in, garbage out. And because you refuse to question that assumption, you'll accept whatever outlandish or improbable conclusions you reach because you can't see any fault in the logic by which you arrived at them.\n \n Now let me show you a different picture, and you tell me if it fits the facts.\n \n Evolution (both the inference of common descent and evolutionary theory) is a product of methodological naturalism, the same tool willingly employed by all scientists, everywhere, of all faiths. It is the only tool we have which allows us to judge the confidence level of statements about the natural world - indeed, it is the tool one is logically compelled to use when you make that ability your primary requirement. It should not be confused with philosophical naturalism, which is a worldview.\n \n Like all widely accepted scientific discoveries evolution has weathered intense critical scrutiny, and won out on merit. Far from being a glittering abstract edifice, it is a well-worn tool employed every day by thousands of scientists. Modern biological science simply would not work if it were false. Despite its vulnerability to falsification, thanks to the sweeping predictions it makes about findings in genetics and paleontology, it remains evidentially uncontested.\n \n Evolution is not an extrapolation forward from a specific 'origin' of life, rather it is an extrapolation backward through history, informed by data from diverse scientific disciplines. The inevitable difficulty in constructing a firm picture of first life so very far after the fact does not undermine the value of its conclusions about more recent (relatively speaking) natural history.\n \n Common descent contradicts literal biblical creationism on a number of levels, from the timescales involved to the evolutionary history of humans (although it should be noted that genetics, all by itself, disproves the notion of a single couple ancestral to us all anyway). For this reason, the established fact of common descent is used by those critical of religion to undermine the foundation of infallible authority claimed by the bible (although again, it should be noted that it is far from the only fact thus employed). At the same time, several faiths have used it to inform their own interpretation of the bible.\n \n A small but vocal minority of religious believers are content neither to accommodate common descent in their beliefs nor ignore it in favour of concentrating on the spiritual, but have instead embarked upon a well-documented, tireless and progressively more sophisticated 'hearts and minds' campaign, applying political pressure to enforce the replacement of science with a theological system under which all discoveries must be filtered, reinterpreted or discarded according to their congruence with scripture. We must not be allowed to draw conclusions from our observation of the natural world if they are not in accordance with their beliefs. \n \n Initially - and somewhat clumsily - presented as Creationism or Scientific Creationism, the movement's 'wedge' was given a keener leading edge with the invention of 'Intelligent Design', a slick and well-funded operation intended to give Creationism a gloss of scientific respectability. By disavowing creationism (in public at least), presenting fallacious arguments at a level of complexity beyond the layman's ability to critically analyze, and endlessly restating the falsehood that evolution is 'a theory in crisis'* an illusion is created of genuine, widespread scientific disagreement, enabling the next stage: Teach the Controversy. To the only audience the I.D. movement cares about (ie, the general public), the scientific arguments for and against I.D are sufficiently rarified as to appear equally valid - thus the appeal to fair play and equal treatment of competing ideas is highly effective. However, the same has so far not held true in the courtroom, where I.D must live or die on its demonstrable merits rather than emotional appeal.\n \n \n Now, out of these two pictures, which one allows us to take the greatest number of people at their word? By that I mean people describing their own motivations and their own reasoning, rather than the motives they ascribe to others (which may not be a lie, merely wrong).\n \n In your version of events, only Creationists are being honest. Everyone else - theistic evolutionists, scientists, the Catholic church - all of them must either be lying or betraying their own principles.\n \n In my version of events, everyone is telling the truth about themselves. Creationists and the proponents of I.D. are being honest when they say their faith is the motivation for their work, and when they talk about their wedge strategy, its methods and goals. Scientists are being honest when they describe evolution as the product of methodological naturalism, when they say they are convinced by the evidence rather than prejudice. Judges are being honest when they throw ID's claims to scientific credentials out of court, and so on.\n \n A vast con - excuse me agenda of lies, or a few people simply being mistaken? Take your pick.\n \n * The same falsehood has been propounded for over a hundred years now, while evolutionary theory has gone from strength to strength in both explanatory and predictive power. I do not call it a lie because it need not be one - it is repeated with innocent conviction and likely arose from equally innocent conviction.",

   "You're right, of course - I'm projecting my reaction to being called an evolutionist onto others. And you're right about the term 'creationist' being equally lacking in specificity - as much a problem for you as for me, given that you actually want the creationist label to apply to you. Which puts us in the slightly awkward position of not being able to call anyone anything :)\n \n That given, I'd say the same thing to marc but in a different way:\n \n Marc, whenever someone voices concern about religion, the first thing you seem to do is check whether that person also accepts evolutionary theory. From this correlation you fallaciously assume causation. Unless you can positively link evolutionary theory with the concerns voiced, you have no grounds for slotting the speaker into your 'evolutionary atheist agenda'. \n\n \n I think I usually can positively make that link, the evidence is seldom hard to see. Don't you notice that it happens the other way also, that when someone voices concern about evolution, many posters here quickly check to see if that person is a Christian? The fallacious assumptions go both ways. Since evolutionists are in the drivers seat concerning education, their fallacious assumptions are shouted much louder. The movie \"Expelled\" made it clear. \n \n \nWhen I talk about Behe, Dembski and Hovind, I do not label them as 'creationists' (poor term thought it may be) lightly. All three have publicly declared their motivations, and I.D itself can readily be linked to biblical creationism via an explicit paper trail.\n\n \n In the same way that Dawkins, Myers, and Provine have declared their motivations? If the personal beliefs of Behe etc make ID what it is, why is it that the personal beliefs of Dawkins etc are just their personal opinion and have nothing to do with evolution? Is it because evolution has been around 150 years vs ID's only 30 or so? (that's not a sarcastic question) I'm guessing that you're going to say yes, that the 150 vs 30 years is important. Something to explore a little further, I'd say. \n \n But you're also going to say that when present day evolutionists write books saying \"How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist\" it just means the specific Judeo Christian God, not the many other possibilities of other gods. It's almost like Ben Stein reads at 4forums, because towards the end of the expelled movie, he was calmly asking Dawkins questions. (with Dawkins squirming and flashing three shades of crimson the whole time. )\n Stein; \"Do you believe in ANY god whatsoever\"? Dawkins; \"NO, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ASK ME SUCH A QUESTION, IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN ANY GOD AT ALL.\" (not a direct quote, just my paraphrase from memory) It's a switcharoo, just like evolution definitions. They rail against all religion with evolution, then when cornered, drop back to a more specific definition of just who God is.",

   "I'm not sure what you mean by this. Surely the point of an attempt to objectively debunk religion's alleged value is that it be objective, cite facts, perform studies, apply the scientific method, rather than merely making philosophical pronouncements. \n\n \n That inspires me to ask a question; Could it be that religion was requested (taunted) to \"apply the scientific method\" by atheistic scientists a few decades ago, and that ID was the result - that we have atheists to thank for ID? The Lord does move in mysterious ways? :) \n \n \nFor instance, the study that showed the almost global invariance of moral values regardless of religion, and also showed that children were far less likely to tolerate or approve of an <insert holy book here< description of atrocity if it was stripped of its 'holy' hallmarks - isn't that relevant information? \n\n \n Who did that study? I think a quick look at the news once a week would show a pretty clear variance in moral values around the world, always according to different religions, or lack of it. Whatever invariance is actually found, could probably be attributed to the fact that everyone was actually created by the same God. \n \n \nCan I broaden the topic to include the rest of the Modern Synthesis, or must I talk only about applications involving RM and NS? If the latter, it's very likely parts of the computer you're using to read this were developed using RM/NS principles derived from observations of nature. When a problem is too complex to solve by design, we turn to evolutionary processes. \n\n \n Pretty vague, seems to me you could name something specific. There is a difference between observations of nature and anti-Biblical evolution. \n \n \nIn terms of increasing our scientific knowledge about our own natural history, and robustly confirming our theories of common descent, it was a triumph. The solid kicking it gave YEC is a triumph for science over pseudoscience, not atheism over religion. It's worth making the effort to appreciate that distinction: that creationism/ID (apologies to jyoshu but I haven't had time to come up with an alternative term) is neither religion nor science, but a deceitful PR exercise whose failures should be celebrated by science and religion alike. \n\n \n Again, were not the taunts from evolutionists/atheists for religion to come up with something concerning their beloved scientific method one of the main inspirations for ID? Then when religion (beautifully) met that demand, it is called a deceitful PR exercise? \n \n I think the Tiktaalik discovery, and the irreducibly complex \"mousetrap\" thinking process of Behe, were both worthy of equal analyzation. If not equal, maybe roughly equal? Was there any similarity in the ways they were analyzed? Let's see, Tiktaalik was given a FREE PASS, the IC mousetrap thinking process was viciously attacked and shouted down. Not much similarity was there? One was one simple, one time historical claim by one small group with credentials or motives that no one seemed interested in checking or exploring, and one was a thinking process that anyone could apply, even though it inspired its originator to be personally attacked. Makes one think a little harder about applications of science vs pseudoscience. \n \n \nWhy would I need to be an atheist specifically, and in what possible scenario would firing someone be on the cards?\n \n Most puzzling of all, though, is your utter disregard for the significance of the finding of Tiktaalik. It seems that to you, it's all about whether the decision to look for it was biased in some way, and who its discovery pleased most - what earthly relevance does that have to the find itself? It was a huge vindication of evolutionary theory, period. \n\n \n If the decision to look, the personal lives of the discoverers, and the find itself was ripped into like Behe was ripped into, I'd bet a lot that it would have about as much significance as Piltdown man does by now. \n \n \nAbsolutely. But it doesn't make them automatically right, which seemed to be your implication. Anyway, I'm happy to agree that all science is and must be open to challenge, so if that's all you meant to say, we can leave it at that.\n \n That depends where you look :) Depending upon the audience, its advocates can be quite candid on the subject.\n \n However, that's only relevant to establishing the political/religious underpinnings of the movement, not to its status as bad science. Ironically enough, their careful omission of any specification of a designer is one thing that prevents it from being favourably compared to sciences like archaeology, as we've already discussed.\n \n In principle, certainly - nothing should ever be held inviolate. In practice, however, a truly immense volume of evidence has accumulated in favour of - say - common descent, evidence that is routinely confirmed and reconfirmed on a daily basis by scientists applying the theory in their day-to-day work. In the judgement of pretty much all professionals in the field, the widespread and continual application of the theory is sufficient safeguard against undetected errors. Let me be clear: I'm not saying it must be true just because it's popular. Imagine you build a machine, and you test it and test it and test it and it passes every test, and then you sell millions of them and they get used every day without failing - which is the more stringent test? Clearly the latter, yes? Ask any massively multiplayer game developer.\n \n So it is with common descent and evolutionary theory. They were not formulated and then put on a pedestal to be admired, they were formulated, tested, and put to work, and that day-to-day application is far more likely to expose any inherent weakness than further bouts of 'testing'. \n\n \n I'd like to see examples of day-to-day application of common descent, what products and services it provides. And what products and services it provides now that would be blocked from being produced if we introduced future generations to ID studies. \n \n \n \nI agree it's hard to find the appropriate analogy - so try this one instead: imagine I'm a member of some remote tribe living at the south pole, totally cut off from civilisation. One day I encounter a modern SUV out in the snowfields. My utter incomprehension as to its nature, purpose or origin, or that such a concept as a 'factory' even exists, would not prevent me from observing the tracks it left and surmising that it came from over there. Evolution is the journey life has been on; we've followed the tracks in the snow. Maybe we'll one day find the factory; maybe the tracks will become too faint. Doesn't matter: the evidence of the journey itself is incontrovertible. \n\n \n An excellent analogy! The evolutionist ONLY keeps trying to find out how it fell together from the rocks in that mountain over there, while the IDist checks it out for specified complexity and design! Only one slight fault with your analogy, the modern SUV is a mere tinker toy compared to the complexity of the human body. \n \n \nSo they have to be lying in order for you to be right? Seems to happen a lot, that :) \n\n \n That's a biggie that goes both ways. A lot of Christians would like to go to church on Sundays, maybe see the occasional 10 Commandments display during the week, and see traditional Christian morals applied to some things political. Without fights with evolutionists! It's often not Christians who are picking the fights, it seems that Christians often have to be wrong for evolution to be right. \n \n \nBehe's work on irreducible complexity is fundamentally flawed because it ignores proven evolutionary pathways by which IC mechanisms can form. You can download simulations of just such processes - I'll look them up for you when I get a chance. These simulations apply mutation and selection, always favouring the fittest, and flag up when IC solutions arise. \n \n How does it work? In essence, an increasingly complex solution evolves stepwise, and then evolves - again, stepwise - into a simpler and ultimately IC form. Picture a ball in a bucket, hanging somewhere high up. Behe argues that since the bottom of the bucket is solid, the ball could not have originated lower down and moved up into it, but must have been created where it is now...\n \n \n For which there are two explanations: either it's not, in fact, good science, or there's a conspiracy to suppress it which includes the judiciary. I can try and nudge you in the more plausible direction, but I can't force you. \n\n \n What leads me towards the conspiracy, is the manner that determined it was not good science. It was not determined by a result of a scientific method, it wasn't approached in a neutral way, it was approached in an emotional, knee jerk way. A case against it was built from a predetermined conclusion. As time went by, it was made to look convincing, as we see by what you are saying. Some of the first criticisms of it at the beginning of it were pretty funny. (\"it's not irreducibly complex - it doesn't need all of it's parts - it doesn't need the base - you can put it on the floor\") hahahaha\n \n \nThe appeal to 'fair play' is hard to ignore, isn't it? But the fact remains, evolution achieved its dual status of fact and theory through sheer hard graft and rigorous, punishing testing and peer review. Not lightly or whimsically is it foisted upon schoolchildren. I.D. wants to circumvent all that, avoid doing good science or producing results, yet claim equal scientific status. \n\n \n You're worse about conspiracies than I am. What evidence do you see that ID wants to circumvent anything? If ID gets the scientific status it seeks, why would evolutionary studies be restricted in any way? They could go forward the same way they do now, if they are as correct and non controversial as you say. I.D. would be an addition, not a replacement. \n \n \nI.D is welcome in a religious or philosophical class - that is its place. It is no more appropriate for the science classroom than it is for the gym - it's simply not earned its place there. \n\n \n Atheism hasn't earned its place there either. In a perfect world, neither would be there. But one IS. So if one is, both should be, if the members of a free society that is involved say so. \n \n \nWhat's unexplored about the 'path' that says 'god did it'? I just explored the sum total of it in three words, and what did we learn? \n \n Why don't we ask the more interesting question how did god do it, and look for evidence to support our hypotheses? See, it's not about whether god exists or was involved, what you don't like is what science has to say about how it happened. \n\n \n Part of looking for the \"how\" should consist of more than just \"random\" and \"natural\". Design can be scientific. \n \n \nIt's not your christianity or conservatism that makes you vulnerable to fallacious reasoning. Fallacies are nothing more nor less than logical errors in reasoning or argument. \n\n \n Do you think the fallacy of \"argument by personal charm\" that I linked was phony? \n \n \nAnd Hitler's frequent Christian exhortations in his speeches, his leveraging of religious fervour to incite his people, and the long-established concept of a 'favoured people' throughout the bible are just irrelevant details? :) \n\n \n No, but that doesn't end the debate. There is more to be said about it, one side shouldn't be permitted to proclaim that the other side makes a logical error, therefore it's a fallacy - end of debate. \n \n \nIt's an interesting topic; I'd love to discuss it in depth sometime. Rest assured, the fallacy to which you refer is not how such discussions end, it is how spurious and hysterical connections with Hitler in an effort to smear an opponent are dealt with. \n\n \n Like spurious and hysterical connections with Christianity? :) I'd like to discuss it in depth sometime too, but I'm getting a terrible urge to give my brain a rest from all this stuff during the summer of 08. \n \n \nWhy? It's still a logical fallacy, because evolution does not prohibit the existence of a god.\n\n \n I know, as long as it's a politically insignificant god.",

   "Why? Is there an overall, broad definition of the word 'might'? You presume the existence of that which you seek to prove: a definition of 'evolution' which encompasses atheism. \n\n \n That definition existed in the questions for both sides thread. It exists in books written by atheists. It's everywhere, in society, in education. \n \n \nThen you should have started the debate 'Common Descent is Atheistic', and I'd have won that one instead ;) \n\n \n I should have - I now see that the phrase \"common descent\" is a good way to define evolution and how it conflicts with religion. Too late now - too similar to what we already did. \n \n \nI don't think it's unreasonable for people to want to know what they're going to be debating. You saw what happened when I went in blind - I expected you to at least start to formulate a definition in your first post, and when you didn't I had to try and cover every interpretation I could think of.\n \n You're revising history again. You were explicitly offered evolutionary theory as an acceptable debating point in addition to the biological definition. \n\n \n As if any opponent wouldn't have taken \"evolutionary theory\" and zoomed right into biology and ruled everything else out. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nHow is distinguishing between terms conflating them? This is nonsense. \n\n \n Trying to draw a large distinction between two terms can be used to say that only one applies to a discussion, while the other does not. \n \n \nThanks - and yes, it is. Possibly because it denies you your favourite soap-box :) \n\n \n Not hardly - I'm standing on it quite well, thank you. \n \n \nI can see why you might think that, but you're confusing origins with history. Evolution doesn't speak to origins. I.D doesn't speak to origins either, because it talks about where life's 'information' came from while ignoring the question of where the inferred designer's 'information' came from. Rather, both speak to part of the history of life. \n \n I.D postulates a discontinuous natural history, one in which living molecules were shaped by an entity or entities unknown, with capabilities and motivations unknown. No positive test for such interference can be made, because you don't know what you're looking for. All you can do is seize upon events or formations for which no plausible naturalistic history yet exists and hope you're right.\n \n Evolutionary theory postulates a continuous natural history of life - just as all scientific theories postulate a continuous natural history of their subject, out of necessity. Hypotheses as to how a particular structure or creature formed - what its natural history was - can be positively tested.\n \n Tiktaalik was a positive test. I.D. could never have predicted the existence of that fossil: a designer of unknown capacity and motivation has no rules by which he must abide, so there was no requirement for that species to have ever lived. Evolutionary theory, on the other hand, required that species to have lived. Thus a positive prediction was made (according to our theory, we will find X if we look in Y), and confirmed. \n\n \n Why can't the same thing be said about evolution, that evolution has no requirement for anything to have been designed, even though there is a possibility that design was involved? That evolution could never test for design, even though design may be present? \n \n \nI.D's predictions are unfailingly negative: we will never find a naturalistic explanation for X. \n\n \n That's only your opinion, from your predetermined conclusion about ID. Dembski says something different, in leading up to the five goals of ID that I posted earlier, he says this;\n \n \nNo Darwinist has offered a hypothetical Darwinian production of any tightly integrated multipart adaptation with enough specificity to make the hypothesis testable even in principle. In accounting for biological complexity, evolutionary biology isn't so much a theory as a pile of promissory notes for future theories, none of which has been redeemed since the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species almost 150 years ago. [snip] For many scientists, a remarkably bad theory - even a pile of promissory notes and rationalizations - are better than nothing. Before jumping ship, scientists want a positive alternative. Intelligent Design offers just that, providing a positive design-theoretic alternative to the proposed materialist accounts of biological complexity. \n \n \n \nBut that's exactly the point! I.D. doesn't work, numerically, unless you factor in your own prejudices as to what is and is not designed. \n\n \n And evolution doesn't work unless you factor in your own prejudices that nothing could possibly be designed. \n \n \nYou've just said as much: I shouldn't 'break' the UPB by feeding in values that make the Giant's Causeway look designed because it wasn't designed. On the other hand, it's ok to feed values into the UPB that result in life looking like it was designed, because life was designed.\n \n There's nothing in I.D. to stop me feeding in values that make the Giant's Causeway look designed other than my pre-existing knowledge of a naturalistic process that could produce them. So why shouldn't the same apply to Dembski's analysis of living structures?\n\n \n And there's nothing in evolution to stop you from feeding in values that make life look random and naturalistic, because of your pre-existing worldview that naturalistic processes could produce it. You're ruling out design, without being 100% scientifically sure.",

   "Nice :) You get the point though: where does 'considering' supernatural intervention or design get you? What do you do next? \n \n If it were some hitherto unknown natural force that was being proposed, you could devise tests to confirm your suspicions and explore its parameters. But when considering a supposed miraculous occurrence, there's no reason to believe the event can be recreated, or that variations to the initial conditions would translate into consistent variations on the output. All you can do once you've considered supernatural intervention is decide whether or not is has occurred, and the only tools at your disposal to help make that decision are naturalistic. In short you have to try and make sure that there are no naturalistic explanations.\n \n But that's exactly what you would have been doing even if you hadn't considered the supernatural: you'd still be pounding away trying to find naturalistic explanations.\n \n What it comes down to, then, is whether we should allow scientists to just decide, based on nothing more than personal preference, to stop looking and declare the case closed in favour of the supernatural. At the moment, we simply say that science doesn't yet have an answer for X - which is the literal truth. Anyone is free to take a chip at it and see if they can uncover something profound. If we alter the methodology as you propose, what authority or degree of certainty do we attach to these arbitrary cries of 'uncle'? How much value should we attach to inferences drawn from them?\n\n \n I don't really propose that we \"alter\" the methodology, but that we extend it. Cries of uncle come from both sides - it is evolutionists who claim that evolution does not address origins. \n \n \nI can't see what value this change adds to the scientific method. All I can see are downsides, and a vast, vast increase in the potential for personal prejudice to send us down useless lines of enquiry - and no reason to ever end those lines of enquiry, since further miraculous intervention could always be invoked to plug the holes. \n\n \n We don't have personal prejudice sending us down useless lines of enquiry now? With books titled \"How science shows that God does not exist\"? \n \n \nThen I must apologise, for such is not the case. I have devoted considerable time to understanding its claims and arguments, particularly from a mathematical perspective - a field with which I am not unaquainted. \n\n \n That's interesting, you'll see many evolutionists attack Dembski because he's not a biologist, he's a mathematician. (UPB?) Seems like mathematics can be used for or against ID. \n \n \nAnd you won't believe me if I demur, based on personal experience? I was brought up in typical Christian fashion, attended sunday school, happily accepted all the stories - I had no reason not to, after all. I didn't go to the trouble of believing them, any more than I went to the trouble of believing there was a table and four chairs in our kitchen; so far as I was concerned, that's simply what had happened. I prayed from time to time, and with complete sincerity.\n \n I won't bore you with the full story, but the upshot is that I realised I would rather appreciate what I know and what I don't know, and to what degree of certainty, and I saw no satisfaction to be found in religion. I see ignorance as an opportunity to learn, not convenient shelf-space to fill with imaginings. The shallowness and circularity of religion's supposed answers, the faulty logic and near-constant subliminal message to stop thinking and just believe were very offputting. At no point did I ever want there to be no god. But it became clear that whatever god might be, it wasn't to be found in the warped anthropological mirror of the bible or any other holy book. Emotional crutch, parasitic meme, method of mass control, catalyst of division and violent disagreement, repository of morals both sensible and silly - religion is many things to many people and none of them require the involvement of a real deity. \n\n \n Your story is not unlike that of Francis Crick and I'm sure, millions of other people all around the world. The reverse has also happened, though I'm sure to a much lesser extent. When you refer to the \"shallowness and circularity\", I'm sure those who have experienced it in the reverse do the same thing you do. I think you may see shallowness and circularity in the presentation of religion to you by imperfect humans, not shallowness and circularity in Christianity itself. In the same way, those who have experienced the reverse, those who grew up without a Christian upbringing and became Christian, may have seen shallowness and circularity not in science itself, but in those imperfect humans (some scientists) who have presented it to them. \n \n \n \nWhich he has thus far failed to do, which makes the rest of his list somewhat moot. \n\n \n Only if your worldview causes you to quickly rule out his two main points, one positive and one negative, the positive one is the criterion of specified complexity, and the negative one is the complete failure of naturalistic attempts to explain certain types of biological complexity. Cries of uncle, or give atheists more time, isn't acceptable to everyone.\n \n \nThat's not borne out by the evidence, however. A hypothesis of non-function is readily testable - excise the relevant material and observe the result. On top of that there are methods for estimating the likely presence of unknown function based on the principles of the Modern Synthesis, eg degree of genetic conservation. I.D's blanket presumption of function is a blunt tool indeed by comparison. \n\n \n I'd like to see a debate on that, between someone like Behe and Dawkins. I get the idea that most evolutionists would not like to see that debate. \n \n \nBig words, for a man stuck in the starting blocks. \n\n \n 150 years to 30 years? Is it really that significant? \n \n \nBy 'found wanting' he is merely reiterating the god of the gaps argument. \n\n \n And it's a good argument, despite the clanging of the oh-so-subjective fallacy bell. \n \n \nWhenever we learn something, we inevitably discover there is more to learn about. Thus what we know, and what we know we don't know, both increase as a result of scientific enquiry. That doesn't mean we're getting dumber :) \n\n \n I agree, then what is wrong with saying that we have learned so much from biology, and therefore we have much more to learn about, including the possibility of intelligent design? \n \n \nScience is a methodology. There aren't 'kinds' of it. There are different avenues of investigation, but they all apply the scientific method. That's what 'should be' in true science. \n\n \n Well then, ID is a new avenue of science. \n \n \nOr maybe it's the paper trail linking creationism and I.D, its abandonment of the scientific method, and its enduring fruitlessness. You have to admit, it's at least possible. \n\n \n Sure, it's possible. But the paper trail linking atheism and evolution, with an equal abandonment of some scientific avenues is equally possible, and can be a serious problem. \n \n \nAggressive, anti religion atheism, sure - there's certainly a dialogue to be had between the various parties. Maybe those atheists are right - I think it would be premature to give religion a free pass. But you're tilting at windmills with evolution. \n\n \n And maybe religious people are right, maybe the recent spate of anti religion books by respected scientists show that we've been premature to give evolution a free pass. Maybe it's clear that not all atheists agree with you, that there is no dialog to be had. Therefore it's necessary to sometimes discriminate against religion in academia, as the movie Expelled clearly showed. \n \n \nWhat, in both conflicting creation myths? :) \n\n \n That's another debate, they don't conflict. \n \n \nSee? That's not the same thing I said at all. The authority of a single book does not compare to that of nature itself, and nature speaks of an evolutionary history - a long, long evolutionary history. Burn your books and I'll burn mine, and we'll see whose truth remains invariant in five thousand years ;) \n\n \n You've got that 150 year to 30 year head start, a burning of the books and an equal start for both may not turn out as well for you as you might think. I think Darwin's \"facts\" and musings would look a lot different if he'd have known about the biological complexity that we know about today. \n \n \nThat would be 'rigorously tested theory', and it's not the 150 year old version I pay attention to anyway. Do I have confidence that it's perfectly accurate? Of course not; that would be mad. Do I have confidence it's a more accurate explanation than it was ten years ago, and will be more accurate still in another decade? Absolutely. Do I have confidence that common descent is a fact? Again, absolutely.\n \n There's a difference between a gap widening and us getting a clearer picture of how wide it always was. The former implies a decrease in knowledge whereas the latter is an increase. And seriously, check out protocells; they're brilliant. \n\n \n Your opinions are noted. I will check out your protocells when I get time. \n \n \nOk *puff puff* I'll try and get to the rest of your posts tomorrow. Take care!\n\n \n I don't have much more time today, and am just about done till next weekend. Go easy on me this week! emoticon_xbouncer",

   "In the same way that Dawkins, Myers, and Provine have declared their motivations? If the personal beliefs of Behe etc make ID what it is, why is it that the personal beliefs of Dawkins etc are just their personal opinion and have nothing to do with evolution?\n\n As I've already said, ID is what it is - bad science - regardless of motivation. Its purpose - explicitly stated in the Wedge document - is the promotion of religion. I don't dismiss the work of scientists who happen to be Christian if it's good science.\n \nBut you're also going to say that when present day evolutionists write books saying \"How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist\" it just means the specific Judeo Christian God, not the many other possibilities of other gods.\n\n Do you have any evidence that I'm wrong?\n \nThat inspires me to ask a question; Could it be that religion was requested (taunted) to \"apply the scientific method\" by atheistic scientists a few decades ago, and that ID was the result - that we have atheists to thank for ID? The Lord does move in mysterious ways? :)\n\n It's a fun story, but one destined for the 'fiction' aisle. ID is part of a drive dedicated to supplanting the scientific method, not using it.\n \nWho did that study? I think a quick look at the news once a week would show a pretty clear variance in moral values around the world, always according to different religions, or lack of it.\n\n I didn't say moral values were invariant, I said you find the same spectrum of moral values in every society, regardless of religion. I also said that different religions teach followers to place non-believers in different mental categories - categories we all possess and to which we apply different moral rules of thumb. \n \nWhatever invariance is actually found, could probably be attributed to the fact that everyone was actually created by the same God.\n\n If you like, though there's no real need.\n \nPretty vague, seems to me you could name something specific. There is a difference between observations of nature and anti-Biblical evolution.\n\n By all means, do your own research. The mantra that undirected change plus success-based filtering cannot yield increased complexity or fitter forms is contradicted both mathematically and empirically.\n \nI think the Tiktaalik discovery, and the irreducibly complex \"mousetrap\" thinking process of Behe, were both worthy of equal analyzation. If not equal, maybe roughly equal? Was there any similarity in the ways they were analyzed? Let's see, Tiktaalik was given a FREE PASS,\n\n In what sense? Are you saying there was no attempt to establish its age, or that its features were ignored when deciding whether it fit the predictions? In what sense is the rigorous testing and peer-review the Tiktaalik discovery underwent a 'free pass'?\n \nthe IC mousetrap thinking process was viciously attacked and shouted down.\n\n Its faulty reasoning was logically refuted; it's not even particularly hard. I've done it myself, here - a refutation which neither you nor Behe has any reply to. Maybe you ought to defer evidence-free speculation about what might be the case re Tiktaalik until you can make some inroads into the simple, straightforward logic that says Behe is wrong.\n \nI'd like to see examples of day-to-day application of common descent, what products and services it provides.\n\n Easy: animal organ transplants.\n \nAn excellent analogy! The evolutionist ONLY keeps trying to find out how it fell together from the rocks in that mountain over there, while the IDist checks it out for specified complexity and design!\n\n Following the tracks of a vehicle to discover its route does not entail any particular belief about how said vehicle came to be in the first place. Nice try, but no cigar.\n \nIt's often not Christians who are picking the fights, it seems that Christians often have to be wrong for evolution to be right.\n\n Wrong is not the same as lying. In your version of events, many thousands of people have to be consciously lying. In mine, many thousands of people - pretty much all of them unacquainted with all the available facts - merely have to be wrong. Ignorance can lead to being wrong - stop the presses! :) \n \nWhat leads me towards the conspiracy, is the manner that determined it was not good science. It was not determined by a result of a scientific method, it wasn't approached in a neutral way, it was approached in an emotional, knee jerk way.\n\n Like the step-by-step refutations I've presented, and you've ignored?\n \nYou're worse about conspiracies than I am. What evidence do you see that ID wants to circumvent anything? If ID gets the scientific status it seeks, why would evolutionary studies be restricted in any way? They could go forward the same way they do now, if they are as correct and non controversial as you say. I.D. would be an addition, not a replacement.\n\n Check out the Wedge document. The explicit agenda is the replacement of the scientific method with a theological system. I.D. doesn't want scientific status, it wants 'science' to be redefined so that it qualifies.\n \nAtheism hasn't earned its place there either. \n\n Total non-sequitur. I.D is excluded because it employs an unscientific methodology. Atheism is neither included nor excluded, because it's a philosophy not a methodology.\n \nPart of looking for the \"how\" should consist of more than just \"random\" and \"natural\". Design can be scientific.\n\n And just as soon as that's been demonstrated, we can move ahead with it.\n \nDo you think the fallacy of \"argument by personal charm\" that I linked was phony?\n\n No, I think it fits my definition perfectly: flawed reasoning smuggled in under the radar by an affable or charming proponent.\n \nThat definition existed in the questions for both sides thread. It exists in books written by atheists. It's everywhere, in society, in education.\n\n And yet you can't give a single example. Books written by atheists mentioning evolution don't help you; I can produce books and scientific papers written by Christians who mention evolution. \n \nAs if any opponent wouldn't have taken \"evolutionary theory\" and zoomed right into biology and ruled everything else out.\n\n Nevertheless, it is a broader topic than changes in allele frequency. You claimed the latter was the only topic anyone in the thread would countenance - you were wrong.\n \nWhy can't the same thing be said about evolution, that evolution has no requirement for anything to have been designed, even though there is a possibility that design was involved? That evolution could never test for design, even though design may be present? \n\n It's not about what evolution can test, it's about what science can test. Science can and does test naturalistic theories - it cannot test supernatural ones.\n \n However, you've cottoned on to an important point. Evolutionary theory predicted Tiktaalik - the existence of such a species was an evolutionary requirement. That prediction was very specific and positively testable. I.D. predicts the existence of design - but it cannot test for it.\n \nThat's only your opinion, from your predetermined conclusion about ID. Dembski says something different, in leading up to the five goals of ID that I posted earlier, he says this;\n\n And he is wrong - mathematically and logically wrong. That's not a matter of opinion. I've shown as much here with the Giant's Causeway example - feed that into his equations and they detect design. Only your pre-existing knowledge that the Causeway was not designed prevents the system yielding a false positive. What possible use is a 'scientific test' when you have to know the result you want in order to get it?\n \nAnd evolution doesn't work unless you factor in your own prejudices that nothing could possibly be designed.\n\n Nope. If a theory explains something in terms of the natural and known, it remains a viable explanation regardless of whether you speculate it could have been accomplished via supernatural intervention instead. And the more you test that theory, the less appealing the competing supernatural explanation becomes, because now it must be supernatural intevention masquerading as natural causes.\n \nAnd there's nothing in evolution to stop you from feeding in values that make life look random and naturalistic, because of your pre-existing worldview that naturalistic processes could produce it. You're ruling out design, without being 100% scientifically sure.\n\n Nobody rules out design. Any random rock on a beach could be designed. All we can do is see if natural processes - a simpler explanation - will suffice.\n \nI don't really propose that we \"alter\" the methodology, but that we extend it. Cries of uncle come from both sides - it is evolutionists who claim that evolution does not address origins.\n\n That's not a cry of 'uncle', it's simple demarkation. Evolution doesn't speak to origins. Studies of abiogenesis do. \n \nWe don't have personal prejudice sending us down useless lines of enquiry now? \n\n Strawman. I merely said such influence would be drastically increased.\n \nThat's interesting, you'll see many evolutionists attack Dembski because he's not a biologist, he's a mathematician. (UPB?) Seems like mathematics can be used for or against ID. \n\n If they can be used in support of ID, it hasn't happened yet. \n \n Dembski's lack of qualifications as a biologist are relevant for the exact reason I've been hammering home all along: in terms of 'specified complexity' and the UPB, garbage in, garbage out applies. Knowledge of the naturalistic systems contributing to a given phenomenon is vital to avoid yielding a false positive (Giant's Causeway).\n \nOnly if your worldview causes you to quickly rule out his two main points, one positive and one negative, the positive one is the criterion of specified complexity,\n\n If you think it's a positive test, you need to read it again more carefully - or better yet read one of the comprehensive debunkings of Dembski's work.\n \n Imagine you sit in a room and watch a light to see if it comes on. If and when the light comes on, you declare the test successful. There's no time limit, no point at which you say 'ok, the light isn't coming on' - that's a positive test, right? Now imagine the wires from the bulb leading into another room where someone is trying to figure out complex problems. If he succeeds, he simply fills in the answer and lays the paper aside. If he gets stuck, he presses the button that illuminates the bulb in your room.\n \n Your 'positive test' is dependent upon the failure of the person trying to solve the problems. Thus while it is a positive test of something (the incompetence or ignorance of the person working on the problem) it is not a positive test of whether the problems themselves are soluble.\n \n In the case in point, Dembski is watching the bulb and Behe is pressing the button. Behe declared something to be IC, wrongly reasoned it therefore could not have evolved, and presses the button. Dembski says 'Aha, here's something I'm told could not have evolved - so I'll calculate the odds of it coming together as a whole entirely at random - hey presto it exceeds the UPB, therefore design. \n \n Dembski's test positively demonstrates Behe's inability to conceive of an evolutionary pathway to haemoglobin, but it does not demonstrate that no such pathway exists.\n \nWell then, ID is a new avenue of science.\n\n Not until it applies the scientific method it isn't.\n \nThat's another debate, they don't conflict.\n\n Mmm. No doubt I'm reading them wrong.\n \nYou've got that 150 year to 30 year head start, a burning of the books and an equal start for both may not turn out as well for you as you might think. I think Darwin's \"facts\" and musings would look a lot different if he'd have known about the biological complexity that we know about today.\n\n Yep, they would probably have been closer to our modern synthesis. Everything we have discovered has only strengthened the case for common descent - Darwin managed to infer it without any knowledge of genetics.",
