   "The Chinese have a great point, just as the protestors in Seoul do. The revision of Japan's history textbooks is unjustifiable and inexcusable. The misery that the Japanese army wrought on the Chinese during the last world war was unparalleled in its savagery. Anger is not only justified, it's called for.\n \n Attacking Japanese restaurants in China, however, and terrorizing the Chinese workers there is not the best way to deal with the issue. In fact, if I had to think of a more immature and ineffective way to deal with it, I'd be hard pressed.",

   "nowadays some people says that we should prepare for another war with Japan, and some call those who attack the Japanese embassy or Japanese restaurants patriots. i could not agree with them.\n \n yes, we all know that Japanese militarists always have a phantasy of ruling the whold world. and what they did in the world war II really brought a lot of damage to asian people. we should be care of their careerism.\n \n but after the world war II, most of the Japanese people want to develope the econmic first, those miltarists have been searching a reasonable excuse to develope Japan's army for a long time. if we now attack them, or do something reasonless else, those miltarists will be very happy to get what they want.\n \n Japan 's miltary power is stonger than China now, but our economic developing speed is mush more faster than Japan, so what we should do now is to try our best to make China stronger and stronger, and do not give those miltarists any pretense.",

   "As the war-time allies with Japan, Germany takes completely different attitude toward his atrocities committed during the World War Two. German leaders have for more once stated their apology to the war victims. Maybe they have political reasons behind these remarks. But at least their apologies sound sincere and several celebrations have been held in Germany to celebrate the liberation of concentration camps. As a close neighbor, we sincerely hope Japan will confess the war crimes it has committed. Only through this, can it be forgiven by its neighbors.",

   "Why didn't you put this all as one post instead of breaking it into 4?\n \n As for the rest, i agree with you. Japan and china need to work out such things. It would certainly be to Japans interest, since considering chinas economic growth, the size of their population, and the fact that it will not be long before the US is too short of money to be marauding off all over the world to defend even our allies, it owuld seem that Japan and China are destined to share power in Asia, and japan will get to essentially \"share\" what ever china gives them.",
