The reasoning aspect got us this far, to guns and cities and civilizations, but our base drivings have not changed, we still want food, shelter, and to make children (as so perfectly said by \"Philosopher\"). We share all our base motivations with wolfs, elephants, moose, monkeys, etc., but the thing that changes us and makes us \"superior\" is our ability to create startigized formula on how to acheieved our base goals I.E. food, shelter and making kids. \n \n We are not sentient, we are not brilliant. We are simply planning apes. It is really comforting to think of ourselves as better then our fellow animals, that we are somehow gifted with sentient thought, but we are not. The majority of what we do with our lives can usally fall into one of three catagories. The need to continue or better the species, the need for self-preservation and the need for command of the social higher-archy (alpha's), or to be a memeber of it, and to be accepted by it (beta's). Try to think of something you do that dosen't fit into one of these three. In case you were wondering, \"blushing\" falls into the last catagory. \n \n \n In summary, the big diffrence between us and apes is that we stand on 2 feet all the time, and that we can plan longer-term then any other animal on this planet. (the main reason we are afraid of death)\n \n P.S. Philosopher, all social animals, excluding drone societies, have at least a basic understanding of the whole cause and effect thing. Gorilla's undertand if they anger the silverback, they are going to get beat up. They understand like we do, if I do this act, I will get this response, and they have to make a choice as to if the response they get will be unfavourable or favourable. A.k.a Good or Bad. Also, only drone societies act soully on instinct, most other animals in the world have varying degrees of freewill as to what they do. \n \n Example-\n Some dogs can live peacefully with cats, and some dogs can't be put within 2 miles of anything remotely looking like a cat. Instincts are universial to a species, until the species mutates or branches off. So how can our two example dogs (both coming from the same mother) have such a varying degree of opinion over the subject of cats if they do not have atleast basic freewill?",

   "Why is it neasescry to continue the species\n \n Any speices that does not want to live, won't live long. So when one animal came along that had a fear of death programed into its base mind, said animal was able to produce offspring more efficently then the other animal that didn't care about death, and didn't mind starving to death. The same goes for when one species has the urge to continue it self agiasnt on species that dosen't care either way. Obiously the species that did care would have a better chance then speices that didn't care. So here today are only the speices that did care about keeping the species alive, or their speices would be extinct. \n \n \n \n Another reason death happens (genetic sense)-\n \n The first is the haymlick limit. This is the thing that cells are only programmed to copy themselves 50 times. This was built in because everytime a cell divides, a bit of the DNA strand gets lost at the tips of the strand, and if the cell kept dividing the DNA would lose more and more bits, until it made no sense at all. The haymlick limit prevents cells from falling apart because of rickity DNA strands (cancer is actually when our cells produce something to fill in the little bits of missing DNA, allowing them to break the haymlick limit and multiply out of control!). Now, a cell that can replicate itself 50 times and then has to stop may seem something unrelated to mortality, but it is not. If only 1,000,000 new bone cells are made, and each of those cells can only replicate itself 50 times, it may seem like more then enough cells, but in this senerio in the time it took for the 1,000,000 + bone cells to be produced, we, lets say lost 2,000,000. That is why we fade away when we grow old, the gap between number of new cells needed and number produced just gets larger and larger. \n \n \n \n Why it is good to not live to be 600 years old-\n \n The second reason is it won't be much of a life. The average human loses\n about 25% of thier brain cells in a lifetime.

I am not going to buy the \"caring about death is why death exists\" argument. Simply doesn't fit with the data.\n \n However, you are not grasping the question. You say that the limit is built in. Why does there have to be a limit. Why could cells and neurons and brain cells etc go on forever. That would seem to indicate evolution. That brain cells were actually beginning to replicate. \n \n You only show that the law of entropy is in full force in living systems. That things get worse over time not better. Natural selection does not negate the law of entropy but is supported by it. However, it makes no logical sense that natural selection had to develop that way.

(Growing maggots for a living is hardly enjoyable). I was trying to use conditioned taste aversion. To do this (in rats) one introduces a novel flavor and then makes the animal sick. (Ever eat something new and get sick right after and then not be able to eat that ever again. I had that experience with Pepto Bismol. Puking pink is no fun.) To do this in flies one needs to make them hungry, how? You fly them. Put them on a record player tied to a string and they fly to exhaustion. You then give them water and sugar water choice. They take the sugar water rapidly. You then make them sick. This is where I got stuck. I couldn't find a way to make a fly sick that didn't kill them. I tried Nicotine in extremely miniscule amounts (approximately 1 part per trillion), I tried spinning them in a centrifuge at 2000 RPMs, and a few other things. It either killed them (the nicotine) or did nothing. \n \n My point being that while animals know some things instinctually, (fight or flight) humans have overcome instinct. We can way lay the fight or flight response. This is the reason for military training. Chimps won't do this. Chimps, when confronted with an obvious agressor WILL backdown if they are losing and see it. Human's have trained that out of themselves. \n \n This is why I asked for the death information. Humans will willingly sacrifice themselves, even needlessly. This is only seen in the protection of the young. True suicide is not seen in the animal kingdom. Whales, may beach themselves, but the cause is unknown. To say they want to die, is a huge stretch.\n \n Humans, have become more than self aware. We are others aware.",

For a long time it has been suggested (about as long as evolution has been a theory) that is the pinacle of intelligence. We see this even in Start Trek episodes. Self awareness is important. However, Self Centeredness is what animals are about. They are about their own survival. Sacrifice for others is not really observed aside from a mother and her young. They have been observed to work together to preserve the herd, (or other appropriate name for the group) but it has never been observed that they will sacrifice for those they don't know.

They don't know us and yet hundreds have sacrificed in Iraq for us. \n \n Not meaning to throw the bible at you but The book of romans says that most won't die for a good man, although for a good man some might even die.

   "Difference between humans/apes.\n \n We have American Idol?\n \n Seriously thought, not a lot. Someone said apes live off instinct and we don't...I'd have to disagree. I'd argue that all of us live most of our lives instinctually, and that you make fewer decisions based on abstract thinking than you do in instinctually motivated thinking. I'm here posting because I find it therapeutic to share and discuss..i.e. rewarding. I have a job because it feels good to have food/shelter/status. I eat and drink because I get \"punished\" if I don't, same goes for using the bathroom. I don't have a job in sales because I find sales to be uncomfortable...punishment, so I avoid it. However if there were enough reward it in, I might consider it. I.e. if the reward outweighed the punishment. So no, I don't find that most of my life decisions are based on some status of being \"human, the most evolved of all earth's creatures.\" We're not so different. Many people fear that or are uncomfortable with the notion..but so what. Reason isn't here to be liked or loved or accepted. However, we, and most socials animals, conform to the need for a hierarchy, dominance, instinctually separating ourselves from those of a lower hierarchy, etc. Animals? Hah, we are humans..superior..yadyada. Seriously, think hard about every action/decisions you make or have made..what motivated it? Pleasure/pain. Don't feel bad though, it's how you got here! Plus you still have American Idol!! Seriously though, that doesn't make life any less special. Actually, nothing CAN be more special than your life so don't worry about it (by definition).\n \n Epaphras asked another good question: Are humans the pinnacle/end of the evolutionary chain? What's next?\n \n Not necessarily the pinnacle of evolution, however I think it's probable that one of three things will occur now that our civilization has become fairly secure and allows a lot of abstract thinking:\n \n 1. Technology develops faster than our ability to responsibly use/control it resulting in a planet of the apes type scenario (end of civilization. but not the apes ruling thing...that's just possible, not probable.)\n 2. We learn enough to know that we don't want to keep progressing and find some equilibrium and stay there (unlikely given our instincts).\n 3. We either find a way to prolong life indefinitely, transfer consciousness, or (and/or) develop thinking machines/organisms that develop far beyond our capabilities and start a new era of life (through us or on their own), that is completely independent of the genetic evolution. Personally, I think we should all be working diligently towards #3 so we can make sure the other more likely #1 doesn't happen before we erase ourselves from existence. Besides, wouldn't it be interesting to free yourself from the randomness of the human condition? Sadly, not in our lifetime :) But place another stone for our children..one day we'll reach the top.\n \n I think the next biggest leap in evolutionary life will either be constructed by humans, or constructed by something that humans construct. That is of course if we don't count Sea Monkeys as the next step in evolution...I think they have nobility and thus a social system, at least they show a King Sea Monkey with a crown on the packaging...\n \n -mach",

   "sorry, jumping in here \n \n someone made a comment about insects not being able to learn\n \n bzz bzz honey bees!\n they scout out nectar, build a mental map (with their 800,000 brain cells) and remember where certain sources of nectar are, they then fly back and communicate to the other bees where the nectar sources are, or at least the general direction\n \n Menzel, R. (1990). Learning, memory and congnition in honey bees. In: Neurobiology of Comparative Cognition (Kesner, R.P. and Olten, D.S., eds.).

Learning and memory in honey bees: from behavior to neural substrates. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 19: 379-404.\n \n Here is the abstract from the last paper:\n Learning and memory in honeybees is analyzed on five levels, using a topdown\n approach. (a) Observatory learning is applied during navigation and dance communication. (6) Local cues at the feeding site are learned associatively. (c) Classical conditioning of the proboscis extension response to olfactory stimuli provides insight into behavioral, neural, and neuropharmacological mechanisms of associative learning. (d) At the neural level, the pathways coding the conditioned and the unconditioned stimulus are identified. The reinforcing function of the unconditioned stimulus is traced to a particular neuron. (e) At the cellular level, the CAMP pathway is found to be critically involved. Nitric oxide is an essential mediator for the transfer from short- to long-term memory.\n \n Anyway, this topic is not philosphy. Maybe it was 200 years ago, but now it's science.",

   "I agree with Draconis in that humans simply operate on a higher level of instinctual behavior. That fact that we don't live in a dog eat dog society is because all humans prefer to live. It was more beneficial to the human race if humans lived together in packs, much as lions do. It is a sort of \"I'll scratch your back, you can scratch mine\" kinda thing. However, a human is no lion. Humans are by far one of the more physically weaker species on the planet. For this reason, the larger the pack of humans, the greater the chances of survival.\n \n Now, for this pack to survive, a few things are needed. First, what can members of the pack do to each other? This is where the issue of morals can be brought up. Each pack of humans needs to decide what is acceptable and what is not. The actions that are acceptable are those that are not harmful to the well being of the pack. This is how \"morals\" came into being. Society defines an act to be moral if it benefits society as a whole. Murder, for instance, is considered an immoral act. Murder weakens the chance for the entire pack to survive. And why must the entire pack survive? Because humans cannot live on their own. \n \n \nRelient Halo: My belief is that man goes beyond just the physical and has another foot in the spiritual (meaning greater existence, not religion). The difference is, we ask why naturally. Apes ask why, but only when prompted. Such an example would be why the original poster thought of starting this thread.\n\n \n First off, the reason man developed a sense of greater existance relates back to the instictual behavior of survival. But what, you may ask, does religion have to do with behavior? Well, humans had figured out, for the most part, to survive in the real world. But, for some reason, humans died anyways. No matter what they did, no matter how healthy, the human would die regardless. This wasn't looking all that great in the eyes of the \"survival-a-mentalist\". Therefore, the logical path was to insure a type of survival after death. Thus the spiritual. It is much easier to say, \"when i die, i will still live spiritually\" than to say, \"no matter what i do, i will die\". Therefore religion.\n \n Ok, time to backtrack to what else a pack of humans need to survive. In order for the unit to work as a whole, the humans need a common goal, and a common plan to achieve the goal. Let's say a human sees a baffalo. Human wants buffalo. However, so does the pack. Instead of fighting, an agreement is reached to share the baffalo to ensure complete survival. Therefore, a plan must be devised as to how to kill and share the buffalo. Many humans have, through trial and error, deduced (as do monkeys and dogs and other animals) that the best way to kill a baffalo is to, let us pretend, sneak up on it and jump it. However, to jump a baffalo, all the humans must jump it at once. Therefore a leader must be chosen. This is the second need of humans. A leader. Because of the basic animalistic instinct of survival, humans have developed close in-pack relationships, well defined morals as to how to behave within the society, and leadership.\n \n Ok, im done with that, but there is something else i would like to address. Many people say that we possess higher cognative skills, and that is what defines a human from an ape. But, cognitive skills are simply the result of a need for survival. All inventions are created to make life easier, to make survival easier. Just as we use tools to lessen our work, monkeys (or chimps, i can never remember which one) use tools to lessen their work. Its just that we are a lot damn lazier, so we need better tools.\n \n You see, no matter what you may think humans have that animals don't, the \"special human characteristic\" is simply and organized, long-term (i think someone else used this word) approach to living. Humans recognize the increase in survival if they worked together. Morals, religion, \"higher cognative skills\", these are just complex paths to ensure survival.\n \n I also place a challenge as that no one here can describe a human characteristic that cannot be linked back to basic instinctual survival.",

   "Wow, finally someone came to the philosophy section. I posted this on the creation vs. evolution thread as well just to get a bite.\n \n I will ask a similar question, How is religion instinctual? Are we the culmination of evolution, if not, what is the next level? Is the planet of the apes possible?\n\n \n I think that everyone is missing the point here. First of all, technically what seperates humans from every other species (apes, birds, dogs, etc.) is our ability to understand abstract concepts, i.e. death. This can be attributed to our large cerebral cortex in our brain, which is where all of our higher information processing occurs. This is why we humans can understand calculus; whereas apes will never be able to comprehend this concept. Furthermore, animals cannot fully comprehend death. For example, a deer that runs into the middle of the road because it is attracted to a car's headlights can comprehend the pain and can actually fear being hurt, but it cannot comprehend the end that is death. This is not true for humans, and is one of our distinguishing features. Thus, can religion essentialy be attributed to human instinct? By this I mean can religion be considered a human instinct that is wired in our brain to compensate for this end we have no tangible answer for? Furthermore, if it is in fact instinctual, is it instinctual for a reason? Did God, or some higher being program us with this instinct to seperate us from animals, and in turn give us the ability to act upon this instinct or to deny it all together? Is this the reason why we have a soul, or why we can go to Heaven (based upon one's own beliefs), or is this just an instict which human's have created in order to make sense of a perceived end which has no tangible answer? Any feedback or thoughts would be great, because I'm currently researching this topic.",
