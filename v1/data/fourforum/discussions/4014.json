It is a lifestyle...an identity. And I don't think most gays are looking to judge the anti-gay community on their stance...they are looking for the time when they will not be judged for their views...just like heterosexuals are not judged for being straight.\n \n \nSo my advice to the gay lobby: get some tolerance.

Before leveling that charge, check out the whole of their life and message.\n\n \n What started all of this anyway? Is there some gay movement that I am not aware of that threw a huge party when they learned of his death? As someone who supports gay rights...his views on the subject were disgusting and worthy of the term \"bigot\". His views on helping drug addicted people, the poor, and many others were commendable.",

I suppose those groups dedicated to Christian rights won't focus on my single issue against Christianity. After all, I'm not a bigot, just as long as we are not dealing with Christianity. Even then I am not a bigot, because it's just Christianity we are talking about. It's only a chosen lifestyle, so it doesn't effect real people when I preach a bias against Christianity.

He was a christian minister...and despite what the catholic priests do to little boys, I think they are mostly good people. He was a humanitarian, working for many different charities.

   "To me, this is the crux of the issue, and the reason I brought it up. The overall issue here is whether or not someone should be labeled and judged overall based on their sentiments toward homosexuality.\n\n \n Yeah, Hitler should not be labeled and judged as anti-semetic based on his sentiments towards jews. I mean really...look at all the good things he did too. He revitalized the German economy after WWI, he brought a fragmented nation together, he brought German patriotism to an all-time high, he put food on German tables, and he expelled a government that had been oppresive to the German people for far too long. Doesn't the good he did outweigh his anti-semetic tendencies? \n \n I understand that White is not Hitler, not even close. White did not shove people into train cars, and then exterminate them in showers/ovens. But it is the principle of the thing. Oppresion is still oppresion, regardless of who it is against, or how fervently you speak about it. I have friends that I grew up with that hate black people. They are generally good people who care about family, and do good for themselves and the community at large. They don't speak at rallies against blacks, they don't march with white hoods on, they never hung anyone from a tree, and they don't burn down churches. But nothing will change the fact that they are bigots. \n \n \n \n \nI suspect that White was more concerned about homosexuality itself rather than \"gays.\" But I sometimes hear and read where people who don't really say tons of stuff bad about homosexuality (maybe a comment here and there) made out to be a bigot or branded a homohater. James Dobson, who has spent most of his life dealing with children, parenting, and divorce issues is another example. Sometimes he brings up the issue of homosexuality and obviously he is opposed to it. But that's a small part of the broader work of his life.\n\n \n Being opposed to homosexuality is being opposed to gays. There is no way around that one. You keep trying to make this a matter of degree...it is not. The person who makes one public comment against homosexuals is just as much a bigot as the man who spends a lifetime screaming out against gays. \n \n \nAlso, I think that often a \"bigot\" is going to be a bigot regardless of the group of people he hates. True bigots are going to dislike black people as well as as gay people. But many, many people who have concerns or disapproval over homosexuality don't hate black people or other groups at all. I think this is because homosexuality is so tied to moral implications as opposed to skin color. I would say that many people who oppose homosexuality are not bigots at all, yet the gay lobby often tries to portray them as such.\n\n \n This is not about skin color. you are correct that some people hate gays as much as they hate blacks...some hate only blacks but not gays, some hate white gay people, some hate yellow gay women, some hate gay eskimo men, some hate nobody. The key word in all of this is hate. It is intolerance based on someone with different values, beliefs, color, or identity...but in all cases, it is still hate. \n \n \nIs it fair to denigrate and write off a life of benevolence just because the person in question doesn't approve of homosexuality?\n\n \n I never wrote off anyone.

   "Yeah, Hitler should not be labeled and judged as anti-semetic based on his sentiments towards jews. I mean really...look at all the good things he did too . . . .

But it is the principle of the thing. Oppresion is still oppresion,\n\n \n No, the principle is not the same. White was sharing his views about morality, backed by many people who feel the same way about homosexuality (not gay people, per se)--Hitler committed genocide. White didn't oppress anyone, and your life (if you are gay) is no worse after White's statements than before. What White did was not \"oppression.\"\n \n \nYou keep trying to make this a matter of degree...it is not. The person who makes one public comment against homosexuals is just as much a bigot as the man who spends a lifetime screaming out against gays. \n\n \n By your view, we should hold Robert Byrd (who is fond of the \"nigg@r\" word) to the same punishment as the man who killed Martin Luther King, Jr. Life is full of 'degrees'--this is a world full of shades of grey, not black and white. The same goes with morality issues, like homosexuality.

Neither would I, and I would try to save your life immediately if I saw you being beaten because you were gay (or any other reason).

When you learn that part I will stop calling you a bigot.\n \n \n\n \n Let's make this clear again . . .\n \n A person can have objections to homosexual actions and NOT be a bigot.\n \n\n \n Fine as long as they do not use that objection to allow employers to fire people for being gay, or allow gay couples to be taxed more than striaght couples.\n \n\n About the \"oppression\" issue, let's be realistic here. Perhaps if you used a word that doesn't invoke the sort of thing the slaves of the 18th and 19th centuries went through, that more accurately describes what gay people deal with, this would work better. But you and I both know that gay people are not under the control of taskmasters, and are not enslaved or really 'oppressed', if we are being honest. I suspect you use that word on purpose to solicit more public sympathy for your movement, but let's at least be realistic. You are free to do pretty much anything you want in this country--including getting married if you want--you don't have to have a certificate to do that. I don't see you being oppressed. I am willing to say that indeed, gay people are ostracized and unaccepted in this country to some degree (and in most of the world), but that's because of the moral stigma that goes with homosexuality.\n\n \n If you are willing to agree that gays are ostracized, unaccepted, discriminated against, then how can you not see them as oppressed. That is a contradiction. You also keep making this claim gays can get married but not get the certificate. Well without the certificate it is not marriage. It is only a committment ceremony. We DO NOT have the rights or protections for our relationships that striaght couples have. That is not equality and we demand equality.",

When you kidnap someone, you violate their rights. It's so simple.\n \n \n\n Remember, it's a govt. by the people, and for the people.

When men look at women, their urges could get the better of them and they could start talking to them (which is very deterimental to the psyche of a good, moral woman). Then men would start fraternizing with women who aren't their wives, and that would just ruin society. The law would be framed with secualr connotations, but really it would just be forcing one's religious beliefs on another.",

Too bad you too can't see people with other opinions other than your own the same way.\n\n \n Did you even understand the point I was making? Judging by your response, you didn't have a clue. Understanding something is the first step to being able to speak intelligently about it. \n \n \n \n \nBlacks oppressed presegregation? In many cases. But let's be honest: I don't see too many \"gay-only\" water fountains or restrooms around. Do you? Are gays oppressed? maybe in some rare cases; it depends a lot on specifics. Certainly enslaving someone is oppression, but no one is enslaving you. Certainly Matthew Shepard was oppressed when he was tied to the fence. Allowing people to do pretty much anything they want, including getting married (though without the addition of the license) is hard for me to view as oppression. That doesn't mean it doesn't affect people--your opinion that you'd be better off with that license may be true--the jury's still out on that one. But \"oppression?\" Let's use honest language and not be a drama queen about it.\n\n \n And why are their no gay only water fountains, lunch counters, seating in the back of the bus, bathrooms, etc? I will tell you. Because you cannot simply tell that someone is gay just by looking at them. In the 60's at the height of all the civil unrest between blacks and whites, it was not to hard to tell who was black and who was not (still is not too hard come to think of it). So based on the exterior color of a person, you knew who you could deny rights to. With gays, it is not these type of rights that they are denied. It is things like getting married to the person they love and having that marriage recognized as legal, because when you apply for the license, they tend to notice that it is two women or two men who show up to sign the papers. You can spin this any way you want, but you are still advocating the denial of rights to a group based on your views, which is nothing more than oppression. Just because you think that as a christian you carry some special favor in this country because you are part of some moral majority...does not make you any less of a bigot. \n \n And by the way, Matthew Shepard was not oppressed when he was tied to that fence...he was tortured, beaten, sodomized, and killed.
