   "I the debate that I am going to present here is a simple one that doesn't even involve opinion because it is so logically laid out. However I am probably mistaken based on a conversation I had this weekend.\n \n I want to know whose words are in the Bible. Are they the words straight from God's mouth or words written based on interpretations of what came from God?\n \n From what I understand, what is written in the Bible is part interpretation on the writer's part. They get a vision or a message from God and they write down what they seen or heard as closely as best as they can. For instance, if God were to show a vision of a war to one of the writers then would that writer describe the war as best he could and therefore put his words in the Bible or would God tell him the words to write and therefore have the words of God in the Bible? Also would it be possible that a misinterpretation could be made? For instance, if God's vision was of nuclear war could the writer make a misinterpretation of what was actually going on?",

   "There's an admixture in the Bible.\n \n We Christians tend to believe that the 10 Commandments came directly from God... with Moses taking dictation.\n \n When Jesus speaks in the New Testament passages, it is generally thought to be the recollections of those who heard, and is inspired by the Holy Spirit.\n \n There are bits that are the work of the author, such as the Epistles, or letters of St. Paul.\n \n Then there are writings that refer to Christians, or by Christians that were written before the Bible was compiled, but aren't in the Bible. (see the list at bottom of http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/)*\n \n \n \n \n \n \n *Some of these are works by pagans who give some mention of Christians.

   "So if the Bible is not the word of God and is rather the word of man, then how can we trust that it is 100% accurate? If it is not 100% accurate, how can anyone assume that anything said in the Bible is correct unless it can be proven to be?\n \n This is the stuff that really interests me about the Bible. I already am under the assumption that it is not 100% accurate because some of the verses just don't seem to be correct. Even more convincing would be if the Bible isn't the word of God meaning that mistakes could have been made. It would explain the mistakes already in the Bible but it would also leave it open to more mistakes in the future prophecies as well as writings of our past.",

This came after I brought up the Ezekiel passage that I often debate. One claimed that a vision was given to Ezekiel and he didn't understand everything that he was being shown. They believed that Ezekiel was shown a vision of nuclear war and didn't know what to make of it so he just wrote in the best explaination he could into the Bible. They said this explained the inaccuracy that I had been debating with them.\n \n If you wish to see what inaccuracy I am talking about just look at the Failed Biblical Prophecy thread. I don't think that a good explaination for that string of passages has been given yet and I also don't think the idea that Ezekiel misunderstood the vision given to him would be a good explaination when trying to defend the Bible. But one thing is for sure in the Ezekiel passage, either the prophecy failed or the wrong names are used in the prophecy. Did Ezekiel not know who the people in his visions were and therefore used the wrong names?",

There is no \"evidence\" to the contrary, so you either believe it is a holy book, or you don't.\n\n \n Of course there is evidence.

The one I focus on most often is that of a war between Babylon and Egypt. Specifics are given on physical events that were to occur and I can test those events based on historical evidence to determine whether the evidence supports or discredits the Bible.

Before the time that passage was written Babylon has invaded Egypt and had taken a great deal of the country. They controlled lands all the way up to the Euphrates River which was where the heart of Egypt was. Egypt's armies turned this around and pushed them back to the Syene peninsula.\n \n 606, Defeats Babylonians at Euphrates\n 605, Egyptians defeated by Nebuchadrezzar at Carchemish, flee to Egypt\n 604, Babylonians overrun Syria and Palestine as Egypt flees\n 601, 1st Babylonian invasion of Egypt decisively defeated\n \n This is what the historical standings where when Babylon ended their 13 years of war against Tyre which lead to the prophecy about the attack on Egypt and destroying the whole of Egypt this time. The invasion makes its way short of the area that the Babylonians had made it to in their earlier invasion of Egypt.\n \n 582, 2nd Babylonian invasion\n Nebuchadnezzar II invades Egypt, enters delta, but is defeated rebellion of garrison of Elephantine against Apries.\n \n Looking back at the passage \"therefore, I am against you, and against your channels, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia\". I looked this up in the past and it basically means the whole of Egypt. This is of course not even close to what actually happened. The actual results were the Syene getting beat up, but that is mostly just a big desert and not highly populated.\n \n Babylon invaded Egypt once again in 568, not under the rule of Nebuchadrezzar, and was again defeated. Soon after that Egypt defeats Persia and becomes a major sea power after taking control of their naval fleet.\n \n So was Egypt decimated? Not anymore than they had been in the past. Were they ever again to become powerful? Not as they had in the past but they were in no way resembling what the Bible says they should have been. \"cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste\". In the year 568 Egypt should have been at year 14 of being laid to waste so the Babylonians should have defeated the Egyptions easily but this was not the case. A few years later of course Egypt defeats Persia which would have been a challenge if there were no cities or people left in Egypt.\n \n Egypt wasn't truly decimated until about 525 BC by the hand of Persia.\n \n \nNebby actually went into Egypt twice\n\n \n Just to confirm this, yes he went there twice. The first time he was more successful than the second. The first time he achieved victory but was later reversed. The second time, which was after the prophecy, he was the one that was defeated. After that Babylon was more of a mess than Egypt was.\n \n \nThat is the best info I have. The statement of \"uninhabitable\" is a hebrew word better translated as without resource, I think. I will look that up again.\n\n \n You have to realize that the definition of uninhabitable is well defined in the passage.\n \n Uninhabitable - \"I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among desolated countries; and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste\"\n \n There is no question what uninhabitable means in this instance. \n \n \nAnyway, fire away with questions.\n\n \n I really don't thing there are any questions. This event did not physically happen so trying to explain how a scenario where it may have happened similar to what the Bible states is futile. If the Bible were correct in what it stated then Egypt would have fallen long before 525 which was 60 years after the prophecy and it wasn't even by the Babylonians.\n \n But if you wish, how was Babylon not able to defeat Egypt in 568?\n \n How was Egypt able to defeat Persia in 562-560 if they were desolate?\n \n What happened to that 40 years of Egypt being uninhabited?\n \n \"I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt, by the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon.\" Why was it Persia that put an end to the hordes of Egypt?",
