Is it moral to kill a person in a coma, a little immoral to kill a retarded person, and the gravest evil to kill a genius? A mature sheepherding dog is more conscious than an infant--does that mean it's more immoral to kill the dog? \n \n Third, consciousness is just subjective experience of all those neurons firing away in the brain, like a lightning show. It is the epiphenomenon of a BIOLOGICAL reality. Twenty-first century people are still like primitives in that they all-too-often think that humans are like disembodied spirits.

It also becomes a class issue as the rich will travel to other countries where abortion is legal, whilst the poor can not. Women regardless of the law will always have abortions, this fact will not change, ever! So why not keep it legal but (somehow) have more stringent rules in place regarding abortion.",
