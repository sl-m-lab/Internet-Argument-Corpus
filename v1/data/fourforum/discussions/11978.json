   "Here's a speech defining why the Government has an interest in preserving marriage as between one man and one woman.\n 'Our government should . . . protect the institution'\n February 25, 2004\n \n The following is the text of President Bush's speech calling for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman:\n \n Thank you. Please be seated. Good morning. Eight years ago, Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage for purposes of federal law as the legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife. The act passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 342-67 and the Senate by a vote of 85-14. Those congressional votes, and the passage of similar defense-of-marriage laws in 38 states, express an overwhelming consensus in our country for protecting the institution of marriage. In recent months, however, some activist judges and local officials have made an aggressive attempt to redefine marriage. In Massachusetts, four judges on the highest court have indicated they will order the issuance of marriage licenses to applicants of the same gender in May of this year.\n \n In San Francisco, city officials have issued thousands of marriage licenses to people of the same gender, contrary to the California Family Code. That code, which clearly defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman, was approved overwhelmingly by the voters of California. A county in New Mexico has also issued marriage licenses to applicants of the same gender. And unless action is taken, we can expect more arbitrary court decisions, more litigation, more defiance of the law by local officials, all of which adds to uncertainty.\n \n After more than two centuries of American jurisprudence and millennia of human experience, a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization. Their actions have created confusion on an issue that requires clarity. On a matter of such importance, the voice of the people must be heard. Activist courts have left the people with one recourse. If we're to prevent the meaning of marriage from being changed forever, our nation must enact a constitutional amendment to protect marriage in America. Decisive and democratic action is needed because attempts to redefine marriage in a single state or city could have serious consequences throughout the country.\n \n The Constitution says that full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts and records and judicial proceedings of every other state.\n \n Those who want to change the meaning of marriage will claim that this provision requires all states and cities to recognize same-sex marriages performed anywhere in America. Congress attempted to address this problem in the Defense of Marriage Act by declaring that no state must accept another state's definition of marriage. My administration will vigorously defend this act of Congress. Yet there is no assurance that the Defense of Marriage Act will not itself be struck down by activist courts. In that event, every state would be forced to recognize any relationship that judges in Boston or officials in San Francisco choose to call a marriage. Furthermore, even if the Defense of Marriage Act is upheld, the law does not protect marriage within any state or city. For all these reasons, the defense of marriage requires a constitutional amendment.\n \n An amendment to the Constitution is never to be undertaken lightly. The amendment process has addressed many serious matters of national concern, and the preservation of marriage rises to this level of national importance. The union of a man and woman is the most enduring human institution, honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith. Ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society. Marriage cannot be severed from its cultural, religious, and natural roots without weakening the good influence of society. Government, by recognizing and protecting marriage, serves the interests of all.\n \n Today, I call upon the Congress to promptly pass and to send to the states for ratification an amendment to our Constitution defining and protecting marriage as a union of a man and woman as husband and wife. The amendment should fully protect marriage, while leaving the state legislatures free to make their own choices in defining legal arrangements other than marriage. America's a free society which limits the role of government in the lives of our citizens. This commitment of freedom, however, does not require the redefinition of one of our most basic social institutions. Our government should respect every person and protect the institution of marriage. There is no contradiction between these responsibilities. We should also conduct this difficult debate in a matter worthy of our country, without bitterness or anger. In all that lies ahead, let us match strong convictions with kindness and good will and decency. Thank you very much.'Our government should . . . protect the institution' - The Boston Globe",

STRAIGHT people who go around and for DECADES BEFORE gays even thought about gay marriage proceeded to rack up a 50% divorce rate and adopt a callous \"it doesn't matter\" attitude towards divorce. STRAIGHTS instituted the \"no fault divorce\".\n \n 2) There's that SAME OL' LIE regarding \"teaching gay marriage in the schools\".\n I have repeatedly challenged ANYBODY to give some evidence to support those lies.\n It's rather telling that nobody even tries. emoticon_wow\n \n 3) \"they (the kids) think the state determines who they are and what they are\"....\n emoticon_xdonno\n I swear.

How convenient is must be to ignore evidence just because it opposes your warped agenda.\n\n \n Every type of marriage you listed is physically harmful.

   "Oy. You poor dear. I have no problem with the notion that government should \"get out of marriage\". What I have a problem with is that the only time you good Christian folk came up with the idea that government should \"get out of marriage\" is when gays wanted to be treated equally to you straights! There was NEVER any demand that government should \"get out of marriage\" before gay people claimed equality.\n\n \n Well .... yeah. No arguments there. Because gay marriage is basically the first issue to come along and try to redefine it at such a fundamental level. It has gone to show how this legal institution is rife and vulnerable for groups to take advantage of it and use it for ulterior purposes. It has now been exposed as an institution that has no boundaries when anyone can come along and change it for anything.

What we are doing is attempting to, and understand this clearly shooter; we are attempting to PREVENT THE REDEFINITION OF MARRIAGE. \n \n It is the gay agenda which is attempting to legislate, redefine, and dumb down our traditional stance on what marriage represents. Get that straight for once will you? And neither are we denying them civil rights. Homosexuals, as equal americans have the same exact rights to marry as I do. To redefine marriage for them would be special rights. At least have the guts to admit the truth of the situation for once. And one last point. Does this look like 2 sentences in the bible? And since when is the truth defined by how many sentences it takes to speak it? \n \n Taken from the HOLY BIBLE: NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION (C) 1978 by the New \n York Bible Society, used by permission of Zondervan Bible Publishers.\n \n GEN 19:1 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was \n sitting in the gateway of the city.

You can \n wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the \n morning.\" \"No,\" they answered, \"we will spend the night in the square.\"\n \n 3 But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his \n house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they \n ate.\n \n 4 Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of \n Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the house.\n \n 5 They called to Lot, \"Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring \n them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\"\n \n 6 Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him\n \n 7 and said, \"No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing.\n \n 8 Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring \n them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do \n anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\"\n \n 9 \"Get out of our way,\" they replied. And they said, \"This fellow came \n here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse \n than them.\" They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break \n down the door.\n \n 10 But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and \n shut the door.\n \n 11 Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and \n old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.\n \n 12 The two men said to Lot, \"Do you have anyone else here--sons-in-law, \n sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them \n out of here,\n \n 13 because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD \n against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.\"\n \n LEV 18:22 \"'Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is \n detestable.\n \n 29 \"'Everyone who does any of these detestable things--such persons must \n be cut off from their people.\n \n 20:13 \"'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them \n have done what is detestable.

The report, entitled &#8220;Report on Infantile Development in Same-Sex Couples&#8221; and available only in Spanish at this time, gathers and compares information from a vast number of studies carried out on the issue.\n \n HazteOir, concerned by the apparent unquestioning acceptance in Spain of homosexual adoption, hopes that the wide array of information provided in the report and its extensive bibliography will prove to the Senate that homosexual parentage is harmful for children.\n \n The president of HazteOir stated, in light of the findings of the report: &#8220;In no way can a couple of persons of the same sex be judged suitable for adopting a child. Considering the findings of this vast bibliography we are obliged to protect the minor and say that same-sex couples must not be allowed to adopt children.&#8221;\n \n The report contests that the majority of the studies carried out which have concluded in favour of same-sex parenthood betray an egregious lack of scientific rigour. Most of the studies show a strong bias to one side.\n \n To prove this the report analyzes the nature of the individuals who have been responsible for the various studies carried out thus far, demonstrating that the vast majority are either homosexuals themselves, or active in the gay-rights movement. Into this category fall all six of the six most prominent psychologists of the American Psychological Association, which, unsurprisingly is one of the organizations most strongly and vocally in favour of homosexual adoption.\n \n In compiling and comparing the available data from these studies, as well as more objective studies, the team of first-class psychologists and sociologists which penned the HazteOir report have noted prominent and disturbing trends.\n \n Among children raised by same-sex couples, the report notes a significant increase in low self-esteem, stress, confusion regarding sexual identity, an increase in mental illness, drug use, promiscuity, STD&#8217;s, and homosexual behaviour, amongst others. Furthermore, the report shows that statistics have brought to light the fact that same-sex relationships betray a much higher instance of separation and break-up than heterosexual relationships, increasing the likelihood that the child will experience familial instability.\n \n The Spanish Association of Pediatrics firmly backs up the findings of the report, stating that a &#8220;family nucleus with two fathers or two mothers is clearly dangerous for the child&#8221;.Experts Worldwide Find Gay Adoption Harmful for Children [Spanish Study Results]\n \n Since you'll accept what shrinks produce based on fraudulent info, will you also accept their opinions when it's honestly founded in documented facts?",

And if so, what involvement is appropriate?\"\nIs it not so that without governmental recognition of a contract between two people recognizing a familial bond where no blood relationship exists, the desires of blood-related family members would supercede that of the non-related partners, no matter how devoted they are to each other, how long they've been together or how alienated either or both of the partners may be from his/her relatives? There would be, after all, no law to rule otherwise. The only legitimate relationship would be through blood or, if not even that, completely chaotic, resulting in a riot of conflicting claims, possibly even from total strangers. (Hey, why not?)\n \n For instance, suppose a couple (of whatever gender combination) had been together 50 years, and had been disowned by their blood kinfolk for many years. One of the couple is injured in an accident, yet any long-alienated, never-seen blood relative can prevent the non-injured partner from visiting the injured one in the hospital, or in the case of death, claim equal or (more likely) a greater right to the deceased's belongings regardless of his/her desire they should go to the partner.\n \n These are the types of situations civil marriage laws were written to settle. These, and many, many others are the rights that male-female couples (even, I might add, if one is a gay male and the other a lesbian, they NEVER have sex, NEVER procreate, are avowed, in-your-face atheists, and avidly pursue a daily regimen of unspeakable, Biblically condemned activities) are AUTOMATICALLY guaranteed through governmental civil marriage laws carried out at your local city hall every day--against NONE of which, by the way, there has ever been a hue and cry, even from the most dyed-in-the-wool fundamentalists. Same-sex couples, no matter how decent, philanthropic, religious, and otherwise exemplary in their behavior are not, simply by dint of their gender, except, currently, in Massachusetts and Connecticut.\n \n The evolution of civil marriage laws began many centuries ago, for pragmatic reasons that were logically understood to be beneficial to the commonweal of the general populace by resolving disputes and confusions that might, and often do, arise from two unrelated people wanting to form a family bond--centuries before marriage was co-opted as a highly hypocritical \"sacrament\" by religions that have long forgotten the basic, central precepts on which they were founded.\n \n As Max Von Sydow says in Hannah and Her Sisters, \"If Jesus were alive today and saw what was being done in his name, he would never stop throwing up.\"",

Here's a partial list and a link to the U.S. GAO report summarizing them:http://www.buddybuddy.com/mar-fed.html\n \n If you can find a way for a same-sex couple to duplicate all of them via their friendly family attorney, please do tell us all how. Because believe me, same-sex couples have been trying to duplicate as many of them as their pocketbooks would allow for decades now. And because you'll find that many of them CAN'T be duplicated (the law about a spouse not being forced to testify against the other spouse in court, to pick one at random.) And NONE of them can be duplicated for free. \n \n So the married but loveless and childless gay man/lesbian atheist porn-star couple-of-convenience gets all of them instantly gratis, with no condemnation from Archie, Jyoshu, or their respective churches, while the loving, religious same-sex couple with the adopted kid has to pay up the wazoo to get a mere handful. \n \n Which can usually STILL be overturned by the family, and frequently are.\n \n (By the way, laws are MADE by the government. It's called the legislative branch. So \"living will\" or not, its legality is matter of governmental involvement.)",

   "Lesz, My marriage means a great many things to me, none of which have anything to do with our governments. My question to you is: What do you think marriage should mean to our governments?\n\n \n Well, marriage is an ancient human institution, based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans, and is one of the foundations of social stability. Why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it? What really surprises me is to find how many alleged Christians NOW find it expedient to demand government \"get out of marriage\", simply because gay people want to get in it. Bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this.\n \n Now, while I agree it isn't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage, it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away. (Mr.WriteLA has summed it up eloquently so I needn't elaborate.) Alas, many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos, so they've jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon -- which isn't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings.",

   "Another problem is (which I've pointed out in previous posts) is that we're not the only government in the world, virtually all the others have laws recognizing and regarding a legal contract called \"marriage,\" and our citizens have a tendency to visit and even live for a time in some of those countries.\n \n Do away with the civil institution in our country alone, and our newly non-governmentally-married citizens may find that a simple declaration that they are, in fact, related and an album full of commitment ceremony photos may not hack it overseas, resulting in a raft of problems for them.\n \n The U.S. is not an island, despite the efforts of Bush & Co. to make it one.\n \n Also, if you look closely at that GAO list of the 1049 legal rights, benefits, etc., you'll see that a great many of them are there to protect the participants and resolve disputes that might arise, as with any contract. I don't consider that to be \"government interference\" any more than I consider governmental establishment of a police force, the military, or traffic laws. It's when they want to go into my bedroom and tell me who I am or am not allowed to love without regard to rationality, general community benefit, or lack of harm to anyone but my partner and I that it crosses the line.

   "Lesz, you have my sincerest sympathies over the legal difficulties you had to endure after the death of your partner. IMO, its incredibly wrong.\n \n You've also stated quite a few rights that marriage affords, but I just wanted to add a few more to the list:\n - Medical decision-making\n - Unlimited tax-free gifting between spouses\n - Right not to testify against a spouse\n \n Insofar as the rights are concerned, it is important for the government to grant licenses as a proof of registration and universal recognition of two people who have promised to dedicate their lives to each other and all the rights such a dedication affords. That is the only role the government should play in marriage -- bookkeeper.\n\n \n The list of rights and protections enjoyed by married couples is considerable, and far longer than the few I mentioned or the ones you added, though those are among the more important ones. As to what role the government should play in marriage, it should be, I feel, as the guarantor of those rights and protections through legislation and the court system. What other institution can do it? Certainly, not a church.",

   "A precise expression of my own personal feelings. Lesz, you were wronged by fate, wronged by the system (i.e. our government), wronged by your &#8220;outlaws&#8221;, and wronged by the legal profession. I cannot begin to imagine the pain and frustration you had to endure.\n \n If it is not too painful or personal, I would be interested to understand some of your specific difficulties. In order for government to withdraw from marriage, we would need to make sure your situation is not repeated by others.\n\n \n Well, I don't want to get too deeply into this. My partner & I drew up wills specifying what should happen to each of our shares in the property, and we had joint tenancy in the mortgage agreement to guarantee our interest in the case of the demise of either of us. The premise was that upon sale of the property, it would be divided between the survivor and and the deceased's relatives. The point was that our relatives should not be able to get their grubby little hands on the other's share of the property if the worst came to the worst.\n \n My partner's father stole and destroyed the only copy of his will after he died -- he was a homophobic bastard who blamed me for his son's homosexuality. In the absence of a will, the only argreement left was the mortgage agreement, which at least guaranteed my share of the property. His father held up the sale, hoping I'd be driven into bankruptcy. Needless to say, I was solely responsible thereafter for the mortgage, which I could no longer afford. My only recourse was to stop paying the mortgage, and the threat of bank foreclosure eventually made his father cooperate with the sale of the property.\n \n Marriage would have made the theft and destruction of the will null and void.\n \n Now, it's probably true that in hindsight we probably could have made better legal agreements, but much of that could have been avoided by a simple marriage. I'll also add that I have known straight, umarried couples, in the same sort of bind, that they would have been protected against had they taken the option of getting married. At least they had the choice: my partner and I did not.\n \n So please forgive me if I find some use in the concept of marriage, and in government's role in it. It would have saved me a couple of years of worry and anguish.",

The point is not the limitations on spousal inheritance, but that spouses are universally recognised to be the closest kin, closer even than blood kin -- except of course, for gay spouses.\n \n I am not saying that you couldn't replace marriage with a thicket of laws or private contracts, but what would that amount to other than marriage, anyway, which already is a thicket of laws, simply because many laws refer to married couples only. Over 1000 federal ones at the last count, and more state and local laws.\n \n I have not argued that legal marriage is the only way of setting up a family and endowing it with legal and contractual obligations and protections, but it is a very convenient way. For example, if one needs to write a law specific to married couples, it is easy to do so, because there's a universality to marriage. Not so easy if one has to include couples with contracts A-L but exclude couples with contracts M-Z. If each spousal contract were unique, it would be difficult, I suggest impossible, to write legislation that would be universally applicable. \n \n The state would almost have to become virtually blind to the existence of what is the most ancient, central and significant human institution ever invented. (If you doubt it is, ponder the visceral, homophobic reactions of our resident nay-sayers on this issue.) I really do not think that's a very good idea, unless one is a doctrinaire libertarian or worse, anarchist.\n \n This applies to money as well as purely legal issues, and let's face it, most legal issues in marriage revolve around money, even cases such as child custody and support. Marriage isn't only universally recognised within the US, it is internationally recognised, though obviously there are differences from country to country. But the institution is nevertheless universally recognisable, even though it changes in form. Abolish marriage, and you abolish the portability of rights.",

Since marriage is a central human institution, I think it isn't reasonable to expect the state to be blind to it. Here I speak of marriage as the mutual agreement of two human beings to live as a family unit, and even raise children.\n \n I just do not see how the state can be blind to that. People living as a family do not have the identical interests and concerns of isolated individuals. I know that, because I have lived both ways.

Evidently, you want to have government make the lives of married couples harder.\n\n \n I do not want the government to make the lives of married people neither easier or harder. If the government gives money to one group of people, the rest of the populations has to pay for it with higher taxes. Money has to come from some place. \n \n It is a fact that most married people are not \"needy\". Many of the most wealthy people are married. There are also plenty of single people that are needy. I suspect that there more needy single people than needy married people.\n \n \nBetter than a misguided faith in lawyers to provide adequate protections.\n\n \n Most of our elected officials who make the laws are lawyers.\n \n \nWhen was the last time you had an intimate, sexual, and permanent relationship with your room mate?\n\n \n The government does not require married people to have sex, be loving, committed or even nice to one another to paraphrase WriterLA.\n \n \nYou seem determined to attack marriage for some reason. \n\n \n Perhaps I was unclear.

   "Well, we can agree on something: I am indeed ideologically and practically \"opposed to government involvement in and regulation of marriage\"\n \n \"Why\"?\n \n 1. It is not necessary\n\n \n Many things are not strictly necessary, but it's convenient to have a government do them, because otherwise they will not get done at all. A social security net, for example. It certainly isn't strictly necessary, but more folk would be in more trouble if it didn't exist.\n \n \n2. It is unfair to single people\n\n \n I just do not see this. Is clothing a naked man who is cold unfair to those who aren't? Single people and married couples have different issues. Single people tend not to be living in joint property or be raising children with another. \n \n \n3. Our government has endowed a special class of people with special benefits that are denied to all others.\n\n \n Again, this is only true of gay couples. Straight couples can access those benefits for the cost of a marriage license. And single people do not need those benefits at all.\n \n \n4. Removing government from marriage is a graceful way out for both sides in the gay marriage debate.\n\n \n Again, this is the least impressive argument. I am not looking for a way out of the marriage debate, I am looking for equality.\n \n \n5. I believe in \"live and let live\" especially in such a personal matter.\n\n \n Well, again here, no-one is forcing to get married or accept the protections offered by the legal institution, if you do not want them. Why burden others with your political philosophy if they do not share it? \n \n \n\"How you think married people would benefit if government were to treat them as if they were completely independent and isolated individuals.\"\n \n 1. Married people would not benefit. As a group they do need the exclusive benefits they are now receiving. Do Bill and Melinda Gates need government marriage benefits? \n\n \n How about Mr. and Mrs. Trashcollector? Or Mrs. Abouttobeabondonedwiththreekids?\n \n \n2. Single people would benefit from lower taxes.\n\n \n Well, maybe, but there have also been tax penalties for some married couples. In any system of redistributive taxation, some folk are going to pay more than others, because, it is viewed, they have a greater ability to pay and pulling their belt a bit tighter hurts less. Married couples have children to look after. Single people typically do not. Society certainly has an interest in helping families raise children.\n \n And no, I am not unaware that the incidence of single parents is increasing, but again, this is mostly through divorce or abandonment by a spouse. Strong marriage laws can address such issues through child support.\n \n \n\"How, exactly, is it they are no different [married people] from two single people who have no financial, legal or social interdependence?\"\n \n 1. The two single people could very well, and often do, have financial, legal and social interdependence e.g. friends, roommates and business partners.\n\n \n Well, they do have contracts to deal with those particular situations. Married people's lives are entwined on more levels simultaneously. If a room mate runs out on me and sticks me with the rent, I can always find another room mate. It's much more difficult is a husband runs out on you and sticks you with the rent and the kids.\n \n \n2. You seem to see differences that should be addressed by law that I do not see. The law does not take romance into consideration. What do you see?\n\n \n I see marriage as an ancient institution that is pretty much part of human nature. It has always been regulated by government, for as long as there have been governments. Before heedlesly throwing it away because it's become inconvenient as an issue between gay and straight Americans, it might be wise to consider it more carefully.\n \n \nA problem that I see is that there is a misconception of what we would like a marriage license/marriage certificate to be and what it actually is. We would like to think it is an official certification or validation that the couple is in love, will live together forever, etc. The fact is that the couple does not have to agree to even be nice to each other or live together. The only qualification is that couple are adults and in most places are different sexes. As far as a relationship is concerned, a marriage certificate is a hollow document. Pretty much anyone can get one for any reason or no reason. Its only value is as a ticket to get a load of benefits.\n\n \n It's certainly true that people have different views of marriage, and that the law doesn't take into account the personal relationship between spouses. It can't really. There is always room for discussion about what sort of protections and obligations should be included in government regulation. I just do not think it's practical or wise simply to abolish it entirely.\n \n It isn't all THAT unfair on single people, who mostly end up getting married at some point. And it is convenient for the large majority who do, because they do not then have to go to lawyers of varying and dubious skills to set up that web of protections that is automatically granted by marriage.",

Don't forget that one of the central issues of marriage is raising families, and this is true for gay couples as well as straight ones. Plenty of gay marrieds are raising kids, without much help from the state.\n \n All I know is that as a single person with no dependents, I have more spare cash than others in my wage group with families.

They are financially and emotionally independent, without longterm ties or any major commitment to each other beyond next month's rent. Married couples -- even these days where women frequently have their own careers -- are not. Indeed, the reason they get married is usually to make an inter-dependent life together, which is why I am puzzled you apparently see no difference between married partners and room mates. Since you ask me to explain what seems to me rather obvious, I'm left wondering whether you are ignoring important distinctions just to force an argument.\n \n Is it not in society's interest to encourage people to become mutually inter-dependent within a stable, long-term partnership, as that is a natural human inclination, anyway, so that if something goes wrong for one of them, they have some support? And isn't it a legitimate government purpose to encourage and support what is in society's interest?\n \n You see, I just do not credit the Randist philosophy that the ideal society is one of rugged individuals, all totally independent of anyone else. That just seems so artificial and, frankly, inhuman. I'm not, of course, implying you are a card-carrying Randist, just that Randism is close to an extreme position on social organisation, and an impractical one. I think government needs to encourage family life, not put obstacles in its way.",

I guess we will have to leave it as a philosophical disagreement. Thanks for the discussion.",
