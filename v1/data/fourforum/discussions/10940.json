Like just this past Sat.\n \n What most 'evangelicals' don't mention is their support is more bible mandated than actually heart felt. And it typically ties in with end times prophesy.\n Most believe that unless the Jew individually converts to Christianity, they'll burn in hell.\n \n Then there's the cold hearted realpolitic support for Israel...keep an allie in the midst of 'enemy' lands and the enemy will be too preoccupied with them to turn much of an eye towards us.",
