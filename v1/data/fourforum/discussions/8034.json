Studies were done on underground society economic contributions to France's economy versus social costs and resulted in no conclusion; learned people couldn't determine if illegal immigration was a financial drain, wash or contribution.\n \n Considering that a majority of US citizens pay little or no federal taxes and a very large number have learned to play the system for a free ride, I find the current refocus on illegal immigration of people wanting work just another example of the general public's ability to respond to manipulation with hypocrisy, stupidity and in many instances, racism.",

   "It is an election year and the party has little to peg its future on, so the Prez comes on TV with plan to cycle 6000 reserve troops on the border. Even by the diminished standards he has set, that is really a dumb idea. I spent some years in the reserves and we actually used our 15-day training period to train and fire our weapons. Now units will be sent to the border just to \"put more boots on the ground\". It is estimated that it will require 70,000 to 80,000 troops cycling through their 15-day duty time to maintain the proposed levels and \"even if you use the Guard troops with the right set of skills, they're not going to have enough time to get oriented to the local and the specific job before it's time to go home\". \n One promising solution to the border problem is House Bill HR 98 by Sivestre Reyes (D, Texas) who called the Prez's border plan \"cheap political theater\". He claims that his bill will cut the inflow by 80% in a year. Basically, he wants to cut off the jobs that are the lure for illegals. He would redesign Social Security cards, making them difficult to counterfeit, and set up a means for employers to quickly verify if an applicant is legal. The bill will add 10,000 new agents to ensure that companies follow the law and imposes serious penalties on employers including up to five years in jail ...

(web site www.house.gov). \n \n This bill against illegal acts by business has little chance in a Republican congress,\n but I believe 10,000 agents in the marketplace will be more effective than 6000 more border patrol agents or untrained troops trying to stop the flow to jobs.\n Dono",

   "Building a wall????? My god, why do we elect these people.\n \n Think about it. Illegal Mexicans and others who travel through Mexico to cross the border, are crossing over MOUNTAINS and DESERT, they are EXHAUSTED and DEHYDRATED, and many die crossing the desert!! Do we really think that if they made it to the \"wall\" they would say \"oh, a wall?! Let's turn back!\"\n \n I don't think so! They can scale the wall with rope, break the wall in sections with dynamite, they can dig tunnels. C'mon people. Let's use a little intelligence....maybe just maybe we should act as if \"we\" are paying for this dumb idea. Wait a minute, we are!!!! Talk about money out the window!!\n \n If we really wanted to crack down, all you have to do is crack down on the employers. One year in jail for the employer per illegal. No substition, no time off for good behavior.\n \n Our own government, shouldn't be giving SCHOLARSHIPS, money and benefits to illegals....they do!!!\n \n :xbanghead stupidity....it must hurt.\n\n \n Oh and lets not fogrget that the national guard would be down there defending the wall instead of the border patrol. I think we should tag illegals that way if they cross a second time, we could probably report them to the mexican police......ROFL. yeah right. Lets face it, San Deigo in 2 years will become little mexico. Nothing against these peoples who are trying anyway possible to come intot he country, but its the damn processing that takes so long! If we had a way to speed up the citizenship, and to lower the costs, maybe just maybe it would help. But are we thinking of policy reform? Nope. I do agree though with having an increase in patrolsmen and national gueard personell dwon there, but my goodness if its anything that need reform its the Mexican government.",
