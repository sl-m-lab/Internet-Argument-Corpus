I pulled out my little locator deal and saw that she was about 400 ft away and moving away form us. I started after her at a fast walk and was LOOSING ground. Finally she was about 900 ft away and I broke into a dead run. Finally she stopped, and was at the very end of my range. I could not figure out how she was moving so fast. There is no way she could run that fast, and it woudl take a guy in damn good shape to carry her and run that fast.\n \n Turned out that a security guy had seen her looking for her mom, put her on his golf cart, and took her back to the security shack to make an announcement. That actually scared me. Apparently when he found her, she was only about 30 ft away from us, but instead of wandering around with her for a few minutes in the immediate area, he thought it made more sense to take her half a mile away and then make an announcement.

I think that all parents should have one just for the sake of convenience.\n \n As far as you wandering off when you were little...there is a curse that mothers use and it WORKS. \"I hope someday you have kids that are just like YOU\".
