   "Guys, I am wondering about North Korea.\n Why don't we go after them? I feel real bad for the oppressed and less fortunate people down there. They have to live with a communist government that does not give a damn about them. Kim Jong Il or whatever his name is is not taking care of his people. They have sickness, poverty, not much electricity, and dwindling economy. I feel real bad. That, and people beleive them to have labor camps or something.\n Why don't we get off our lucky asses and go atack them. We are over here sitting on our free and non-poor asses, and they are suffering. No human being should have to live with that. Why? \n Why don't we go after them, they pose a threat to Japan, and a couple other countries. They pose no threat to Amerika, cause they have not the capabilities to send a nuclear missile to Amerika. But, why? They could go after Japan, granted, the Chinese would step in. \n They have no right to treat innocent people like that. They need to be attacked. I know that is a crazy idea and it affects us in no way. But if I were in their shoes, I would like to have a country come in and liberate us from the perils of the North Korean Government. No man or womans should have to suffer poverty, disease, or anyting like that because their government would rather threaten countries, and care more about thier military.\n Please respond. I am open for opinions. I just want to know why America doesn't do something?\n We can resolve their nuclear problem, but why not North Korea? We need a better regime and government system in North Korea.",

   "Is this a parody or something?\n \n \"Hey, there's a poor crappy country. Let's invade it! That'll really sort all their problems out. They'll welcome us with open arms, because obviously they believe that their government is evil and they love the US government. Decades of Communist propaganda will be easily overcome with love when GI Joe starts blowing up their neighbourhood.\"\n \n This part was particularly funny:\n \n \"No man or womans should have to suffer poverty, disease, or anyting like that because their government would rather threaten countries, and care more about thier military.\"\n But it's fine for American citizens to suffer poverty and disease because their government would rather invade countries and cares more about its military?\n \n Also:\n \n \"But if I were in their shoes, I would like to have a country come in and liberate us from the perils of the North Korean Government.\"\n You probably wouldn't because from birth you'd have had an ingrained hatred of the US.\n \n -Wez",

   "But, that country's government does not need to be in power. They don't give a damn. Many North Koreans would love to be liberated from that government. Many North Koreans love America. \n I know this idea has no sense in it at all. But, the government:\n 1. Does not give a damn about the citizens/people of North Korea.\n 2. Spends atleast 94 percent of it's money on it's military.\n 3. Does not help the poor.\n 4. Poor people have disease cause they can't buy food and have to eat out of trash cans.\n 5. The government threatens the world with Nuclear weapons, and Japan is a likely target.\n 6. The government is rumored/ said by many North Koreans in the United States and elsewhere that they operate prisons of torture.\n I don't like this. I think we should liberate the North Koreans and remove Kim from power. \n Unlike America, we actually have missions for the poor to go and live. We actually feed people food and have a stamp program. They don't really have any of that. Unlike America, we have no disease, and we don't threaten other countries with the nuclear warheads we have developed. \n Not only would we be saving the poor and the rich from the evil communist Korea, we would be saving Japan and other countries close by. I guarantee the Koreans are dumb enough to nuke Japan. \n But, listen, forget the nuclear war XXXX. Just let me know if my idea makes sense about liberating Koreans. I don't see why president Bush doesn't anyway. He would be giving the freedom to about four million Koreans.\n -John",

   "The US has spent the last 60 years threatening people with nuclear weapons. Need I remind you that during the cold war it was the US that had the first strike nuclear policy, not the USSR.\n \n As to the US not having disease, last I heard there were 38 million Americans without proper healthcare. The US has a higher infant mortality rate than Cuba for crying out loud. The US does #### all for the poor, by comparison with any normal developed country, and most of those do little. \n \n I'm not saying any of this to defend the mess that is the north korean regime, but to pretend the US is all sweetness and light is ridiculous.\n \n I don't think an invasion is a good idea, not least because if North Korea does have nukes, an invasion is the most likely cause of them being used. Plus, if Kim Jong Il really doesn't give a #### about his people, then he will happily use them as cannon fodder, hundreds of thousands will die. A quote, a sarcastic one just to make clear for those sow on the uptake, with reference to Vietnam springs to mind: \"It's ok to kill 2 million people if you're defending their freedom\".",

   "Yes, but Unlike North Korea, we actually are doing something about the bad healthcare in our country. We are taking care of the poor. But some don't want to be helped.\n That whole 94 percent spent on their military thing is just a guess. Most communist countries spend most of their money on their military. Plus, I was just guessing on the population of North Korea. It looks like a small country, I thought, hell. Probably four million. That was just a guess. A dumb guess. Anyway, I just feel bad for the North Korean citizens. I know they hate their government. I am sure they would love us to liberate them. They may not like us, but I am sure most of them do. Plus, that would solve one of many world problems if North Korea was out of the picture.",
