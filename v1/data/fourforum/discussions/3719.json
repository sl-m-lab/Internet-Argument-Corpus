By this, I mean, the whole naturalistic explaination about our origins. We know that many evolutionists hold to the idea that we evolved over eons of years from \"simple\" organisms that eventually evolved from a bacterium. This leads us in to ask the question, where did that bacterium come from? Evolutionists say it was spontaneously produced by a lightning strike in some primeval sea. We can then ask, where did the Earth come from and where did the Solar System come from? To which we are told everything was formed as a result of the big bang about 13 billion years ago, give or take a few billion years.\n \n You may choose to prove any one of these three events is scientific in response to the original topic. The mutations and natural selections and changes we see in animals today is not an area for debate as creationists and evolutionists are in complete agreence over these events as they can be tested and observed. The area in which we have debate is the interpretation about the origins of the scientific evidence, for example, the fossils, animals and plants, planets, rocks and so on.\n \n It is this that I am refering to.

   "Hello Close_slave_can:\n \n \nI don't think the lightning strike will be proven it is merely plausibe.\n\n \n I think it goes something like that. Scientists have tried to repeat what they believe happened, but to no success. Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!\n \n \nAs for the big bang I don't know much about it but I thought cosmic background radiation was fairly strong evidence.\n \n \n Partially, the big bang theory did predict that there should be cosmic background radiation (CMB for short I believe - Cosmic Microwave Background radiation). However, this radiation basically has the same temperature of 3K everywhere throughout all of space, and forms what is known as the light-travel-time problem for big bang models of the universe. The article below demonstrates this in an easy to understand format:\n \n Light-travel-time: a problem for the big bang <http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v25/i4/lighttravel.asp<\n \n If you can't be bothered going to the link, I know how that feels, I have copied and pasted the following information that outlines the problem that CMB poses to the big bang theory:\n \n The temperature of the CMB is essentially the same everywhere5-in all directions (to a precision of 1 part in 100,000).6 However (according to big bang theorists), in the early universe, the temperature of the CMB7 would have been very different at different places in space due to the random nature of the initial conditions. These different regions could come to the same temperature if they were in close contact. More distant regions would come to equilibrium by exchanging radiation (i.e. light8). The radiation would carry energy from warmer regions to cooler ones until they had the same temperature. \n \n The problem is this: even assuming the big bang timescale, there has not been enough time for light to travel between widely separated regions of space. So, how can the different regions of the current CMB have such precisely uniform temperatures if they have never communicated with each other?9 This is a light-travel-time problem.10\n \n \nAs for evolution producing large changes I don't think has been proven either but small changes have almost been proven, and if small changes can happen then it is reasonable that a large sequence of small changes. \n \n \n You are true in that we do see small changes in the genetics of animals due to mutations and natural selection and other genetic causes. But here lies another problem. Instead of creating the new information required to change a bacterium into a human, all changes cause a loss of information to the genome or the changes have been caused by an addition of information from somewhere else in the population, e.g. bacteria typically do this as one way for biotic resistence. Notice how with this, no new information has been produced, it has just been \"given\" from else where in the population. We just simply do not see any new information being created from any mutations or natural selection today, and as such, there is no reason to suggest that it may have happened eons of years ago.\n \n The book \"Not by Chance!\" by Dr Lee Spetner shows that time and chance cannot produce the new information required for large scale evolution to be true. It can be brought here. \n \n \nAll will say that the above theories are preferable to genesis when you have the standpoint that you only deal with what you can measure. \n \n \n That is what I am trying to establish. Many have stated that evolution is science, although when I prove to them other wise, or challange them as I am doing here, they do not answer yet they still state, \"Evolution is science\". I am wanting a reasonable reply to establish that the events listed above can be proved by science and as a result if it cannot be proved, that they are just belief systems about the past. I have also stated that the evidence needs to be interpreted by people's starting world views for it to make any sense. The evidence, fossils and stars for example, does not change between evolutionists and creationists. They just interpret it differently according to their underlying beliefs. No one has challanged this principle, although they ignore it and pretend that it doesn't exist by making stupid remarks such as:\n \n \"There is more evidence for evolution than creation\" and \"There is no evidence for God or creation\".\n \n These comments are made from a position based purely on ignorance of what the evidence is and how it must be interpreted to make any sense of. Just like data in IT; data by itself is meaningless. When it has been interpreted and processed by humans it is called information and makes sense. Similarly, the evidence is like data and makes very little sense on it's own. When it is interpreted through a person's underlying assumptions and beliefs (either atheism or Christianity in this case) it then makes much more sense.\n \n So we have the same evidence, just different interpretations (or beliefs) on the evidence's origins. The example about the CMB can be used to examplify this. The CMB is the scientific evidence. The evolutionary interpretation is that it was caused from the big bang explosion that released billions of electrons and radiation, etc. This same evidence can also be interpreted through Dr Humphreys' Relativistic cosmology as outlined in \"Starlight and Time\". In this book, Dr Humphreys also addresses the red shift evidence. It is a thrilling application of science and is very interesting to read.\n \n In both cases, both interpretations of the origins of the evidence must be taken by faith - unless someone else can prove me wrong?",

You have constantly stated that creation scientists (the original definition of \"creationist\") make up lies and rubbish about an overall theory of evolution. Who believes in the big bang theory? Evolutionary scientists! Who believes that life originally came from non life? Once again, evolutionary scientists! Who believes that life evolved over eons of years from simple to the complex? Evolutionary scientists. Evolution is basically the naturalistic world view that tries to describe how evidence of the present originated (from the big bang through to the progression of life and to try and explain how the evidence of today fits what we should see if evolution were true). The creationary world view, in the case of what is usually argued about on this forum, is based on Christianity and through that tries to describe how evidence of the present originated and how it fits in with what we should observe if creation were true.\n \n Pandion, please, provide some evidence for your supported assertions and attacks against creationists. I have challanged you before in this way, yet you do not answer. No one has answered me when I ask. That's okay, but what is not cool is when you re-state the same rubbish, \"Creationists are scientifically illiterate\". \n \n All of those fields you listed form \"Science\" and most were founded by, or have been radically improved by Christian creationists. Evolution (like creation) uses these fields to support their belief about the origins of the evidence we see. No, we accept real science that we can observe, test experimentally and repeat. \n \n We obviously need to clear up what science is, if we are to get anything out of this thread. So we ask the question, \"What is science?\"\n \n Science is the human enterprise of seeking to describe accurately and quantitatively the nature and processes of our universe through observation, hypothesis, and experimental validation. Certain axiomaticc principles must be accepted by faith for this method to be valid, the first of which is the expectation of order in the universe. A specific corollary of the order principle is the law of causality, or \"cause and effect\" relationships. This law states that one cause can have many effects, but no effect can be quantitatively greater or qualitatively superior to its cause. Observed effects are assumed to have causes because of this law, and are not treated as purely random or chance occurrences. The inquisitive mind will speculate on the cause of an observed effect and then seek to recreate and test the cuase experimentally. That is the essense of the so-called scientific method. \n \n Note, however, that an observation is always an action of the present, not of the past. Additionally, the observer must recognize that observations are to varying degrees indirect, through an instrument of some sort that may distort his perception. For instance, our eyes are optical instruments that recieve incident light, optically focus that light on the retina, which in turn converts the image to a complex system of electrical impulses, transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve. If the transmission of the image from an object to our brain is distorted at any point along the way, our visual perception will be incorrect. Some optical illusions are actually misinterpreted in the brain because of preconceptions, without any optical or electrical distortion. All observations must be similarly analyzed and scrutinized to develop accurate perceptions. The farther removed in time or distance an indirect observation is, the greater the opportunity for distorted perception.\n \n Applying the foregoing discussion to the age of the Earth, we recognize that we have no human record of observed events from great antiquity, but rather interpretations of recent observations of present realities. Oftn the establishment of a great age is built on observations from a very great distance or developed through tedious indirect means. Evidence contradictory to the hypothesis is either suppressed or ignored because of preconceived assumptions. Even the light arriving from distant stars is a present reality, not a direct observation of the past. These observations are of effects for which various hypothetical causes have been proposed. Those causes are somtimes gradual processes that would require very long times to produce the present state.\n \n By way of illustration, consider geologic formations in the Great Basin of the western United States. The vast horizontal layers of hydraulically deposited sedimentary rock are said to take long periods of time to accumulat, based on the assumption that the rate of deposition was always similar to that observed today in a typical river delta. This concept of uniformity may seem like a reasonable starting point when considered abstractly, but no steady-state river flow could possibly cover such a vast area; neither would it produce the violently buried and mangled podies found fossilized in many roks of the region. The present-day erosion conditions applied unifromly in the past could not account for the unusual formations of the Grand Canyon, meas, badlands, and other canyons. By constrast, the catastrophic processes observed during and following the eruption of Mount St. Helens in the Cascades of Washington state produced a scale model of the Grand Canyon in a very brief period of time. Sediments were rapidly deposited and then suddenly eroded by pyroclastic steam, water, and mud flows in the area northwest of the summit. Now the canyon walls resemble others that are are assumed to be of great age, even though they are known to be less than 20 years old.\n \n The point to be recognized is that science deals with observations of present states and processes, and can only discuss the prehistoric past. In the example of geologic formations of the Great Basin, the assumption of unifromity can be contrasted with a model of catastrophic tectonic, volcanic and hydraulic activity that would accompany a global cataclysm such as teh great flood of Genesis. The observed eruption of Mount St. Helens demonstrated that rapid processes can produce effects commonly believed to require long periods of time, and thus gives credence, if not preference, to the concept that the Earth's geology did not require long periods of time to develop. Many puzzling formations can only be explained through cataclyssmic forces. Similarly, other methods of estimating the age of the Earth or of the universe apply assumptions about processes and rates that extend into the distant past. Regardless of how apparently compelling such dating methods appear to be, the fact remains that they are built on assumptions that must be critically questioned and evaluated.\n \n All events of the past (even the recent past) are best reconstructed from the testimony of witnesses and the accumulation of corroborating evidence. That is the basis of the system of jurisprudence. Science can contribute by determining what is possible, but cannot infallibly reconstruct the past. There are definition impilications about prodigiuos age, however, that can be gleaned from applying known principles from the laws of science.\n Reference:\n Dr Jeremy I.

If a creature gains new information, it has the ability to change from say, a reptile into a bird (ignoring the avian lung and other evidence that makes this close to impossible). Thus changing kinds (i.e. a cat kind into a dog kind). But we do not observe any new information being generated today, and as such, creatures do not have the ability to change kinds and hence, macro-evolution cannot happen.\n \n \nThe evidence on which this theory is based would exist whether you or I (or anyone else) had the ability to interpret it.\n\n \n Yes the evidence exists without interpretations - I did not say that it didn't. The evidence, however, does not make any sense without interpretations. Did you read that data example I stated? How evidence is like data that must be interpreted and processed by people and given meaning and thus becoming \"evidence\" for a theory or belief (i.e. information). \n \n \nThe origins of this evidence are synonymous with the data itself. It is naive to suppose that the acceptance of evolution theory depends upon the evidence of so-called \"proofs\": it depends rather upon the fact that the theory of evolution infiltrates and supports every branch of biological science.\n \n \n I really don't understand what you are talking about, can you please clarify it? Evolution is able to explain most branches of science, as can creation. Both are able to explain how the same evidence originated through different interpretations of the evidence that is based on their underlying beliefs or assumptions.\n \n \nAnti-evolutionism has therefore, the same status as flat-earthism.\n\n \n How on earth did you come to this conclusion??? Evolutionism is just but one interpretation of the same evidence, can you not understand this simple principle? Christian creationists can also support and explain every branch of modern day science and how the evidence originated and how the observations we make today fit in with what we would expect to see if Genesis is correct. FYI, the Bible states in Isaiah 40:22 that the earth is round.\n \n \nBiologists don't argue about whether evolution has taken place - but many details of how evolution proceeds are still matters for investigation.\n\n \n Once again, it depends on your defintion of evolution (biological). Micro or macro? For many scientists, if you ask for a grant to determine if man evolved from ape like ancestors, you will never get it. You ask which of the supposed ape like ancestors did we evolve from. Not one of the three stages listed above have been proven, not even on the balance of probabilities. They are just belief systems about the past by fallible man to try to explain how evidence of the present originated.",

I said that no mutation has ever been seen to add new DNA (or information - which ever you like) to the genome. Now, there are some beneficial mutations out there, but they result from the loss of information from the genome. You may ask how can this be? Well, we will illustrate with an example of how bacteria can aquire antibiotic resistence:\n \n There are two ways that we will briefly discuss:\n 1. The bacteria can gain the information from another bacteria who already has the DNA for antibiotic resistence.\n 2. The bacteria can loose information. We will discuss how this happens below.\n \n The \"Golden Staph\", which you should all be aware of, is resistant to pennicillian. It normally produces a little bit of this enzyme that inactivates or destroys the pennicillian. Since there is only a small amount of this enzyme produced, consequently it is swamped by the amount of penicillian and is destroyed. The \"factory\" has a mechanism to tell it how much enzyme to produce - this enzyme normally has some other function, it just happens to destroy the pennicillian. What happens is there is a mutation in the control systems of the factory so that the bacteria now produces heaps of the enzyme. So it is now producing enzymes out of control now, i.e. it just produces as much of the enzyme as it can from the factory inside the cell. The antibiotic, such as pennicillian, is then destroyed by the enzymes and consequently the bacterium becomes resistant.\n \n How did it happen? Through loss of control of over the production of the enzyme. The mutation has destroyed DNA or information. In this example, the loss of DNA has resulted in the bacterium surviving and could be called a \"beneficial mutation\", although no new DNA information has been added. Some have even said that sickle-cell amenia is a beneficial mutation because as a side benefit you are immune to the malaria virus (I hope that is how it is spelt). This is because your blood is too sick for the virus to live in. But if you inherit both sickle cell amenia genes, you are dead.\n \n The terms \"beneficial mutation\" does not mean an increase in DNA information to the genome. This is a little confusing.",

But if you inherit both sickle cell amenia genes, you are dead.\n \n The terms \"beneficial mutation\" does not mean an increase in DNA information to the genome. This is a little confusing.\n\n \n \n Here is a quick example of a mutation ADDING DNA to a genome:\n http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary/prophage\n Meaning of PROPHAGE\n A bacteriophage that is in a dormant state; its genome is either integrated into that of the host, or is replicated autonomously.\n \n http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-P/prophage.html\n A phage chromosome inserted as part of the linear structure of the DNA chromosome of a bacterium. A temperate phage integrated into the host chromosome.\n \n This may not (but coupled with another mutation MAY) be beneficial but it adds \"information.\"\n \n And let's get the \"information\"/DNA thing straightened out. \n A chain of DNA can only be considered \"information\" if it codes for a protein or performs some regulatory function. Mere DNA is not information (but genes are).\n \n And then here are some examples of beneficial mutations:\n http://www.gate.net/~rwms/EvoHumBenMutations.html\n Now, I would say that the only time we can call any of these mutations a gain or loss of \"information\" would be if there were a gain or loss in the number of genes.",

   "How do we measure it? If a mutation is a loss of informatioin (even if the mutation was beneficial), why isn't a second mutation that reverses the first an increase in information?\n\n \n nu leader wrote:By the amount present in the genome that makes sense and performs a function. There isn't a second mutation because we don't see it happening today.\n\n \n This is just totally absurd. If we measure information by \"the amount present in the genome that makes sense and performs a function\" then how do you define DNA that \"makes sense?\". You are just replacing one ambiguity with another. Also I notice your definition sidesteps the issue of information difference between two different genes that perform different functions.\n \n \nTaking the TNR mutant as an example. We do not see the rooster producing feathers again, because the lost DNA cannot be regained as the mutation has destroyed it.\n\n That isn't necessarily true. I don't know what this TNR mutant is you are talking about, but most mutations that cause damage can be reversed. Most damage is not reversed because the odds are low and the organism dies out before it can reproduce.\n \n Why not pick an adaptation. For example is the adaptation of a fin to a leg an decrease or increase in information? What about the reverse, the adaptation of a leg to a fin?",
