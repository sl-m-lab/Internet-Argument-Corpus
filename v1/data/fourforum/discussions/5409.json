   "in every one of the gospels it was noted that jesus either explicitly stated or implied that he was going to be killed, and that he would return in 3 days. in one instance he said he would destroy this temple and in 3 days rebuild it, referring to himself, but the elders were furious because they thought he was referring to the temple in jerusalem.\n \n on the day jesus was crucified, the gospels state that jesus' body (as well as the other crucified victims) had to be taken down before sunset, which was the beginning of the jewish sabbath.\n \n Mark 15: 42, 43 - And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, Joseph of Arimathe'a, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. (also Luke 23: 50-54)\n \n that would imply that the death of jesus was a friday, since the jewish sabbath is saturday.\n \n Mark 16: 1, 2 - 1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Mag'dalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salo'me, bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had risen. (also Matt 28: 1,2; Luke24: 1-4; John 20: 1)\n \n looking at the passages now, there is obviously some confusing information here. either jesus was only dead for 1 day, or the \"sabbath\" in this instance wasn't saturday. it seems more likely that the gospels imply jesus was only dead one day, because they imply that the sabbath in question was actually saturday. after the sabbath was the first day of the week, which we know is sunday, so jesus was only dead for 1 day\n \n that jesus rose on the 'third' day is a universal 'religious fact'. no bible-based religion disputes this. yet clearly, from the bible itself there is a serious contradiction that have been widely overlooked. but there it is, as clear as ever... hmmm.... i really had no intention of going down this route, but this truly is very wierd...\n \n any thoughts?",

   "so is it correct to go along with the convention that jesus was dead for 3 days? being dead for 3 days and dying and resurrecting on the 3rd day has a subtle and technical difference that most religions seem to get away with. however, the both terms are commonly interchanged, giving a false idea to what the bible actually says. in reality, according to the gospels jesus was only dead for the duration of the sabbath. he died just before the sabbath began, and resurrected just after it ended. however, his death would span 3 days. most biblical accounts seem to agree with this, except that one in matthew about 3 days and 3 nights\n \n so do we (meaning new testament-based religions) reject that verse since it clearly contradicts the rest of the account? mind you, that verse in matthew was recorded as a quote from jesus himself. so did jesus actually say those words, or were they interjected by the author to add a more scriptural significance to the prophecy (i.e., referring to the prophet jonah). \n \n also, this verse suggests that jesus believed that the jonah story was also an actual account of a literal event.\n \n it seems to me that this is more evidence that the gospels were greatly embellished by the gospel authors, who in this case overdid the religious significance and made a fatal flaw of gross inconsistency. sticking to just the facts would have saved them from this problem",

But the really deliberate additions in my opinion are things concerning the birth and to a degree the death of Christ, as well as some variants in the parables to denote the lack of Armageddon or the increasingly gentile church (this is in Matthew and Luke compared to Mark).

Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before! 11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them. 12 And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.",

   "Obvious Child said: How can you justify punishing the innocent as justice? If a murderer's mother volunteered to be executed instead of him, would this be justice?\n \n First, the Bible says that ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god (Romans 3:23). Isaiah 64:6 says that \"ALL of us have become like one who is unclean, and ALL our righteous acts are like filthy rags\". The prophet Jeremiah says that \"the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure...\" So there are no innocent people on earth who have mental acuity who have been around for any length of time. \n \n Now regarding the \"murderer's mother\" volunteering to be executed instead of the murderer. That wouldn't work because the mother herself was sinful (see scriptures above), and God required a sinless sacrifice for sins. \n \n No One is Righteous  \n \n Romans 3:9 What shall we conclude then? Are we any better[b]? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin. 10 As it is written: \n \"There is no one righteous, not even one; \n 11 there is no one who understands, \n no one who seeks God. \n 12 All have turned away, \n they have together become worthless; \n there is no one who does good, \n not even one.\"[c] \n 13 \"Their throats are open graves; \n their tongues practice deceit.\"[d] \n \"The poison of vipers is on their lips.\"[e] \n 14 \"Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.\"[f] \n 15 \"Their feet are swift to shed blood; \n 16 ruin and misery mark their ways, \n 17 and the way of peace they do not know.\"[g] \n 18 \"There is no fear of God before their eyes.\"[h] \n \n 19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. 20 Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin. \n \n Righteousness Through Faith \n 21 But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. 22 This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25 God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement,[i] through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished- 26 he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus. \n 27 Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith. 28 For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. 29 Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, 30 since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. 31 Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.\n \n So basically, just as through one man (Adam) sinned entered the world, so also through one man (Jesus) is sin resolved and accounted for. God (Jesus) made it easy for us and took the punishment for sin upon himself.\n \n Footnotes / Old Testament References:\n \n Romans 3:9 - Or worse \n Romans 3:12 - Psalms 14:1-3; 53:1-3; Eccles. 7:20 \n Romans 3:13 - Psalm 5:9 \n Romans 3:13 - Psalm 140:3 \n Romans 3:14 - Psalm 10:7 \n Romans 3:17 - Isaiah 59:7,8 \n Romans 3:18 - Psalm 36:1 \n Romans 3:25 - Or as the one who would turn aside his wrath, taking away sin",

Romans 2:7); (4) loss of opportunity for service and authority in heaven (Mt. 25:14-30); (5) a low position in heaven (Mt. 25:14-30); (6) loss of rewards (cf. v. 14-15); and (7) repayment for the wrong done to others (Col. 3:24-25).\n \n AS ONE ESCAPING THROUGH THE FLAMES: 'Escaping through the flames' is probably an expression meaning 'barely saved.' God will evaluate the quality of life, influence, teaching, and work in the church of each person. If his work is judged unworthy, he will lose his (heavenly) reward, yet he himself will be saved.\" ( Full Life 1755-56)\n \n For those who may have been saved just prior to death (the thief on the cross), there may not be any (good) works to reward, yet their salvation is assured. It is my contention that once a person is regenerated, eventually, if they live long enough, there should be some sort of Godly works in their life (James chapter 2), or they were never born again. \n \n Cheers....\nI have literally never heard this before. Quite interesting... but I thought the whole point was that redemption was complete? This is surprisingly Catholic: I thought the idea that works have any effect was rejected by Luther: what demonination are you?\n \n BTW: you didn't answer my question as to how punishing someone uninvolved = justice, and why its necessary unless sin is a natural force outside of God's power.",

He allowed this because he wanted people to have free will to choose between good and evil, and learn the consequences of good and evil (note Genesis 1:26 and 3:22 in conjunction with each other).\n \n BTW, the New Testament book of Hebrews is a good one to read about Jesus' sacrifice.",

   "EZ, probably the most fundamental concept of Judaism is the singular nature of the Hebrew god. Judaism does not recognize a Trinity. The Trinity is a Christian construct.\n\n \n That's pure folly, my boy, for the following reasons:\n \n ONE GOD OR A TRINITY?\n \n It is safe to say that many Christians would be at a loss to explain the Biblical doctrine of the triune-unity of God (one God manifested in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit). It is a concept universally rejected by Jews as a seeming contradiction to the monotheistic teaching (the Jewish doctrine that there is but one God) found in the Old Testament. Indeed, the basic theme of the Torah (the first five books of the Bible, written by Moses) is the doctrine of the unity of God. To the Jewish mind, therefore, a triune God seems totally inconsistent with this teaching. Or did they miss what's really in their own Scriptures?\n \n Christianity, on the other hand, holds that while the Old Testament is still true in every respect, the Old Testament clearly reveals that God is a unified and triune God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and that the Messiah is clearly God the Son. In essence, Christianity agrees with Judaism that there is only one God, but differs with Judaism in that this one God is manifested in three persons. One Christian school teacher was asked by a student how this could possibly be, to which the teacher replied, \"It's sort of like a three-leafed clover, which has three protrusions but is still looked upon as one leaf.\" To the Christian, God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one in purpose and Spirit, yet each seems to have their own individual manifestations. To this end, I will now provide the Old Testament scriptural evidence for the triune God.\n \n EXAMPLE # 1: The \"Shema\" Verse\n \n For most Jewish people, the \"Shema\" is the foundational verse for the concept of a monotheistic God. It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 actually establishes, rather than refutes, the plurality of God. In fact, the Shema verse actually presents one of the strongest arguments for the tri-unity of God in the entire Bible. Here's why. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time often contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n In Numbers 13:23, it speaks of a \"cluster\" of grapes. The word \"cluster\" is again the Hebrew word echad. Obviously, this singular cluster of grapes consisted of more than one grape.\n \n In Ezra 2:64, the Bible records, \"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand, three hundred and threescore.\" The words translated \"whole congregation\" in English are derived from the single Hebrew word echad. Again, a singular entity (one congregation) is comprised of more than one individual.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). He chose echad to make his point, so that it might be understood there is a plurality in union. Hence, the Shema verse not only testifies against the singularity of God, but actually implies a unity of two or more entities.\n \n More coming....",

   "Educating Orion on the Trinity in the Old Testament - Part 2\n \n EXAMPLE # 2: \"Elohim\"\n \n In the very first verse of the Bible we find a statement which clearly illustrates the plurality of God.\n \n \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\"\n Genesis 1:1\n \n The Hebrew word that is used for God in Genesis 1:1 is the word Elohim, a derivitive of the word El. \"El\" denotes God in the singular sense, while \"Elohim\" is the plural notation for God. Of the 2,750 times that these words are used in the Old Testament, Elohim, the plural form, is used in 2,500 cases, and is used 32 times in the accounts of the Genesis creation of the heavens and the earth.\n \n Another excellent example of the word Elohim used in a critical text is found in Exodus 20:1, where the Lord is giving the Ten Commandments to Moses and the people of Israel:\n \n \"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt.\"\n \n Grammatically, it would be acceptable to say, \"I am the Lord your Gods.\" Such examples as these, which occur 2,500 times in the Old Testament, raises the following question: If the scriptures are the divine word of God, why would the Lord consistently select the plural form of God - Elohim, to refer to Him in a plural sense? Why would He not use the singular form, El, in each instance? This is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed for those who believe in a monotheistic God.\n \n EXAMPLE #3: Plurality in Personal Pronouns\n \n Plurality in personal pronouns (such as \"us\" and \"our\") when used in reference to the Lord, lends additional documentary evidence for the plurality of God. A good case in point is Genesis 1:26:\n \n \"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,\n and let have dominion over the fist of the sea, and over the birds\n of the air, and over the livestock, and over all the earth.\"\n \n Here, we see a conversation that is taking place prior to the creation of man. Who is this person or persons with whom God is conversing? First, this 'person' or 'persons' is able to communicate with God in His own realm of timeless eternity. Because man had not yet been created, He was not speaking to someone of earthly intelligence, but someone in the heavenly, supernatural and eternal realm.\n \n Secondly, this person or persons with whom God is communicating apparently has the same kind of creative ability as God (\"Let us make\"). This clearly implies a cooperative effort between God (Elohim - plural) and the person or person with whom God is speaking.\n \n And finally, the person or persons with whom God is speaking is comparable, or identical, with God (\"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\").\n \n When confronted with this passage, modern Jewish rabbis often claim that God is speaking with angels. However, this explanation fails to address a number of problems. First, there is no indication found anywhere in the Bible that says angels can create life. Secondly, nowhere is it indicated that angels were ever made in the image and likeness of God. And finally, there is no indication from scripture that mankind was ever made in the likeness of angels. \n \n Just one more example. In Genesis chapter 11, God is looking down at man's attempt to build the Tower of Babel to make a name for themselves. In verse 7 God states:\n \n \"Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will\n not understand one another.\"\n \n Once more, the personal pronoun \"us\" is used as a reference to God. Note that in verse 11:5 it is \"the Lord\" that is referred to when \"us\" is later used (\"The Lord came down to see the city\"). \n \n The \"Creators\" of the Universe\n \n The plurality of the Creator (Elohim) in Genesis 1:1 has been dismissed by many as simply a description of God's diverse nature. However, the plurality of the creator of heaven and earth is also seen in a number of other Old Testament verses. For example, in Ecclesiastes 12:1 we read,\n \n \"Remember also thy Creators in the days of thy youth, while the \n evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt\n say, 'I have no pleasure in them.\"\n \n \n \n The notion of a plural Creator is also seen in Isaiah 54:5, where the prophet states:\n \n \"For thy 'Maker' is thy husband, Jehovah of Hosts is His name.\"\n \n In the above verse, the word \"Maker\" is the Hebrew word \"asa,\" which denotes the plurality of the entity involved in the creative process.",

   "EXAMPLE #4: The Holy Spirit is a Person - God! - Part 3 \n \n While in Genesis 1:2 we see the \"Spirit of God\" moving upon the face of the waters during creation (remember God as \"Elohim,\" a plural creator), there is a very important and often overlooked verse in which the prophet Isaiah reveals that the Holy Spirit is more than just some type of spiritual force. Isaiah 63:10 reads,\n \n \"But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore He was\n turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.\"\n \n The word \"vexed,\" as used above, is the Hebrew word \"atsab,\" which means \"to worry, pain, or anger; to grieve, hurt, or make sorry\" (Zodhiates Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary section, page 91). The question, of course, is \"How can some inanimate force be angered or grieved, as we see occurred in the above passage? Only if the Holy Spirit was alive and possessed personal attributes could He experience these types of emotions.\" The Holy Spirit must therefore be a person. \n \n Another important verse that shows that the Holy Spirit is one of the \"Creators\" is found in Job 33:4, which reads,\n \n \"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty\n hath given me life.\"\n \n Obviously, the Holy Spirit must possess intelligence in order to take part in the creative process. Other \"personal\" attributes of the Holy Spirit are as follows:\n \n 1. The Holy Spirit \"testifies\" (Nehemiah 9:30).\n 2. The Spirit \"instructs\" (Nehemiah 9:20).\n 3. The Spirit \"strives with men\" (Genesis 6:3).\n 4. The Spirit sends messengers (Isaiah 48:16).\n 5. The Spirit enabled Joseph to interpret Pharoah's dreams (Genesis 41:38).\n 6. The Spirit gives wisdom (Exodus 28:3; 31:1-6; 35:31).\n 7. The Holy Spirit is the \"Spirit of Wisdom\" (Isaiah 11:2).\n 8. He is the Spirit of Knowledge (Isaiah 11:2)\n \n Notice clearly that all of the things that the Holy Spirit does requires intelligence of the variety that only God alone can possess. This ties God and the Holy Spirit together in a most closely-knit and inseparable unity. \n \n In Psalm 51:11, in the prayer of David to His Father in heaven, David alludes to the Holy Spirit when he prays, \"Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.\" \n \n Considering the aforementioned evidence, we can only conclude that Holy Spirit is a living person (diety), who possesses many of the same intellectual and creative attributes as the Almighty God.\n \n EXAMPLE #5: The Son of God \n \n In Isaiah chapter nine, we read a number of magnificent verses that proclaim the coming Messiah as being God:\n \n \"For unto us a child is born,\n to us a SON is given,\n and the government will be on His shoulders.\" (Isaiah 9:6)\n \n Who is this child that will be born?\n \n \"He will be called Wonderful Counselor,\n Mighty God, Everlasting Father,\n Prince of Peace.\n Of the increase of His government and peace\n there will be no end.\n He will reign on David's throne,\n and over his kingdom,\n establishing and upholding it with\n justice and righteousness,\n from that time on and forever.\" (Isaiah 9:6-7)\n \n How is it that God can be born as a child? This \"child\" that is called \"Mighty God\" is also mentioned in Isaiah 7:14:\n \n \"Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: The virgin will\n be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call Him,\n 'Immanuel.'\" \n \n Again, God is seen as one who is \"born.\" The name, \"Immanual,\" means \"God with us\" in Hebrew (note that God has many names in the Old Testament: \"Adonai,\" meaning \"Lord\" (Malachi 1:6); The \"Rock\" (Deut. 32:4 and Psalm 18:2); \"Thy Refuge and thy Fortress\" (Psalm 91); The \"Redeemer\" (Job 19:25); etc.). By the way, Job 19:25 states, \"For I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end He will stand upon the earth.\"\n \n Psalm two is another not-so-subtle hint that God has a beloved son:\n \n \"Why do the nations conspire....\n against the Lord and His Anointed One?\n I have installed my King on Zion, my Holy Hill.\n He (the Lord) said to me, 'You are my Son;\n today I have become your Father.\n I will make the nations your inheritance,\n the ends of the earth your possession.\n You will rule them with an iron scepter;\n You will dash them to pieces like pottery.\"\n \n Jewish thought concludes that these verses must be referring to King David or King Solomon, when the king reigns forever on his eternal throne. Yet if you remember in Isaiah 9:6-7 a child will be born who will be called \"Mighty God,\" \"Everlasting Father,\" and \"Prince of Peace,\" who will reign on King David's throne. Who is this person? Is it David that will rule over the nations with an iron sceptor and subdue his enemies, or is it someone else? Well, David knows who this person is, and David calls Him, \"Lord:\" \n \n \"The Lord says to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your\n enemies a footstool for your feet.\" (Psalm 110:1)\n \n Jesus once asked the pharisees of His day, \"Who do you say the Messiah is?\" The pharisees responded, \"The Son of David.\" Jesus replied, \"How then can David, speaking in the Spirit, call Him Lord when he says, 'The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. If he is David's son, how then does David call Him 'Lord?\" The answer, of course, is that the Messiah will be born of an earthly mother (a virgin to be given in marriage to a descendant of King David) and conceived by a heavenly Father (God). Psalm 72 refers to this individual as the \"Royal Son\" who will \"Endure as long as the sun,\" and whom \"All kings shall bow down to,\" and through whom \"All nations shall be blessed\" (Pssalm 72:1, 5, 11, 17).",

   "DANIEL'S VISION OF THE 'SON OF MAN' - Part 4\n \n In Daniel chapter nine, starting with verse 24, the prophet Daniel gives a critical, time-sensitive prophecy concerning when the Jewish Messiah shall arrive in Jerusalem. This prophecy is known as the \"Seventy Weeks of Daniel,\" and you can read of this prophecy in a later section . But a second vision by Daniel records another individual of similar stature approaching the throne of Almighty God.\n \n In Daniel 7:13-14 we read:\n \n \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a\n son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the\n Ancient of Days (Jehovah God) and was led into His presence. He\n was given authority, glory, and sovereign power; all peoples, nations,\n and men of every language worshipped him. His dominion is an\n everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one\n that will never be destroyed.\"\n \n Remarkable. Jesus referred to Himself as the \"Son of Man\" numerous times (Mark 14:21, etc.). In the gospel of Mark 14:62, Jesus was specifically asked if He was the Christ, the Son of the 'Blessed One.' Jesus replied, \"I AM (note: this was the name Jehovah revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai when Moses asked the Lord His name). And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One (note Psalm 110:1) and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" \n \n But as far as the vision of Daniel is concerned, here is that same individual spoken of in Isaiah 9:6-7 who will reign on David's throne, who will have the sovereign power of Almighty God, and whom the peoples and nations of the earth will worship. He is approaching the throne of the \"Ancient of Days,\" who is clearly Jehovah God (see Daniel 7:9-10), and is about to set up his eternal kingdom. Is this not the eternal Messiah, the Son of God? If King David were to reign on this throne, would he desire that all people worship him, or would he do as he did on earth and direct the people's worship towards Almighty God? We will look to the prophet Jeremiah for still another clue.\n \n If by now there are any doubts that God will raise up a Lord (who is someone other than David) who will reign on David's throne, then the prophet Jeremiah foretells who this individual is:\n \n \"The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will raise up to\n David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely, and do\n what is just and right in the land. In His days Judah will be saved\n and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which He will be\n called: THE LORD (JEHOVAH) OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.\" (Jeremiah 23:5-7)\n \n Remember, in Jewish theology there can be only one Lord. Yet in the above verse the Lord God is raising up another Lord who is called, \"The Lord our Righteousness.\" Certainly neither David, who committed murder and adultery, or Solomon, who sought after the idols of his many wives, nor any other Jewish King could become the \"Righteousness\" of the people. This is a divine individual, and is the same person that Isaiah and King David refer to as, \"Lord.\" \n \n In all these things - in all these examples, we clearly see that the God of Israel is more than just a monotheistic entity. In fact, the evidence testifies against God being a singular entity, and clearly depicts a unified, Triune God - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Like my professors told me when I entered the seminary to begin my theological studies, \"Do not abide in the teaching traditions of men. You must know what the word of God teaches. Learn it first-hand for yourself. For it has been around much longer than those who regurgitate their own traditions. Traditions come and go. Cults rise and fall. But only the direct word of God can be trusted.\" A unified, triune God explains things better, and only a triune God with the Messiah as the Son of God correctly matches the scripture in perfect harmony with other related scriptures.",

To this end, I will now provide the Old Testament scriptural evidence for the triune God.\n \n EXAMPLE # 1: The \"Shema\" Verse\n \n For most Jewish people, the \"Shema\" is the foundational verse for the concept of a monotheistic God. It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 actually establishes, rather than refutes, the plurality of God. In fact, the Shema verse actually presents one of the strongest arguments for the tri-unity of God in the entire Bible. Here's why. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time often contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n In Numbers 13:23, it speaks of a \"cluster\" of grapes. The word \"cluster\" is again the Hebrew word echad. Obviously, this singular cluster of grapes consisted of more than one grape.\n \n In Ezra 2:64, the Bible records, \"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand, three hundred and threescore.\" The words translated \"whole congregation\" in English are derived from the single Hebrew word echad. Again, a singular entity (one congregation) is comprised of more than one individual.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). He chose echad to make his point, so that it might be understood there is a plurality in union. Hence, the Shema verse not only testifies against the singularity of God, but actually implies a unity of two or more entities.\n \n More coming....\n\n \n \n Oh yes, that is the logic where they are tying to say ONE IS EQUAL TO THREE. Right. No, the shema is not a compound one. It is one.",

   "Maybe you can address the following evidence which you must have missed or glossed over the first time around:\n \n The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 actually establishes, rather than refutes, the plurality of God. In fact, the Shema verse actually presents one of the strongest arguments for the tri-unity of God in the entire Bible. Here's why. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is often known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time, in Scriptural examples, contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n In Numbers 13:23, it speaks of a \"cluster\" of grapes. The word \"cluster\" is again the Hebrew word echad. Obviously, this singular cluster of grapes consisted of more than one grape.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE (echad) HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad).

   "...learn to reference authoritative, reputable, scholarly sources in order to back up your own opinions/assertions.\n\n \n LOL! Your idea of an authoritative, reputable, scholar is any liberal with a hairbrained attack against the Bible. Let's take a close look at one \"scholar\" you have bandied about in the past - the liberal \"Bishop\" Spong:\n \n What's Wrong with Bishop Spong?\n \n http://www.christian-apologetics.org/html/Whats_wrong_Spong.htm\n \n (from the website):\n \n Spong the Greek \"scholar\"\n \n Spong boasts that he spends hours studying the Bible and professes an acquaintance with Koine Greek, the language the NT was first written in. Therefore it is not surprising that in RMR, where he denies Jesus' bodily resurrection, that he turns to an analysis of the Greek text to see what the Bible really means.\n \n In RMR p. 53-55, Spong draws our attention to Gal. 1:15-16a which says:\n \n v15 But when He who had set me apart, even from my mother's womb, called me through His grace, was pleased v16 to reveal His son in me ...\n \n From v. 16, \"to reveal His son in me\", Spong claims:\n \n This was not a physical body recalled from the grave. The word for \"reveal\" in this text is ophthe, the same word used in the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures to describe the appearances of God (theophanies) or angels of God (angelophanies).... What was the nature of a theophany? Was it really \"physical\"? What was the means of hearing God's voice speak? Was it audible to any ear? Was it capable of being recorded or objectified?\n \n At first, we were impressed by this depth. But on checking a computerised concordance, we found that ophthe is sometimes used of ordinary physical \"seeing\" (Acts 7:26, 1 Tim. 3:16). A logician would also note that Spong commits the fallacy of false alternatives, because he overlooks the possibility that seeing could be both physical and supra-physical, rather that either/or. We thought that it was strange that Spong should ignore this point. However, we decided to check a Greek NT to see if Spong had at least analysed the word correctly in this passage. But we could not find ophthe in the passage. To give Spong a second shot, we checked a NT Greek Interlinear. The word was not there either. Instead, the Greek word for \"reveal\" in Gal. 1:16 is actually apokalupsai, not ophthe! Apokalupsai is often used in the NT in an objective sense.\n \n It is shocking to see that Spong was trying to attack traditional Christian belief by appealing to a mis-translation of a Greek word which is not even in the passage he is explaining. Prof. O'Collins is undoubtedly referring to this blunder when he wrote: \"What is said about a key verb St. Paul uses in Gal. 1:15f. shows that the bishop [Spong] has forgotten any Greek that he knew.\" Spong should heed O'Collins' kindly \"advice for his next book [which] is to let some real experts check it before publication.\"\n \n Yep, real good there, Orion....",

No geology evidence of an earthquake during the period of Jesus' death..zero.\n\n \n Well, Jerusalem was burnt to the ground in 70 AD so you can pretty much figure most everything was lost, including many of the official records of Pontius Pilate, which were alluded to by others, and other official records. But let's not say there's no evidence for anything miraculous:\n \n THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n REFERENCE\n \n McDowell, Josh.

   "The Scarlet thread\n \n Quoted from JCNT:84, re: Mt 27.51:\n \n \"The parokhet in the Temple. Exodus 26:31-35 describes this curtain as it existed in the desert Tabernacle. It separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. Only the cohen hagadol was allowed to pass through it into the Holy of Holies; and that he could do only once a year, on Yom-Kippur, to make an atonement sacrifice for his sins and for the sins of the Jewish people. When it was ripped in two from top to bottom it symbolized the fact that God was giving everyone access to the most holy place of all in heaven, as taught explicitly at MJ 9:3-9, 10:19-22 [that's \"Hebrews\" for us goyim, ;)].\n \n The Talmud bears an amazing witness to the work of Yeshua in altering the system of atonement. The background is that on Yom-Kippur, when the cohen hagadol sacrificed a bull (Leviticus 16), a piece of scarlet cloth was tied between its horns. If it later turned white, it meant that God had forgiven Israel's sin in accordance with Isaiah 1:18, \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they will be white as snow.\"\n \n \"Our Rabbis taught that throughout the forty years that Shim'on the Tzaddik served,... the scarlet cloth would become white. From then on it would sometimes become white and sometimes not.... Throughout the last forty years before the Temple was destroyed... the scarlet cloth never turned white.\" (Yoma 39a-39b) \n \n Thus in the days of Shim'on Tzaddik the sacrificial system established by God in the Tanakh was observed, and it was effective. But afterwards Israel's spirituality declined, so that the sacrificial system was effective only sometimes. Finally, after Yeshua's death, forty years before the destruction of the Temple, it was never effective. The Talmud does not say it, but what had become effective for forgiving Israel's sin was the sacrificial death of Yeshua the Messiah.\" \n \n http://www.christian-thinktank.com/dveil.html",

Are you unable to tolerate opinions which differ from your own?\n\n \n The point is you and the liberal \"Bishop\" Spong don't have the FIRST PIECE of EVIDENCE to back up your silly theory that Christ isn't who the Bible claims. And Spong wants to wear his little white collar like he's some kind of Christian, while denying who Jesus is (Lord God and Savior) and why he came to earth? In Paul's and John's day he very likely would have been kicked out of the Church for that bile.\n \n I also got a laugh out of Spong's thesis that \"All \"Theo-talk\" is meaningless. Translation: Spong's \"theo-talk\" must then also be meaningless according to his own claim. \n \n The man is a charlatan, a wolf in sheep's clothing. The Apostle John, who knew Jesus quite well, said this about such men: 1 John 2:22 - \"Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist-he denies the Father and the Son.\"",

   "Examining Orion's \"Bishop\" Spong\n \n Spong's \"Thesis\" # 9: There is no external, objective, revealed standard writ in scripture or on tablets of stone that will govern our ethical behaviour for all time.\"  \n \n Here is the crux of the liberal mindset: The liberal progressives want no moral laws or moral judgments made that (1) would define what sin in God's and man's eyes is, and (2) that would XXXXX their consciences.  In other words, forget the real God - the liberals want to create their own god so their same sex sin can be codified, so their shacking up is legitimized, and so they can do whatever they want, whoever they want, whenever they want, and do it with pride.\n \n In order to achieve this immoral liberal \"Utopia\" THEY HAVE TO ATTACK traditional Biblical truths (and those who profess them), and replace it with their own brand of liberal fundamentalism.\n \n And this is why Spong has to deny Christ on the cross and his atoning sacrifice for sins. Sin carries with it moral judgments about behavior, and the liberal progressives don't want those moral judgments or guidelines to exist. So, Christ's sacrifice and the concept of sin have to be abolished and branded as folly.\n \n Spong's \"Thesis\" # 10 - \"Prayer cannot be a request made to a theistic deity to act in human history in a particular way.\"  \n \n Says who? Spong and Company? Elijah and others in the Bible made such prayers and they were honored.\n \n So, this is the kind of intellectual acumen and \"scholarship\" that Mr. Orion believes is winning the day. I do hope they can come up with something better than what we've seen so far out of \"bishop\" Spong.",

This, despite the fact that you've previously admitted to never having read any of his books. I mean, difference of opinion is one thing - but you go way beyond that. Given the degree of venom which you spout against this man, I can only conclude that you see him as a serious threat to your Christian fundamentalist theology and evangelism, and your literalist interpretation of the Bible, as you continue to cut&paste from your 'sources'.

   "lets take a look at your links\n \nhttp://www.carm.org/diff/Matt12_40.htm\n Therefore, we can see that because of the Jewish usage of counting any part of a day as the whole of the day, the term \"three days and nights\" is idiomatic and not literal.\n\n here the link says its not literal, like i said\n \n \nwww.wcg.org/lit/jesus/howlong.htm\n Therefore, to demand that the phrase \"three days and three nights\" must be taken literally as a 72-hour period creates what appears to be a contradiction within the Gospel of Matthew.\n\n takeb literally, the verse contradicts the timeline, like i said. therefore the verse is to be taken figuratively\n \n \nwww.hope-of-israel.org/pdf/bv2.pdf \n But when we read the gospel accounts of Christ's death and resurrection with an open mind, there is absolutely no way we can get three days and three nights from these New Testament verses!\n ...........\n The literal interpretation of the phrase \"three days and three nights\" as representing an exact period of 72 hours ignores the abundant Biblical and Rabbinical evidence on the IDIOMATIC USE of the phrase \"a day and a night,\" to refer not to an exact number of hours or of minutes, but simply to a calendrical day, whether complete or incomplete.\n\n again, the article concedes to the contradiction and suggests that we dont take the verse literally\n \n \nwww.new-life.net/3_days.htm\n The expression \"three days and three nights\" that He used only in Matthew 12:40 was meant to tie in with the quotation He gave from Jonah 1:17. The Hebrew expression for three days and three nights was likewise used generally and indefinitely for three days simply. This is manifestly the case here. Jesus was dead part of the first, all of the second, and part of the third day. In the Jerusalem Talmud, it is said \"that a day and a night together make up an ownah (nuchtheemeron in Greek), meaning \"night\" and \"day\", and that any part of such a period is counted as a whole.\"\n\n yet again, jesus saying \"three days and three nights\" did not necessarily mean what he said. even though he wasnt dead for 3 days and 3 nights, we can safely count 1 day and 2 nights as 3 days and 3 nights. talk about throwing logic out the window!\n \n \nwww.biblestudy.org/basicart/threeday.html \n There is nothing in the Bible to favor the Good Friday crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The biblical record harmonizes with a Wednesday crucifixion and Saturday evening resurrection--a full 72 hours. This view allows for a literal interpretation of \"three days and three nights.\" It allows for the word \"after three days\" to mean just that. It proves that Jesus Christ fulfilled the sign of Jonah and thus proved His Messiahship to the Jews.\n\n this article also cites the contradiction, and concludes that the crucifixion had to have taken place on the wednesday. this, of course, contradicts all the previous explanations\n \n \nwww.christiancourier.com/questions/entombmentQuestion.htm \n Clearly there was flexibility in the Hebrew mode of expressing time. \n \n One must understand, therefore, how the Israelite people spoke of time. The New Testament does not contradict itself with reference to how long Jesus was in the tomb.\n\n this article agrees with the other logically devoid one that 3 days and 3 nights can be equated to 1 day and 2 nights because there was a \"flexibility\" in the way israelites referred to time. in other words, it doesnt mean what it says\n \n \n all the authors to the articles you link acknowledge the contradiction and provide disharmonious attempts to explain. but more than that, they all concede that jesus didnt mean what he said when he said that. its just like one of those allegory thingies",

Hebrew days begin at sunset. Sabbath Laws were severe regarding doing any work on Saturday. These facts have a significant effect on any discussion regarding the Crucifixion of Jesus. If Jesus had been Crucified on Hebrew Friday, there would have been too many time consuming things for Joseph to do before sunset when the Sabbath would have begun. Jewish law was that it was a mortal sin to do ANY work on the Sabbath. Even such a simple thing as picking up a writing pen was considered to be \"work\" and therefore sinful on the Sabbath. Neither Joseph nor anyone else would have dared carry the Body, carry all the burial cloths and other materials, or even sell him such materials, so close to the Sabbath beginning. Jesus was therefore almost certainly actually Crucified on Hebrew Thursday, and then placed in the tomb after sunset, in other words, on Hebrew Friday.\n \n http://mb-soft.com/public/crucif.html\n \n The Case for a Thursday Crucifixion, By Ernest L. Martin, Ph.D.\n \n this is how the historical scenario would run:\n &#61623; Christ died about 3 p.m. on Thursday (Nisan 14).\n \n &#61623; At sundown commenced the annual holyday called the First Day of Unleavened Bread (Nisan 15), see John 19:31.\n \n &#61623; The next evening at sundown would have occurred the weekly Sabbath so that there were in 30 C.E. two Sabbaths in tandem to one another.\n \n &#61623; Then after those two Sabbaths or, as Matthew puts it, at the end of the sabbaths (plural, and in this case to be reckoned as two Sabbaths in tandem), the priests and Pharisees posted the guard and put mortar around the stone, effectively sealing it to the rock escarpment (Matthew 28:1a).\n \n &#61623; About 12 hours later, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, the stone was rolled away by angels and Christ emerged, now resurrected from the dead (Matthew 28:1b).\n \n This reckoning allows the \"three days and three nights\" of Matthew 12:40 to be a literal fact (using the inclusive count for the first day). It would also satisfy the \"after three days\" (Matthew 27:63) as literal (using again the inclusive for the first day). And, most importantly, it dovetails exactly with the new astronomical data that are pointing squarely to a Thursday for Nisan 14.\n \n http://www.askelm.com/news/n010501.htm\n \n With this information, this thread, and Unkerpaulie's claims of a clear contradiction for which there is no possible explanation, are rendered null and void.\n \n Nice try, guys.",

   "Repeating errors and mistakes is not being 'corrected'. You really should learn that.\n\n \n More evidence to bury the previous question follows:\n \n In Mark 2:26, reference is made to an occurrence in \"the days of Abiathar the high priest.\" But from 1 Sam. 22, we learn explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiathar\n \n Verse 26. Abiathar the priest. From 1Sa 21:1, it appears that Ahimelech was high priest at the time here referred to. And from 1Sa 23:6, it appears that Abiathar was the son of Ahimelech. Some difficulty has been felt in reconciling these accounts. The probable reason why Mark says it was in the days of Abiathar, is that Abiathar was better known than Ahimelech. The son of the high priest was regarded as his successor, and was often associated with him in the duties of his office. It was not improper, therefore, to designate him as high priest, even during the life of his father, especially as that was the name by which he was afterwards known. Abiathar, moreover, in the calamitous times when David came to the throne, left the interest of Saul, and fled to David, bringing with him the ephod, one of the peculiar garments of the high priest. For a long time, during David's reign, he was high priest, and it became natural, therefore, to associate his name with that of David; to speak of David as king, and Abiathar the high priest of his time. This will account for the fact that he was spoken of, rather than his father. At the same time this was strictly true, that this was done in the days of Abiathar, who was afterwards high priest, and was familiarly spoken of as such; as we say that General Washington was present at the defeat of Braddock, and saved his army; though the title of general did not belong to him till many years afterwards.\n \n http://www.ccel.org/ccel/barnes/ntnotes.iii_1.ii.xxvi.html\n \n The (alleged) \"Abiathar error\" is a famous one among skeptics, who bounce this around like taffy. Abiathar, they sniff, was not high priest when David did this; David was before Ahimelech. We have previously provided an answer based on analysis from Casey's Aramaic Sources of Mark's Gospel, and we now expand on that here.\n \n The initial and simple answer notes that the verse in Mark says that this event took place \"in the time of\" Abiathar the high priest, which is not the same thing as saying that he was the one involved in the episode in question. This remains essentially correct but requires more detail.\n To begin, the description of Abiathar as \"high priest\" is not titular. Neither Ahimelech nor Abiathar are ever given the title in the OT, though it is clear that Abiathar served as a leading priest (along with Zadok) and Ahimelech may have ranked highly as well. The word for \"high priest\" is archierus, a combination of hierus, or priest, and arche, a word most often meaning \"beginning\" but also meaning supreme in rank or order. Casey sees behind this language an Aramaic description too literally rendered in Greek: It does not mean Abiathar was \"high priest\" but indicates that he was a great priest, a renowned priest. That much is obviously true. Abiathar served David for the entirety of his reign of 40 years and had the privilege, along with Zadok, of carrying the Ark of the Covenant, the most sacred Jewish religious object. As a renowned priest, it is expected that in his days, the Law would be correctly observed [Casey, 151] and his name would invoke the honoring of the law. Jesus mentions Abiathar in order to say, in effect, \"In the time of Abiathar, who as a renowned priest was a real stickler for the law, and in whose days we would expect the law to be followed, David and his friends were allowed to do this; yet you say now that we can't do something similar? \n \n http://www.tektonics.org/tsr/abby.html",

How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the showbread...?\n \n \"In 1 Sam 21:1-6, Ahimelech, not his son Abiathar, was high priest. Matthew (12:4) and Luke (6:4) attempt to correct Mark's error.\"- NRSV\n\n \n \nNope. You have already been corrected on this (see previous posts).\n\n \n You have corrected nothing, EZ. However, I DO like the way you dance.\n \n I quoted to you above from the KJV. Let's look at a few other translations...\n \n Mark 2:26 how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest... - NASB\n \n Mark 2:26 - He entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest... - NRSV \n \n To which I give you the following...\n \n 1sam 21:1-3 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee? And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place. Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.\n \n As opposed to Mark's account, when David went to Nob seeking bread, he met not with Abiathar, but with Ahimelech, Abiathar's father. Ahimelech gave David sacred bread after David told Ahimelech that he was on a mission for Saul. Saul then accused Ahimelech of treason for assisting David and had him killed, along with the other priests of Nob. Abiathar escaped and went to David, who later appointed him priest.\n \n BTW, did you overlook this one...\n \n \nMt 23:35 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.\n \n Quoting the NRSV Study Bible...\n \n \"On the death of Zechariah, see 2 Chron 24:20-22.

So when Luke says 'when Quirinius was Governor', perhaps he doesn't really mean Governor; or perhaps he means before Quirinius was Governor; or perhaps, against all precedent, Quirinius was Governor twice; and so on.\n \n Having tortuously contrived the possibility of such an alternative, you then proclaim that alternative to be the obvious and incontrovertible explanation, and the bible to be inerrant after all.\n \n And the house of cards gets more precarious every time...",

   "here's my thoughts on the matter. jesus died on the friday. the duration of thursday night to friday morning was the the first day of the passover. jesus' last supper was held on the night that he was betrayed and arrested. the feast of the passover that year would begin at the beginning of sabbath, which would be the friday evening. jesus was tried early in the morning of friday, and executed by around midday. before 3 pm he died, and the thieves that were being hung with him had their legs broken to speed up their death. jesus and the other criminals crucified that day were taken down and buried well before sundown, at which time the passover feast would start. jesus remained dead for the entire duration of friday night and saturday day, and rose sometime before dawn (between 3am and 5am perhaps).\n \n the verse in matthew that is the cause of all this contention says that \"the son of man will be in the heart of the earth for 3 days and 3 nights, as was the prophet jonah\" (paraphrasing). the story of jonah is a peculiar one. he was a prophet that downright defied the direct command of god. god must have in extremely good humor those days, because not only did he not zap jonah into oblivion for his rebelliousness, god created an elaborate scenario, with a terrible storm that allegedly nearly destroyed the boat jonah was on, just so that jonah could be tossed overboard to end up in the belly of a huge fish (a whale, most likely?). now, the story goes on to say that jonah stayed in the belly of the fish for 3 days and 3 nights, praying to god, and at the end of that period the fish spit jonah out on the shore, near the town he was instructed to go to in the first place.\n \n obviously, you might ask, how in the heck could jonah know he was in the fish's belly for exactly 3 days and 3 nights? for all we know (if the event actually did happen) it could have just felt like this long. i mean, you could spend a single day in solitary confinement, in a wet, pressurized, pitch-black chamber, with nothing to eat or drink, and barely enough air to breathe, and think you were in there for a month. even the origin of the story could not have been a first hand account. the story was about jonah, but not written by jonah himself.\n \n the truth could have well been that jonah was probably thrown overboard and swam/got washed to shore, maybe semi-conscious and forgot how he got there. theories of how he got there and how long he was in his mode of transport might have spawned, and, being a superstitious people, anything, regardless of how illogical, was possible. the rest is history\n \n now in the new testament, where this story of jonah is bonafide scripture, the author of matthew seems to get a bit ambitious about jesus being the \"ultimate prophecy fullfiller\" and excitedly inserts a jonah reference as part of jesus' speech, including the invented \"3 day-3 night\" timeline from the jonah story. this is one of the many foot-in-the-mouth moments for the bible\n \n final verdict: jesus died on friday evening, rose on the 3rd day. the matthew verse was a blooper",

   "here's my thoughts on the matter. jesus died on the friday. the duration of thursday night to friday morning was the the first day of the passover. jesus' last supper was held on the night that he was betrayed and arrested. the feast of the passover that year would begin at the beginning of sabbath, which would be the friday evening. jesus was tried early in the morning of friday, and executed by around midday. before 3 pm he died, and the thieves that were being hung with him had their legs broken to speed up their death. jesus and the other criminals crucified that day were taken down and buried well before sundown, at which time the passover feast would start. jesus remained dead for the entire duration of friday night and saturday day, and rose sometime before dawn (between 3am and 5am perhaps).\n \n the verse in matthew that is the cause of all this contention says that \"the son of man will be in the heart of the earth for 3 days and 3 nights, as was the prophet jonah\" (paraphrasing). the story of jonah is a peculiar one. he was a prophet that downright defied the direct command of god. god must have in extremely good humor those days, because not only did he not zap jonah into oblivion for his rebelliousness, god created an elaborate scenario, with a terrible storm that allegedly nearly destroyed the boat jonah was on, just so that jonah could be tossed overboard to end up in the belly of a huge fish (a whale, most likely?). now, the story goes on to say that jonah stayed in the belly of the fish for 3 days and 3 nights, praying to god, and at the end of that period the fish spit jonah out on the shore, near the town he was instructed to go to in the first place.\n \n obviously, you might ask, how in the heck could jonah know he was in the fish's belly for exactly 3 days and 3 nights? for all we know (if the event actually did happen) it could have just felt like this long. i mean, you could spend a single day in solitary confinement, in a wet, pressurized, pitch-black chamber, with nothing to eat or drink, and barely enough air to breathe, and think you were in there for a month. even the origin of the story could not have been a first hand account. the story was about jonah, but not written by jonah himself.\n \n the truth could have well been that jonah was probably thrown overboard and swam/got washed to shore, maybe semi-conscious and forgot how he got there. theories of how he got there and how long he was in his mode of transport might have spawned, and, being a superstitious people, anything, regardless of how illogical, was possible. the rest is history\n \n now in the new testament, where this story of jonah is bonafide scripture, the author of matthew seems to get a bit ambitious about jesus being the \"ultimate prophecy fullfiller\" and excitedly inserts a jonah reference as part of jesus' speech, including the invented \"3 day-3 night\" timeline from the jonah story. this is one of the many foot-in-the-mouth moments for the bible\n \n final verdict: jesus died on friday evening, rose on the 3rd day. the matthew verse was a blooper\n\n \n Well now, I've provided evidence to the contrary about when Jesus died. But you're welcome to your opinions.\n \n As for how did Jonah know how long he was in the belly of the great fish? Can you on solid grounds state that, afterwards, God did not reveal it to him (since Jonah was a prophet and was able to communicate with God? Or better yet, that he knew which day he went overboard and then, by interaction with someone days later, found out what day that was? And then deduced it was 3 days by doing some very basic math? Not very difficult.\n \n p.s. Again, how about the \"Can\\'t see the forest for the trees\" award for those who miss the bigger picture: There is universal agreement in all 4 Gospels that Christ was resurrected!\n \n Jesus is Lord!",

Not very difficult.\n\n well, if you believe that god actually spoke to jonah in the first place, or that god was actually going to destroy ninevah and didnt, or that god caused an isolated local storm around a single boat, or that god ceased the storm immediately upon jonah hitting the water, or that god had a whale swallow jonah alive, then beach itself to vomit jonah out, then safely roll back into the sea, then its hardly far fetched to believe that god told jonah that he was in the fish's belly for exactly 3 days and 3 nights. remember, jonah was asleep in the bottom of the ship which was caught in the storm, and under a storm its difficult to tell what time of the day or night it is. but i digress\n \n jonah himself wasnt really that much of a prophet. the story has it that all he did was keep a city that wasnt destroyed from being destroyed. his ministry really didnt do anything to shape the history of the israeli nation whatsoever. not only that, but jonah was dissentful and unwilling at every stage of his mission, yet god humored him for his disobedience, very unlike the typical temperament of the old testament god. its quite likely that the entire story was made up. maybe jonah did jump on a ship and was never heard of again. maybe the city of ninevah was never destroyed by god. it would be very easy for superstitious people to put the 2 together and conclude that jonah must have miraculously made it to ninevah, and miraculously stopped god from destroying the city. i mean, ninevah is still standing? it must be a miracle!!!\n \n anyway easyrider, as of now you have not yet told us whether jesus died on a friday, and the 3 days/3 nights was a lie, or if jesus died on the thursday, and the last supper was a lie. jesus could have only did on one of these days. which is it?",
