No amount of anything will get anyone from either side to change what they think about this stuff.\n To the creationists: You are never going to convince the evolutionists. You know why? Because you're wrong.\n To the evolutionists: You are never going to convince the creationists. At least not in the forum (no pun intended). They are stubbornly willfully ignorant.\n I'm not jaded, there is just no movement on this stuff. Devote your time to other issues on here.",

   "that's not quite it. \n \n Creationists can't prove creationism because it doesn't have any real points to argue, nor does it have evidence. Creationist must prove creationism by attacking evolution, something they always do with lies or twisted facts. The evolutionist, for the most part, aren't dumb enough to fall for the lies, such as the moon dust theory, and prove these attacks are lies. Creationists don't accept any part of evolution, regardless of what is backing it.",

I, myself, am an example of this. I used to be a fundamentalist Christian. Although my doubts started for other reasons, it was my learning about the theory of evolution (and noticing how lame the creationist apologetics were) that were the final push, the reason why I could no longer believe in the fundamentalist view point.\n \n Even if the people with whom you are arguing are recalcitrant, as ungerdunn points out there are the lurkers, some of whom may be like I was.",

There are young earthers, there are neo-darwinists, there are intelligent design advocates and problably a plethora of agnostics (they haven't decided what reality is because for them the evidence leads to ambiguity rather than certainty). There are those who believe God created the material of the universe and programmed it to evolve, those who don't believe in God and those who adhere to a literal interpretation of scripture. Some creatonists are young earthers and others accept the scientifically discovered age (5 billion years I beleive) but still adhere to creation rather then evolution or perhaps more accurately accept micro evolution but not macro evolution. What facinates me is not so much the alleged ignorance of truth or facts but the emotional investment of devoutly religious people. They don't seem to resent the rejection of creation as much as what they percieve to be a contempt for their religious devotion.",
