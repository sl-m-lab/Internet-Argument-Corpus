They are not willing to have the rights of good people restricted, but wish to see fewer guns go to criminals. \n \n End guessing.\n \n What I don't understand is all the laws necessary are already in place to stop criminals from getting guns.

I don't know their demographics.\n \n I would agree that if the majority of Americans really o favor more gun control, they certainly aren't being very vocal about it. It hs been said that Gore lost the presidential election because of his vocal support of gun control.\n \n Even if the majority of Americans DO want more gun control, who cares? THis isn't a democracy, it is a constitutional republic. Unless they can caught up enough votes for a constitutional ammendment, it doesn't mean anything. \n \n This is the problem with the GG's. RAther than taking the proper steps if they wish to outlaw firearms, which would be to move for a constitutional ammendment, they are committed to chiseling away at our rights a bit at a time. They try to convince us that the second ammendmnet does not mean what it clearly says. They need to GROW SOME SPINES. IF you can't stand up, say what you want, and get what you get, you should just shut up and sit down. \n \n They know they cannot enact a gun ban or even strict gun control under hte framework of American Democracy, so they try to go through the back door so to speak.",

I don't know their demographics.\n \n\n It's an excellent point that we don't know the demographics of those surveys (one was done by Harris). I went to the ICPSR website that allows you to analyze survey data. I know that the General Social Survey attempts to be nationally representative. They asked over 900 people the following question in 2002:\n \n \"Would you favor or oppose a law which would require a person \n to obtain a police permit before he or she could buy a gun?\"\n \n I was shocked to see that 80.5% said they were in favor of that. I think there is an impulse among many Americans to regulate gun ownership, but I think that most of the people willing to decide to vote one way or the other based on the control issue are pro-gun people. \n \n And Sinjin, there are roughly 100 million gun owners in the U.S., owning a total of 400 million guns. Confiscation polls very poorly--any discussion of taking away guns is purely academic. It is not politically feasible. \n \n Presumably we could prevent a lot of gun thefts if we educated gun owners on how common these thefts are, and educated them on ways to secure their guns against theft. For example, keeping them in a locked gun safe would thwart many burglars. Most burglars are teens looking for loose, easily accessible valuables. Why is first impulse for so many Americans to coerce other people's activities?\n \n Anti-gun people ignore the fact the guns are used by law-abiding people to scare off criminals hundreds of thousands of times a year, probably as often, if not more often, than the number of times guns are used to commit crimes. The point is to take guns away from criminals; guns in the hands of responsible people prevent crime.",

I live out in the sticks, and there has been a rash of burglaries around here lately during the day when people aren't around. One of the things they have been taking is guns.
