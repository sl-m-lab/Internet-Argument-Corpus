   "A national retail sales tax? GREAT IDEA!\n Aim for goals of liberty\n \n By HERMAN CAIN\n Published on: 09/24/04\n \n The most popular of the various national retail sales tax plans is called the FairTax. It is in both houses of Congress today as HB 25 and SB 1493. It is a replacement, not an add-on, for the federal income tax and for federal payroll taxes collected to fund Social Security and Medicare.\n \n The FairTax provides a dollar-for-dollar replacement of all revenues now collected through such taxes and eliminates the need for annual and quarterly income tax filings, the surveillance by the federal government of wages and investment income and the need for anyone to hire an expert in order to comply with federal tax laws.\n \n The FairTax is a progressive tax. The biggest-spending wealthy will pay an effective tax of $23 for every $77 they spend on new products and services. The poorest get money back. American families would receive a monthly refund equaling the amount of sales tax a poverty-level family would normally pay.\n \n As such, the FairTax eliminates federal taxes on the poor, including highly regressive Social Security taxes. This automatic refund won't mean much to the wealthy but will be quite significant to low- and moderate-income families and to those on fixed incomes. Everyone receives the refund, including the wealthy, in order to eliminate both means testing for the poorest Americans and the need to track earnings for everyone.\n \n The FairTax has no exemptions, no shelters and no complex tax dodges available primarily to the wealthy and special-interest groups. The only thing every taxpayer can know about the current tax code is that it is an 8-million-word mess that no one has ever read. But even a child can understand the 13 words that define the FairTax: \"The FairTax is applied to all new goods and services delivered at retail.\"\n \n The FairTax captures billions of dollars of revenues currently lost in the underground economy. Even drug dealers would pay their share of taxes when they purchase goods and services. The simple fact is, the more money one spends under the FairTax, the more consumption taxes one pays. Those who buy luxury items pay more; those who live more modestly pay less.\n \n The FairTax also eliminates the IRS' unwelcome surveillance of every penny of income earned, loaned, won or invested by American citizens. In place of the huge bureaucracy created to collect federal taxes, the FairTax uses the states' sales tax infrastructure to collect taxes at the point of retail sale.\n \n The intrusive interest from our government into citizens' financial status is eliminated overnight.\n \n We can achieve the dream of upward economic mobility for all if we first believe our goal is attainable. The FairTax - truly an issue that delivers on the promise of individual liberty - will survive the distortions of presidential politics, and with a demanding public, the FairTax will achieve the congressional passage and a signature from the White House. It all starts with telling the public the truth and believing we can change things. I believe.\n \n \u0095 Herman Cain also has served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and as CEO of Godfather's Pizza. He recently ran for the U.S. Senate from Georgia.\n \n Herman Cain has served as chairman of the board of the National Restaurant Association.\n \n Find this article at: \n http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/0904/24cain.html",
