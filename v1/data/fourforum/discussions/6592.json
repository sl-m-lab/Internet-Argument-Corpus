   "President of Georgia M. Saakashvili is about to consolidate constitutionally his right for political prosecution of Georgia nationals (see ]Labor party of Georgia: Saakashvili should not win Nobel Peace Prize). According to this, any oppositional activity in Georgia will soon switch from political sphere into that of criminal responsibility. \n \n Saakashvili has given instructions to Georgian Parliament (being fully liable to Saakashvili) to work out \"Concept for national consensus\". According to Saakashvili, this document will enable Georgia to establish its main priorities for development and national security (including territorial integrity of Georgia within borders before Georgian-Abkhazian and Georgian-South Ossetian conflicts). Next step is to be adoption of a law assigning responsibility of every Georgia national for deviation from national \"Concept\". Suchwise, the new law will branch out to all residents of independent Abkhazia and South Ossetia and will also enable Saakashvili to lawfully counteract claims of Armenian and Azerbaijani national minorities displeased with oppression by Saakashvili regime.",

   "The classical scheme to kill to birds with one stone is now what president of Georgia Saakashvili is trying to resort to. Dirty dancing with Ankara forced Georgian president to give Djavakh lands occupied by ethnic Armenias to let Turks meshetins come and settle down there! You can't picture what could happen here in case of corrupt eviction but for some special! Simultaneously with clearing the erea Saakashvili plans to create new training camps for Islam terrorists there. Those terrorists will be the tool for inhibition separative moods among Djavakh Armenians!",

   "Weird idea, it is to make confederation state Georgia + Azerbaijan. It's been not once voiced by Georgian president Saakashvili and USA have been clearly highly supportive of it. I've already stumbled across some articles in American and European mass media cherishing the project. By no doubt such extensive PR could have been sponsored only by rich America. \n \n What's their grand idea, I wonder? I guess the guys in Washington are feeling really knackered by huge appetite of Saakashvili and his suite. Georgia indeed comes rather costly to USA with the perspective of any sizeable progress in democracy and economics not available. Perhaps much better doing Azerbaijan is able to drastically improve things in Georgia in framework of confederation. Frankly, that makes my friends in Baku somewhat uneasy. They are also scary of Azerbaijan's independence severely reduced in the result. They say in case of confederation Azeri president Aliev could be more ruled from the overseas. \n I think that confederation project undermines relationship between USA and Azerbaijan.",

   "Bio weapons are back\n \n I've recently learned from a reporter that US military have built a bio lab not far from the capital of the Republic of Georgia in the village of Alexeyevka. And it appears they gonna test some new generation of biological weapons there!! \n Can't they really understand that they put all Europe in jeopardy by acting so foolishly? Well... it's not that no one knows about Georgia's president being a bit off his pannikin and that he really can go all length so as to return the breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia. While voila here's such a perfect opportunity to get rid of the annoying people inhabiting the regions! I'm sure he expects that Americans will either let him use the weapons or will do it themselves - those devils can do it... well they have nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki, haven't they... Besides it will have absolutely no effect on them 'cause they live on a far away continent while here in Europe we'll have to clear up the mess after their crazy experiments. \n Frankly guys I've got no desire to do this...",

   "Isn't the West (western governments and private business) doing careless indeed in Georgia now? Lots of money is stuffed into Georgia staying somewhat unclear so far. Even Georgians themselves admit Georgian leadership is not quite relevant as it is. \n Some oppositional Georgian leader has lately voiced his concern over the current political course of Georgia. Indeed, Saakashvili claims his adherence to western democracy and at the same time he is highly supportive of the \"last European dictator\" Lukashenko and is building closer relationship with Iran, a known American foe! Georgian opposition is sure Saakashvili is evidently after establishing dictatorship regime in Georgia!\n Dictatorship is no match for free business development, you see. Why are we staying blind and deaf to these warnings, I wonder? Looks really weird! I think our pols just allow too much to Saakashvili...\n What now? I'm sure western business community must just reevaluate current risks in Georgia and maybe even start curtailing business in this country till better time arrives....",
