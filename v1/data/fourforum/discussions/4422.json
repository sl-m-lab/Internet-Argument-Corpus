   "I'm a bit ignorant on this topic since I don't live in the US, but I recently caught the end of a program which reported that a church political group had successfully campaigned to force the removal of \"FCUK\" products from being sold in the US. The product was permitted to re-enter the market after its packaging was replaced with the unabbreviated title.\n \n While I don't doubt that the company had intended there would be some controversy (which is always good advertising), I wonder if some representative groups aren't being a little over sensitive?\n \n Given the amount of uncensored violence and sex that is freely presented throughout every corner of our environment, surely this was a pointless exercise? Or is this an important \"win\" for those that would seek to impose their moral views on the rest of society?",
