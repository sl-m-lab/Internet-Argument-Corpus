   "I'd say even calling the Bible a \"book\" is a stretch. It's more like an anthology of some ancient Hebrew and Christian writings. If it was a book, it wouldn't make much sense, as there are chapters and chapters of laws that are later made irrelevant, the main character (\"God\"), is terribly inconsistant and doesn't really develop at all, it jumps around all over the place geographically, historically and philosophically, etc. For example, what's with the whole section describing various boils and step-by-step treatment?

   "Any boob who really studied the Bible knows that much of it, especially the Old Testament was \"handed down\" through Oral Tradition -- because -- duh, they didn't have computers, typewriters, pens, paper or even understand the notion of \"recording\" anything except perhaps by drawing (eg heiroglyphics), so they relayed history through the generations by word of mouth. \n \n Someone had the audacity (or the undiagnosed mental illness) of saying \"God spoke to me and told me to tell you this.\"\n \n Ever play \"Story Down the Lane\"? Enough said on how distorted a \"law\" can get.\n \n People obviously experimented and construed hypotheses on what happens if you copulate with a woman (pregnancy occurs and regeneration) or with another man (nothing but its own pleasure), or with an animal (nothing or at least a dead animal), by \"spilling your seed into the dirt\" (again, nothing).\n \n THe whole idea was to preserve the species.\n We need not be so desperate to preserve our species anymore.",

Nothing is outdated simply because it's old. \n \n \n And excuse me, but your qoeting the Old Testement. I am a Christian. So the Old Testement is important, but I have been freed from all those little rules by Christ. Jesus himself didn't wash his hands before he ate, contrary to the law of the day. {Gasp!} That means he broke the law right? And he was supposed to be Sinless! But he IS God. So he didn't or doesn't need to follow all the little rules in order to be allowed to worship God. And by being purified by his sacrafice, we too are freed from having to follow all the little rules.\n \n \n This argument jsut doesn't cut it for me.

The bible, although it contains some wisdom, is an outdated book that promotes racism, antisemitism, and homophobia.\n\n ================\n What Christians need to understand is that the Holiness Code (back half of Exodus, then Lev., Num., Deut.) detail cermonial and ritual law. \n \n While they were very specific and pretty detail the state of sinful man, there is no record anyone kept them consistently. Hence, the sacrificial system and Day of Atonement. The law does not save nor qualify anyone for fitness before God. It never did, never does and never will. This is shown from the OT all the way up throught he writings of Paul. No one is saved by the law.\n \n Christ never used the law as a prerequisite for being in communion with Him. Instead, he extened his hospitality to the people most consdered the dregs of humanity. The prostitues, tax collectors and lepers of His day are the addicts, aids victims, homosexuals and traitors of today.\n \n The often practice of Christians to use the law as a way of seperating themselves from the rest of sinful humanity is done in error, I believe. The law, I thought, was to reveal how much we are all the same before God.\n \n MC",
