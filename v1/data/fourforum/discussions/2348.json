Sony has just come out with an $800 miniature double mike digital recorder that fits in your pocket. The mikes are sensitive to different frequencies and combined, their signals more truly represent the actual recorded sound with greater sensitivity on both ends of the frequency spectrum. On the mini model, the mikes are nearly touching each other but they are in separate holders.\n \n There was a group on Austin City Limits several weeks back using double mikes about 4 inches apart with the singers \"lipped up\" to the upper mike. I don't know that I can tell the difference despite a blindfold, but I've never been able to tell the differences between quality systems with slightly different %WOW either.

   "Awww C'mon Jim, you should know me better than that.emoticon_cry I AM the Truthsayer.\n \n But on that note, I just got a new digital camera for Christmas (about time huh?) If I could figure a way to upload those photos I suppose I could show you some pictures.\n \n One of my Mackie systems is installed at one of my accounts but Mark (FoH engineer) runs it for me each week. One of my other FoH guys is currently building a new website for my production company (Roadwarrior Productions) and as soon as that gets up I post ya a link.\n \n This Yamaha system I bought a few months ago has only been out a few times. Maybe, (I dunno,) but maybe one of the bands I mixed has a photo of me and the system. I'll check.\n \n Yes, I did go and snag the photos above from another website. But I was just wanting to share with the board something we all seem to have in common.\n \n But here is a piccy of me on my P-bass last year in Milwaukee. I love that thing. http://www.boogiemart.com/sitebuilder/images/Summerfest_best_friends-150x101.png The other guy in the yellow, (the one even fatter than me,) has been playing with me for almost 15 years (we started together back when we both skinny.)\n \n Found another piccy of me at \"Country Jam\" in Eau Claire WI, when we palyed the side stage next to Travis Tritt, Diamond Rio, Kelly Koffee (sp?) Charlie Daniels a couple of years back. That guitar is my Peavey Cirrus. We were the only rock band there but it seemed to go over well. http://www.boogiemart.com/sitebuilder/images/100_0249-150x112.jpg\n \n Here's a piccy of a band I did in Lyons, WI last Halloween (Noise Pollution.) One of my mains is in the background. http://members.aol.com/chrisrocker/NoisePollutionRocks/PastShows/20051029/img27.jpg I'll see if I can find some more\n \n Here's some eye-candy from that same gig for you guys!!! The mic in the picture is a Shure Beta-58 (which I use for vocal mic's) I use SM57's for instruments and Beta 52 for kick and some Sennsenheimer (sp?) for rack toms. http://members.aol.com/chrisrocker/NoisePollutionRocks/PastShows/20051029/img75.jpg\n \n Here's a shot especially for you Jim at the same gig.http://members.aol.com/chrisrocker/NoisePollutionRocks/PastShows/20051029/img81.jpg hahahahaha!!!!\n \n A better shot at one of the mains (same gig) http://members.aol.com/chrisrocker/NoisePollutionRocks/PastShows/20051029/img87.jpg\n \n Another one....http://members.aol.com/chrisrocker/NoisePollutionRocks/PastShows/20051029/img98.jpg\n \n I'll keep lookin' around.emoticon_xgood",
