North Carolina II, 325 U.S. 226 (1945), the Supreme Court upheld North Carolina's right to prosecute for bigamy two North Carolina domiciliaries who traveled to Nevada to divorce their respective spouses and to then marry one another.

Lanham, 117 N.W. 787 (Wisc. 1908) (plaintiffs, who were prohibited from getting married in Wisconsin because law prohibited marriage within one year of divorce, were married in Michigan and returned to Wisconsin; Wisconsin held that marriage was not valid, since it violated\n Wisconsin's public policy\n\n To go along with the above case:\n \njudicial award in a tort or contract case. The state has a right to take into account its local \"public policy.\"\n Among the types of marriages that have been denied recognition are:\n \u0095 Marriages between cousins, or between uncles and nieces;11\n \u0095 Polygamous marriages;12 and\n \u0095 Marriages by an individual who was very recently divorced.13 \n",
