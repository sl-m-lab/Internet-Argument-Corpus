   "Prominent rabbi has supported the killings of Palestinian civilians by Israeli occupation troops in the Gaza Strip, saying killing non-Jewish civilians is compatible with religious laws\n \n Rabbi Dov Lior \"The law of our Torah is to have mercy on our soldiers and to save them. This is the real moral behind Israel's Torah and we must not feel guilty due to foreign morals,\" the Ma'ariv Israeli newspaper quoted him as saying\n \n \"...a thousand non-Jewish lives are not worth a Jew's fingernail\"\n Rabbi Dov Lior\n ------\n \n Well this seems like religious fundamentalism at his most pristine. Shining sparkling and unfortunately the voice of the right wing and many of the moderates. This creed of religious fundamentalism and the belief of being the \"chosen ones\" has gone to far. Israel must not feel obliged to foreign morals aka international law. They must disregard the people they were created by, the U.N. Israel must brush off the global community because killing is necessary (wouldn't that make suicide bombings necessary, because no life is above Palestinian life). Reparations for the Holocaust must be sought, but reparations for their genocide will never be given. I love the arrogance of Zionism, of religious fundamentalism, to believe that your god has instilled you the right to destruction, to hate, to the torture of innocent human beings. As an American I stand deathly afraid of Al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism, but sadly Zionism has killed many more. This idea that sending missiles into crowded rallies is any different than bombing pizza parlors is ridiculous. Oh wait there is a difference, one is ordered by extremists (Hamas) and one is ordered by Sharon and Mofaz under the State of Israel. Oh how I do love that democracy. \n \n Remi",

   "Additionally, last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Israel faces negative growth and rising unemployment that would hit 10.7 percent this year and 10.9 percent next year. The IMF predicted that Israel's gross domestic product would contract by 1.5 percent this year. It also forecasts an inflation rate of 6.2 percent this year and 3 percent in 2003. Combined with the bleak global economic scene, these numbers should be ringing many bells within Israel.\n\n \n COnsidering a 2.4% annual population growth, plus a trade deficit of 12%, an inflation rate of 5.7% (and that is an optomistic number) amd the fact that last year they lost half a percent in their GDP, I would say that it is definatly time for the US to step in once again and bail out his pathetic little ME country which cannot survive on its own. Of course, we can't really afford to do this, since our own economy is in the toilet, but we will probably do it anyway. After all, by the time the deficti has to be paid, the guys who are in office now will have been replaced. We can leave the next generation to deal with the mess.",

   "Not every Israeli is a Zionist. The extremists in Israel need to be brought to heel.\n\n \n Agreed. Unfortunately, a majority support Sharon's policies for not just their basic Zionist philosophies, but because every government, the US included, waves the flag and going against the image of patriotism is difficult for a majority of people to comprehend. Sharon's current policy of razing refuge camps and personal property while killing civilians on what seems to be a random basis may put the situation in a position of being irretrievable for a peaceful settlement. A great number of Palestinians cross the 'border' into Israel everyday to work and people can only be pushed just so far. Too many generations have been raised on hate for it just go away. I feel Israel's current strategy is to fence in as much of what they now control as possible, eliminate resistance leadership, demoralize the remaining Palestinian population to a point of sub-severance and establish a fortress type mentality. As Israel is desperate for foreign investment, they feel, IMO, that type of stability will encourage world bankers to open their purse strings. Shows how little they actually know about bankers who have been burned by virtually every type of ME 'stability' not backed by oil as collateral. We'll continue to subsidize Israel until we reach our own financial crisis.",

One hting you can be certian of is that if it is the AJ web page, they have video or recordings to go with it. This is one thing I like about their channel. They are well aware of the fact that their crdibility is in question, so they make sure that in addition to the talking heads, they have video or pictures to back up every story and they don;t tend to sensationalise things.\n \n Since theri spin is not 100% pro American, you get more accurate stories in many cases. Do you rememebr when they pulled down the statue of saddam? THe American press showed all these tight angle shots and led you to believe that this was a huge group of people. AJ showed the wide angle shots of teh square, and you saw right away that it was 50 people, tops. \n \n I don't want to see a new chanel being used as a propoganda outlet.
