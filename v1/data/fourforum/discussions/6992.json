   "Trebor?\n \n Are you scholarly enough to hold forth on this topic?\n \n \n. . . . Buber realized that human existence is determined by two fundamentally different kinds of relation: I-It relations and I-Thou relations. It is characteristic for I-Thou relations that only in them real encounter happens when all is left behind, all preconceptions, all reservedness is given up, when one fully engages in the encounter with the other and carries on a real dialogue with him.\n \n The relation to the Thou is immediate.\n \n Between I and Thou there is no terminology, no preconception and no imagination, and memory itself changes, since it plunges from singularity into the whole.\n \n Between I and Thou there is no purpose, no greed and no anticipation; and longing itself changes, since it plunges from dream into appearance. . . .\nhttp://www.buber.de/en/dialogue_trust.shtml\n \n I dare not tread upon this land.

   "Jesus was and is a radical, leftist liberal. \n\n \n <chortle<\n \n Was Jesus a liberal? (BTW, don't confuse political conservatism / liberalism with Biblical conservatism / liberalism.) \n \n As God, Jesus is the one who gave Moses the Levitical law against gay sex to begin with; and he's the one who inspires all Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16), including Romans 1:26-27 and I Corinthians 6:9-10. He's the one who knits together babies in their mother's wombs (Psalm 139:13) that you liberals love to butcher. He's the one who said to the adulteress, \"Go and sin no more'. Liberals often say there is no sin, and they'll do whoever they want, any way they want, whenever they want, and will do them with pride. Jesus is the one who says a man shall reap what he sows, as opposed to the liberals' greedy \"redistribution of wealth\" scheme, which says that people should reap for a living what other people sow. And Jesus is the one in the Book of Revelation who judges wicked sinners and sends them to the Lake of Fire. Liberals would never cast judgments, unless they're talking to a conservative, and then they turn into Mr. Judgmental themselves. And if liberals could recognize evil at all they'd either show tolerance towards it, endlessly debate it at the U.N., or appease it until the cows came home. Jesus a liberal? Get real.\n \n And for the record, Jesus \"conserved\" the law of God in his day. It was the corrupt pharisees, etc., who took (liberal) \"liberties\" with it to begin with.",

Otherwise you are taking just as many possible liberties, by using cultural traditions as a framework to interpret the Word of God.

The idea of God as some sort of cosmic bean counter who has a score to settle and who wants to see the books balanced using a barbaric method makes no sense to me. It makes sense, IMO, only if viewed as an attempt by Jesus' early followers to justify his untimely death.

   "Rather than truly embrace \"freedom\", liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses which are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, seek to prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools, embrace an unconstitutional, de-facto litmus test against possible pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, seek to squelch religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws, and generally engage in a whole range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values.

   "So let's be clear on this: there is to be no physical second coming, accompanied by angels and divine judgement etc? That's fine by me, but a lot of your fellow evangelicals are going to feel let down.\n\n \n Yes, EasyRider finds himself once again in a pickle! But that's the \"beauty\" of the Holy Bible: one can quote from it to prove X is true, and later quote from it to prove X is false!\n \n This seems like an opportune time to repost something I did a while ago, seeing as how it is the current topic of discussion and even uses some of the same verses.\n \n \n \n[Jesus said,] \"For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ... At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.\"\n \n \"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.\" \n (Matthew 24:27, 30-34)\n \n\n \n But clearly, that generation, and a great many others since, have passed away without the second coming of Jesus. Here we have not only an example of a false Biblical prophecy, but one spoken by Jesus himself. Jesus is a false prophet!\n \n Some have tried to get around this embarrassing predicament by saying that the original word that was translated as \"generation\" could also be translated as \"race\", such that \"I tell you the truth, this [race] will not pass away until all these things have happened.\" Is there any reason to doubt this attempt to avoid Jesus being a false prophet? Yes. The Bible - in fact, the very same book in it, the book of Matthew - makes it clear that Jesus meant generation, as in the people currently alive when He made the statement, and not race.\n \n \nThen Jesus said to his disciples, ... \"For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with the angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\"\n (Matthew 16:24, 27-28)\n \n\n \n We see Jesus make the same general claim in both the book of Mark and the book of Luke:\n \n \n[Then Jesus said to his disciples and the crowd,] \"If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels\". \n \n And he said to them, \"I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.\"\n (Mark 8:38 - 9:1)\n \n\n \n and:\n \n \n[Then Jesus said to them all,] \"If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.\"\n (Luke 9:26-27)\n \n\n \n So Jesus's prophecy failed. What does the Bible itself, back in Deuteronomy, tells us about people who foretell prophecies that fail to come true?\n \n \n[The Lord God said,] \"You may say to yourselves, 'How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the Lord?' If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true, that is a message the Lord has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously.\"\n (Deuteronomy 18:21-22)\n \n\n \n So the Lord God Himself tells us that Jesus does not speak for Him. But worse, for Jesus, is what the previous verse tells us should be done to a false prophet like Jesus.\n \n \n[The Lord God said to me,] \"... a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded him to say, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, must be put to death.\"\n (Deuteronomy 18:20)\n \n",

A malakh is a messenger, either human or angelic. Yet there is one (divine) malakh who stands out from all the rest. The Bible calls him simply, \"THE angel of the Lord.\" Whenever you see this \"angel\" / messenger in the Old Testament, he is acting, talking, or doing \"Divine\" things. Case in point:\n \n Zech. 3:1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him.\n 2 And the Lord said to Satan, \"The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\"\n 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the Angel. 4 Then He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, \"Take away the filthy garments from him.\" And to him He said, \"See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you with rich robes\" (note Isaiah 61:10 and the \"robe of righteousness\").\n \n Many more examples in the links below.

It cannot be an ordinary angel but only the Spirit of the Lord Himself manifest in the flesh as a pre-incarnate appearance of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n \n Let's examine the biblical evidence:\n \n Genesis 16 -- After Hagar fled into the wilderness to escape from Sarah, Abraham's wife, the Angel of the Lord promised to greatly multiply her descendants and prophesied the birth of Ishmael, who became the progenitor on the Arab nations.\n \n Genesis 22 -- read by Jews every Yom Kippur, it is the Angel of the Lord who called from heaven to stay the hand of Abraham as he took the knife to slay his son Isaac.\n \n Genesis 32:30 -- Jacob wrestled with a \"man\" during the night who blessed the patriarch and changed his name to Israel. Jacob responded by calling the place of this encounter Peniel, saying, 'it is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.' Jacob identified the \"Man\" as God.\n \n Genesis 48:15,16 -- when Jacob blessed his son Joseph and his children, he said, \"The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my Shepherd all my life to this day, the Angel who has delivered me from all harm.\"\n \n Exodus 3:2 -- The Angel of the Lord appeared to Moses in the midst of a burning bush but then in verse 4, \"God (the Father) called to Him from within the bush.\"\n \n Exodus 13:21 -- When the Lord delivered the children of Israel from Egypt, the Bible says, \"By day the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light.\"\n \n Exodus 14:19 -- He was in the pillar of cloud guiding the Israelites through the wilderness after their flight from Egypt. The \"Angel of God,\" who had been traveling in front of Israel's army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them, coming in between the armies of Egypt and Israel. And then in verse 24 we are told that the Lord looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and cloud, and fought against Egypt! Who is involved in this pillar - the Angel of the Lord or God Himself? They must, in context, be one and the same.\n \n Numbers 22:22-35 -- He appeared to Balaam, the pagan prophet, and gave him orders, even commanding the donkey to speak.\n \n Joshua 5:13-15 -- \"The Man with a Sword in His Hand\" is humbly identified as \"Commander of the Army of the LORD.\" Joshua fell to his face and worshipped Him and called Him \"My Lord.\" Ironically, Joshua in Greek means JESUS.\n \n Judges 6 -- This same Christophany told Gideon to deliver Israel from Midian. The Angel of the Lord appeared to a timid Gideon and sat down under an oak tree to initiate a conversation with him (vss. 11,12).

In verse 16, the conversation continues, but in verse 20, it is the Angel of God who is in conversation. The next verse relates that a miracle is performed by the angel.

Scholarship on the subject presently vacillates between a late first century and an early to mid-second century date for Luke's writings.\" I would throw my lot in with those who favor a late first century date. If the Acts of the Apostles were written in the mid second century, it is hard to understand why there would be no mention or even cognizance of the epistles of Paul, which were being quoted as authoritative by writers before that time, especially since Acts has thousands of words devoted to recording things about the life of Paul, unlike Justin Martyr (whose apologies don't quote Paul). The idea that Acts didn't mention the letters of Paul because they were in Marcionite use (as is plausible for Justin) founders on the unity of the Luke-Acts composition. And, of course, if the author of Acts was a companion of Paul, it is improbable to place it very long after the turn of the century, even if St. Luke lived to the ripe old age of eighty-four in Boeotia as the Anti-Marcionite Prologue avers. I have not done enough research to come to a conclusion on whether Luke used Josephus' Antiquities, which would demand a date after 93 CE. Marcion had a form of the Gospel of Luke from which he derived his Gospel of the Lord, which sets an upper bound of around 130 CE. A date for Luke-Acts in the 90s of the first century or first decade of the second would account for all the evidence, including the alleged use of Josephus and the apparent authorship by a sometime companion of Paul. If Luke did not use Josephus, a date in the 80s is permissible.\n \n\n \n This is from the link http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/luke.html\n \n So, while it MIGHT be true that Luke was completed before the first century, it is also feasible it was not.",
