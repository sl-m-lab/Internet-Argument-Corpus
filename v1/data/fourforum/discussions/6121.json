The question you pose, though, is the crucial one; and the answer has to be that a process of evolution, almost certainly (but not necessarily exclusively) involving natural selection, is the best hypothesis we have, in terms of closeness of fit with observation and experiment.\n \n As has been pointed out to creationists countless times, speciation has been observed: it is not the pie-in-the-sky fantasy that creationist literature scoffs at.\n \n As to the stats with which bushalltheway started this thread, odds calculations like this have been batted around in creationist publications for decades. A lot of them stem from a Scientific American article from August 1954 by George Wald, who calculated the odds against the specific amino acid sequence of an enzyme coming together by chance. Needless to say, the odds are absurdly small - we're in monkeys-typing-Shakespeare territory here - but as no contemporary theory for the origin of life envisages enzymes forming in that fashion they are also wholly irrelevant. Unfortunately, Wald also gave creationists a huge boost with this quote, which you will find on creo sites all over the web:\n \n \nI think a scientist has no choice but to approach the origin of life through a hypothesis of spontaneous generation . . . One has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede that the spontaneous generation of a living organism is impossible. Yet here we are as a result, I believe, of spontaneous generation.\n\n \n This is cited time and again as 'proof' that scientific theories of non-theistic abiogenesis (and thus, in the creationist mind, of evolution as well, as they seem incapable of separating them) are as much a matter of 'faith' as their own theistic notions. What Wald intended, I suspect, was to point up how inadequate models of abiogenesis were in his day; what he achieved, sadly, was a huge propaganda boost for the creationists.",

What he's looking for is something from you saying why you think that it's true, especially when there is such a huge amount of data saying that it can't possibly be. Alternatively, you could explain why you think evolution is false, despite the huge pile of evidence saying it's true. And here's the critical part, the part you really need to try to understand. \"Because the Bible says so\" is insufficient, unless you already believe it's true. If someone doesn't believe in a literal Genesis, then telling them \"cause the Bible says so\" will carry as much weight as \"cause a fortune cookie said so\". If you just want to say \"I don't agree\" than that's fine. If you're going to tell people \"You're wrong\" then you need to back it up with something meaningful, or lose all credibility. And that's not just in these forums, you'll find that that's true all through your life.\n \n P.S.\n I've had no luck tracking down that article. Are you sure you got the date right?",

How does that prove that God created the Universe just 10,000 years ago as described in Genesis? You do know that there are other religions with their own creation myths, don't you? How does 'proving evolution' wrong automatically dismiss all of the other supernatural tales of creation and leave only yours? It doesn't. So your whole logic is flawed.\n \n \n \n Second, something interesting I ran across tonight that relates to your throwing in the towel and rejecting science in favor of mystical powers.\n \n \n\"Driesch's goal was to explain [embryonic] development in terms of the laws of physics and mathematics. ... This strikingly modern concept of nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction and nuclear equivalence eventually caused Driesh to abandon science. Because the embryo could be subdivided into parts that were each capable of re-forming the entire organism, he could no longer envision it as a physical machine. In other words, Driesch had come to believe that development could not be explained by physical forces. Harking back to Aristotle, he invoked a vital force, entelechy (\"internal gola-directed force\"), to explain how development proceeds. Essentially, he believed that the embryo was imbued with an internal psyche and the wisdom to accomplish its goals despite the obstacles embryologists placed in its path. Unable to explain his results in terms of the physics of his day, Driesch renounced the study of developmental physiology and became a philosophy professor, proclaiming vitalism (the doctrin that living things cannot be explained by physical forces alone) until his death in 1941.\" (Developmental Biology: Seventh Edition, Scott F. Gilbert, Sinaur Associates Inc., 2003, p61,62) \n\n \n It's sad to see such a great scientific mind turn to mush - mysticism - when running across something that is CURRENTLY unexplainable. \n \n Behe might want to take note :-)",

You were hoping that the emergence of the first cell would be that point, now you're going all the way back to the big bang.

Or do you really believe that there is a race of bat boys living on the moon?\n \n Can you show me the archaeological evidence that Moses parted the Red Sea? Ooops, make that the sea of reeds, since the Red Sea is a mistranslation of the original. \n \n Can you show me the archaeological evidence that the Earth was created in just six days? Nope.\n \n Can you show me the archaeological evidence that fruit bearing trees appeared on Earth before animals? Nope.\n \n Can you show me the archaeological evidence that confirms a world-wide Noahkian deluge? Nope.\n \n \n \nNidder1: The life of Jesus is well documented history.\n\n \n But the Gospels tell different stories about him, so the documentation is not internally consistent. For example:\n \n The book of Matthew states that when Jesus died on the cross, dead people rose up out of their graves and went into the city. \n \n \nAnd when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.\n \n At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people. (Matther 27:50-53) \n\n \n Gee, don't you think that something as astonishing a dead people coming back to life, coming out of their tombs, and going into the city would be noteworthy enough for at least one of the other 3 gospels writers to at least mention it? \n \n \n \n The gospel of Matthew also tells that an angel, in a grand theatrical manner, rolled back the stone blocking the entrance to Jesus's burial cave when the women arrived.\n \n \nAfter the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.\n \n There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.

It is know that this is a huge question, and one that is still being answered. What you don't seem to know is that the science of evolution doesn't address that question at all, and was never intended to.

Nothing you said here gives us any reason to think that any huge leap of faith is required to understand or believe it.\n \n Now on to your first point, the validity of the Bible. Most of your arguments can be boiled down to this statement, \"Some of the Bible is true, therefore all of the Bible is true.\" I believe that this is a fair summary of your position, and I believe that once it's stated that way it becomes fairly obvious that that conclusion does not logically follow. If I've mistated your argument please feel free to correct me. As to your last point, the millions of Christians, I must point out that there are more non-Christians than Christians, so if you're going strictly by numbers I'm afraid that Christianity loses.

   "OK I've been racking my brains (and the net) for some creationist arguments for my Devil's Advocate position.\n Unsurprisigly, there is no evidence FOR creation except Genesis, so I can't really go with that.\n There is, however, some apparent evidence AGAINST evolution: the concept of \"Irreducible complexity\" (IC). An early example used in this argument was the human eye. The proponents argued that the eye was so complex, with so many interdependent and essential parts to make it work that it could not have evolved stage by stage. The eye has since been discredited as an example of IC as we have examples of all kinds of creatures with all kinds of eyes, from light-sensitive patches all the way through various stages of complexity to our own, amazing eyes.\n However the IC proponents still have some examples going for them, the best known is the bacterial flagellum, a description of which can be found here:\n http://id-www.ucsb.edu/fscf/library/origins/graphics-captions/Flagellum.html\n \n Unfortunately, in the course of researching IC, I have found far more research that debunks it than that supports it. The central (and seemingly stand-alone) text for IC is Michal Behe's Darwin's Black Box. Simply by googling \"Irreducible complexity\" I found, for example, one site with three links to articles which show IC to be, if not disproven, certainly unproven, and quite likely to be disproven in the near future.\n http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/icdmyst/ICDmyst.html\n http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/Evolving_Immunity.html\n http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/flagellum.html\n \n These articles are quite technical but still comprehensible. And there are plenty more to be found.\n \n That's all I could find, apart from some stuff about parasitic wasps who lay eggs in other parasitic wasps who lay eggs in yet more parasitic wasps who then lay eggs in caterpillars. But this argument basically has nothing useful to say about why it disproves evolution.\n \n Back to the devil's drawing board...",

Let's look at the latter first. \n\n \n Well actually no. To clarify, as there seems to be some misunderstanding on the board, I propose to deal specifically w/ the origin of life. I will discuss evolution where it is deemed appropriate, however it is not technically my argument. Why? Because, if science proved without a doubt today that evolution is no longer a theory, but correct, it wouldn't solve anything. What it would do is question the origin of life. The faithful, would simply say, no problem, God made it that way and is still the original creator of life as many already believe. I use ev vs. cre. for a convenient expression, because those who believe there is no creator must believe in evolution.\n \n Also, I'm not here specifically to prove that the bible is correct, so to bombard me w/ a number of scriptures and ask me how I can possibly think it is true is irrelevent. (not necessarily you, but it has come up)\n \n Although I will use Christian examples from time to time is not the point, I am arguing simply for creation, not who the creator was. For example, one person argued that Christianity was started by force. This couldn't be more wrong and is a part of Muslim history, but I don't always have the time or inclination to address ignorance.\n \n \n\n \n As to your last point, the millions of Christians, I must point out that there are more non-Christians than Christians, so if you're going strictly by numbers I'm afraid that Christianity loses. However, I've never felt that truth could be determined by majority vote, so I'm willing to drop that whole line of reasoning if you are.\n\n \n Fair enough, but lets not confuse the argument. There is no solid proof for either side, or we wouldn't be here debating today. And yes I am taking it slow. I think things need to be discussed in their own time. Really there is nothing worse than taking the time to type a lot of material and having people pick out one thing and ignore the rest. Or simply not listen and then ridicule w/o making any attempt to at least justify their position.\n \n \n And, you are right that many people believe in evolution, but how many don't know what they believe? They just think they know, but when put to it, don't really have a clue. Too many.\n \n Also, if I am speaking strickly of a creator and not Christianity than you have to accept all the faith's of the people of the earth. Not just the Christians. I may from time to time use examples from other religions, but Christianity, I believe, is the most representative.",

   " Why? Because, if science proved without a doubt today that evolution is no longer a theory, but correct, it wouldn't solve anything. \n \n\n I realize that this is tangential to your argument, but you've make a very common mistake here and I feel it's worth the effort to correct it. In science something isn't called a theory until it's been determined to be almost certainly correct. I know this contradicts common usage, but that's they way the terminology developed. An untested idea, in science, is called a hypothesis. Once a hypothesis is tested and shown to explain observations and not contradict any know facts it gets elevated to theory. There is no further advancement from there; theories don't get to graduate to \"proven\".\n Theory is as good as it gets, and to scientists it indicates an idea which is almost certainly correct. I say almost certainly because new facts are always being uncovered, and even venerable theories like Newton's laws of motion may need to be tweaked. \n \n \n \n Also, if I am speaking strickly of a creator and not Christianity than you have to accept all the faith's of the people of the earth. Not just the Christians. I may from time to time use examples from other religions, but Christianity, I believe, is the most representative.\n\n That's a little problematic, isn't it? If you wanted to argue for the YEC view of creation I could easily come up with pages of evidence on why it couldn't possibly be correct. If you want to propose the ancient watchmaker view, that God set the big bang in motion and has just been watching since, then I could say nothing to refute it. If you say turtles all the way down then I'll just be amused.\n \n My point is that all creation scenarios are not the same. If you want to argue in favor of creation than you really need to specify exactly who created what, when, and how, at least in general terms. The idea that some God nudged some amino acids around in the premordeal soup a few billion years ago is really a very different idea than saying Jehova created everything from nothing 6000 years ago.",

There is a sudden appearance of nearly all animal phyla, and they appear fully formed w/o the required evolutionary ancestors to support your theory.\n \n In addition, in the Mysteries of Life's Origin, biologist Dean Kenyon of San Franciso State University and author of Biological Predestination which argued chemicals had a pre-destination to evolve into living cells under the right conditions, wrote in the forward: \"The authors believe and I now concur, that there is a fundamental flaw in all current theories of the chemical origins of life\"\n\n \n \n Fine.. we have some claims by a biologist that is talking about 'biological predestination'. How can you test for that? How can you show that there was a 'creator' behind it. It seems to be a religiously oriented claim that is untestable.\n \n Does Dean Kenyon have a peer reviewed scientific article on this subject?\n How can this claim be tested? How can it be disproved? what predictions does it make ?",

   " There is no further advancement from there; theories don't get to graduate to \"proven\".\n Theory is as good as it gets, and to scientists it indicates an idea which is almost certainly correct. I say almost certainly because new facts are always being uncovered, and even venerable theories like Newton's laws of motion may need to be tweaked. \n \n\n \n Exactly, so you have no more to go on than myself. While you may believe that a theory is proof enough for you, I beg to disagree, that is exactly what this debate is about.\n \n \n\n My point is that all creation scenarios are not the same. If you want to argue in favor of creation than you really need to specify exactly who created what, when, and how, at least in general terms. The idea that some God nudged some amino acids around in the premordeal soup a few billion years ago is really a very different idea than saying Jehova created everything from nothing 6000 years ago.\n\n \n True, but I believe I have already stated that I will most likely refer to Chrisianity. You may deduce from that that I am talking about the creator of the Christians, Jews, Muslims. I am trying to stay away from this specifically, however because people inevitabley want to discuss whether or not Christianity is true and that is not what this debate is about.

   "Nidder, a few points. I won't bother quoting you since these are simply general issues that frequently come up, we can call them the \"cliches of creationism\".\n \n 1) Evolution is not abiogenesis, neither is it reliant on abiogenesis. Even if the earth was created 3 hours ago by a magic pink unicorn in space, this would in no way contradict the fact evolution occurs, or impede its progress in future. As such, raising arguments about the origins of life does nothing to contradict any theory of evolution.\n \n I have previously asked you to define evolution in your own words, so we could perhaps see what you thought you were talking about. You have of course failed to do so, perhaps in an attempt to conceal your ignorance.\n \n 2) Arguments from statistics: Walk into your bathroom. Pull down your pants and take a dump. What are the odds of your deposit taking the exact size, shape and colour it did? Pretty small, I'd bet. Eugene McScientist calculates the odds of this particular faecal formation as 1 in 10^900, even smaller than the odds of life formation. Therefore the shape of your **** must have been intelligently designed.\n \n The point of this example is simply to illustrate a statistical/philosophical truth, that events which appear to us \"unlikely\" before the fact, cannot be judged to have happened, or to have not happened, after the fact on the basis of these odds. The odds of any given person winning the lottery are very small before the fact. But when someone wins, we do not declare it impossible on the basis of ex ante odds.\n \n This is of course aside from the issue of using statistics from the 1950s that are no longer relevant.",

   "Nidder1: The understood timeline of how life appeared on earth is the same order in which it appears in the Bible. This knowledge being beyond coincidence.\n\n \n Oh, it goes past coincidence alright ... all the way to XXXX!\n \n Consider what Genesis says about seed-bearing land plants with fruits and animals. Here is the passage from the NIV Bible.\n \n \nThen God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seeds according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning - the third day.\n \n ...\n \n And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that is was good. ... And there was evening, and there was morning - the fifth day.\n \n And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds; livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. ... God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning - the sixth day.\n (Genesis 1:11-13, 20-21, 23-25, 31) \n\n \n According to the Bible, angiosperms (the seed-bearing plants with fruit) were created before any animals. Science/evolution directly contradicts such a claim. \n \n \nThe oldest definitive trace of flowing plants to appear in the fossil record is of pollen grains in Cretaceous rocks some 130 million years old, whereas the oldest fossilized flowers are about 120 million years old. (However, a fossil flower was tentatively identified in 130-million-year-old rocks in southern England in 1996). \n (Biology: Fifth Edition, Solomon, Berg, and Martin, Saunders College Publishing, 1999, p584) \n\n \n Yet we know of animals - simple bilaterians - dating back to 580 to 600 million years. So the Bible is GROSSLY off on this chronology. Genesis creation myth refuted.\n \n \n Also, in part of the above quote from the Genesis, the Bible states that specific types of animals were created on the same day, whereas evolution/science directly refutes the claim.\n \n \nAnd God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" \n (Genesis 1:20) \n\n \n Birds appeared at the same time as living creatures in the waters? No way!! Birds didn't arise until some 150 million years ago (off the top of my head) whereas the waters had living creatures at least 540 million years ago (base of the Cambrian explosion) and actually all the way back to 3.5 billion years ago (as evidenced by stromatolites). The Genesis creation myth isn't even close!\n \n Another failed chronology for the Genesis creation: it has LAND animals being created AFTER birds! Not at all consistent with science/evolution. \n \n Finally, Genesis has God creating plants BEFORE the sun. Gee, I think I read somewhere that science kind of has it the other way around! :-)\n \n Your argument is found both misleading and to be confuted.",

   "Nidder, a few points. I won't bother quoting you since these are simply general issues that frequently come up, we can call them the \"cliches of creationism\".\n \n 1) Evolution is not abiogenesis, neither is it reliant on abiogenesis. Even if the earth was created 3 hours ago by a magic pink unicorn in space, this would in no way contradict the fact evolution occurs, or impede its progress in future. As such, raising arguments about the origins of life does nothing to contradict any theory of evolution.\n \n I have previously asked you to define evolution in your own words, so we could perhaps see what you thought you were talking about. You have of course failed to do so, perhaps in an attempt to conceal your ignorance.\n \n 2) Arguments from statistics: Walk into your bathroom. Pull down your pants and take a dump. What are the odds of your deposit taking the exact size, shape and colour it did? Pretty small, I'd bet. Eugene McScientist calculates the odds of this particular faecal formation as 1 in 10^900, even smaller than the odds of life formation. Therefore the shape of your **** must have been intelligently designed.\n \n The point of this example is simply to illustrate a statistical/philosophical truth, that events which appear to us \"unlikely\" before the fact, cannot be judged to have happened, or to have not happened, after the fact on the basis of these odds. The odds of any given person winning the lottery are very small before the fact. But when someone wins, we do not declare it impossible on the basis of ex ante odds.\n \n This is of course aside from the issue of using statistics from the 1950s that are no longer relevant.\n\n \n If you bothered to read my posts you'd know that I was talking about the origin of life, that is where my argument lies. I have also stated that it has nothing to do w/ evolution and that evolution is irrelevant to this discussion. \n I think perhaps if you'd pay attention, rather than just being a condescending ****. you'd get more responses.",

This created simple amino acids, and other orangic compounds. \n \n This shows that simple chemistry could provide the building blocks of life. While it is most assuredly a far cry from life itself, the basic building blocks needed were very easily reproduced in the lab.\n \n Of course, such creation \"scientists\" like Jonahan Wells object, saying that the atmosphere was diffdernt, (and ignoring later experiments, etc etc etc.)\n \n\n Ok first of all I am well familiar w/ this experiment so I didn't need a corresponding link for referrence. And what I did do was provide evidence in both cases of it being valid and in the case not valid. However, you have yet to even attempt a conversation in regard to the biology what you claim you know. I thought you said this was simple? Well then you should have answers for my common arguments not accusations and misdirections.\n \n \n\n But, let us fast forward to this century, to the Titan. It had interested scientiests, because it had lots of methane and ethane in it.. just like was\n was believed that the early earth had. When the Huygens probe landed on Titan, what did it find? It found that the atmosphere is rich in complex organic materials. That proves the objections of Jonathan Wells and other 'creation' scientists are incorrect. \n\n \n This is a perfect example of why people need to provide sources for their information. It's common practice. You clearly mistated here and yet I get the gears for wanting the back up. And you say you have backed up? I haven't seen you offer any evidence except that a news station reported complex organic material being found and you still havn't explained what that organic material was so that I can follow up. \n \n And you may think that this is what shows the miller experiment is valid, but it doesn't. You have shown nothing to back this up. You are making too big a leap of faith w/o evidence to back it up. \n \n Next I gave you one simple question to set the ground work for my argument and you still have not answered it. Is it hypocritical or isn't it? \n \n We can't keep going over the same old, foot stomping, if you can't back things up, can't talk about basic biology, can't answer basic questions and scenarios and yet still believe just as strongly in abiogenesis, then I say that's a pretty huge leap of faith. \n \n I say that the very cell itself is evidence of intelligent design. In a living system the guidance that's needed to assemble everything comes from DNA. Every cell of every plaint and animal has to have a DNA molecule. Working hand in hand with RNA to direct the correct sequencing of amino acids. So, if you can't explain how the amino acids got organized, in order to make just a protein molecule, than perhaps try to explain where did the DNA came from?\n \n on edit: And whether you like it or not, your faith in something you can't explain, can't prove, and can't even discuss intelligently is what proves my point.",

What I want to see is just ONE example of one species turning into another. \n\n \n Sure thing....\n \n \n\"The mechanism of sympatric speciation has been experimentally verified for many plants. One example is a group of species, collectively called hemp nettles, that occurs in temperate parts of Europe and Asia. One hemp nettle, Galeopsis tetrahit (2n = 32), is a naturally occurring allopolyploid thought to have formed by the hybridization of two species, G. pubescens (2n = 16) and G. speciosa (2n = 16). This process occurred in nature but was experimentally reproduced. Galeopsis pubescens and G. speciosa were crossed to produce F1 hybrids, most of which were sterile. Nevertheless, both F2 and F3 generations were produced. The F3 generation included a polyploid plant with 2n = 32 that self-fertilized to yield fertile F4 offspring that could not mate with either of the parental species. These allopolyploid plants had the same appearance and chromosome number as the naturally occurring G. tetrahit. When the experimentally produced plants were crossed with the naturally occurring G. tetrahit, a fertile F1 generation was formed. Thus, the experiment duplicated the speciation process that occurred in nature.\" (Biology: Fifth Edition, Eldra Pearl Solomon, Linda R. Berg, and Diana W.

Speciation involves the genetic divergence of one population from the rest, until it is genetically isolated from the ancestral type. We can observe in the laboratory and in nature any number of stages in this process, as the link I provided earlier explains.\n \n \nYes, but not observing nature. Or do you conveniently dismiss the comment captured? Or the term \"when crossed with\"? Not to mention the term strain.\n\n \n A typical piece of creationist bluster. You demand to be shown that one species can emerge from another; biologists can show you exactly that process in laboratory populations. Read the Dohzhansky item again and point out what Dohzhansky did that couldn't happen in nature.\n \n As to the word 'strain'. it applies equally well to wild populations. Consider the following (from http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html :\n \n \nThere are two distinct strains of Rhagoletis pomonella, the apple maggot fly. One infests the apple, the other the hawthorn. They have different breeding times--as the fruits flower at different times--and so they do not interbreed in the real world. I do not know if they could interbreed in the laboratory. Since the fly is not found in Europe, and the apple is an import from Europe, the only presumption is that the apple strain is a speciation off the original hawthorn strain.\n\n \n \nHow about Dohzhansky produced? How do you ignore that? Come on, lets be real and use some basic comprehension here. These results are man made. Geeeeez..\n\n \n Use some basic comprehension indeed. How do you think Dohzhansky 'produced' assortative mating? It was by letting the laboratory population go on interbreeding for enough generations - exactly as happens when assortative mating occurs within or between natural populations. What, did you imagine he operated on them, or something? Geeeeez..\n \n \nAnd if all species are related, than how about plant life to animal? (You walked into that one).\n\n \n Well, one of us walked into it, certainly. There is no problem here: you share 18% of your genes with cress. The plant and animal kingdoms evolved from separate protoctist-like ancestors, which themselves had shared a common ancestor in the remote past. For an up-to-date view of the relatedness of animals, plants and other eucarya, you might find this site useful: http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/RootWeb/a_molecular_view_of_microbial_di.htm .

It's only what I assume based on what I know.\n\n \n \n Thank you for taking the debate seriously. And a serious answer deserves the same in kind. And you are right 'no proof'. And yet I have had people argue on here that evolution is a fact. And what I mean by complexity is the complexity of life itself (not an all encompassing statement, like the 'look at the human eye' argument, but life's origin). (Will support this below.)\n \n Ultimately, I gave the space/life scenario because I believe that the cell is so complex that science has not even come close to explaining it. And although you did not answer the question, I think it is in fact hypcritical to assume that an orderly message from space denotes intelligence and yet not assume or at least consider that the beginning of life in its complexity does not do the same. \n \n Also, intelligent design is the field of study that investigates signs of intelligence. It identifies those features of objects that reliably signal the action of an intelligent cause. Too see what is at stake consider mount rushmore. The evidence for Mount Rushmore's design is direct. Eyewitnesses saw the sculptor Gutzon Borglum spend the better part of his life designing and fashioning this structure. But what if there were no direct evidence? Suppose humans went extinct and aliens, visiting the earth discovered Mount Rushomore in substantially the same condition as now.\n \n In that case what about this rock formation would provide convincing circumstantial evidence that it was due to a designing intelligence and not merely due to wind and erosion? Such patterns or characteristics point to an intelligence. Design theorists purport to study such signs formally, rigorously and scientifically. In Defense of Intelligent design William A. Dembski\n \n They claim that specified complexity is a key sign of intelligence. The scenario I gave was an example of that specified complexity.\n \n But I digress, lets move on to support of my argument of this 'complexity': \n \n DNA: The Tiny Code That's Toppling Evolution \n As scientists explore a new universe-the universe inside the cell-they are making startling discoveries of information systems more complex than anything ever devised by humanity's best minds. How did they get there, and what does it mean for the theory of evolution?\n \n by Mario Seiglie\n Two great achievements occurred in 1953, more than half a century ago. \n \n The first was the successful ascent of Mt. Everest, the highest mountain in the world. Sir Edmund Hillary and his guide, Tenzing Norgay, reached the summit that year, an accomplishment that's still considered the ultimate feat for mountain climbers. Since then, more than a thousand mountaineers have made it to the top, and each year hundreds more attempt it.\n \n Yet the second great achievement of 1953 has had a greater impact on the world. Each year, many thousands join the ranks of those participating in this accomplishment, hoping to ascend to fame and fortune.\n \n It was in 1953 that James Watson and Francis Crick achieved what appeared impossible-discovering the genetic structure deep inside the nucleus of our cells. We call this genetic material DNA, an abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid. \n \n The discovery of the double-helix structure of the DNA molecule opened the floodgates for scientists to examine the code embedded within it. Now, more than half a century after the initial discovery, the DNA code has been deciphered-although many of its elements are still not well understood.\n \n What has been found has profound implications regarding Darwinian evolution, the theory taught in schools all over the world that all living beings have evolved by natural processes through mutation and natural selection.\n \n Amazing revelations about DNA \n \n As scientists began to decode the human DNA molecule, they found something quite unexpected-an exquisite 'language' composed of some 3 billion genetic letters. \"One of the most extraordinary discoveries of the twentieth century,\" says Dr. Stephen Meyer, director of the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute in Seattle, Wash., \"was that DNA actually stores information-the detailed instructions for assembling proteins-in the form of a four-character digital code\" (quoted by Lee Strobel, The Case for a Creator, 2004, p. 224). \n \n It is hard to fathom, but the amount of information in human DNA is roughly equivalent to 12 sets of The Encyclopaedia Britannica-an incredible 384 volumes\" worth of detailed information that would fill 48 feet of library shelves!\n \n Yet in their actual size-which is only two millionths of a millimeter thick-a teaspoon of DNA, according to molecular biologist Michael Denton, could contain all the information needed to build the proteins for all the species of organisms that have ever lived on the earth, and \"there would still be enough room left for all the information in every book ever written\" (Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, 1996, p. 334).\n \n Who or what could miniaturize such information and place this enormous number of 'letters' in their proper sequence as a genetic instruction manual? Could evolution have gradually come up with a system like this? \n \n DNA contains a genetic language \n \n Let's first consider some of the characteristics of this genetic 'language.' For it to be rightly called a language, it must contain the following elements: an alphabet or coding system, correct spelling, grammar (a proper arrangement of the words), meaning (semantics) and an intended purpose. \n \n Scientists have found the genetic code has all of these key elements. \"The coding regions of DNA,\" explains Dr. Stephen Meyer, \"have exactly the same relevant properties as a computer code or language\" (quoted by Strobel, p. 237, emphasis in original).\n \n The only other codes found to be true languages are all of human origin. Although we do find that dogs bark when they perceive danger, bees dance to point other bees to a source and whales emit sounds, to name a few examples of other species\" communication, none of these have the composition of a language. They are only considered low-level communication signals. \n \n The only types of communication considered high-level are human languages, artificial languages such as computer and Morse codes and the genetic code. No other communication system has been found to contain the basic characteristics of a language.\n \n Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, commented that \"DNA is like a software program, only much more complex than anything we've ever devised.\" \n \n Can you imagine something more intricate than the most complex program running on a supercomputer being devised by accident through evolution-no matter how much time, how many mutations and how much natural selection are taken into account? \n \n DNA language not the same as DNA molecule \n \n Recent studies in information theory have come up with some astounding conclusions-namely, that information cannot be considered in the same category as matter and energy. It's true that matter or energy can carry information, but they are not the same as information itself. \n \n For instance, a book such as Homer's Iliad contains information, but is the physical book itself information? No, the materials of the book-the paper, ink and glue contain the contents, but they are only a means of transporting it.\n \n If the information in the book was spoken aloud, written in chalk or electronically reproduced in a computer, the information does not suffer qualitatively from the means of transporting it. \"In fact the content of the message,\" says professor Phillip Johnson, \"is independent of the physical makeup of the medium\" (Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds, 1997, p. 71).\n \n The same principle is found in the genetic code. The DNA molecule carries the genetic language, but the language itself is independent of its carrier. The same genetic information can be written in a book, stored in a compact disk or sent over the Internet, and yet the quality or content of the message has not changed by changing the means of conveying it. \n \n As George Williams puts it: \"The gene is a package of information, not an object. The pattern of base pairs in a DNA molecule specifies the gene. But the DNA molecule is the medium, it's not the message\" (quoted by Johnson, p. 70).\n \n Information from an intelligent source \n \n In addition, this type of high-level information has been found to originate only from an intelligent source. \n \n As Lee Strobel explains: \"The data at the core of life is not disorganized, it's not simply orderly like salt crystals, but it's complex and specific information that can accomplish a bewildering task-the building of biological machines that far outstrip human technological capabilities\" (p. 244). \n \n For instance, the precision of this genetic language is such that the average mistake that is not caught turns out to be one error per 10 billion letters. If a mistake occurs in one of the most significant parts of the code, which is in the genes, it can cause a disease such as sickle-cell anemia. Yet even the best and most intelligent typist in the world couldn't come close to making only one mistake per 10 billion letters-far from it.\n \n So to believe that the genetic code gradually evolved in Darwinian style would break all the known rules of how matter, energy and the laws of nature work. In fact, there has not been found in nature any example of one information system inside the cell gradually evolving into another functional information program. \n \n Michael Behe, a biochemist and professor at Pennsylvania's Lehigh University, explains that genetic information is primarily an instruction manual and gives some examples. \n \n He writes: \"Consider a step-by-step list of [genetic] instructions. A mutation is a change in one of the lines of instructions. So instead of saying, \"Take a 1/4-inch nut,\" a mutation might say, \"Take a 3/8-inch nut.\" Or instead of \"Place the round peg in the round hole,\" we might get \"Place the round peg in the square hole\" . . . What a mutation cannot do is change all the instructions in one step-say, [providing instructions] to build a fax machine instead of a radio\" (Darwin's Black Box, 1996, p. 41).\n \n We therefore have in the genetic code an immensely complex instruction manual that has been majestically designed by a more intelligent source than human beings. \n \n Even one of the discoverers of the genetic code, the agnostic and recently deceased Francis Crick, after decades of work on deciphering it, admitted that \"an honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going\" (Life Itself, 1981, p. 88, emphasis added).\n \n Evolution fails to provide answers \n \n It is good to remember that, in spite of all the efforts of all the scientific laboratories around the world working over many decades, they have not been able to produce so much as a single human hair. How much more difficult is it to produce an entire body consisting of some 100 trillion cells!\n \n Up to now, Darwinian evolutionists could try to counter their detractors with some possible explanations for the complexity of life. But now they have to face the information dilemma: How can meaningful, precise information be created by accident-by mutation and natural selection? None of these contain the mechanism of intelligence, a requirement for creating complex information such as that found in the genetic code. \n \n Darwinian evolution is still taught in most schools as though it were fact. But it is increasingly being found wanting by a growing number of scientists. \"As recently as twenty-five years ago,\" says former atheist Patrick Glynn, \"a reasonable person weighing the purely scientific evidence on the issue would likely have come down on the side of skepticism [regarding a Creator]. That is no longer the case.\" He adds: \"Today the concrete data point strongly in the direction of the God hypothesis. It is the simplest and most obvious solution . . .\" (God: The Evidence, 1997, pp. 54-55, 53). \n \n Quality of genetic information the same \n \n Evolution tells us that through chance mutations and natural selection, living things evolve. Yet to evolve means to gradually change certain aspects of some living thing until it becomes another type of creature, and this can only be done by changing the genetic information. \n \n So what do we find about the genetic code? The same basic quality of information exists in a humble bacteria or a plant as in a person. A bacterium has a shorter genetic code, but qualitatively it gives instructions as precisely and exquisitely as that of a human being. We find the same prerequisites of a language-alphabet, grammar and semantics-in simple bacteria and algae as in man. \n \n Each cell with genetic information, from bacteria to man, according to molecular biologist Michael Denton, consists of \"artificial languages and their decoding systems, memory banks for information storage and retrieval, elegant control systems regulating the automated assembly of parts and components, error fail-safe and proof-reading devices utilized for quality control, assembly processes involving the principle of prefabrication and modular construction . . . [and a] capacity not equalled in any of our most advanced machines, for it would be capable of replicating its entire structure within a matter of a few hours\" (Denton, p. 329). \n \n So how could the genetic information of bacteria gradually evolve into information for another type of being, when only one or a few minor mistakes in the millions of letters in that bacterium's DNA can kill it? \n \n Again, evolutionists are uncharacteristically silent on the subject. They don't even have a working hypothesis about it. Lee Strobel writes: \"The six feet of DNA coiled inside every one of our body's one hundred trillion cells contains a four-letter chemical alphabet that spells out precise assembly instructions for all the proteins from which our bodies are made . . . No hypothesis has come close to explaining how information got into biological matter by naturalistic means\" (Strobel, p. 282).\n \n Werner Gitt, professor of information systems, puts it succinctly: \"The basic flaw of all evolutionary views is the origin of the information in living beings. It has never been shown that a coding system and semantic information could originate by itself [through matter] . . . The information theorems predict that this will never be possible. A purely material origin of life is thus [ruled out]\" (Gitt, p. 124). \n \n The clincher \n \n Besides all the evidence we have covered for the intelligent design of DNA information, there is still one amazing fact remaining-the ideal number of genetic letters in the DNA code for storage and translation.\n \n Moreover, the copying mechanism of DNA, to meet maximum effectiveness, requires the number of letters in each word to be an even number. Of all possible mathematical combinations, the ideal number for storage and transcription has been calculated to be four letters. \n \n This is exactly what has been found in the genes of every living thing on earth-a four-letter digital code. As Werner Gitt states: \"The coding system used for living beings is optimal from an engineering standpoint. This fact strengthens the argument that it was a case of purposeful design rather that a [lucky] chance\" (Gitt, p. 95). \n \n More witnesses \n \n Back in Darwin's day, when his book On the Origin of Species was published in 1859, life appeared much simpler. Viewed through the primitive microscopes of the day, the cell appeared to be but a simple blob of jelly or uncomplicated protoplasm. Now, almost 150 years later, that view has changed dramatically as science has discovered a virtual universe inside the cell.\n \n \"It was once expected,\" writes Professor Behe, \"that the basis of life would be exceedingly simple. That expectation has been smashed. Vision, motion, and other biological functions have proven to be no less sophisticated than television cameras and automobiles. Science has made enormous progress in understanding how the chemistry of life works, but the elegance and complexity of biological systems at the molecular level have paralyzed science's attempt to explain their origins\" (Behe, p. x). \n \n Dr. Meyer considers the recent discoveries about DNA as the Achilles\" heel of evolutionary theory. He observes: \"Evolutionists are still trying to apply Darwin's nineteenth-century thinking to a twenty-first century reality, and it's not working ... I think the information revolution taking place in biology is sounding the death knell for Darwinism and chemical evolutionary theories\" (quoted by Strobel, p. 243). \n \n Dr. Meyer's conclusion? \"I believe that the testimony of science supports theism. While there will always be points of tension or unresolved conflict, the major developments in science in the past five decades have been running in a strongly theistic direction\" (ibid., p. 77).\n \n Dean Kenyon, a biology professor who repudiated his earlier book on Darwinian evolution-mostly due to the discoveries of the information found in DNA-states: \"This new realm of molecular genetics (is) where we see the most compelling evidence of design on the Earth\" (ibid., p. 221).\n \n Just recently, one of the world's most famous atheists, Professor Antony Flew, admitted he couldn't explain how DNA was created and developed through evolution. He now accepts the need for an intelligent source to have been involved in the making of the DNA code. \n \n \"What I think the DNA material has done is show that intelligence must have been involved in getting these extraordinary diverse elements together,\" he said (quoted by Richard Ostling, \"Leading Atheist Now Believes in God,\" Associated Press report, Dec. 9, 2004). \n \n \"Fearfully and wonderfully made\" \n \n Although written thousands of years ago, King David's words about our marvelous human bodies still ring true. He wrote: \"For You formed my inward parts, You covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made . . . My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought. . .\" (Psalm 139:13-15, emphasis added). \n \n Where does all this leave evolution? Michael Denton, an agnostic scientist, concludes: \"Ultimately the Darwinian theory of evolution is no more nor less than the great cosmogenic myth of the twentieth century\" (Denton, p. 358).\n \n All of this has enormous implications for our society and culture. Professor Johnson makes this clear when he states: \"Every history of the twentieth century lists three thinkers as preeminent in influence: Darwin, Marx and Freud. All three were regarded as 'scientific' (and hence far more reliable than anything 'religious') in their heyday. \n \n \"Yet Marx and Freud have fallen, and even their dwindling bands of followers no longer claim that their insights were based on any methodology remotely comparable to that of experimental science. I am convinced that Darwin is next on the block. His fall will be by far the mightiest of the three\" (Johnson, p. 113).\n \n Evolution has had its run for almost 150 years in the schools and universities and in the press. But now, with the discovery of what the DNA code is all about, the complexity of the cell, and the fact that information is something vastly different from matter and energy, evolution can no longer dodge the ultimate outcome. The evidence certainly points to a resounding checkmate for evolution! GN\n \n http://gnmagazine.org/issues/gn58/tinycode.htm",

   "Essentially, odds and probabilities are completely meaningless. All things are ruled by causality, meaning that the future is 100% set in stone, without any room for true chance.\n\n \n This remains far from proven. When we get down into the subatomic level instead of becoming more certain we start talking in probabilities. Some argue because there is chaos in the underlying nature of the universe. If you are a string theorist then this means all the strings (making up all matter and energy) are vibrating and there is a certain randomness to the vibration. Minute particles can wink in and out of existence for no reason except chaos among other things. \n \n That our certainty about the minute details of matter/energy is an illusion because we are looking from the 100,000 foot level. The devil is in the details. Talk to me when we can predict weather, earthquakes, solar radiation, etc., with any certainty. No, the more variables are involved, the more there is uncertainty. And at the atomic level it gets even dicer. Because of the Heisenberg indeterminacy principle or as some refer to it the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we know we cannot know all aspects of a particular partical or wave-length at any one time. For particals we can measure their velocity, or weight or vector but we cannot get all three of those measurements at once. Thus certainty is not possible. If certainty is not possible at the wave/particle level then it is even less likely at the macro level.\n \n No we will always have probabilities. Truth and Knowledge will ever be approximations. It is the degree of how well they serve us, continuing to accurately predict the behavior of our universe that they will prove their merit or lack thereof.\n \n Evolution as a theory proves its merit both because nothing has been able to replace it as a predictor for what we see in nature. Intelligent Design is not a theory for many reasons. Firstly it provides no verifiable or falsefiable hypothesis, and two it has not been predictive of observations in nature that have born out. Every claim made by those advocating ID has been refuted and found to be better explained through evolution. Far from hurting evolution, challenges like intelligent design serve to strengthen the very basis of evolution as long as the challenge remains within science.\n \n Evolution vs Intelligent Design becomes a problem when politics and religious fervor are used to try overturn the scientific debate. Science is self-correcting, politics is not. ID fails on its scientific merits and would have long ago been relegated to the dust heap of history except for literial bible believers who blind themselves against well-established science. It as if the flat earthers suddenly had a large percentage of people who supported their belief and we were asked to teach flat earth theories along side spherical earth theories in geography. It is just plan kooky.",

As Werner Gitt states: \"The coding system used for living beings is optimal from an engineering standpoint. This fact strengthens the argument that it was a case of purposeful design rather that a [lucky] chance\" (Gitt, p. 95).\n\n \n No it does not. Nature is filled with examples of things that happen optimially, the sun (and all suns) are so heavy that they condense and ignite and produce nuclear fusion when the reach a certainty density. Jupiter does not have that density, Sol (our star does). \n \n Thus based on your example there is an optimial engineering design of matter that when you clump enough of it together it starts a chain reaction. This does not prove that nuclear fusion is \"designed\" it just proves that it behaves in specific ways. \n \n And DNA isn't immuatable either, their are life forms or arguably near life forms (viruses) that use half strands of it (RNA) that show even DNA itself could have evolved. Life forms can be shown to be close when they have similiar DNA, thus higher primates have very similiar DNA structures as humans. Similiar numbers of genes and placement of genes within the DNA. Other animals have varied numbers of genes, some more than us, some less. The fact is the code itself is not perfect, there are lots of dead end genes in our DNA that do nothing at all. That these same genes that are dead ends for us have purpose in other plants and animals. \n \n For instance human beings are genetically setup to have 4 of the 5 chemical reactions that would allow us to produce vitamin C automatically within our bodies. Vitamin C is hugely important to us because without it we get scurvy and we get skin sours, our teeth fall out, we lose our eye-sight, etc. Why do we have 4 out of 5 of these things if we are designed? Are we evolving toward beig able to do this ourselves or evolving away from it? Doesn't really matter does it? It just shows that far from a perfect design we are filled with false starts, genetic dead ends and the evidence of eons of evolution. What is an appendix? What does it do? Why do whales have hip bones and parts of a vestigal leg if they never walked on land? \n \n But back to DNA. We don't know that DNA is required for life or not, all we know is that DNA is in the form of our life here on earth. We also know it allows for and further supports evoloutionary thinking. Far from refuting it, DNA shows how there is no such thing as an animal/plant \"kind\" that creationsists and IDers often hold as inviolate. Their assertion that all life forms are of a particular \"kind\" and that no new \"kinds\" form is made ludicrous by looking at DNA. It shows that not only does life evolve but it stores its evolution within DNA and that all life is a range of genetic possibilities not absolutes . It can even be shown how the DNA code itself changes over time thereby revealing how the results of selection, mutation, gene migration, etc. That how many genes and animal has will grow and shrink, how those genes are used with proteins to build plant and animal tissues and how their environment effects them all support evolution because they can be traced through similiar creatures and these patterns followed.\n \n The fact that 4 chemical letters to create such a code is ideal only shows that the universe follows patterns, patterns themselves are not proof or lack of proof of a creator, merely a system. What IDers fail to realize is evolution just describes the system and makes no reference to what created the system itself. If you have a beef with that speak out against abiogenesis not evolution. \n \n You can't point to a lake and say see the water all lays evenly on it therefore goddidit when gravity and fluid dynamics provide a much cleaner and rational solution than goddidit. Same with spherical vs flat earth, the sun at the center of the solar system, vs earth at the center of the universe, demons vs bacteria causing disease, old earth vs new earth creationists and yes evolution vs creationism (in whichever flavor). \n \n Each time the religious have drawn a line in the sand, said goddidit and then been outdown with a clearer, cleaner more predictive model. Religious thinking is much safer when it deals with the supernatural and if it can't avoid muddying its toes in the water of science. Stick to the unknowable things, like what sparked the big-bang, etc. That's pretty much outside of science, there are theories but as for now, like I.D. they are not scientific theories, they cannot be proven or disproven. \n \n As for evolution, argue away. Its a model whose evidence continues to grow over time. DNA hardly refutes evolution. Your point is however is.",

   "Thank you for taking the debate seriously. And a serious answer deserves the same in kind. \n\n \n Whoa dude! I didn't mean gimme a 10 page post! \n \n \nAnd you are right 'no proof'. And yet I have had people argue on here that evolution is a fact. \n\n Well, \"proof\" is pretty absolute.\n There's no \"proof\" that convection causes winds on earth's surface but it is a fact. There's enough evidence to make it a fact.\n \n Is it the \"truth\"? {shrug}\n \n But there is enough evidence for evolution to make it fact.\n \n This is all semantics anyway.\n \n \n \n \n And what I mean by complexity is the complexity of life itself (not an all encompassing statement, like the 'look at the human eye' argument, but life's origin). (Will support this below.)\n\n You need a general definition of \"complexity\" before you can mean anything specific by \"complexity of life.\"\n \n \n\n Ultimately, I gave the space/life scenario because I believe that the cell is so complex that science has not even come close to explaining it. \n\n But that's not true.\n There's plenty about the cell that we understand.\n The amount we know is amazing. \n \n\n And although you did not answer the question, I think it is in fact hypcritical to assume that an orderly message from space denotes intelligence and yet not assume or at least consider that the beginning of life in its complexity does not do the same. \n\n Orderly?\n \n We get \"messages\" from pulsars that are very \"orderly.\" But we assume they come from a natural source.\n \n But anyway, the method that people use when looking for \"intellegent\" signals from outer space is scientific.\n \n There are testable hypotheses and something physical to work with.\n If we do get a signal that we think MIGHT be intellegent, then that would be evidence to support the hypothesis. Then more experiments would have to be performed in order to further support it. This is science.\n \n Now, unless I'm missing something, there's no testable hypothesis coming from ID. If they purport that the designer is physical and part of this universe, then maybe they'd have a starting place. But then they'd have to try explaining who designed the designer.\n \n \n\n Also, intelligent design is the field of study that investigates signs of intelligence. It identifies those features of objects that reliably signal the action of an intelligent cause.\n\n So ID \"scientists\" are also looking for intellegent extraterrestial life?\n \n \nToo see what is at stake consider mount rushmore. The evidence for Mount Rushmore's design is direct.\n\n Is the BACK of Mt. Rushmore designed?\n \n \nEyewitnesses saw the sculptor Gutzon Borglum spend the better part of his life designing and fashioning this structure. But what if there were no direct evidence? Suppose humans went extinct and aliens, visiting the earth discovered Mount Rushomore in substantially the same condition as now.\n \n In that case what about this rock formation would provide convincing circumstantial evidence that it was due to a designing intelligence and not merely due to wind and erosion? \n\n I'd look around for other rocks in the area that looked like faces.\n If I couldn't find any, then I'd try to figure out why THAT rock was unique.\n Then I might be inclined to think that perhaps some intellegent creature could have carved it. So what? Looking for intellegent design in manufactured, inanimate objects is so different from looking for it in dynamic, living things.\n \n \n \nSuch patterns or characteristics point to an intelligence.\n\n Inanimate objects that don't look like all the ones around it can be used as evidence for intellegent influence, sure.\n \n But please explain how this applies to living things.\n \n \n\n They claim that specified complexity is a key sign of intelligence. The scenario I gave was an example of that specified complexity.\n\n Ok, there's an example.\n Can you give us a working definition of \"specified complexity\"?\n \n\n What has been found has profound implications regarding Darwinian evolution, the theory taught in schools all over the world that all living beings have evolved by natural processes through mutation and natural selection.\n\n It did have profound implications.\n They finally found the genetic material PREDICTED by Darwin's theory.\n Darwin had no idea about DNA, obviously, but he surmised that there MUST be some way to pass characteristics to the next generation. He guessed that it should be some sort of \"gene.\"\n \n \nAs scientists began to decode the human DNA molecule, they found something quite unexpected-an exquisite 'language' composed of some 3 billion genetic letters.\n\n Duh! The \"language\" is composed of 4 letters.\n \n\n Could evolution have gradually come up with a system like this? \n\n Of course.\n \n \nCan you imagine something more intricate than the most complex program running on a supercomputer being devised by accident through evolution-no matter how much time, how many mutations and how much natural selection are taken into account? \n\n Yes, because that's what happens with natural selection and descent with modification: things tend to become more complicated over time.\n \n \n\n Information from an intelligent source \n \n In addition, this type of high-level information has been found to originate only from an intelligent source. \n \n As Lee Strobel explains: \"The data at the core of life is not disorganized, it's not simply orderly like salt crystals, but it's complex and specific information that can accomplish a bewildering task-the building of biological machines that far outstrip human technological capabilities\" (p. 244). \n\n Ok, everything previous in this C&P job said nothing about intellegence.\n They just talked about the \"bewildering complexity\" of the whole thing.\n \n \n Here's where it starts to make unsubstatiated claims.\n \n In addition, this type of high-level information has been found to originate only from an intelligent source. \n \n Has it?\n \n Before they make this statement they need to demostrate how DNA came from an intellegent source. Then they can make this statement.\n \n \n \nFor instance, the precision of this genetic language is such that the average mistake that is not caught turns out to be one error per 10 billion letters. If a mistake occurs in one of the most significant parts of the code, which is in the genes, it can cause a disease such as sickle-cell anemia. Yet even the best and most intelligent typist in the world couldn't come close to making only one mistake per 10 billion letters-far from it.\n\n Ah, we've finally diverged from reality altogether here.\n \n DNA is so error-ridden it's not funny.\n Thank GOD for DNA repair mechanisms. ;)\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair\n \n \nIn human cells, both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors (such as UV rays) can cause DNA damage, resulting in as many as 500,000 individual molecular lesions per cell per day.\n\n \n Why would a super intellegent alien design an information storage system that has 500,000 errors a day? It has so many \"errors\" that they have to be constantly \"corrected.\"\n \n \nSo to believe that the genetic code gradually evolved in Darwinian style would break all the known rules of how matter, energy and the laws of nature work.\n\n emoticon_wow \n \n \n In fact, there has not been found in nature any example of one information system inside the cell gradually evolving into another functional information program. \n\n I'm not sure what this is supposed to mean.\n I think they mean that the DNA/RNA system hasn't been observed to change into something else?\n \n What the hell sense does that make?\n \n It just happens to be the most successful system.\n There are other ways, some involving layered clays, that have been discovered that can act as genetic material, an \"information system\" if you will.\n \n \n \n \nHe writes: \"Consider a step-by-step list of [genetic] instructions. A mutation is a change in one of the lines of instructions. So instead of saying, \"Take a 1/4-inch nut,\" a mutation might say, \"Take a 3/8-inch nut.\" Or instead of \"Place the round peg in the round hole,\" we might get \"Place the round peg in the square hole\" . . . What a mutation cannot do is change all the instructions in one step-say, [providing instructions] to build a fax machine instead of a radio\" (Darwin's Black Box, 1996, p. 41).\n\n God, Behe comes up with the worst analogies and explanations.\n \n \n \nWe therefore have in the genetic code an immensely complex instruction manual that has been majestically designed by a more intelligent source than human beings. \n\n It sounds here as if they have reached some conclusion based on their misunderstandings above.\n \n \n\n Evolution fails to provide answers \n\n ToE provides plenty of answers.\n \n ID has provided NONE so far.\n \n \nIt is good to remember that, in spite of all the efforts of all the scientific laboratories around the world working over many decades, they have not been able to produce so much as a single human hair.\n\n Mimicking biology in the lab is extremely difficult because biomaterials, like hair and spider silk, are built from the bottom up, molecule by molecule for the most part. Humans do not yet possess this level of sophistication in materials synthesis. We're getting close, especially with things like spider silk, since it has commercial viability.\n \n \n \nUp to now, Darwinian evolutionists could try to counter their detractors with some possible explanations for the complexity of life. But now they have to face the information dilemma: How can meaningful, precise information be created by accident-by mutation and natural selection? None of these contain the mechanism of intelligence, a requirement for creating complex information such as that found in the genetic code.\n\n I'd like to know where they are getting this XXXX about information REQUIRING an intellegent source.\n \n \n \nSo what do we find about the genetic code?

That expectation has been smashed. Vision, motion, and other biological functions have proven to be no less sophisticated than television cameras and automobiles. Science has made enormous progress in understanding how the chemistry of life works, but the elegance and complexity of biological systems at the molecular level have paralyzed science's attempt to explain their origins\" (Behe, p. x).\n\n There he goes again, comparing life to human-built machines.\n \n \nDr. Meyer considers the recent discoveries about DNA as the Achilles\" heel of evolutionary theory. He observes: \"Evolutionists are still trying to apply Darwin's nineteenth-century thinking to a twenty-first century reality, and it's not working ... \n\n Sorry, but biology has moved WAY past Darwin.\n \n \nDr. Meyer's conclusion? \"I believe that the testimony of science supports theism. \n\n See? There it is.\n \n He didn't say \"intellegent designer.\"\n \n He said theism, as in god(s).\n \n \n Yeah, so thanks for the C&P.",

   "Whoa dude! I didn't mean gimme a 10 page post! \n \n\n For sure, but it's been asked so many times, I figured I'd get myself out on the table. Generally harder this way, but oh well. I probably should have cut the points that went too far ahead, but again oh well. \n (fyi, all quotes are yours unless noted otherwise)\n \n \n\n Well, \"proof\" is pretty absolute.\n There's no \"proof\" that convection causes winds on earth's surface but it is a fact. There's enough evidence to make it a fact.\n \n Is it the \"truth\"? {shrug}\n \n But there is enough evidence for evolution to make it fact.\n \n This is all semantics anyway.\n \n\n No its not all semantics because we're not talking about the same thing. Ultimately, you are talking about what science directs you to believe are the facts, or supposed facts, and I am led to believe that there is enough evidence to say that you don't have enough 'facts' to be so arrogant. \n \n \n\n a\u00b7bi\u00b7o\u00b7gen\u00b7e\u00b7sis (b--jn-ss)\n n.\n The supposed development of living organisms from nonliving matter. Also called autogenesis, spontaneous generation \n \n\n \n For example, people used to believe that something like maggots just spontaneously generated out of meat, but of course that was proven false. \n \n And yet, those who subcribe to abiogenesis still believe this is possible in spite of having absolutely nothing that points to it (specifically) as being practical, only that that must explain how we are here w/o ID. \n \n \n\n You need a general definition of \"complexity\" before you can mean anything specific by \"complexity of life.\"\n \n\n \n Complexity as can be defined as being complex or difficult. I am saying that abiogenesis is too complicated to have spontaneously generated.\n \n \n\n But that's not true.\n There's plenty about the cell that we understand.\n The amount we know is amazing. \n \n\n You are absolutely right, the amount we know is amazing. But what is more amazing is the the cell itself. Think about it. The very first living cell! The <b<expansive</b< amount of information contained therein. And it didn't organize itself. Not like it does today. If it organized itself it would denote intelligence. So think about. Every single step accidental? It just happened to come together by a fluke! Something that was once nothing just happened to acquire an incredible amount of intelligence? From where, how? It doesn't add up. \n \n \n\n Orderly? \n \n We get \"messages\" from pulsars that are very \"orderly.\" But we assume they come from a natural source.\n \n\n Well, no by orderly I meant intelligent. Like sequences of prime numbers for example. A signal that denotes intelligence from space static where there was nothing before it. Not unlike 'spontaneous generation' from nothing to something w/ intelligence. \n \n \n\n But anyway, the method that people use when looking for \"intellegent\" signals from outer space is scientific.\n \n There are testable hypotheses and something physical to work with.\n If we do get a signal that we think MIGHT be intellegent, then that would be evidence to support the hypothesis. Then more experiments would have to be performed in order to further support it. This is science.\n \n Now, unless I'm missing something, there's no testable hypothesis coming from ID. If they purport that the designer is physical and part of this universe, then maybe they'd have a starting place. But then they'd have to try explaining who designed the designer.\n \n\n \n To address the second part first, the designer is not specifically a part of the universe. And there is no designer for the designer. However, this is taking us more into a discussion of faith and off topic.\n \n For the first part: No, I think that is being hypocritical. In both cases we are talking about intelligence appearing suddenly from where there was completely none. It's not irrelevant just because I can't go back in time and test it, because we know it happened for certaintly-there is no question that it happend. So what really needs to be tested. Intelligence appeared from where there was once nothing. I think we can both safely say that that IS a fact.\n \n\n So ID \"scientists\" are also looking for intellegent extraterrestial life?\n \n\n No don't be silly; it's been explained as an example of specified complexity.\n To employ specified complexity to detect design is to engage in effect-to-cause / cause-to-effect reasoning.\n \n \n\n Is the BACK of Mt. Rushmore designed?\n \n \n I'd look around for other rocks in the area that looked like faces.\n If I couldn't find any, then I'd try to figure out why THAT rock was unique.\n Then I might be inclined to think that perhaps some intellegent creature could have carved it. So what? Looking for intellegent design in manufactured, inanimate objects is so different from looking for it in dynamic, living things.\n \n \n\n :) \n \n\n \n Inanimate objects that don't look like all the ones around it can be used as evidence for intellegent influence, sure.\n \n But please explain how this applies to living things.\n \n\n But this is a simple pattern. Its not even complex and yet you infer intelligent design. How much more infinitely complex is the origin of life? And yet this was an accident? Come on. emoticon_cry \n \n So anyway, you're right this is too long and I need a beer. I've cut the rest, but keep a copy handy so we can continue w/ this discussion. Lets continue w/ what we have here and we can add in more as we progress. If there was something specific you wanted me to address, please let me know.",

At the Golden Jubilee of the Atheist Centre in India in 1990 Dr. Crick stated, \"I have no doubt, as will emerge later, that this loss of faith in Christian religion and my growing attachment to science have played a dominant part in my scientific career not so much on a day-to-day basis but in the choice of what I have considered interesting and important.

   "Just recently, one of the world's most famous atheists, Professor Antony Flew, admitted he couldn't explain how DNA was created and developed through evolution. He now accepts the need for an intelligent source to have been involved in the making of the DNA code. \n \n \"What I think the DNA material has done is show that intelligence must have been involved in getting these extraordinary diverse elements together,\" he said (quoted by Richard Ostling, \"Leading Atheist Now Believes in God,\" Associated Press report, Dec. 9, 2004). \n\n \n Anthony Flew now admits that he was misled about the origin of life, by Gerald Shroeder, who isn't even a biologist. \n \n Flew himself is largely to blame for being misled because he uncritically listened to only one side of the story, accepting it at face value.\n \n Further, Flew's conception of 'God' would not be that of Christianity, Islam, or any such religion, but rather the God of the deists. \n \n \n \nUpdate (December 2004)\n \n Flew has now given me permission to quote him directly. I asked him point blank what he would mean if he ever asserted that \"probably God exists,\" to which he responded (in a letter in his own hand, dated 19 October 2004):\n \n ******************************\n Flew: I do not think I will ever make that assertion, precisely because any assertion which I am prepared to make about God would not be about a God in that sense ... I think we need here a fundamental distinction between the God of Aristotle or Spinoza and the Gods of the Christian and the Islamic Revelations.\n ******************************\n \n Rather, he would only have in mind \"the non-interfering God of the people called Deists--such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.\" Indeed, he remains adamant that \"theological propositions can neither be verified nor falsified by experience,\" exactly as he argued in \"Theology and Falsification.\" Regarding J. P. Moreland using Flew in support of Moreland's own belief in the supernatural, Flew says \"my God is not his. His is Swinburne's. Mine is emphatically not good (or evil) or interested in human conduct\" and does not perform miracles of any kind. Furthermore, Flew took great care to emphasize repeatedly to me that:\n \n ******************************\n Flew: My one and only piece of relevant evidence [for an Aristotelian God] is the apparent impossibility of providing a naturalistic theory of the origin from DNA of the first reproducing species ... [In fact] the only reason which I have for beginning to think of believing in a First Cause god is the impossibility of providing a naturalistic account of the origin of the first reproducing organisms.\n ******************************\n \n He cites, in fact, the improbability arguments of Schroeder, which I have refuted online, and the entire argument to the impossibility of natural biogenesis I have refuted in Biology & Philosophy.\n \n So what of the claim that Flew was persuaded by the Kalam Cosmological Argument? Flew \"cannot recall\" writing any letter to Geivett claiming \"the kalam cosmological argument is a sound argument\" for God but he confesses his memory fails him often now so he can't be sure. Nevertheless, I specifically asked what Antony thought of the Kalam, to which he answered:\n \n ******************************\n Flew: If and insofar as it is supposed to prove the existence of a First Cause of the Big Bang, I have no objection, but this is not at all the same as a proof of the existence of a spirit and all the rest of Richard Swinburne's definition of 'God' which is presently accepted as standard throughout the English speaking and philosophical world.\n ******************************\n \n Also, regarding another rumor that Flew has been attending Quaker meetings, Antony says \"I have, I think, attended Quaker meetings on at least 3 or 4 occasions, and one was at the wedding of a cousin,\" and thus hardly a religious statement on his part but a family affair. Nevertheless, for him and his family generally, he says \"I think the main attraction\" of Quakerism has been \"the lack of doctrines.\" On the whole God thing, though, Flew is still examining the articles I sent him, so he may have more to say in the future.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Update (January 2005)\n \n Antony Flew has retracted one of his recent assertions. In a letter to me dated 29 December 2004, Flew concedes:\n \n ******************************\n Flew: I now realize that I have made a fool of myself by believing that there were no presentable theories of the development of inanimate matter up to the first living creature capable of reproduction.\n ******************************\n \n He blames his error on being \"misled\" by Richard Dawkins because Dawkins \"has never been reported as referring to any promising work on the production of a theory of the development of living matter,\" even though this is false (e.g., Richard Dawkins and L. D. Hurst, \"Evolutionary Chemistry: Life in a Test Tube,\" Nature 357: pp. 198-199, 21 May 1992) and hardly relevant: it was Flew's responsibility to check the state of the field (there are several books by actual protobiologists published in just the last five years), rather than wait for the chance possibility that one particular evolutionist would write on the subject. Now that he has done what he was supposed to do in the first place, he has retracted his false statement about the current state of protobiological science.\n \n Flew also makes another admission: \"I have been mistaught by Gerald Schroeder.\" He says \"it was precisely because he appeared to be so well qualified as a physicist (which I am not) that I was never inclined to question what he said about physics.\" Apart from his unreasonable plan of trusting a physicist on the subject of biochemistry (after all, the relevant field is biochemistry, not physics--yet it would seem Flew does not recognize the difference), this attitude seems to pervade Flew's method of truthseeking, of looking to a single author for authoritative information and never checking their claims (or, as in the case of Dawkins, presumed lack of claims). As Flew admitted to me, and to Stuart Wavell of the London Times, and Duncan Crary of the Humanist Network News, he has not made any effort to check up on the current state of things in any relevant field (see \"No Longer Atheist, Flew Stands by 'Presumption of Atheism'\" and \"In the Beginning There Was Something\"). Flew has thus abandoned the very standards of inquiry that led the rest of us to atheism. It would seem the only way to God is to jettison responsible scholarship.\n \n Despite all this, Flew has not retracted his belief in God, as far as I can tell. But in response to theists citing him in their favor, Flew strangely calls his \"recent very modest defection from my previous unbelief\" a \"more radical form of unbelief,\" and implies that the concept of God might actually be self-refuting, for \"surely there is material here for a new and more fundamental challenge to the very conception of God as an omnipotent spirit,\" but, Flew says, \"I am just too old at the age of nearly 82 to initiate and conduct a major and super radical controversy about the conceivability of the putative concept of God as a spirit.\" This would appear to be his excuse for everything: he won't investigate the evidence because it's too hard. Yet he will declare beliefs in the absence of proper inquiry. Theists would do well to drop the example of Flew. Because his willfully sloppy scholarship can only help to make belief look ridiculous.\n (http://www.secweb.org/asset.asp?AssetID=369)\n \n",

Ultimately, you are talking about what science directs you to believe are the facts, or supposed facts, and I am led to believe that there is enough evidence to say that you don't have enough 'facts' to be so arrogant.\n\n All right Johnny Cochrane!\n Ladies and gentlemen of the supposed jury... :)\n \n \n \nFor example, people used to believe that something like maggots just spontaneously generated out of meat, but of course that was proven false.\n\n People also believed that the Earth was made in 6 days.\n That has also been proven false. \n \n \n \nAnd yet, those who subcribe to abiogenesis still believe this is possible in spite of having absolutely nothing that points to it (specifically) as being practical, only that that must explain how we are here w/o ID.\n \n Wow, how many times have we been over this Peddler?\n Life didn't arise from dead organic matter in a jar over a short time span.\n \n \nComplexity as can be defined as being complex.\n\n And tautology can be defined as tautology.\n \n \n I am saying that abiogenesis is too complicated to have spontaneously generated.\n\n Is that a supposed fact?\n Please explain how you know this.\n \n \n\n You are absolutely right, the amount we know is amazing. But what is more amazing is the the cell itself. Think about it. The very first living cell! The <b<expansive</b< amount of information contained therein. And it didn't organize itself. Not like it does today. If it organized itself it would denote intelligence. So think about. Every single step accidental? It just happened to come together by a fluke! Something that was once nothing just happened to acquire an incredible amount of intelligence? From where, how? It doesn't add up. \n\n So this means that you can't imagine how life could have originated without God. Big deal. Some people are smarter than you and are working very hard to figure it out. If scientists just threw up their hands and said \"Goddidit\" 500 years ago, where would we be? Think about it. \n \n \n\n Well, no by orderly I meant intelligent. Like sequences of prime numbers for example. A signal that denotes intelligence from space static where there was nothing before it. Not unlike 'spontaneous generation' from nothing to something w/ intelligence. \n\n A sequence of prime numbers MIGHT indicate an intellegent signal. \n \n BTW, why do you think spontaneous generation (abiognesis if you like) equates with \"something from nothing\"?\n \n \n \n \nTo address the second part first, the designer is not specifically a part of the universe.\n\n Then there's no real way to test for it.\n \n\n And there is no designer for the designer. \n\n But the designer must be very complex.\n By the definition of ID, very complex things must be designed.\n \n\n However, this is taking us more into a discussion of faith and off topic.\n\n Funny how that happens with ID.\n \n \n \n In both cases we are talking about intelligence appearing suddenly from where there was completely none.\n\n I never said anything about intellegence appearing suddenly.\n \n \nIt's not irrelevant just because I can't go back in time and test it, because we know it happened for certaintly-there is no question that it happend. So what really needs to be tested. Intelligence appeared from where there was once nothing. I think we can both safely say that that IS a fact.\n\n I agree. What we call intellegence exists. Once it likely did not exist.\n \n So what are you talking about?\n \n Testing for intellegence? Do you want to give the universe an IQ test?\n \n \n\n No don't be silly; it's been explained as an example of specified complexity.\n To employ specified complexity to detect design is to engage in effect-to-cause / cause-to-effect reasoning.\n\n I wasn't being silly. You said IDists look for signs of intellegence in nature.\n Shouldn't a good starting place be to look for intellegence that IS in this universe?\n \n \n \n:) \n\n Come on Johnny Cochrane, a smiley face is no answer.\n OJ has to answer the question.\n \n IS THE BACK OF MT. RUSHMORE DESIGNED OR NOT?\n \n \n \n \nBut this is a simple pattern. Its not even complex and yet you infer intelligent design. How much more infinitely complex is the origin of life? And yet this was an accident? Come on. emoticon_cry \n\n Simple. Complex.\n These terms are relative.\n Besides I don't even know what simple pattern you are talking about.\n For all we know \"The origin of life\" may have been very simple indeed.\n Like I said though, mutation and natural selection tend to make things more complicated, complex if you will.",

Last year, a local pastor sent video footage of sex acts being performed in front of police to the mayor, city council, and the media. City officials simply ignored the footage and continued to welcome and praise the weeklong celebration as being an \"exciting event\". However, Hurricane Katrina has put an end to the annual celebration of sin.\n \n On the official \"Southern Decadence\" website (www.SouthernDecadence.com), it states that the annual event brought in \"125,000 revelers\" to New Orleans last year, increasing by thousands each year, and up from \"over 50,000 revelers\" in 1997. This year's 34th annual \"Southern Decadence\" was set for Wednesday, August 31, 2005 through Monday, September 5, 2005, but due to massive flooding and the damage left by the hurricane, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco has ordered everyone to evacuate the city.\n \n The past three mayors of New Orleans, including Sidney Barthelomew, Marc H. Morial, and C. Ray Nagin, issued official proclamations welcoming visitors to \"Southern Decadence\". Additionally, New Orleans City Council made other proclamations recognizing the annual homosexual celebration.\n \n \"Although the loss of lives is deeply saddening, this act of God destroyed a wicked city,\" stated Repent America director Michael Marcavage. \"From 'Girls Gone Wild' to 'Southern Decadence,' New Orleans was a city that had its doors wide open to the public celebration of sin. From the devastation may a city full of righteousness emerge,\" he continued.\n \n New Orleans is also known for its Mardi Gras parties where thousands of drunken men revel in the streets to exchange plastic jewelry for drunken women to expose their breasts. This annual event sparked the creation of the \"Girls Gone Wild\" video series.\n \n \"We must help and pray for those ravaged by this disaster, but let us not forget that the citizens of New Orleans tolerated and welcomed the wickedness in their city for so long,\" Marcavage said. \"May this act of God cause us all to think about what we tolerate in our city limits, and bring us trembling before the throne of Almighty God,\" Marcavage concluded.\n \n \"[God] sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\" (Matthew 5:45)\n",

The energy comes from the uncoiling of curled up dimensions, or something like that. As for the next evolutionary step - bear in mind that except for a few disease resistance genes we have taken ourselves largely out of evolution's scope. AIDs and Influenza resistance will probably be the next widespread noticable step. As for the man/monkey ones - why don't people use flint clubs when designing microprocessors, where have all the knights in the US military gone? Things that can not compete die out.\n \n\n I believe God had a big blueprint...and just made everything similar to fit into the proper biological and physical functions....\n Why? To save time, but time wasn't around before the creation of the universe - the only reason you wouldn't design each thing seperately is that you don't have enough time or materials. This is a fairly vague blueprint as well isn't it, and we are still talking about him designing stuff in an evolutionary manner (which implies that he doesn't really understand how it all works and lets selection deal with the trickier stuff, much in the same way we do).\n \n\n I admit most of religion is garbage and hype...but that doesn't alter the fact that there is a God.....\nIf the rest of its rubbish, why should we make an exception for one more assumption\n \n\n The ultimate question should be \"Is there a God?\" because think of the implications.

Surely to weigh all the beleifs equally and make your choices based of logic is going to be rated higher over an unfounded irrational beleif.

How is one to explain creation without the creator just as evolution without the billions of years it has taken for it to work?\n\n \n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n I repeat what I meant: The question of God's existence is not germaine to the debate about evolution vs creation. Evolution has still occured regardless of whether or not there is a God. Just because creationism mandates the existence of God, it doesn't mean that this counts as an argument against evolution. So bringing the question of God into the discussion when trying to debunk evolution, is pointless. Now, do you have a problem with that clarification of my position?\n \n With respect to TIME, it is essential to evolution, whereas the question of God's existence is not. Of course, creationism doesn't depend upon a time frame the way evolution does (since you can have either YEC or OEC) even though it madates the existence of GOD, whereas evolution is neutral on this question. So, in short, the only point I am making is that arguments against atheism are NOT arguments against evolution, and arguments for evolution are NOT arguments for atheism. Are you clear on these distinctions?",

   "IM2L844: I have provided a few links in order to prevent this post from taking the plethora of space it would require and deserves....\n\n \n All of your evidences - which are little more than a listing from Jonathan Wells' book \"Icons of Evolution\" - are not what you think. I'll choose just one and address it. Or rather, I'll provide a few scattered quotes, and a link, from a very long rebuttal to the chapter in Wells' book that addresses it. \n \n I choose ... VERTEBRATE EMBRYOS. Anyone who reads that full page that I quote a few things from will be forced to see how pitiful Wells' argument is.\n \n \nUnfortunately, what Wells tries to do in this chapter is to take this invalid, discredited theory and tar modern (and even not so modern) evolutionary biology with it. The biogenetic law is not Darwinism or neo-Darwinism, however. It is not part of any modern evolutionary theory. Wells is carrying out a bait-and-switch here, marshalling the evidence and citations that properly demolish the Haeckelian dogma, and then claiming that this is part of \"our best evidence for Darwin's theory.\" \n \n ...\n \n Wells would also like the reader to think that Haeckel's embryos were a key piece of the puzzle that Darwin himself used to assemble his theory, and that therefore Darwinism was built on a false foundation. He neglects to mention an important matter of chronology, however. Darwin's Origin of Species was published in 1859, after decades of research. Haeckel's theory was first published in 1866 , and Haeckel's diagrams were published in 1874. ...\n \n ...\n \n The case of Stephen J. Gould illustrates Wells' two-faced strategy particularly well. In 1977, Gould wrote an excellent scholarly book on the intertwined history of embryology and evolution, titled Ontogeny and Phylogeny. As might be guessed from the title, Haeckel is a prominent character in the book, and his theories and their consequences in the field are dissected in detail and without mercy. Gould also returned to this topic in his column in Natural History magazine in 2000, centering his commentary on the discovery of a scathing critique of Haeckel by one of his contemporaries, Louis Agassiz. Gould has also written other related articles, disparaging textbook authors for their deplorable habit of recycling text and figures well beyond reason. Yet how does Wells twist the facts? He claims that Gould \"...(despite having known the truth for over twenty years) kept his mouth shut until a \"creationist\" (actually, a fellow biologist) [he is referring to Michael Behe here] exposed the problem\"! \n \n This is a remarkable example of the kind of dishonest doublespeak used by Wells throughout his book. He can cite author after author clearly condemning Haeckel's ideas between 1894 and 2000, and simultaneously claim that biologists have been \"resurrecting recapitulation\" throughout the 20th century. He claims that Behe \"exposed the problem\", but Behe has done no research in embryology, has published nothing original on the history of 19th century science, and deserves no credit here - this \"problem\" was exposed over a century ago, and the real creative and innovative work in embryological analysis being done here is by an evolutionist, Michael Richardson, not Behe. I'm also surprised that Gould can publish an almost 500 page book that is critically well-received and frequently cited, and still be accused of keeping his mouth shut on the subject!\n \n Gould is not alone. The author of one of the most influential textbooks in developmental biology, Scott Gilbert, described the biogenetic law as \"disastrous\" and \"untenable\". Raff and Kaufman made the same case against Haeckel that Wells does here, so what Wells is teaching us is not surprising anyone. \n \n ...\n \n http://pharyngula.org/comments/9_0_1_0_C/\n \n",

Why don't textbooks discuss the \"Cambrian explosion,\" in which all major animal groups appear together in the fossil record fully formed instead of branching from a common ancestor -- thus contradicting the evolutionary tree of life?READ MORE \n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n As a couple others have already remarked, these examples grabbed off of creationist websites are typical, predictable and well known to most of us who understand evolution. So I'll take on the CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION. This \"explosion\" lasted longer than the evolution of old world primates from monkeys to apes to hominids, and involved many more drastic changes. Were talking about a period that lasted around 90 million years. You are omitting the preceding period of around 90 million years, involving the Ediacaran fauna, showing what appear to be precursors to jellyfish, echinoderms and other creatures without hard shells. The Cambrian is full of fossils largely because calcium carbonate first becomes prominent which is preserved better than soft body parts. Much of the precambrian is lost forever due to subduction & metamorphic changes. Never mind the fact that bacteria, protozoa & algae precede the Cambrian & Ediacara by a couple billion years. Life did NOT appear all of a sudden.\n \n Completely missing from this article, is the fact that a tremandous amount of evolution has occured in the half billion years since the Cambrian period. Even though all of the animal phyla had been established during the Cambrian, many of the smaller taxa, such as classes & orders, came much later. Amphibians didn't appear 'til the Devonian and reptiles 'til the Carboniferous. It wasn't 'til the Jurassic that birds & mammals first appeared. In the plant world, Flowering Plants didn't appear 'til the Cretaceous. So what is seen in the Cambrian are species which are all extinct today. This is exactly what we would expect from an evolutionary standpoint.\n \n The rest of your examples are equally weak. I'm sure the others on this forum have the same reaction as I have. This is all rehashed stuff that we have seen time & again on creation websites. And if the articles on talkorigins seem complicated and obtuse, it's only because they are trying to draw upon a century & a half of evidence for evolution to counter the misinformation found on sites like AIG. It is relatively easy for a website to give a few pages of simplistic, misleading rhetoric that can fool, the majority of folks who have not formally studied biology or geology. The real info is much more involved.",

Even if we accept that the artists' drawings of human evolution are innaccurate it doesn't mean that the theory underyling them is. Read the page I linked to in response to the VERTEBRATE EMBRYOS and this point will be drive home.\n \n Second, we have overwhelming evidences - independent evidences - that humans evolved from a common ancestor we share with chimps. Here's a bit of information from my personal notes: I can flesh out the enumerated list with details (as I did in my relatively recent formal debate here), if you need them. Now, from my personal notes...\n \n \n \n Evolution at and below the species level stands on firm, well supported, scientific ground, and has in fact been confirmed by observations. The rest is often times said, by Creationists, to be nothing more than extrapolation: evolutionists simply assume that because microevolution and speciation have been observed in the short amount of time that biologists have been examining organisms, that additional time would produce larger scale evolution. The following is one example of an anti-evolutionist questioning the validity of this extrapolation.\n \n \n\"Actual scientific evidence, both experimental and paleontological, supports only limited variation within fixed boundaries, or what is called microevolution. Macroevolution - the unlimited capacity of organisms to transform beyond all boundaries - is an extrapolation from microevolution. As with all extrapolations it is legitimate to question whether this extrapolation is \n warranted.\" (Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology, William A. Dembski, InterVarsity Press, 1999, p250) \n\n \n For the current discussion, the extrapolation past confirmed evolutionary processes would be the origin of humans from an ancestor we share with chimps. But is this just extrapolation? No! Multiple scientific evidences support the position that humans and chimps share a common ancestor. \n \n 1) The 96% - 99% identity between the human and chimp genomes indicates common ancestry.\n \n 2) The multiple, conserved non-functional DNA sequences (pseudogenes) shared by both chimps and humans bolster the case of genetic relatedness by means of common descent and crush the \"common design\" counterargument.\n \n 3) The head-to-head fusion of two \"chimp\" chromosomes to form one of our human chromosomes.\n \n 4) The individual anatomical differences between humans and chimps being so minor: mostly differences in the mere size, shape, or amount of shared structures (brain size, arm length, jaw shape, curvature of spine, amount of hair, etc.). No major biological novelty separates the two species (and neoteny alone can explain several of the differences).\n \n 5) The nearly identical brain structure for chimps and humans, including several shared asymmetries.\n \n 6) The fact that chimps have several \"humanlike\" mental qualities, such as high intelligence, self-recognition, a sense of fairness - which is modulated according to strength of social bonds - and a rudimentary form of apathy.\n \n 7) The numerous hominid fossils that help document our evolutionary past. \n \n Together, all of these evidences - which come from multiple, independent, objective sources, and which are verifiable, at least in principle, by anyone - form a very convincing argument in support of our evolutionary origin. And, they show that the evolutionary position that humans evolved from a common ancestor we share with chimps is not mere extrapolation from the confirmed processes of microevolution and speciation. Evolutionists have both the logical extrapolation and the multiple supporting evidences.",

Possibly you are parroting what some deception by some ministry, like AIG, and not actual education in the matter.

If you can't do that, then any claim you have to such descent is bogus. \n \nEVOLUTION A FACT? Why are we told that Darwin's theory of evolution is a scientific fact -- even though many of its claims are based on misrepresentations of the facts?\nReally?

   "IM2L844 wrote:\n HOMOLOGY. Why do textbooks define homology as similarity due to common ancestry, then claim that it is evidence for common ancestry -- a circular argument masquerading as scientific evidence?READ MORE \n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n This whole creationist argument against homology hinges upon the assertion that it is circular - the belief that homology is used as evidence for phylogeny. It is NOT. The article cited ignores the plethora of evidence for common descent that has nothing to do with similarities in structure. But I want to limit this post to a discussion on why analogous structures/adaptations in marsupials & placentals are NOT homologous.\n \n First of all there is unrefutable evidence of an early divergence between placentals & marsupials that occured at least 100 million years ago in the Cretaceous period. Even biogeography makes that abundantly clear, since almost all of today's marsupials are found in Australia & surrounding islands. The fact that there is a rich fossil record in South America but not in North America or Eurasia is totally consistent with the split between the southern super continent, Gondwana, and the northern continent, Laurasia. Bit that's not all. The fossil record also shows a split in dental & skeletal features in the Cretaceous that can still be seen today.\n \n Beside the obvious difference between marsupials & placentals (pouch vs placenta) there are these others which can be traced in the fossil record:\n 1) Marsupials only have one generation of permanent teeth and they have unique cusp arrangements on the molars\n 2) The jugal bone (\"cheek bone\") goes back to the jaw articulation in Marsupials but not placentals.\n 3) There is no auditory bulla around the ear opening for Marsupials as there is in Placentals.\n 4) There is a single opening in the eye orbit for all the nerves (optic nerve plus 4 cranial nerves) in Marsupials , whereas Placentals have 2 extra openings for these nerves.\n 5) Indentation on the mandible in Marsupials is absent for Placentals.\n \n So no competent biologist would ever assign the Koala to the bear family based soley on superficial resemblences, when there are so many fundamental differences. This is also the reason wings in birds and bats are understood to be nonhomologous, while they are definitely homologous AS forelimbs. This classic textbook example is totally sidestepped by creationists who ignore the fact that homology here has to do with more than simple appearances, but has everything to do with evidence from paleontology, embryology, biogeography and genetics which establish common ancestry FIRST. And with Marsupials, the case for separate ancestry is undeniable.",
