They were not. McCain believes Democrats on the committee blocked Bennett's recommendation because he was the lone Keating Five Republican.\n \n In February 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee found McCain and Glenn to be the least blameworthy of the five senators. (McCain and Glenn attended the meetings but did nothing else to influence the regulators.) McCain was guilty of nothing more than \"poor judgment,\" the committee said, and declared his actions were not \"improper nor attended with gross negligence.\" McCain considered the committee's judgment to be \"full exoneration,\" and he contributed $112,000 (the amount raised for him by Keating) to the U.S. Treasury.\n\n \n Your Keating Five argument is very weak considering the FACTS surrounding the investigation. To paint McCain along with those who truly acted improperly is nothing more than an example of your deliberate bias. It has little to do with reality.",
