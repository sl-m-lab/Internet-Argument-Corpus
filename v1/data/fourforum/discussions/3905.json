If they refused to do the laundry, they would have worn the same dirty clothes until they couldn't stand their own stench. If they hit me, they get hit back. If they slam their door, it gets taken off the hinges, and they don't have a door to slam. If they play their stereo too loud after I tell them to turn it down, the speakers get locked away. 12 and 17 are not the ages to teach children right from wrong.

By the age of 17 most personality features are already in place. Personality is an incredibly stable part of who we are--your parents pouting in the front yard certainly isn't going to chage who you are. Even by 12 it is an uphill battle. \n \n I would agree this is a case of 'too little, too late.' Too bad for the kids, the parents, and the rest of us who have to put up with this garbage from millions of families across America.\n \n Whistler",
