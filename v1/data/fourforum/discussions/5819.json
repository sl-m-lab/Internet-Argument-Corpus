   "I was listening to a radio talk show, the host's name I can't remember, but she is a lady talk show host and although she is of the typical conservative talk show genre, what she says is usually sensible. She does, however use this as a ploy to subtly slip in some illogic that sounds logical.\n \n Anyway, she was discussing an interview with the mother of a soldier who had died in Iraq. She and her entire family, including the son, were against the Iraq war. In the same interview was another mother who had lost a son in the war, but was for the war.\n \n The talk show host then referred to some other person saying, \"Of course {so and so} has always been pro-military, pro-war, and pro-Bush.\" as if these three things were inextricably linked\n \n She then referred to the mother that was against the war in Iraq. \"How did they find the one mother whose son died in Iraq that's anti-military?\"\n \n This struck me as quite odd. First of all, if her son was in the military then how anti-military could she have been? The woman said she was against this one particular war. But this also doesn't make her \"pro-war.\"\n \n This also reminded me of a truck with Marine bumper stickers on it everywhere and one bumper sticker that just plainly said in bold letters \"PRO WAR\"\n \n I thought that this was absurd.\n \n +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n \n So after all that, here's the deal:\n \n Who here considers themselves \"pro-war.\" I mean in a general sense.\n What I take from the term \"pro war\" is that you are FOR war since that's what pro- means.\n \n Does this mean you like war?\n Does this mean you like death and destruction?\n Do you think there should be more war?\n Do you think there should be a war in the US?\n \n Are you pro-war and if so, how pro-war are you, and what do you mean by the term \"pro-war?\"",

   "So anyway, what I'm gathering from all is that I have misunderstood all this time.\n \n When someone says they are pro-war, that doesn't mean they are for war in a general sense, although that's what the words mean.\n \n It REALLY means that they support the reasoning behind the war that is going on at the time they call themselves pro-war. \n \n But when people say they are anti-war, they DO mean in a general sense?\n \n But someone who is pro-war now would always be pro-war, wouldn't they?\n \n Can you think of anyone who is in favor of the present war in Iraq but was against the war in Vietnam?\n \n Generally what I get is that anyone who supports wars that the US has started supports them all (I guess we only started 2-3 depending on how you see Korea and if you don't go back to the Spanish-American War). They will find all kinds of justifications and rationalizations to explain why they are pro-war at any given time, during any given war.\n \n In the future, the US will most likely have another war for whatever prupose and the people who call themselves pro-war will be all for it.\n \n So really,when someone goes to the trouble of calling themselves pro-war, they don't really mean in any temporary sense. \n \n Surely there is plenty of grey area here.\n I like to think that I'm like most people and detest the thought of war, but sometimes there is no alternative.",
