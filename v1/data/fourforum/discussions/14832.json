   "Reinterpreted and reinvented throughout the ages, the Bible has become the ultimate tool in justifying and perpetuating war, torture, murder, genocide, hatred, rape, slavery, racial hatred, infanticide, and gender subjugation,and all of these horrors have been executed with the justification that the perpetrator is simply following the word of a loving God. With even the most perfunctory application of archeological data, science, logic, and historical fact it becomes readily apparent what the Bible truly is. The Bible is a collection of mythic, pseudo-historical, epic, and theological fables and propaganda. \n The God of the Christian, Catholic, and Muslim Faiths as well as other Religions according to the Christian Bible, is directly responsible for many mass-murders, rapes, pillage, plunder, slavery, child abuse and killing, not to mention the killing of unborn children, Yet religious people simply refuse to see the real truth and are taught in churches how to \" explain\" these things away or they choose to simply ignore the parts that show their God in a bad light. Religion promotes delusion, the belief in an invisible being created by men to control the populations within societies. People of Faith will put their health , or the safety of their children at risk waiting for \" God' to step in and heal them, that is one of the atrocities of religion. \n \n I have a friend whom I've know for 30 years, she is a Christian Fundamentalist and truly believes all that she has been brainwashed to believe. This friend has suffered from Heart problems for ten years, and recently about 2 years ago she was Diagnosed with Diabetes. 8 months later she called me and was overjoyed, While telling me that she was no longer Diabetic. God had healed her, and she was just giddy with delusion. This past Christmas Eve this person went under the knife, to have Triple Bypass Heart surgery. She called me to tell me the day before, and my first thought was\" If GOD healed you of Diabetes, then why on earth would he not heal your heart as well\"... I didn't voice this to her at the time but I plan on asking her once she has recovered enough .\n \n Point is, just like a lot of the stories from your link, Religion is dangerous in the fact that it impedes critical thinking. The World suffered through a period where religion reigned stronger than ever, and human Evolution suffered greatly because of it.",

   "\n \n Do we really want to let people who don't know what the hell they are doing lead us backwards into the dark ages?\n\n \n No we do not. However as an American Atheist I am bound by the Constitution to allow these people their freedoms to express and worship. The state cannot interfere. That being said, these people have no right to effect the state either.\n \n That I think is where we as Atheists need to look at closely. We need to ensure that while these people are protected and can worship no matter how delusional and fringe some of them may be, they cannot effect law. They cannot influence the rights of others.\n \n That is the true danger here. All we can do is give reason and look critically at the world around us. We must remain vigilant in our own endeavors to ensure this world is a better place for all free thinkers.",

   "sure, allow them their freedom to believe, but respect? absolutely not.\n \n religion deserves no more respect than anything else. the bible deserves no more respect than any other literary publication, and finally God deserves no more respect than anyone else. i remember on the blogging website tumblr when people were freaking out because someone posted a picture of a bible in a toilet, as if it's wrong to disrespect christianity. religion is not exempt from criticism, nor is it exempt from insults. lets be honest, respect is extremely hard to find in religion and amongst the religious. why should we respect something that gives no respect in return? i refuse to.",
