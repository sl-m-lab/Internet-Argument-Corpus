   "Do the ten commandments still agree with every day life today? \n \n \n Examples that they don't agree:\n \n The first commandment says: I am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not have strange gods before me. \n \n That contradicts our idea of freedom of religion.\n \n The second commandment says: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\n \n We are abiding by that commandment very well. (sarcasm)\n \n The tenth commandment says: Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods. \n \n Coveting our neighbor's goods is the basis behind our economy and trade.\n \n \n What do you all think?",

   "Let me know if this is not the kind of answer you are looking for.\n \n I myself do not advocate their not being a god, but if asked my religion, I will say atheism (currently).\n \n \"The first commandment says: I am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not have strange gods before me.\"\n \n - This commandment does not agree with the most powerful of nations (US, and Europe).I agree with you that if this was in place in those nations there would be no freedom of religon. The fact is that the US has a seperation between church and state, therfor this commandment can not possibly agree with the ideas of the US. \n \n \"The second commandment says: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\"\n \n - This is not in place in the US, once again because of the seperation between church and state. It is not against the law to use gods name in vain. (ex. god damnit). Words are a manner of self expression, and should not be banned from scociety. Although I find it true that a resturaunt has the right to kick a customer out if he uses excessive language that could hurt the resturaunts buisness. This is fair.\n \n \"The tenth commandment says: Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods. \n Coveting our neighbor's goods is the basis behind our economy and trade.\"\n \n It is the basis behind are economy so I would have to agree, that one it doesn't make sense becaus: \n Greed is a human emotion, and emotions can be filtered but not altogether blocked. \n Two if we were not jealous for anything, we would not want a better car, house, or other things. This altogether would destory our economy.\n This I think is the worst commandment and hardest to follow. \n \n Commandments ---\n \n \"You shall not steal.\" \n \n - This is in place as well as it should be because it is violating the rights of others. \n \n Same response to \"You shall not steal.\" \n \n \"You shall not commit adultery.\" \n \n - As far as I am aware this is going against any laws but most find it unacceptable and wrong therfor it does fit societies ideas. \n \n Thanks For Reading This\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "Some of them would still be relevant, but only, in my opinion, ones such as 'You shall not steal' and 'You shall not kill.'\n \n We studied the commandments/laws/guidelines of differnt religions in class a year or two ago, and 'Thou shalt kill' was one of the most debated, as it's extremely imprecise. Does it apply to killing animals to eat? Euthenasia? Abortion? What about self-defence? Is picking flowers a sin, by this commandment?\n \n My opinion on that particular commandment is that it's certainly still relevant, but if a sizeable proportion of people worldwide are going to live by it, it ought to be more precise.\n \n And now that I've managed to go off on a wild tangent to the topic, I'll hit the post button and scuttle off emoticon_frazzled",
