   "Currently, YES, we can, and much faster than those folks who are building them by hand. Honestly, I hate to discuss this, since I am sure that the GG's out there, ignorant of the law as they tend to be, have no idea that in this country, you can build as many guns as you wish. There is no requirement to put serial numbers or any other markings on them. The only real restriction is that the gun you build may not be an automatic weapon or an assault weapon (at least until the AWB sunsets). You can even sell them, as long as you are not building them specifically to be sold. Of course, considering these are guns with no markings, it would be a nightmare to try to enforce that.\n \n There is a growing group of people doing this, there are even several yahoo groups devoted to the subject. Most of them are biulding kit guns. They buy demilled kits (kits with all the parts included except the reciever, which is the part that is the actual \"gun\" by legal standards) then they build new recievers for them. \n \n Of course, the gun kits that are most commonly available are military weapons being cycled out. Some of the more popular I have seen are the 1919, a belt fed squad support class machine gun. Guys are building semi auto versions of these (though from some of the message posting I have seen from some of these guys, there is nothing \"semi\" about a lot of hte guns being built). The AMD-63 and AMD-65 (short barreled versions of the AK-47 which are illegal to import into the US as guns, but fine to import as kits and re-build here), Uzis seem to be popular builds, as do Stens (A cheap and easy to build SMG). There also seems to be a real market for Druganov sniper rifles.\n \n Personally, I like to build 1911's (my favorite pistol), though I have also built a few Sig 228 copies, a browning high power, a couple of handguns of my own design, I have also built a 1919 (semi for me folks, I already have enough full auto stuff, really don't need to go to jail), a couple af AMD-63's (fun gun to play with), and a couple of .50 caliber rifles (semi-auto, not the bolt action that is generally available to the public). there are others (MAC's, etc...) but the ones listed were some of my more difficult builds.\n \n I don't think there were a whole lot of folks building their own weapons prior to the current gun control legislation, today, though, it seems to be a growing hobby. So, from a practicale standpoint, the current set of gun control laws have had no verifiable effect on crime, but they have helped spawn the construction of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of completley undocumented, untraceable, military weapons.\n \n WAY TO GO, ANTI GUNNERS. Another 10 years of this, and we will have created enough undocumented weapons for everybody in the country to have one. And many of these are not the relatively weak \"assault weapons\" you folks seem so concerned about. The 1919 fires a .308, but the conversion kits for 30-06 seem REALLY popular (like, waiting list to get one popular). These are BIG, SERIOUS weapons. Weapons that will go through a bullet proof vest like it isn't even there. Weapons that, in some cases (such as some of the .50 rifles being built) will puch through the engine block of a car and still have plenty of punch to go though a bulletproof vest like it isn't even there.\n \n I think that the pro-gunners in this country have learned their lesson from Waco, Ruby ridge, and all the other \"enforcement actions\" that end with a bunch of dead people, but no charges ever being filed. If your government does not agree with you, they will storm your house, seize everything you own, destroy your life, and murder your family and friends, but you WILL NOT get your day in court. If you sue, they will hand you a few million bucks, but persoanlly, I don't think I would be willing to trade my families lives for a few million dollars. How about you?\n \n Oh yes, those in this country who are concerned about things like rights and governmental abuse of power have learned their lesson well. We need bigger guns. If the folks at waco had actually been well armed, they could easily have broken out of that seige. If those who supported weaver had bettr weapons, they could have reduced the LE contingent at waco to little more than piles of freshly groud meat. \n \n Personally, I am not a militant, though I can see their viewpoint. I personally believe that we need a pretty drastic political revolution int his country, but I do not believe that it is time to start arming yourself with heavy weapons to use against our fellow Americans. Of course, i have the luxury of a large and well equipped machine shop, and I know that if that time ever did come, I can knock out heavy machine guns at the rate of about 4 per day (part of my job is estimating time and materials required to complete short run production items).\n \n This is pretty much thanks to the GG's in this country. Prior to their little reign of terror and rights infringement fest, you did not see peopel building heavy machine guns or anti-equipment sniper rifles at home. There was almost NO market for short barreled AK's, and there were not thousands of undocumented Uzis floating around.\n \n Technology is really helping, too. CNC mills are making the job a breeze. My first CNC machine cost close to $100,000 and was the size of a large van (mostly electronics and controls). Now, guys are building their own CNC machines using stepper motors they are scavenging from old printers and control boards they are making at home. You can BUY a CNC conversion for a mill now for under $500. It used to be that you needed a massive abrrel press, high pressure oil pumps, and large lathes in order to build gun barrels. The equipment alone represented an investment of around $100,000. Now, thanks to new technology, you can use an EDM machine that weighs 10 lbs and you can put together for under $200.",

You are either obeying the law or you are not.\n \n As far as the whole black market for homeade machine guns, this is likely because criminals are smarter than gun grabbers.

   "It is a problem for anti-gunners. If we can't buy them? How about making them?\n \n \n\n \n This question was decided in a fashion that invalidates the powers of the federal government less than a year ago.\n \n In U.S. v. Stewart a conviction for possession of a machine gun was overturned by (surprise, surprise) the 9th circuit because the regulated parts never entered interstate commerce.\n \"Because these firearms were genuinely homemade, we find that Stewart did not obtain his machineguns by \"us[ing] the channels of interstate commerce.\" . . . We reverse Stewart's conviction for machinegun possession under section 922(o) as an unlawful extension of Congress's commerce power\"\n This ruling is also boosting those fighting against federal marijuana laws; if it's homegrown, what can the feds say about it?\n \n Seems to be, nothing.\n \n The decision can be read here -\n \n http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/9th/0210318p.pdf",

Homemade guns used for crime is not the issue I tried to bring up. The issue I tried to bring up if guns are banned, they are SOOOOO easy to make. Good people by default will not make them, being good law abiding citizens. In Europe they don't make them. It is much easier to get them from Eastern Europe. Plus the don't mess of simple hunting rifles Sat night specials, they use heavy machineguns and RPGs. Ofcourse these machineguns and RPGs are in gun free countires:\n \n http://www.rense.com/general35/eascape.htm\n \n So then I ask you?
