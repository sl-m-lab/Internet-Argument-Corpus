   "We moved off topic so I created a new thread. For those wanting to see the previous statements made in the thread, you can go here.\n \n \n Okay if you are going to say that everything is evidence no matter what it is, then we will just have to disagree. But I think you would be hard pressed to get many people to agree with that definition.\n\n I don't necessarily think that exactly. What I had a problem with was with you saying that what someone thinks (i.e. me) is not evidence. As established, it's wrong by definition. I'm quite sure that many people with agree with it, since it's the most popular definition of the word. People rarely widely disagree with a definition from a reliable dictionary. Plus, it's really not for you to change the definition of the word in the dictionary. :)\n \n Was there no time before man was created since there was no one to perceive it?\n\n I believe that I have already answered this several times. Yes, of course - there was. Before man roamed the earth there was change and motion, and consequently - there was time.\n \n The old, does a falling tree make a sound in the forest if no one is there to hear it argument?\n\n There is a lot of controversy, and really - it's quite simple. How are you defining sound? Some definitions of sound suggest that it is only sound when it is heard by humans. If we leave it at this, we're left with so many questions. What if an animal is there? What about if you got a tape recorder? Would it be a sound only when it was played? What about a deaf person? Well, at least for this one, by our first definition, our answer should be \"yes\". Deaf people can pick \"sounds\" since sound is a vibration (if we define it as that). They hear sound with their fingers. Of course, they do not \"hear\" as well, since the ear is much better equipped for such things.\n \n sound1 P Pronunciation Key (sound)\n n. \n 1. \n a. Vibrations transmitted through an elastic solid or a liquid or gas, with frequencies in the approximate range of 20 to 20,000 hertz, capable of being detected by human organs of hearing. \n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=sound\n \n By this more appropriate definition, the tree falling in the wood does indeed make a \"sound\". \n \n \n The issue of whether it is closed or not has nothing to do with how much matter is in our universe.\n\n Matter density - it has everything to do with it. It all depends on the density of matter and energy in the Universe. It will either keep on expanding forever or it will be gravitationally slowed and will eventually collapse back on itself, sometimes called the \"big crunch\".\n \n About the Atom. You're right, people since Democritus thought that the atom was the smallest thing in the Universe. And at the time, that was the definition for the smallest thing. However, we must not forget that definitions change over time. If you check the definition of it now, you will see that it says nothing of the sort in the definition. The smallest thing, as far as I know, is a singularity.\n \n I can understand what you're trying to say about the Universe. Many scientists, even today, cannot fathom that the Universe is \"expanding\" but into nothing - which isn't something. It just doesn't seem to make sense. To try to provide an answer, some said it's expanding into \"hyperspace\" - which is more or less now considered a fictional thing, except in Star Trek. ;) I think it's also used in M-theory, but it's just the space between branes. Other said, \"it's expanding into another dimension\", which hasn't proved to be too credible either. \n \n Before I go on, we want to be careful of what we mean by \"expanding\". Expanding is probably even the wrong word to use. Planets, suns and solar systems aren't expanding. Even space itself is not expanding. All we know is that galaxies are moving further and further away from each other. And the further they are to us, the faster they're going. \n \n Like I have said, it is hard for us to use empirical methods to find out whether there is something \"outside\". As the classic big bang theory goes, there is not spatial boundary - no point that you can go to and say, hey! this is the boundary! However, although there is no spatial boundary, evidence suggests that it is spatially finite. Refer to the analogy with a 2d ant on a 3d model above. \n \n The thing about multiple dimensions and multiverses is that they're all well and good but all such ideas are currently not testable and so cannot be regarded as anything more than speculation. We can't really say anything about them - and there are too many questions that arise. There is a lot of possibility, but no common understanding - more like science fiction.\n We can say that there are other \"universes\" that all exist in \"hyperspace\", but we really have no reason to believe so. If time began at the big bang, then what? Are there different dimensions of time for different Universes? What happens when two Universes \"expand into each other\"? Is \"hyperspace\" infinite? \n \n I mean outside the physical matter caused by the big bang like I said above.\n\n Just how do you intend on reaching it if there is no possible access to it? Like I said, the Universe is curved. If you go forward for ever and ever you'll get back to where you started.",

Check post 36 on the last thread.\n\n \n Just because you write a big paragraph on something, doesn't mean it's clear or even correct. In that post you argued two things. One was that if there is no one to perceive motion, then time does not exist. We have already agreed that perception is not required for time. The second part was that time is the result of motion or if there is not motion, then there is no time.\n \n First of all I am not saying that time did not begin at the big bang. I am saying that hasn't been determined yet and no one can say for sure. There are several ways this might turn out to be true. If there are other universes that are older, then even by your definition time began before our big bang. If time is a property that is not dependent on something moving, then time may have begun before the big bang or may have even always existed. If the universe is cyclic, then time has always existed even by your definition. And cyclic can be both cases of the theory we use to describe our universe. The first is the collapse and rebirth. The second is the continual expansion. In that case everything will eventually combine into black holes. Then after billions of years, those black holes will degrade into nothing, and we will be right back where we started.\n \n \nIf time is part of the Universe, you cannot therefore say that it was around \"before\" the Universe was created - it's a contradiction.
