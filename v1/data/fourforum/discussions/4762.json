But if you're going to pretend, you minus well just make the blasted thing, you're already producing alot of the stuff you need anyways.

Thus, using a crude cost-benefit analysis, better to take some shells now rather than risk radioactive long-distance strikes later.\n\n \n True, but that goes out the window if they already have it. We will risk combat coventially, We will not risk combat with nuclear weapons on the table. Thus is the difference.

   "Conventional deterrence is not obsolete and North Korea retains it in spades.\n\n \n We could effectively destroy N koreas border defenses in a matter of a coupleof weeks of intensive bombing, and their offensive abilty (abilty to act outside their own borders) is nill in a conventional capacity. Their great equlaiser is the ability to put a mushroom cloud over Los Angeles, and the knowledge that hina would back their play if they used nuslear deterrent against invasion.\n \n \nIf anything, North Korea's nuclear ambitions have undermined its position as it makes military action more, not less palatable.\n\n \n How do you figure? While their attempts to gain weapons may have increased the chance of military intervention, now that they have them, military intervention is off the table. It was questionable whether or not we could \"take\" N Korea in a conventional war, since they would undoubtedly have chinese backing (If you will remember, we were beaten, and beaten rather badly last time around). Add their nuclear ability to that, including the fact that while the world would likely tun a blind eye to the use of nuclear weapons as a purtely defensive measure, but almost certainly NOT tot he use of like force by the US, the agressor in this case, it essentially makes a war on the korean penninsula unwinnable. \n \n \nThey key to dealing with North Korea is China. China has the power to curb North Korea's ambitions short of war and everyone knows it. China must be shown that the advantages of North Korean nuclear weapons are offset by the disadvantages.\n\n \n This is absolutly correct. Unfortunatly, the Chinese do not seem to have any problem with N Korea having nukes, nor do they seem inclined to support our efforts to disarm them. While the US has adopted a policy of \"stabilization\", that is, keeping those on top on top and keeping other nations down, china, and much of the rest of the world, seems tired of beiong \"stabilized\". There is virtually no chance that the chinese will intervene on our behalf as far as the korean situation goes. All it would take is a word from Beijing, and the Korean weapions program would be gone tomorrow. It seems far more likely that the Chinese and Koreans both will milk this for all it is worth. The koreans will hold out for billions of dollars in aid and trade agreements (the EU is all kinds of ready with the trade relations), and China will play the N korean card as a way to gett he arms embargo against them lifted, in whihc case they will assure N Koreas defense using their own nuclear aresenal, as well as having all kinds of bright, shiny new weapons to pass across the border to them. \n \n This may all be a moot point in the end, though, since it appears that the EU will likely lift the arms embargo against china, or at least their part of it, in return for market share in chinas domestic markets and their up and coming arms business. If they (the chinese) can pull this off without having to move on the Krean situtation, it is unlikely we will ever see any \"improvement\" in that area.\n \n The days of the US standing on high and passing down proclomations as far as who may and may not defend themselves with nuclear weapons are apparently over. It has become crystal clear that, while we may posture and rattle the sabre, we are unwilling to step up to a real threat. While invading a third tier nation, already crippled after years of sanctions, relying on a army composed of 20 yr old russian gear and conscript soldiers, seems to still be within our power, stepping up to a nation where our casualties may well consist of an entire US battlegroup in the first 3 hours of the war is apparently not. \n \n While our leaders are apparently willing to \"bang of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor\" at the cost of only a few americans lives, they are not willing to risk the widescale casualties associated with taking on a nuclear armed nation. \n \n \nA remilitarized Japan threatens the entire Asian rim - particularly China. If China allows North Korea to go nuclear, the US could counter by encouraging and enabling similar technologies in Taiwan and Japan.\n\n \n Yea, right. The fact that Taiwan has not already been nuked off the map is based almost entirely on hopes by China that they will be able to bring them back into the fold so to speak with their industrial and trade infrastructure intact. The minute it starts to look like Taiwan might actually be a threat, especially a nuclear threat, china will obliterate Taiwan. AThey do not even have to use nukes to do it. Taiwan does not have the massive patriot missile defense network that S Korea has, and even if they did, the chinese ar more than capable of sending enoguh firepower their way in order to take down taiwan. They would not even have to go nuclear,. They could easily wipe them out with conventional missiles, and without a single chinese casualty. Japan is in the same boat. they simply are not big enough, nor do they have enough people, to start annoying China. Besides, why would they? The Japanese have thrown their lot in with the chinese in most respects. They have hundreds of billions, maybe even trillions, invested in the chinese economy and helping to get it off the ground. I would hazartd to guess that, should things actually come to a head between the US and China, the japanese would be right in line behind the Europeans to back China. there is simply too much invested there. Nobody is going to back a has been consumer economy like the US against an up and coming industrialist nation like china.\n \n \nThat is the reason why we have taken a different approach. In Iraq, all of the options short of war were exhausted. That is not the case in East Asia.\n\n \n Yes, all the options had been exhausted. We had UN inspectors inspecting gardening sheds and outhouses, and still no WMDs, Saddam was still taking only Euros for oil, and the Sauds were still kicking us out of our bases there. We werte at the end of the line. We either had to drop all the BS and end the sanctions, which would effectively have been the end of the petro dollar, the end of US direct involvement in the ME, and the start of some very difficult question from the international community with the release of the UN inspectors final report, like, \"Why did we starve a million children to death when the UN inspectors declared Iraq WMD free 10 years ago?\"\n \n You can twist it however you want, but at the end of the day, nations all over the world are clamoring for nuclear weapons in order to defend themselves against the American threat, and it seems that they are meeting with some sucess. I will remind you again that the very week G Bush said \"We will not allow Syria to pursue nuclear technology\", the russians shipped the first of many loads of reactor parts to Syria.",

A key component of this initiative involves the deployment of large numbers of long-range 240mm multiple rocket launcher systems and 170mm self-propelled guns to hardened sites located near the Demilitarized Zone.\n \n According to one report, a South Korean security analyst suggested that DPRK artillery pieces of calibers 170mm and 240mm \"could fire 10,000 rounds per minute to Seoul and its environs.\" North Korea has about 500 long-range artillery tubes within range of Seoul, and the total rate of fire of thjese artillery pieces would be between 2,000 and 4,000 rounds per minute. The DPRK's two hundred 240mm MRLs fire either 12 or 22 rounds, providing a maximum single salvo of no more than 4,400 rounds.\n \n These launchers can fire a first strike of many thousands of missiles and return in a few minutes to protected caves or to alternate firing positions. The MRLs move out from underground facilities (UGFs), fire from preplanned firing positions, and return to the UGFs. Examination of the available data on the UGF sites suggests that a number of possible \"exit and return\" methods for the MRLs may be possible. In this case, the launchers move directly from the firing points to the UGFs. This procedure makes it difficult to target the launchers, because once they fire it only takes 75 seconds to return to their UGFs. The MRLs can fire their complete set of rockets in 44 seconds. Data from the Joint Precision Strike Demonstration Project Office indicates that the crew then needs two minutes to lower the launcher, raise the stabilizing pads, and quickly return to the UGF. This gives a total exposure time of 164 seconds. However, it is possible that the MRLs could displace faster than the JSPD case or that they might take longer. \"\n \n http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/m-1985-mrl.htm\n \n http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/army.htm",
