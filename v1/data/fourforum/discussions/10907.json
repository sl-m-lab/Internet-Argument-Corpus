The question posed was \"did Jesus say he was the son of God?\"\n \n Archie says that Jesus answered directly:\n \nHere is Jesus being asked directly if He is the Son of God, and He answers directly that He is. \n\n \n And as evidence he quotes:\n \n \nMat 26:63 But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, \"I adjure You by the living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of God.\"\n \n Mat 26:64 Jesus *said to him, \"You have said it {yourself;} nevertheless I tell you, hereafter you will see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN.\" \n\n \n In which Jesus says nothing of the kind. He says the \"son of man\" (whatever that means) will be seated at, presumedly, the right hand of God. He never directly refers to himself. He sounds like he is deliberately avoiding the question. \n \n Arch then quoted more of the same saying that the father and I are one. \n \n Why the heck didn't he (jesus) just answer the question? Or, more precisely, why didn't those who were telling the story second hand, tells us that he answered the question directly and to the point and leave out any question??? That leads me to believe that the gospel was not intending to be clear on the topic.\n \n I never get that about the biblists. When you hear the words, \"the bible clearly says\" or \"the bible tells us\", be prepared for gibbersih and half-statements. It is indeed poetic, but it is anything but clear.\n \n Please, someone other than Archie, who knows the bible -Zardoz comes to mind- please try to explain this.\n \n No offense Archie, but your response will be predictably evasive, confusing and simply muck up the topic.

You can make the case that parts of the Old Testament fall into this category, but the New Testament dates from within the same century as the events it describes (or most of it does at any rate) and the reason for its composition is to serve the need for knowledge in the church that already existed, the church did not begin with the writing of the New Testament. There is substantial evidence that Christians were in existence in the first century. Now, you can claim that the Gospels contain embelishments or wishful thinking, and given the distance in time I would find it difficult to demonstrate otherwise, but to claim that they are myths is patently absurd.\n \n You are of course free to believe what you will, but if you are attempting to convince others then derision only serves to confirm how ignorant you already appear to be.\n\n \n \n Well thank you Jo. But as far as ignorance goes, I believe it is you and all the rest who would believe this nonsense that is called christianity. It is based on no evidence and on one set of writings that were selected 300 years after the alleged events occurred by a group of power hunger men. There is no truth to any of the stories, though there may be some lessons to be learned from the stories, as is the case with many myths and legends. YOU are certainly entitled to believe anything you wish, but to deride the rest of us for thinking you'r a FOOL, is your problem, not mine. The same can be said for your buddy troll Archie.",

   "\n Ever looked into the islamic point of view on Jesus and what high status he is given by muslims, even though muslims would never say he is God or son of God. I been exploring all of these views lately to seek out the truth to which is the most clear and straight forward version.\n\n \n Anyone can make anything they want up.\n \n New Agers and some pagans also exhault Jesus as a wise man, elightened, user of spiritual arts and manipulator of laws.\n Putting him on the same level as a Buddha or Guru. \n All depends on what you want.\n So, it really doesn't matter how a religion based in the middel east sees Jesus several hundered years after his alleged comming.\n \n As for your prior post.\n I haven't read in any Christan text that Jesus was 'tied' down.\n However, tying one to a cross was the prime way to crucify someone in those times.\n You would slowly suffocate due to how you were placed there.\n Eventually, towards the end, they'd break your legs to help speed this process up (so you can't support your weight to breath and keep your chest unrestricted). Allegedly when they came to Jesus, he was already dead and this wasn't needed. Hence the alleged fulfilling of Old Testament prophecy in regards to his death (no bones broken).\n \n But, for Jesus, it was said they used nails to crucify him with.\n IMO, this was mostly to due with a time limit. \n They couldn't let him stay hanging on the cross as the next day was a religious day and no one would be allowed to die then. Thus, break the legs to speed it up. And finally, stab them with a spear to ensure they are dead. When Jesus was stabbed, watery fluids ran out smelling like roses from what I recall.\n I'd suggest that the 2 criminals hanging by his side were up there prior to Jesus being nailed to the cross. with ropes used for them.\n When Jesus was put up there, they'd desire to try to speed up the process of death with the use of nails. No ability to pull yourself up or push yourself up with arms or legs without massive pain and you'd choke to death faster.\n Normally, they'd have a while (days) to let you die slowly.\n So the 'brutality' of using nails wasn't born out of maliciousness but out of a desire to have him die faster.\n Which he did.\n \n Arch knows the bible pretty well. I'd give him a scour of about 80 out of 100 for what it actually says. Which is pretty decent as most believers don't even crack the book open.\n I can give him a good run for his money in biblical discussion.\n My suggestion would be to simply read the thing and not rely on extra-biblical sources for references until after that's done. Doing so, I find you typically will have people make claims about the bible that simply aren't true or accurate. Whether they be believers like Arch or non believers like me.\n \n Once you actually know what's written you can then go onto what sects of Christianity believes what about what is written. \n From Calvinism which has the predestination, God controls all things including you to the Pentecostals who believe in a personal relationship with God as use of Charismatic gifts like laying on of hands for healing, casting out demons and babbling as a version of speaking in tongues.\n You have a nearly 2,000 year old tradition of Catholicism vying with Protestants. You have conservative and liberal versions of the same sect too.\n IIRC, there are ~30,000 different Christian sects or divisions in the Church.\n There's a whole different 'language' with religious meanings. \n For example, 'bathed in the blood' would be a common term for Evangelicals and in a litteral sense, would sound barbaric to an outsider (gah, covered in muckybood?!?) but to a believer is simply mean you have accepted the (blood) sacrifice Jesus as payment for your 'sins'.\n Things like sanctified, anointed, born again. All have religious meanings that a secular person wouldn't understand.\n \n It can all be quite confusing.\n \n Unless you have an actual reason to learn this stuff...you might find drilling holes into your head more useful.\n I'd recommend a Black & Decker plug in power drill with a 1/4\" bit.\n \n Smoking crack can be good too.\n \n Bathing with a toaster if you really want excitement.\n \n But, having a desire to just learn about a &%#$@ religion makes no sense.\n \n If you're looking for 'spiritual enlightenment' then masturbation would be in order.\n \n If you're too timid for any of that, try staring at the sun or watching paint dry.",

The question is, was and is He the true Messiah?

Why would an informed people who were looking for a LIVING Messiah then follow a DEAD false Prophet who was proven to be false by remaining dead?\n \n So can't you see that the best evidence of Christ's existence and the truth of who He is has to be the combined billions of human beings who have followed Him since that day 2000 years ago when He was so brutally murdered and became the unblemished sacrificial lamb who died for our sins? \n \n 2000 years ago, before ascending on high Jesus told His followers that He must go to prepare a place for us, but that He would send the Comforter (Holy Spirit) who would abide in us and guide all believers in Him into all understanding according to His will. (John 14:26)And 2000 years later as one born into this generation, I am attesting to you that I have had that same promise fulfilled in my personal experience and life. \n \n So Jesus Christ was not just a figure of His time, but was a figure for all time and does not fit within any one time period but embraces every generation equally and with equal force and power. And time itself submits to His authority as He is the Word of God who spoke it into existence. (John 1:1) To deny this reality is to deny reality itself.

(John 14:26)And 2000 years later as one born into this generation, I am attesting to you that I have had that same promise fulfilled in my personal experience and life. \n \n So Jesus Christ was not just a figure of His time, but was a figure for all time and does not fit within any one time period but embraces every generation equally and with equal force and power. And time itself submits to His authority as He is the Word of God who spoke it into existence. (John 1:1) To deny this reality is to deny reality itself. I know of no other way to describe how important his contribution is to the redemption of humanity, because without Messiah, there would be no redemption at all in the hearts of Men.",

   "But there are miraculous acts in Acts to which Luke was a witness. Early 2nd century is later than most scholars believe Acts was written. The traditional view is that they were written about AD60, shortly after Paul's letters. The vast majority of scholars put them before AD100.\n\n \n \n That depends. The earliest that many scholars feel it was written is in the 80's. However, there is a substantial piece of evidence that lends itself to the idea that the author of Luke/acts used Josephus as a source. IF that is true, the late first century or very early second is most likely. The terminus of it being written is 130, since Marcion had a version of it in is Gospels, dated then.\n \n Why don't you look up the passages that show 'We', and show where he is talking about Jesus.. not Paul.\n \n Prove your claim",

   "No comment on the common sense deductions that speak to Jesus being a real historical figure huh samiinh? Just admit that nothing will squelch your anti-christian bigotry and blind hatred for anything that is deeper than the flesh which you can reach out to touch and feel.\n Samiinh, try to get passed your anti-christian hate and bigotry for just a second and ask a few key questions. The jewish people of the first century were all raised with the same level of religious training from childhood. Regarding a minimum standard is what I am referring to. Now it is true that people of that generation were looking for the Messiah so one could deduce that they were susceptible to being scammed by a poser. But on the other hand, they knew the prophecies that describe Him and His coming also.\n \n Now, that Jesus Christ lived and walked the Earth as a man who claimed to be the Son of God is a given historical fact that cannot be denied with any veracity at all, so let's just get past that denial. The question is, was and is He the true Messiah? So one must ask how after such a public and brutal execution that Jesus suffered, how could His small group of friends who were fishermen, and men of other menial type craft jobs, who as Peter documented, denied they even knew Him and went into hiding in order to avoid the same fate.\n \n So consider this; if Jesus remained dead after being crucified, doesn't it make sense that the belief in Him would have died with Him? Why did thousands of faithful Jews seemingly convert to this radical belief system in complete opposition of the Religious Authorities who the people understood condoned the killing of Jesus if the promoter and founder was now dead by the most brutal and humiliating method of execution of the day? Why would an informed people who were looking for a LIVING Messiah then follow a DEAD false Prophet who was proven to be false by remaining dead?\n \n So can't you see that the best evidence of Christ's existence and the truth of who He is has to be the combined billions of human beings who have followed Him since that day 2000 years ago when He was so brutally murdered and became the unblemished sacrificial lamb who died for our sins? \n \n 2000 years ago, before ascending on high Jesus told His followers that He must go to prepare a place for us, but that He would send the Comforter (Holy Spirit) who would abide in us and guide all believers in Him into all understanding according to His will.

I know of no other way to describe how important his contribution is to the redemption of humanity, because without Messiah, there would be no redemption at all in the hearts of Men.\n\n \n \n I'm sorry, but I haven't not been shown any historic evidence that the alleged Jesus of Nazareth ever existed. Rant all you want, Arch, it just isn't provable.",
