(Even for those who marry illegally, I suspect few, if any, are aware of it.)\n\n Maybe, maybe not. I can't say one way or the other if there's any state that wouldn't allow a straight couple to get married, but Mass would. In essence, however, you are correct. I suspect straight couples aren't grilled on their qualifications if they're from out of state. And if their marriage license wouldn't be granted in their home state, they will non the less be considered married once they get home.\n \n \n\n I mean gay couples. For example, my partner and I are residents of California, but I can imagine circumstances that would cause us to move to Boston JUST TO GET MARRIED.

As things stand currently, MA wouldn't marry you. If you don't live in Massachusetts, and your home state wouldn't marry you, you can't get a license to marry in MA. So the issue wouldn't come up; you can't get married now and have it recognized later. On the other hand, if you moved to Boston, bought a house and everything, got married, then moved back to California, then moved back to Boston, I suspect (IANAL) you would still be considered married in MA.",
