I also think that Bush is biggest opportunist there ever was. If it was not for his daddy he would still be milking cattle in Crawford. I'm sorry but I think they are all scammers but Bush is the biggest one. Come on now people made him out to be a hero for crying out lowd any president would done the same thing after 9-11 and yes it was a sad day I lost a friend in one of the towers. Bush has done nothing for the elderly like he said he would a lot of these folk's are on a fixed cash flow and they have a hard time to make ends meet. And these people have worked hard all there life. I think it is time that the president start working on some important issues here. Instead of playing war. How about trying to come up with a peace plan. Health care for those that are in need. prescription coverage instead of siding with the big drug company's. Help small businesses out instead of big fat corporations. And that is for starters. And as for Clinton he did not get impeached. Every thing would have been fine if the Concervatives did not pry into his bedroom affairs come on now Newt G. R. from GA. did the same thing he was banging women on the side but the Liberals did not make that big of a deal about it. Come on now face the facts in this country not GA. peanuts",

It's saying one thing to one group and the opposite to another, it's the lies to get votes, it's the wishy-washy, two-faced political bulldung that paints Kerry as a shifty, untrustworthy piece of work.\n \n If Kerry spoke before one group and said \"I think we should all part our hair on the right.\", and then spoke before another group and said, \"I think we should all part our hair on the left.\", I would say he's an opportunist...even though I could not care less which side the hair is parted on. \n \n I don't care about Kerry's SUVs, I don't care about Clinton's hummers...I care that they lied.\n \n Do you get the point?\nWell I do care about Kerrys.misleading it is peanuts compaired to Bush's misleading us for the umteenth time wishy washy garbage that we have been getting. Take a look at Maineac's post in the past. At least he knows how to dig up dirt on ole glamor boy. And you did care about Clintons personal life you Republicans made the biggist deal out of it. Gee you guys had fun with that more then you like to eat. I don't buy your garbage.",

John Kerry said yesterday that he is breaking party ranks to support most-favored-nation trade status for China &#8230; &#8216;I think the president has some strong arguments about some of the assets of most-favored-nation status for China,&#8217; Kerry said.&#8221; (John Aloysius Farrell, &#8220;Kerry Breaks Party Ranks To Back China Trade Status,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 6/15/91)\n \n In 2000, Kerry Voted In Favor Of Permanent Normal Trade Relations With China.

KERRY: &#8220;George, I said at the time I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.&#8221; (ABC News, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Columbia, SC, 5/4/03)\n \n Kerry Later Claimed He Voted &#8220;To Threaten&#8221; Use Of Force In Iraq. &#8220;I voted to threaten the use of force to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United Nations.&#8221; (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At Announcement Of Presidential Candidacy, Mount Pleasant, SC, 9/2/03)\n \n Now, Kerry Says He Is Anti-War Candidate. CHRIS MATTHEWS: &#8220;Do you think you belong to that category of candidates who more or less are unhappy with this war, the way it&#8217;s been fought, along with General Clark, along with Howard Dean and not necessarily in companionship politically on the issue of the war with people like Lieberman, Edwards and Gephardt? Are you one of the anti-war candidates?&#8221; KERRY: &#8220;I am -- Yes, in the sense that I don&#8217;t believe the president took us to war as he should have, yes, absolutely.&#8221; (MSNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Hardball,&#8221; 1/6/04)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Eliminating Marriage Penalty For Middle Class\n \n Kerry Said He Will Fight To Keep Tax Relief For Married Couples. &#8220;Howard Dean and Gephardt are going to put the marriage penalty back in place. So if you get married in America, we&#8217;re going to charge you more taxes. I do not want to do that.&#8221; (Fox News&#8217; &#8220;Special Report,&#8221; 10/23/03)\n \n Said Democrats Fought To End Marriage Penalty Tax. &#8220;We fought hard to get rid of the marriage penalty.&#8221; (MSNBC&#8217;s &#8220;News Live,&#8221; 7/31/03)\n \n But, In 1998, Kerry Voted Against Eliminating Marriage Penalty Relief For Married Taxpayers With Combined Incomes Less Than $50,000 Per Year, Saving Taxpayers $46 Billion Over 10 Years.

John Kerry, Remarks At Town Hall Meeting, Manchester, NH, 8/6/03)\n \n Now, Kerry Attacks Patriot Act. &#8220;We are a nation of laws and liberties, not of a knock in the night. So it is time to end the era of John Ashcroft. That starts with replacing the Patriot Act with a new law that protects our people and our liberties at the same time. I&#8217;ve been a District Attorney and I know that what law enforcement needs are real tools not restrictions on American&#8217;s basic rights.&#8221; (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At Iowa State University, 12/1/03)\n \n Kerry Took BOTH Sides On First Gulf War\n \n Kerry Took BOTH Sides In First Gulf War In Separate Letters To Same Constituent. &#8220;Rather than take a side--albeit the one he thought was most expedient--Kerry actually stood on both sides of the first Gulf war, much like he did this time around. Consider this &#8216;Notebook&#8217; item from TNR&#8217;s March 25, 1991 issue, which ran under the headline &#8216;Same Senator, Same Constituent&#8217;: &#8216;Thank you for contacting me to express your opposition ... to the early use of military force by the US against Iraq. I share your concerns. On January 11, I voted in favor of a resolution that would have insisted that economic sanctions be given more time to work and against a resolution giving the president the immediate authority to go to war.&#8217; --letter from Senator John Kerry to Wallace Carter of Newton Centre, Massachusetts, dated January 22 [1991] &#8216;Thank you very much for contacting me to express your support for the actions of President Bush in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. From the outset of the invasion, I have strongly and unequivocally supported President Bush&#8217;s response to the crisis and the policy goals he has established with our military deployment in the Persian Gulf.&#8217; --Senator Kerry to Wallace Carter, January 31 [1991]&#8221; (Noam Scheiber, &#8220;Noam Scheiber&#8217;s Daily Journal of Politics, The New Republic Online, 1/28/04) \n \n Flip-Flopped On Gay Marriage Amendment\n \n In 2002, Kerry Signed Letter &#8220;Urging&#8221; MA Legislature To Reject Constitutional Amendment Banning Gay Marriage. &#8220;We rarely comment on issues that are wholly within the jurisdiction of the General Court, but there are occasions when matters pending before you are of such significance to all residents of the Commonwealth that we think it appropriate for us to express our opinion. One such matter is the proposed Constitutional amendment that would prohibit or seriously inhibit any legal recognition whatsoever of same-sex relationships. We believe it would be a grave error for Massachusetts to enshrine in our Constitution a provision which would have such a negative effect on so many of our fellow residents. &#8230; We are therefore united in urging you to reject this Constitutional amendment and avoid stigmatizing so many of our fellow citizens who do not deserve to be treated in such a manner.&#8221; (Sen. John Kerry, et al, Letter To Members Of The Massachusetts Legislature, 7/12/02)\n \n Now, In 2004, Kerry Won&#8217;t Rule Out Supporting Similar Amendment. &#8220;Asked if he would support a state constitutional amendment barring gay and lesbian marriages, Kerry didn&#8217;t rule out the possibility. &#8216;I&#8217;ll have to see what language there is,&#8217; he said.&#8221; (Susan Milligan, &#8220;Kerry Says GOP May Target Him On &#8216;Wedge Issue,&#8217;&#8221; The Boston Globe, 2/6/04)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Attacking President During Time Of War\n \n In March 2003, Kerry Promised Not To Attack President When War Began. &#8220;Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts &#8230; said he will cease his complaints once the shooting starts. &#8216;It&#8217;s what you owe the troops,&#8217; said a statement from Kerry, a Navy veteran of the Vietnam War. &#8216;I remember being one of those guys and reading news reports from home. If America is at war, I won&#8217;t speak a word without measuring how it&#8217;ll sound to the guys doing the fighting when they&#8217;re listening to their radios in the desert.&#8217;&#8221; (Glen Johnson, &#8220;Democrats On The Stump Plot Their War Rhetoric,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 3/11/03)\n \n But Weeks Later, With Troops Just Miles From Baghdad, Kerry Broke His Pledge. &#8220;&#8216;What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States,&#8217; Kerry said in a speech at the Peterborough Town Library. Despite pledging two weeks ago to cool his criticism of the administration once war began, Kerry unleashed a barrage of criticism as US troops fought within 25 miles of Baghdad.&#8221; (Glen Johnson, &#8220;Kerry Says Us Needs Its Own &#8216;Regime Change,&#8217;&#8221; The Boston Globe, 4/3/03)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Death Penalty For Terrorists\n \n In 1996, Kerry Attacked Governor Bill Weld For Supporting Death Penalty For Terrorists. KERRY: &#8220;Your policy would amount to a terrorist protection policy. Mine would put them in jail.&#8221; (1996 Massachusetts Senate Debate, 9/16/96)\n \n In 1996, Kerry Said, &#8220;You Can Change Your Mind On Things, But Not On Life-And-Death Issues.&#8221; (Timothy J. Connolly, &#8220;The &#8216;Snoozer&#8217; Had Some Life,&#8221; [Worcester, MA] Telegram & Gazette, 7/3/96)\n \n But, In 2002, Kerry Said He Supported Death Penalty For Terrorists. KERRY: &#8220;The law of the land is the law of the land, but I have also said that I am for the death penalty for terrorists because terrorists have declared war on your country.&#8221; (NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet The Press,&#8221; 12/1/02)\n \n Flip-Flopped On No Child Left Behind\n \n Kerry Voted For No Child Left Behind Act.

Kerry In Tune With Educators,&#8221; The [Quincy, MA] Patriot Ledger, 7/11/03)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Affirmative Action\n \n In 1992, Kerry Called Affirmative Action &#8220;Inherently Limited And Divisive.&#8221; &#8220;[W]hile praising affirmative action as &#8216;one kind of progress&#8217; that grew out of civil rights court battles, Kerry said the focus on a rights-based agenda has &#8216;inadvertently driven most of our focus in this country not to the issue of what is happening to the kids who do not get touched by affirmative action, but &#8230; toward an inherently limited and divisive program which is called affirmative action.&#8217; That agenda is limited, he said, because it benefits segments of black and minority populations, but not all. And it is divisive because it creates a &#8216;perception and a reality of reverse discrimination that has actually engendered racism.&#8217;&#8221; (Lynne Duke, &#8220;Senators Seek Serious Dialogue On Race,&#8221; The Washington Post, 4/8/92)\n \n In 2004, Kerry Denied Ever Having Called Affirmative Action &#8220;Divisive.&#8221; CNN&#8217;s KELLY WALLACE: &#8220;We caught up with the Senator, who said he never called affirmative action divisive, and accused Clark of playing politics.&#8221; SEN. KERRY: &#8220;That&#8217;s not what I said. I said there are people who believe that. And I said mend it, don&#8217;t end it. He&#8217;s trying to change what I said, but you can go read the quote. I said very clearly I have always voted for it. I&#8217;ve always supported it. I&#8217;ve never, ever condemned it. I did what Jim Clyburn did and what Bill Clinton did, which is mend it. And Jim Clyburn wouldn&#8217;t be supporting it if it were otherwise. So let&#8217;s not have any politics here. Let&#8217;s keep the truth.&#8221; (CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Inside Politics,&#8221; 1/30/04)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Ethanol\n \n Kerry Twice Voted Against Tax Breaks For Ethanol. (S. Con.

It had a smaller tax cut but more tax cut for a stimulus, which is what we need. So you ask me, what do we need now? Yes, we need additional stimulus. We should absolutely not raise taxes.

Many of us thought it should have even maybe been a little bit larger this last year &#8230; [T]he next tax cut doesn&#8217;t take effect until 2004. If we can grow the economy enough between now and then, if we have sensible policies in place and make good choices, who knows what our choices will be.

Lawmakers,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 3/1/94)\n \n Two Years Later, Kerry Flip-Flopped. &#8220;Kerry no longer supports the 50-cent [gas tax] hike, nor the 25-cent hike proposed by the [Concord] coalition.&#8221; (Michael Grunwald, &#8220;Kerry Gets Low Mark On Budgeting,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 4/30/96)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Leaving Abortion Up To States\n \n Kerry Used To Say Abortion Should Be Left Up To States. &#8220;I think the question of abortion is one that should be left for the states to decide,&#8221; Kerry said during his failed 1972 Congressional bid. (&#8220;John Kerry On The Issues,&#8221; The [Lowell, MA] Sun, 10/11/72)\n \n Now Kerry Says Abortion Is Law Of Entire Nation. &#8220;The right to choose is the law of the United States. No person has the right to infringe on that freedom. Those of us who are in government have a special responsibility to see to it that the United States continues to protect this right, as it must protect all rights secured by the constitution.&#8221; (Sen. John Kerry [D-MA], Congressional Record, 1/22/85)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Litmus Tests For Judicial Nominees\n \n Kerry Used To Oppose Litmus Tests For Judicial Nominees. &#8220;Throughout two centuries, our federal judiciary has been a model institution, one which has insisted on the highest standards of conduct by our public servants and officials, and which has survived with undiminished respect. Today, I fear that this institution is threatened in a way that we have not seen before. &#8230; This threat is that of the appointment of a judiciary which is not independent, but narrowly ideological, through the systematic targeting of any judicial nominee who does not meet the rigid requirements of litmus tests imposed &#8230;&#8221; (Sen. John Kerry, Congressional Record, 2/3/86, p. S864)\n \n But Now Kerry Says He Would Only Support Supreme Court Nominees Who Pledge To Uphold Roe v. Wade. &#8220;The potential retirement of Supreme Court justices makes the 2004 presidential election especially important for women, Senator John F. Kerry told a group of female Democrats yesterday, and he pledged that if elected president he would nominate to the high court only supporters of abortion rights under its Roe v. Wade decision. &#8230; &#8216;Any president ought to appoint people to the Supreme Court who understand the Constitution and its interpretation by the Supreme Court. In my judgment, it is and has been settled law that women, Americans, have a defined right of privacy and that the government does not make the decision with respect to choice. Individuals do.&#8217;&#8221; (Glen Johnson, &#8220;Kerry Vows Court Picks To Be Abortion-Rights Supporters,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 4/9/03)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Federal Health Benefits\n \n In 1993, Kerry Expressed Doubts That Federal Employees Health Benefits System Worked Well. &#8220;Hillary Rodham Clinton today offered a fresh description of one of the most confusing elements of the Administration health care plan, the health insurance purchasing alliances, saying they would let all Americans choose coverage in the way members of Congress do. &#8230; Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said he was not sure that the Federal program worked all that well.&#8221; (Adam Clymer, &#8220;Hillary Clinton Says Health Plan Will Be Familiar,&#8221; The New York Times, 12/8/93)\n \n Kerry Expressed Personal Dissatisfaction With His Coverage Through Federal Program. &#8220;Earlier this month, when Hillary Rodham Clinton came to Boston and vowed that average Americans would get as good coverage as that enjoyed by their senators and representatives, Sen. John F. Kerry told Clinton that he thought the country could do better. The Massachusetts Democrat said he was thinking, among other recent disasters, of his $500 dental bill for treatment of an abscessed tooth. &#8216;Because it was done in the dentist&#8217;s office, rather than the hospital, they didn&#8217;t cover it. So they were urging me to go spend twice as much in a hospital,&#8217; said Kerry, who is covered by BACE, the Beneficial Association of Capitol Employees.&#8221; (Ana Puga, &#8220;Lawmakers Talk Health Care,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 12/19/93)\n \n Now, On Campaign Trail, Kerry Is Enthusiastic About Health Care He Receives As Senator. &#8220;As a U.S. Senator, I could get the best health care in the world. Most people aren&#8217;t so lucky, and we need to change that. That&#8217;s why my plan gives every American access to the same kind of health care that members of Congress give themselves. &#8230; Because your family&#8217;s health care is just as important as any politicians&#8217; in Washington.&#8221; (Sen.

John Kerry, Congressional Record, 3/10/94, p. S2772)\n \n But Now Kerry Says He Supports Carrying Of Stock Options As Corporate Expense. &#8220;On an issue related to corporate scandals, Kerry for the first time endorsed the carrying of stock options as a corporate expense. The use of stock options was abused by some companies and contributed to overly optimistic balance sheets. Kerry applauded steps by Microsoft Corp. to eliminate stock options for employees and said all publicly traded companies should be required to expense such options.&#8221; (Dan Balz, &#8220;Kerry Raps Bush Policy On Postwar Iraq,&#8221; The Washington Post, 7/11/03)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Medical Marijuana\n \n Kerry Said His &#8220;Personal Disposition Is Open To The Issue Of Medical Marijuana.&#8221; &#8220;Aaron Houston of the Granite Staters for Medical Marijuana said that just a month ago Mr. Kerry seemed to endorse medical marijuana use, and when asked about the content of his mysterious study, said, &#8216;I am trying to find out. I don&#8217;t know.&#8217; Mr. Kerry did say his &#8216;personal disposition is open to the issue of medical marijuana&#8217; and that he&#8217;d stop Drug Enforcement Administration raids on patients using the stuff under California&#8217;s medical marijuana law.&#8221; (Jennifer Harper, &#8220;Inside Politics,&#8221; The Washington Times, 8/8/03)\n \n But Now Kerry Says He Wants To Wait For Study Analyzing Issue Before Making Final Decision. &#8220;The Massachusetts Democrat said Wednesday he&#8217;d put off any final decision on medical marijuana because there&#8217;s &#8216;a study under way analyzing what the science is.&#8217;&#8221; (Jennifer Harper, &#8220;Inside Politics,&#8221; The Washington Times, 8/8/03)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Burma Sanctions\n \n In 1995, Kerry Was Against Burma Sanctions. &#8220;&#8216;I question whether isolation is a successful means of promoting political change,&#8217; Kerry told a constituent in a 1995 letter justifying his opposition to a Burma sanction bill.&#8221; (Geeta Anand, et al., &#8220;Menino Gets Ahead Of Himself, Starts Contemplating Third Term,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 5/18/97)\n \n But Now Kerry Supports Burma Sanctions. &#8220;In his 1996 reelection campaign, Kerry, after Governor William F.

John Kerry, Congressional Record, 10/08/92, p. S17709)\n \n But Now Kerry Constantly &#8220;Challenges The Stature Of His Democratic Opponents&#8221; Over Their Lack Of Military Service. &#8220;And more than ever, Mr. Kerry is invoking his stature as a Vietnam veteran as he challenges the stature of his Democratic opponents -- none of whom, he frequently points out, have &#8216;worn the uniform of our country&#8217; -- to withstand a debate with Mr. Bush on national security.&#8221; (Adam Nagourney, &#8220;As Campaign Tightens, Kerry Sharpens Message,&#8221; The New York Times, 8/10/03)\n \n Flip-Flopped On PACs\n \n Kerry Used To Decry &#8220;Special Interests And Their PAC Money.&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m frequently told by cynics in Washington that refusing PAC money is naive,&#8217; Kerry told his supporters in 1985. &#8216;Do you agree that it is &#8220;na\u00efve&#8221; to turn down special interests and their PAC money?&#8217;&#8221; (Glen Johnson, &#8220;In A Switch, Kerry Is Launching A PAC,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 12/15/01)\n \n But Now, Kerry Has Established His Own PAC. &#8220;A week after repeating that he has refused to accept donations from political action committees, Senator John F. Kerry announced yesterday that he was forming a committee that would accept PAC money for him to distribute to other Democratic candidates. &#8230; Kerry&#8217;s stance on soft money, unregulated donations funneled through political parties, puts him in the position of raising the type of money that he, McCain, and others in the campaign-finance reform movement are trying to eliminate.&#8221; (Glen Johnson, &#8220;In A Switch, Kerry Is Launching A PAC,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 12/15/01)\n \n Flip-Flopped On $10,000 Donation Limit To His PAC\n \n When Kerry Established His PAC In 2001, He Instituted A $10,000 Limit On Donations. &#8220;A week after repeating that he has refused to accept donations from political action committees, Senator John F.

Kerry, who broke with personal precedent last year when he established his first political action committee, has changed his fund-raising guidelines again, dropping a $10,000 limit on contributions from individuals, a cap he had touted when establishing the PAC. The Massachusetts Democrat said yesterday he decided to accept unlimited contributions, which has already allowed him to take in &#8216;soft money&#8217; donations as large as $25,000, because of the unprecedented fund-raising demands confronting him as a leader in the Senate Democratic caucus.&#8221; (Glen Johnson, &#8220;Kerry Shifts Fund-Raising Credo For His Own PAC,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 10/4/02)\n \n Flip-Flopped On Using Personal Funds In 1996 Race\n \n In 1996, Kerry And Weld Established $500,000 Limit Of Personal Wealth To Be Used In Senate Campaign. &#8220;In 1996, Kerry and Weld gave their already noteworthy Senate race added significance by establishing a spending cap. The candidates agreed to spend no more than $6.9 million from July 1 through the election. Weld ended up spending $6.6 million and Kerry $6.3 million. One key element of the agreement limited the candidates to spending $500,000 in personal wealth, a clause Weld favored because Kerry is married to a millionaire, Teresa Heinz.&#8221; (Glen Johnson, &#8220;In Kerry&#8217;s Plan For A Pac, The Resolution Of Opposites,&#8221; The Boston Globe, 12/18/01)\n \n Kerry Broke Agreement By Spending $1.2 Million Over Limit. &#8220;[P]ost-election reports showed a last-minute infusion of $1.7 million from Kerry&#8217;s wife, heiress Teresa Heinz. &#8230; [K]erry denied that his campaign violated its agreement.

The same is true of accidental launch. If it were to happen, no leader could ever explain not having chosen to defend against the disaster when doing so made sense.&#8221; (Peace Action Website, &#8220;Where Do The Candidates Stand On Foreign Policy?&#8221; http://www.peace-action.org/2004/Kerry.html, Accessed 3/10/04)\n \n Now Kerry Campaign Says He Will Defund Missile Defense. FOX NEWS&#8217; MAJOR GARRETT: &#8220;Kerry would not say how much all of this would cost. A top military adviser said the Massachusetts Senator would pay for some of it by stopping all funds to deploy a national ballistic missile defense system, one that Kerry doesn&#8217;t believe will work.&#8221; KERRY ADVISOR RAND BEERS: &#8220;He would not go forward at this time because there is not a proof of concept.&#8221; (Fox News&#8217; &#8220;Special Report,&#8221; 3/17/03)\n \n Flip-Flopped On 1991 Iraq War Coalition\n \n At The Time, Kerry Questioned Strength Of 1991 Coalition. &#8220;I keep hearing from people, &#8216;Well, the coalition is fragile, it won&#8217;t stay together,&#8217; and my response to that is, if the coalition is so fragile, then what are the vital interests and what is it that compels us to risk our young American&#8217;s lives if the others aren&#8217;t willing to stay the &#8230; course of peace? &#8230; I voted against the president, I&#8217;m convinced we&#8217;re doing this the wrong way &#8230;&#8221; (CBS&#8217; &#8220;This Morning,&#8221; 1/16/91)\n \n Now Kerry Has Nothing But Praise For 1991 Coalition.

It&#8217;s a serious challenge, and it is a war of sorts, but it is not the kind of war they&#8217;re trying to market to America.&#8217; Kerry characterized the war on terror as predominantly an intelligence-gathering and law enforcement operation. &#8216;It&#8217;s basically a manhunt,&#8217; he said. &#8216;You gotta know who they are, where they are, what they&#8217;re planning, and you gotta be able to go get &#8216;em before they get us.&#8217;&#8221; (Katherine M.

The bill would provide $10.3 billion as a grant to rebuild Iraq, including $5.1 billion for security and $5.2 billion for reconstruction costs. It also would provide $10 billion as a loan that would be converted to a grant if 90 percent of all bilateral debt incurred by the former Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein has been forgiven by other countries.

   "AP) -- President Bush's decision Tuesday to allow his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, to testify publicly before the commission investigating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks reversed earlier White House insistence that she would only appear privately.\n \n Some previous Bush reversals in the face of criticism:\n \n \n He argued a federal Department of Homeland Security wasn't needed, then devised a plan to create one. \n \n \n He resisted a commission to investigate Iraq intelligence failures, but then relented. \n \n \n He also initially opposed the creation of the independent commission to examine if the 2001 attacks could have been prevented, before getting behind the idea under pressure from victims' families. \n \n \n He opposed, and then supported, a two-month extension of the commission's work, after the panel said protracted disputes over access to White House documents left too little time. \n \n \n He at first said any access to the president by the commission would be limited to just one hour but relaxed the limit earlier this month.",

   "George Bush is standing by his Iraqi invasion like a rock. He isn't moving his position on whether the war was right or wrong regardless of what the press tries to make him do. Basically he knows what he did was right and no one can convince him otherwise. This can either be a good or bad thing. In my opinion, it is a refreshing thing to see a politician do at the very least.\n \n On the other side of the coin you have Kerry. He will change sides at the drop of public opinion. Ideally this is what a democracy is supposed to be about. Leaders are supposed to share the same views as the people. However it is plain to see that Kerry cannot have two opinions about one topic and put them both into action in the White House. It doesn't make sense what he is doing and people are beginning to see right through him because of how he is acting.\n \n No one really knows what Kerry stands for right now while with Bush everyone knows what he stands for and we know that he won't change his mind. In this scenario neither are perfect but I'll go with Bush.\n\n \n emoticon_xagree AMD, I'm constantly impressed by how effectively and how intelligently you point things out. You hit the nail right on the head in your post.\n \n \nI'm sorry GHOST I don't but that line of BS Bush wanted war before he got into office this war is about finshing what his dad did not finish when he was in office if you ran the word peace by him he would not know what it is. I's sorry but this dam war is going to put us in bankruptcy before it is all said and done. In the end it is all about oil.\n\n \n What basis do you have for any of this? Do you have any proof? I don't think you do, you know why? Because you're wrong. If you know what Woodward (a liberal and rather against the Iraq business) wrote, you'd see that. I know you hate Bush.

Bush has done nothing for the elderly like he said he would a lot of these folk's are on a fixed cash flow and they have a hard time to make ends meet. And these people have worked hard all there life. I think it is time that the president start working on some important issues here. Instead of playing war. How about trying to come up with a peace plan. Health care for those that are in need. prescription coverage instead of siding with the big drug company's. Help small businesses out instead of big fat corporations. And that is for starters. And as for Clinton he did not get impeached.

We have been warned and put on notice about the weapons by not only the CIA but also foreign intelligence services long before Bush was elected. The Iraqi liberation act was unanimously passed by the Senate and signed by Clinton in 1998. This would have been the appropriate time to protest but no protest was forthcoming.

   "By openly lied you mean that Bush actually knew that no weapons existed but stated that they did anyway to justify invasion. So the David Kay report which revealed a concealment program, labratories hidden in mosques and the attempted purchase of long range missiles from North Korea as well as the fact that chemical weapons to be used in a foiled attack against Jordan were aquired by Al-queda from Syria (most likely hidden there by Saddam prior to the invasion) doesn't impress upon you that Bush may have been right all along? We have been warned and put on notice about the weapons by not only the CIA but also foreign intelligence services long before Bush was elected. The Iraqi liberation act was unanimously passed by the Senate and signed by Clinton in 1998. This would have been the appropriate time to protest but no protest was forthcoming. And incidentally even if the case could be made that no weapons existed, would it not be more logical to suggest that Bush was the one lied to or misled? Once again it seems as though some voters and polilical operatives will say anything they think will give them the upper hand in an election year.\n\n Bingo Bingo bush knew right along there was no WMDs he wanted war as soon as he took office he wanted to finsh what his dad did not do when he was in office. I don't beileve Bush for one min on any thing nor do I trust the man. Bush & Kerry they all mislead you. More Bush then Kerry and if you beileve the CIA etc etc. Wow if I were you I would rethink that one.",

I did not say that Bush knew there were no WMD. I was paraphrasing a previous quote from a post by another member in an attempt to disprove an accusation. I also find it interesting that you interpreted my post as having suggested that I believe the CIA. What I did was present evidence of a weapons program as detailed in the Kay report which suggests Bush's actions were correct as well as pointing out that we were told of the weapons before Bush was elected. I also pointed out that if there are no weapons then it was Bush who was lied to not Bush who was doing the lying. You've got to read my posts a little more carefully.",

Yep this war could ahve been prevented It has me all fired up I personally know 45 over there in Iraq so I'm on edge I think this whole thing could handled better. I also think we should have put more troops in Afghanistan and finsh that job first before going to Iraq further you can say all you want about the UN but. The thing of it is we should have there approval before starting a war and also get a lot more of the world to go along with it too. I supported Bush until he pulled of the WMDs ****. The UN weent there did there job and did not find any WNDs you cant get someone to crapout something that is not there.",

We went to the UN several times, we got who was willing to go. Many countries didn't want to because this would have been bad for their business. I think we played this pretty well diplomatically. Unfortunately, diplomacy can't solve all problems once those problems are developed enough.\n \n The UN inspectors didn't do their job effectively for no reason other than the fact that they didn't have cooperation. Kay said that they knew of a ton of trucks going across the border between Iraq and Syria. They were most likely carrying the WMDs out. Whether or not there were WMDs, people have to realize that intelligence is an imperfect science. You get things wrong sometimes despite how hard you try or how accurate information appears to be. Based on what Bush and the intelligence community believed at the time, they made the right decision. I personally believe that there were WMDs, and they either went out through Syria or they're buried somewhere in the Iraqi deserts.

The UN is nothing more than an impotent group of showoffs and appeasers, claiming to have the interest of the world in high regard. The US never went \"against\" the UN.\n \n The UN had issued several sanctions against Iraq and had not ruled out military force in the process of assuring compliance. The UN was just too willing to write another sanction rather than enforcing the ones already instated.\n \n Bush had the balls to do what he said he would, and several countries agreed with him.\n \n Quite frankly, I wish the UN would move to France...let the French support them the way we do now. I doubt many people are aware just how much of the cost of the UN is paid by the United States.",
