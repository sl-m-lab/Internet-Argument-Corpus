Even Kamikazes; I don't if that qualifies as heroic. Maybe THAT is crazy.\n\n \n This will make you yawn if you're not interested in this type of story...\n \n The reason I'm interested in the Zulu War so much is a particular battle - Rorke's Drift (which they made the film \"Zulu\" about). Shortly before the battle the Zulus wiped out over 1,500 Brits at another battle; Isandlwana (also the subject of a film - \"Zulu Dawn\") - the Zulus didn't take prisoners.\n \n 4,000 Zulus then marched on to the tiny missionary station (which was being used as a military hospital) at Rorke's Drift. For about two days, the 100 or so military patients and other soldiers fought the Zulus off. The patients were given guns and told to fire from their beds through windows and firing holes cut into external walls. Later they had to cut holes in the walls to move from room to room as the Zulus broke into the hospital and set it alight - men dragged themselves along the floor to get away.\n \n By one of the quirks of history, an engineer, Lieutenant Chard had been detached from the force at Isandlwana to go back to Rorkes Drift to build a bridge over the river. Had he been at Isandlwana he would have been slaughtered. As it was, when he arrived at Rorkes Drift, he became the senior officer when the hospital was attacked. He organised walls of bags of horsefeed with firing steps that linked the buildings together; an engineer's mind at work.\n \n When the walls were breached they fell back to a small fort made out of biscuit boxes\n \"Chard decided that the Zulu pressure was too great, and ordered a withdrawal to a barricade of biscuit boxes which had been hastily erected across the yard, from the corner of the store-house to the front mealie-bag wall. In this small compound the garrison would fight for their lives throughout most of the coming night.\"\n \n They were in a space so small, that they were almost back to back with the men behind them.\n \n The Brits award the Victoria Cross as their highest award (equal to your Medal of Honor). More were awarded at this engagement then at any other - 11 being awarded. The Brits lost 25 dead and killed about 300 Zulus.",

   "I also have an interest in wars especially in how their outcome effects the entire world. I wasn't even aware of what my favorite battle was until I had watched the movie The Last Samarai. It was mentioned during the film that at the battle of Thermopylae only a few hundred Greek soldiers stationed themselves at the mountain pass of Thermopylae to try and hold of the marching Persian army which numbered tens of thousands. If they were to fail in this mission the main army of the Greeks would not be able to escape and Sparta would take a major blow in the war. The unit held the pass for two days and killed as many as 20,000 Persians before every one of the 300 Spartan were killed in their valiant effort. The Persian army actually won the battle of Thermopylae in this way and shortly there after arrived in Athens and burned it to the ground, but the city was deserted by this time because of the delay the Persian army faced at the pass. The war went on for the next 20 years in favor of the Spartans which is very important to all modern Western society considering the Greeks were at this time the first and only democratic nation in the world and they were making many other leaps in the fields of science, philosophy, and literarature. This time was called the Greek Miracle for all the important occurrances that happened between the fourth and fifth centuries BC. If not for those 300 men who fought impossible odds and gave their lives at Thermopylae none of this may have been possible.",

I don't care what he did to the citizens of Iraq. There are far worse situations in the world. We went in there on the premise of WMDs, flimsy at best to invade a sovereign country, and now the administration is struggling for public support using humanitarian rationalization refocus while continuing to randomly kill civilians in the name of democracy.
