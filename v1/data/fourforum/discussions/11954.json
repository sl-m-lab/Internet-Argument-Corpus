   "L. Brent Bozell III. Of course. \n \nFor weeks the dying Conservatives attacked Obama as being a Socialist when it came to his economic philosophy, but once it became apparent that he was going to win, suddenly he became a Reaganite.\n \n There is a reason why Brent Bozell made it onto my \"Irrelevant\" list. With Obama we have a chance for some much needed change, with Bozell it's more of the same. The man talks out both sides of his neck constantly.\n Check this ... out.\n \n On America's Newsroom, Media Research Center president L. Brent Bozell III claimed that President-elect Barack Obama \"ran as a Reaganite\" and \"won over ... the public as a fiscal conservative.\" But less than two weeks earlier, Bozell accused Obama of espousing \"socialism\" throughout the \"entirety of the campaign.\"\n \n Wow, in just two weeks:\n \n BOZELL: But when you go through the entirety of the campaign saying the kind of things that you're saying in the debates, where on, for every question, you've got a redistribution of wealth answer, where you've got socialism, where you've got the government controlling every aspect of life. You don't expect a reporter to ask you, \"Is this socialism?\" Because the media don't ask that question. Well, some uppity reporter did -- and look what happened, they cancelled her. And, by the way, she won't be going to the ball, either....\n \n BOZELL: Well, number one is that the public is conservative; number two, Barack Obama won as a conservative. That means that Barack Obama does not have the mandate to enact the left-wing agenda he wants to enact. He didn't run on it, he ran from it. So, this is not necessarily bad news for conservatives.\n\n Right Wing Pundits | Crooks and Liars\n \n Golly gosh. Does that mean that Obama is a conservative socialist?",

   "Censorship of the airways, or The Fairness Doctrine as the deceptive liberals like to call it, is nothing more than a tactic that the liberals must employ to combat the effectiveness of talk radio in dispelling the liberal lies that propogate from the liberal MSM in both print and television broadcast \"journalism\".

It is a despicable abuse of power and amounts to nothing more than muzzling their opposition for political gain...political censorship.\n \n To argue that the liberals do not have equal opportunities to broadcast their messages on radio is ridiculous. Liberals are free to produce and broadcast liberal talk radio shows just as conservatives are free to produce and broadcast conservative talk radio shows. Their only problem for liberals is that liberalism sucks and nobody really wants to listen to mentally disoriented numbnuts spouting liberal principles. That numbnut Al Franken and his Air America show had to pay stations to broadcast his drivel because no respectable sponsors wanted to be associated with failure.\n \n So the liberals, because they haven't the talent to garner a substantial audience, want to force fairness into the system by taking away our right to express our opinions in public without giving equal time to present gibberish from their side....and giving is exactly what they want done...their message, presented at someone else's expense.\n \n And of course, they'll have to hire more government employees (to be paid with our tax dollars) to monitor the airways and report on opportunities to force equal time broadcast of rebuttal.

   "Hardly so. Liberals have equal opportunity to broadcast their messages. There is nothing stopping liberals from producing a liberal talk show...except the lack of intelligent content for the show.\n\n \n I'm not so sure about that. The very fact that personalities like Limbaugh, Hannity, and many others essentially command the Arbitron ratings would make it nearly impossible for any personality with opposing views to get any airtime. Take, for example, WJR in Detroit. It is one of the most powerful radio stations in the Midwest. Here's what their schedule looks like, and here are the leanings of the shows' hosts:\n \n -Dr. Laura Schlessinger (conservative)\n -Gary McNamara (conservative)\n -Paul W. Smith (conservative)\n -Frank Beckmann (conservative, but I think his show isn't extensively political)\n -Paul Harvey (conservative)\n -Rush Limbaugh (conservative)\n -Sean Hannity (conservative)\n -Mitch Albom (moderate, leans liberal)\n -Mark Levin (conservative)\n \n So, on an average day, you have 20.5 hours of conservative commentators, 2 hours of moderate/liberal commentator (just one person), and the remainder is news/sports. Where, exactly, is the equal opportunity? Maybe on another station. But I can't think of a station in the region with nearly the same signal strength. Why should opposing views be relegated to other, less powerful outlets? What a lot of people continue to ignore is that is the reason Fairness Doctrine originally existed. The inherent limitations of the spectrum meant that stations should present opposing views on controversial topics. Another thing that is being misrepresented, even after I pointed it out on another thread, is that Fairness Doctrine never called for equal time for opposing views, merely that important issues should be presented in an honest and equitable manner.\n \nStrawman argument. Equality exists already. Equal opportunities exist for liberal broadcasters. All viewpoints are allowed on the radio. The same is true for the existing television and newsprint media. The liberals have control over most of those outlets. Talk radio is a different animal and can't be controlled as easily as the press and television. Therein lies the rub for the liberals. The only way to lessen the effectiveness of conservative talk radio is to silence it with fairness (censorship).\n\n \n Equal opportunity only exists as far licensees and networks allow, which is, by extension, as far as the ratings dictate. It seems to me like a bit of a catch-22. You likely won't get picked up if you don't have the ratings, but you won't get ratings if not many people can hear you in the first place. \n \n \nThe next step will be to require publishers to provide equal printing of opposing views every time a conservative article or book is published. This kind of tactic is to be expected of liberals...more government control of our lives. As long as the ruling few can control the masses, they can stay in power...and benefit from the perks and immunities associated with being a big, bad government official.\n\n Nonsense. The very fact that there exists an independent regulatory agency (the FCC), whose purpose is to regulate broadcasting distinguishes broadcast media from other media. The government is allowed certain control over the airwaves because the spectrum is limited, and oversight is needed so that the people, who the airwaves actually belong to, can be adequately served. There are no such limits to publishing because paper is cheap and abundant. Such a hypothetical is especially absurd now that just about everyone and their mother has a blog. Furthermore, I know of no liberal or liberal group that does anything close to advocating such a thing. In the 38 years that Fairness Doctrine was actually FCC policy, can you name any examples where the expression of an opinion was actually prevented? I've heard a lot of talk that it's \"censorship\" but I have yet to hear any examples.\n \n \nPersonally, I think liberals are reluctant to debate the conservative talk show hosts. I have heard many a story about how certain liberals have been invited to come on various shows to debate issues, only to refuse for some dubious reason...like scheduling conflicts. Few accept the invitations...likely because they realize that their arguments do not hold water very long...or that they will actually have to answer some tough questions...and will be requested to adhere to logic and truth in their arguments.\n \n It is plainly a case of ineptness fighting back with claims of unfairness in the arena.\n\n \n And I've heard many a story about how conservative hosts carefully screen callers to find those that agree with them, or those that would make the host look better by arguing poorly against them. Are liberals afraid to go on such shows? Or, do they recognize that the very nature of the program makes it incredibly difficult for rational discourse to occur? One account seems to support the latter. This isn't necessarily representative of the whole, but I think it is a fair assessment.\n \n Let me be clear. As I've said before, I'm not advocating for reinstating the Fairness Doctrine (at least not by Congressional mandate), I just have seen far too much misrepresentation of what it was, historically. It seems like there is a lot of false outrage because a few Democrats have expressed interest, even though support of such is not necessarily widespread across the party. For example, the President-Elect does not support it. So, I think that claims of \"liberals trying to suppress conservatives\" are overblown, not only because the Fairness Doctrine has been misrepresented, but it is not as widely supported as some claim.\n \n I do, however, think that we would be well served to have stricter ownership caps and better enforcement of the public interest standard. As stated in The Public and Broadcasting:\n \nIn exchange for obtaining a valuable license to operate a broadcast station using the public airwaves, each radio and television licensee is required by law to operate its station in the \"public interest, convenience and necessity.\" This means that it must air programming that is responsive to the needs and problems of its local community of license.\n\n Frankly, with all of the technology at our disposal, I think the Fairness Doctrine is largely obsolete and unnecessary. It might be nice if licensees would at least operate in the spirit of allowing opposing views on controversial issues, but I think that terrestrial radio is a dying breed anyway. I think fivethirtyeight.com had an interesting analysis on the subject. What it stems from should maybe be saved for another thread, but I agree with his closing sentiment, that \"conservatives now need to find a way to communicate with people who are actually paying attention.\"",
