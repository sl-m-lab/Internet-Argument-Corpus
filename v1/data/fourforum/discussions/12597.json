   "Teachers are in a position of trust, like doctors or psychologists or attorneys. We therefore see their role in relationships with students and/or parents similarly. However, teachers are not held accountable to the same ethical parameters as any of those professions.

   "Discuss the ethical parameters of teaching.\n\n I think teachers should be held to a high ethical standard. Of course, I think all people should be held to a high ethical standard, so I don't think that teachers should be held to a higher standard. (More on this later.) The problem, of course, is the answer to the question: \"Whose ethics?\"\n \n \nPersonally, I am beginning to think that licensed teachers should have coursework in ethics.\n\n At the very least, I agree that teachers should be required to have some sort of coursework or seminar or something similar for professional ethics. A standard semester-long course on ethics goes a long way beyond what I think you really want to drive home. However, I'm all for making philosophy department courses like ethics, logic, and introductory philosophy required core classes in college.\n \n \nWhat are considerations for the ethical practice of teaching, and what understanding of the profession, ethically, should teachers have before they are licensed by the State?\n\n Modules of teacher training discuss professional ethics and procedural legalities. Thus, asses are covered. (Remember, I bemoan the amount of window-dressing that occurs within the system.) How well some teachers remember these topics and how strictly some adhere are a completely separate question.\n \n \nI am thinking more about greyer areas -- their being privy to confidential information about families, their position of power in relationship to that information and the lives of children whom parents love, and sometimes the lives of the parents themselves, and their freedom in our U.S. system to abuse that power.\n\n Remember that the key phrase is \"legal liability.\" If there is none, then a state-run institution won't mandate activity or non-activity. If a parent tells me something interesting but not highly sensitive about little Susie, most often I'm not legally obligated to keep it a secret. The right to privacy has mostly to do with records. When Mommy says that Little Susie is upset with her grandmother, this is not legally protected information. Of course, I can't imagine broadcasting this fact to other students, and I don't know why teachers who don't have Little Susie in class should care; why would I spread it around? But if the mother will spread it around, why should I be legally forbidden to do so? Helping is part of my job, but schools have counselors, too. If I'm supposed to be a counselor and a teacher, then I should be paid as both.\n \n \n... but that this is distinct from abuse of power, or colluding in the abuse of power, and, that such abuse should not be permitted to parade as either (a) or (b).\n\n I'm not disagreeing, but how do you define \"abuse of power\"? Remember, if you're going to have an ethics code, it has to be legally enforceable.\n \n \nApart from the basics mentioned, what are some of the obvious and less obvious ways -- both legitimately and illegitimately?\n\n Here's one of my many pet peeves: Coaches are notorious for influencing classroom teachers when star athletes are involved. When my state's code of ethics was recently updated, I had hoped that this would be addressed. Well, it was addressed; coaches who approach a teacher to \"discuss\" \"changing\" a grade are not violating the code of ethics, because they're \"only discussing.\" This is like a slap in the face to me. It's one thing for a coach to ask what's going on, or to see if there are steps that could be taken, but to \"discuss changing\" the grade? No. Somebody needs to be shot.\n \n For the record, people ###### off at a few isolated events in my state made a push to change the old ethics code. The original version of the update was so appalling, such a violation of teachers' personal privacy, that there was outrage. The mere thought that being a teacher should make us an all-day slave to someone else's ethics is unacceptable. Most of the idiocy was removed, but much was not: Every teacher pays a fee for investigations into misconduct whether that teacher has been accused or not; in fact, the fees apply even if there are no allegations of misconduct. If a hearing is convened, we have a limited amount of time to address the entirety of every complaint. (e.g., If I'm accused of six violations, I have 25 minutes to address all six sufficiently enough to prove my innocence.) This takes place under the supervision of a chairperson with ultimate authority who has no connection to government judicial rules.\n \n As a male who teaches tough classes to some spoiled kids, I live damn near in fear of being accused of misconduct because some student or parent is really upset at a grade. I push (not physically) my kids to encourage them to do well, and I respond to smartass comments in kind lickety-split to shut them up when necessary. Everything I do has a positive intent, even if playing nicey-nice isn't part of the equation. Sadly, it's good for the kids but dangerous for me. To know that my teaching career is probably over as soon as Little Susie's mother gets upset because \"perfect\" Susie has a B in my class is disconcerting, to say the least.",

To know that my teaching career is probably over as soon as Little Susie's mother gets upset because \"perfect\" Susie has a B in my class is disconcerting, to say the least.\n\n \n I spoke once to a high school teacher who moved because he was fed up with the grading pressure from parents determined that anytime he gave a B, he had just ruined Johnny's chance to go to Harvard. He found himself happier teaching in a area where parents were less competitve and had lower expectations.\n \n Part of the problem are social values taught by teachers themselves. Let's pull out of the violins for the fairy tales told by the teachers, whereby in reality, they are trained to track each and every one into their designated life position or spot. (Though they often see themselves as only the teller of the inspiring tale set to music.)\n \n On sports, which you also mentioned, I would favor a full overhaul and dethroning of sports in our schools. Plus we are locked into a very narrow mental framework as to what qualifies as a legitimate sport. I think it is also a way the boys get hit with sexism in our educational system, vs. what gets done to the girls. And I do not think people should be stopped from getting their high school diploma because they still need 3 credits (or whatever it is nowadays) of volleyball. Nor do I think sports deserves the kind of funding it gets, when Johnny still can't read or still doesn't understand the theory of evolution or (many of other things).\n \n So I think what we value educationally (as in sports) also reflects a failure of ethics in our schools.",

My point was that everyone telling you you're wrong should make you examine what you're saying, not allege that everyone else is conspiring against you. Certainly there are times when the rest of the world is wrong and the individual is right, but they are few and far between and if you want to be that individual, you have to provide evidence or at least make clear the principles on which you base your ideas.

   "If you have something specific to say about something I specifically said, cut and paste it...\n\n You got it.\n \n \nTeachers are supposed to be fair and unbiased, but most of them are exactly the opposite.\n\n Unsupported assertion.\n \n \nFor all our national hoopla over testing, most teachers lack sufficient training or understanding of assessment or testing.\n\n Unsupported assertion.\n \n \nIt's unethical that teachers aren't better trained in assessment.\n\n But you don't even know how well or not well teachers are trained in assessment. States require training in assessment for a teaching certificate. Individual districts are often in charge of their own additional training, which might include information about assessment, including creating assessments and interpreting assessments. Ultimately, you know jack squat about what teachers know or don't know about assessment.\n \n \nIt's also unethical the extent to which they cover for one another. Even when they no longer have to, politically speaking.\n\n A couple weeks ago, I had a colleague cover one of my class periods so that I could observe another teacher. How dare I?!\n Oh, that's not what you meant, eh? Well, the above is the extent to which I need to be \"covered.\" I take on the peons who are ignorant about the education process (despite their unsupported claims otherwise) and school them. The problem, of course, is the same one as in the classroom: I can't teach you if you don't want to learn.\n \n \nThey support and condone each other's abuse of students and parents. They support and condone each other's inananities. It has nothing to do with education for them, let alone thinking, but politics.\n\n This is offensive. I don't abuse anyone via my job, not even online personalities so full of themselves that they deserve a good butt-kicking.\n \n \nThey no longer interact with the world, as others do. They hide in their teaching.\n\n Yeah, it's a shame you can't find any teachers, say, participating on internet forums with everyday people (and the occasional nutjob).\n \n \nThey are gang leaders and gang members, bigots and frauds.\n\n But you get pi**y when we call you unfamiliar with education? You might actually be insane.\n \n \nWell, (1) you have no knowledge of the individual you're referencing (myself, that is, and my background),\n\n And you know next to nothing about my teaching, my treatment of students and parents, my assessment, my training in assessment, and my understanding of assessment, but you -- like some sort of self-righteous yet blind-to-the-world schmuck -- have decided to rip into me. You're a hypocrite.\n \n \nIsn't life hard when we're stuck with the substance of what someone says, instead of argument by authority?\n\n We've been through this. You keep pulling out the \"argument by authority\" line whenever you don't like what we have to say. But the statements we are making about the system are based on our experience with the system. That makes each of us a legitimate authority, hence our conclusions are not fallacious.\n What is doubly hypocritical is that your training in assessment, which apparently amounts to zilch, makes you think that you're in a legitimate position to draw conclusions about it.\n \n \nYour rude, intellectually dishonest, and invasive speculations insofar as my experience is concerned, is not relevant to the substance of the arguments here.\n\n More asinine hypocrisy. If you want to talk about what teachers do, then experience is relevant.\n \n \nSo you can stop playing your little argument by authority game...\n\n And you can stop playing your little accusation of argument by authority game game, but you won't.\n \n \nI said many teachers were not adequately trained in assessment, and I daresay most reputable United States educators would agree with me, dear.\n\n Now there's a misleading statement. I have no doubt that \"many\" teachers' understanding of assessment is probably subpar. In fact, I can think of a handful immediately. There might even be five in my school. But to say this as if its a pervasive problem that condemns the entire system is asinine. I'm sure that there are \"many\" people in the country with a third nipple, but that doesn't mean that we should act as if all or even the majority or even still a large percentage of people have third nipples.\n \n \nYou have not provided any evidence for your counter assertion on American educators as being well educated in assessment, as demonstrated in classroom.\n\n But you didn't provide any evidence for your position, either. You also didn't provide reason for your outraged bluster against the entire system based on your concocted notion.\n \n \nBtw, by way of assessment, your response in these posts indicates that you need to brush up on your reading comprehension skills.\n\n No, you need to brush up on your logic skills and writing skills. My god, if it takes you eight posts to ask one question in an understandable way, is it really the readers' fault?\n \n \nYou continue to play intellectually dishonest games, including your fallacious and bogus argument by authority trick,\n\n Lie.\n \n \nAs I already mentioned, plenty of reputable U.S. teachers agree with what I'm saying. They're not offended.\n\n I'm not personally offended by the strict meaning of your statement. It's likely true, based on my experience. But you're treating the statement as if it says something else, then running with that to your ultimate conclusion, which is offensive.\n \n \nOh really? If a teacher can't pass a high school geometry regents exam, do you think that would reflect on their ability to teach geometry? If a teacher can't answer a multiple choice question on what states are next to California, do you think that reflects on their ability to teach, for starters, social studies?\n\n Ah, I love it. In the thread about overhauling the education system, antonia was going nuts about pedagogy. Now she's going nuts about content knowledge.\n Now, I'm confidence that antonia and I both agree that teachers need both. Believe me, nothing ###### me off more than somebody trying to teach material that he or she doesn't understand, because that handicaps the learners. Now, I can honestly say that my scores on the content knowledge qualification tests that are used in my state (which are used in most states in the U.S.) were superb. Of course, this is also true for my scores on the pedagogy tests, but I suppose that antonia won't believe that, mainly because she doesn't want to. That said, my administrators and I know what my scores are, and even though I meet antonia's qualificatory standards via assessment of teachers, she's decided that I'm an abusive gang member who can't properly teach my kids.\n Wait, that reminds me:Isn't life hard when we're stuck with the substance of what someone says, instead of argument by authority?\nIsn't life hard when you have your beliefs and demand to stick to them regardless of the slew of evidence against them? Isn't it hard to posit a way to judge teachers so that you can call them incompetent and then -- after the teachers meet your criteria -- continue to call them incompetent? For antonia, it's easy as can be!\n \n \nYes, and you go back, class after class after class ...\n\n What the hell kind of response is this?\n \n \nI'm rude?! You make huge generalisations and accusations against teachers, you never back up anything you say with evidence of any kind, you imply that teachers act against the interests of parents and students and you're surprised when teachers find that insulting?\n\n Hear, hear.\n Now watch as antonia says that I'm supporting Jo instead of formulating my own statement, which would simply say the same thing.\n \n \nI've yet to see any system of testing that accurately reflects on teacher performance.\n\n This is a hot-button topic in the U.S.: Merit based pay. It's one of those ideas that sounds great on paper. Merit based pay will make teachers work harder, be more proactive, feel ownership of their work, etc. And I agree that pay based on actual merit would probably be a good thing. The problem is that designing a way to actually measure merit is extremely complicated, probably too complicated to make it reasonable.\n \n \nMy argument is not an argument from authority, I am simply pointing out that, at least in my experience, your argument that teachers lack sufficient training or understanding of assessment is demonstrably false.\n\n The sad part is, Jo didn't even have to do this. antonia never supported that argument in the first place.\n \n \nUnless of course you think that 2+ full days training on the topic every year and a significant chunk of initial teacher training is insufficient.\n\n That's all? My school has weekly meetings, most of which at the beginning of the year discussed different ways to assess.\n But, I must not understand any of it, because antonia says so. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nI would like to see you provide some evidence, specific anecdotal evidence at the very least, outline of teacher training even better, to support your case that teachers are insufficiently trained.\n\n Good idea, Jo. I'll be waiting for antonia's response.",

No. Underpaid? Sure. But that's common. And that's neither here nor there in this discussion.\n Non-unionized? Damn right. So you can spare me your hatred of unions. On the other hand, some loonies -- like parents who think they know more about education than trained, professional educators -- tend to increase my desire to join one.\n \n \nAnd please, spare me the appearance of the teacher who's the equivalent of Sarah Palin's steelworker husband.

What the hell have I said that compares me to him? How the hell can you take the statement I made to make it obvious that I interact with non-teachers and pretend that I'm saying that I never interact with unionized teachers? You accused me of being locked in my own little world of academia, and I made it obvious to any dipstick that your statement is wrong. And when the hell have I talked about my parents' backgrounds?\n \n \nI WONDER WHY?\n\n Of course you wonder. You can't understand something explained for an dipstick and you can't remember what I've said and what I haven't. Your statements have no connection to reality and your accusations of fallacy are themselves fallacious. Your assertions are unsupported and your comprehension skills nonexistent. You're probably wondering alllll the time.\n \n \nAnswer the question on gender and assessment in math classes, \"science teacher\". And what it reflects about teachers' understanding of assessment.\n\n For all I know, you made up a statistic. Can you show me the study that supports your assertion?\n \n \nYa'all asked me for an example of what I was talking about -- even \"just personal anecdote\" -- and I gave you one, much earlier, backed up a major peer reviewed study. Which you ignored, again and again. While just dishonestly asserting that I hadn't.\n\n Okay, please link us to the specific post in which you give the hyperlink for this study.\n \n \nAnd if you were teachers well trained in assessment, let alone a teacher in SCIENCE education, you'd know about that study.\n\n I went back and looked for links within your posts.

Linking me to one of your statements, instead. \n \n Don't expect me, however, to agree with any organization 100% of the time.\n \n What's interesting, though, is that I agree with more of the teacher's union positions, in some respects, than your comrade does. For example, teachers' unions today support choice -- such as private school, charters, and home education.\n \n Plus, a teacher's union would NOT support your idea of what you deserve salary-wise, as a private school teacher and non-union member (because I recall you are NOT a union member) -- and because, as a private school teacher, that's between you and your private school. Not you and the taxpayer.\n \n I support teacher's unions because I think teachers deserve decent working conditions and salaries, and because I am aware of what life was like for teachers before they had unions, and because I am aware of how hard some teachers work (obviously not yourself).\n \n However, I would agree with Galactababe, from the conversation where you linked, that this hoopla over salaries is overdone. Unionized teachers, are doing pretty well, all things considered. If we went single-payer, with health care, that would also save the tax-payers money insofar as education employees are concerned. And take a big piece off the bargaining table.\n \n As far as U.K. is concerned, I'm not familiar with their issues, but if you're such a union supporter yourself, you'd be jumping all over JoBennett since the teachers there right now are struggling under horrible working conditions and their position on testing is contrary to his, as a result. He's being basically anti-union in terms of the union there representing the interests of most secondary teachers.\n \n You don't sound like a professional teacher to me, though. One, you're too derogatory. Two, you don't even know about the ERIC database. Three, you can't remember the reference to the study about teachers calling on boys more than girls during math.

Compared to an average job, teaching pays a competitive (or better) salary. The problem here is that teaching is not an average job. Oh, and another problem is that you rarely attract the people you really want to be teachers because they can make more money elsewhere.\n \n \nAs far as U.K. is concerned,\n\n You know, it's not as if I don't care, but I have battles to fight closer to home, even within my own school. Also, contrary to your slanderous lies, I have plenty to do.\n \n \nYou don't sound like a professional teacher to me, though. One, you're too derogatory.\n\n You don't sound like a sane person to me, at times. My responses depend largely upon the attitude displayed by others in the conversation.

I don't use ERIC to look up articles from the Journal of Chemical Education because I have a subscription J Chem Ed itself. Of course, this year I came up with a new procedure for making a stoichiometric determination because I preferred it over the popular methods. When I presented it to an administrator, she said I need to write the textbook companies. So, apparently, there are aspects to teaching that are outside of reading what other people have already done. Imagine that...\n \n \nThree, you can't remember the reference to the study about teachers calling on boys more than girls during math.\n\n No, see, I remember that you referred to it. That's not sufficient. After all, you've repeatedly accused me of not being a teacher even though I've repeatedly referred to being a teacher. You're going nuts because I'm not providing a name and location so that you can find me, but when I expect you to simply link to a study, you apparently can't do it.\n \n \nFour, you never even heard of this study and you claim to be in science education. (It's well known among math and science educators.)\n\n Says you. Of course, it's hard for me to actually find out something about this study when you tell me next to nothing about it.\n \n \nFive, you're unable to comment on the implications of teacher understanding of assessment due to the findings of that kind of study. Meaning that, your understanding of assessment, and ability to work freely with the concepts is not fluent whatsoever.\n\n I think that what's obvious is that it's unreasonable for me to draw conclusions from your knee-jerk description of a study that you refuse to help me find. If it were so damn important, you'd do it.\n Tell you what: If you refuse to allow me to look for myself, you'll answer the questions that I think should be addressed. First, what effect does the fact that math and science teachers are disproportionately male (compared to other subjects) have on females' and males' willingness to participate in class, in terms of comfort, confidence, and intimidation? If there is an effect, has it been factored into the data? Do these data include random selection, volunteerism, or both? If both, how did the two compare? Was the entirety of the data interpreted with the purpose of concluding a single punch-line, or would the findings be more useful if explained in detail?\n Thanks in advance, I'm sure.\n \n \nHome educators usually find a course or tutor/teacher for advanced high school subjects. Some are using online courses, these days, too. Some attend classes part-time in the public school system.\n \n I think your understanding of home education sounds very limited and stereotypical.\n\n Do try to keep up, \"dear\":\n I'll take a homeschool Mom over and college educated acedemic [sic] anytime!!\nNow you come out and say that homeschool Moms usually don't do my job.

You and Galactabunk were getting your asses kicked because you had lousy, pathetic arguments. I do that to everybody around here regardless of sex. Look around. I rip into marc9000, Archangel, and Easyrider. I've argued with friends, men and women, because I disagree with their points. I don't hate women. Sometimes I don't like people, but really the case is that I don't like dumbass positions.\n But, let's suppose for a minute that I really were a misogynist. You'd be in no position to talk. You and GB let loose with several misandrous statements in the \"overhaul\" thread:I thought Electrolyte was an intelligent lady, at first. Then the lowly mud slinging, the irrational statements, the ramblings, the attacks, gave him away for me, too.\nSo, really, we could believe you and think that this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black, or we could actually be realistic and realize that it's a case of the pot calling the porcelain bathtub black.\n \n \nIf you and your comrade are *the* representative of unions, then surely you are, very sadly, bringing this country down.\n\n How can I be expected to have a conversation with somebody who acts as if her skull is as impenetrable as foot-thick steel? I've made it clear enough that an ##### would know that I'm not in a union. Hell, even you've acknowledged this. Thus, I cannot possibly be a representative of a union, nor can I reasonably be called representative of unions. But here you are, basing an argument on a completely concocted whim. Again, come back to reality, antonia. You'll then stand a chance at regaining sanity.\n Two sentences in, and you already look completely incompetent.\n \n \nYou're the one talking about yourself and myself and teachers' unions. It's a very reasonable point to raise.\n\n If it were, then you'd raise the points without MAKING S*** UP. Is that really so damn hard?\n \n \n(If you are even a teacher.) So stop this paranoic rant.\n\n Not a chance in hell. You call me paranoid, but you can't get past your asinine insinuations that I'm not really a teacher and that I'm making all of this up.\n \n \nWell, either way, you aren't a hard working teacher.\n\n How in the HELL do you think you can conclude this? Do you want to know what I did today? Just today? Teaching a normal day, I spent my prep hour consulting with a colleague on a project for his classes and grading papers. I worked through my lunch. After dismissal, I worked on making a test until just before 6:00, when I left school to go to a study session that I had organized for my students. When done, I went back to school to finalize the test and run copies. Now, it's not as if there wasn't plenty more to do, but as it was then nearly 8:30 and I hadn't eaten, I decided that I'd just come into work early again tomorrow so that I could leave school and get some food.\n But, yeah, I'm a lazy, underworked, overpaid bum. That, or you need to take a long walk off of a short pier. If you could job shadow me for one day, you'd feel half an inch tall for spewing this bull about me.\n \n \nWhat misandry? Provide me an example, from that conversation, Mr. Scientist, if you're were so bashed, as a result of being male.\n\n Okay. See above. Ironically, from the same post that I cited (after correction) in my previous post.\n \n \nThe only thing I see, in both your case and your comrade's in that conversation, is misogyny. Exemplified by your use of this term.\n\n All she did was complain. Bitch, whine, moan. When you look up the verb on Merriam-Webster, it says, \"complain.\" Even urbandictionary's first entry means someone who \"whines excessively.\" I guess I could have tagged \"-er\" on the end, but that kind of loses the auditory correlation.\n \n \nWhy don't you just call us \"niggers\",\n\n Why would I do that? You two kept on bitching. It's an apt description for the behavior.\n \n \nHow would you like it, if women, in large numbers, were commonly calling men who annoyed them, \"c##ks####rs\" or \"bastards\" or any number of words that DON'T EVEN EXIST because we live in a male -- not female -- dominated, and MISOGYNIST, not misandrous society?\n\n If they don't exist, then you coined them just now? Oh, I guess they do exist. Hey, if they're really rare, they won't be filtered on 4forums. Oh, wait, they are. Bummer for your argument.\n \n \n\"Frankly, my dear\", we're tired of being your Lennonesque theme song:\n\n Never even heard of it. Play the persecution card much?\n \n \nSo can you stop f-ing up the discussion, for once, with your GDF sexism?\n\n For the record, my use of the word \"dear\" was entirely mocking your use of it, hence the emphasis on it. If you really thought it was so bad, you wouldn't be doing it... unless, of course, you were purposely being antagonizing. But you wouldn't do that, would you? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nYou are the one who needs to keep up. Whatever Steamroller had in mind, which may (or may not) have been your average public school institution and teacher, home education doesn't mean that the mother is necessarily teaching a subject, herself.

(Among some other things.)\n\n I'll take this opportunity to explain that nobody here is my \"comrade.\" But why am I expected to stalk him?\n \n \nI never said anything about evil college educated academics. Don't you realize how irrational you appear when you object to someone else's premise (i.e. Steamroller) as if it were my premise?\n\n Oh FFS. Learn to read. I didn't object to it as if it were your premise. It was in its own separate post. You, yes YOU responded to that response, so I responded to you because your response was aimed at labeling me as stereotypical when you actually supported my point. Now you're all pissy about it, and it isn't because I'm pretending that you made the original point; it's because you keep looking like a fool. Ironically, in your repeated objections, you make yourself look even more foolish.\n \n \nDemanding that I defend myself, when it was someone else who said it?\n\n I demand that you defend YOUR statement: the insinuation that I'm stereotypical. And that you do it especially in the light that my statement was accurate, even according to that statement of yours.\n \n \nGive me a break. And you were trained in scientific thinking? Or this a comedy routine?\n\n I'm certainly running circles around you. You call people \"dear\" but get pissy when someone does it to you. You display misandry and then falsely accuse others of misogyny. You accuse me of attributing statements to you that aren't yours, but I've made it clear which statements -- and of whose -- I'm actually responding to. You make statements based on known falsehoods as attempts at rhetoric. You pretend that you support the unions after saying that they bring the country down. You accuse me of not being familiar with teaching resources when I bypass the superficial databases and go straight to the journals.\n \n \nFor more information on that study, see Professors Myra and David Sadker's, Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls.\n\n Ah, so you acknowledge that you didn't post a link, or the actual text of the study, but instead gave your superficial, knee-jerk interpretation of an article that you might not even have access to. Good to know.\n \n By the way, I have resources sitting in my classroom right now that are aimed at engaging female students in the sciences. The one whose name I remember off the top of my head is \"Jumpstarting Jill.\" But I guess I only have that because I'm a misogynist and want to electrocute my female students, huh?\n \n Seriously, how black and blue does your XXX have to end up before you stop being so damn ridiculous?",

   "Just a few points, Electrolyte, because this conversation is really veering off into all kinds of things I don't want to argue about. I want to discuss the ethical parameters of teaching, as outlined in the first post. We'll just have to agree to disagree on many other things. But I will mention these points:\n \n (1) I think you need to lighten up and fine tune your internet irony meter on some statements. A sense of humor would help too.\n \n (2) My reference to your stereotyping concerned your understanding of home education. A stereotypical understanding that I see common to many. Whatever Steamroller said or meant, you'd have to speak to that poster about it. I think it's only about the second time I've seen them appear (lovely sunset, btw, Steamroller, if you're reading).\n \n (3) I do support teacher's unions, and for the reasons I've already stated. And I think I've clarified the source of any misunderstanding there. So I think it's fair, at this point, to say you're engaged in strawman.\n \n (4) I posted, more than once, a reference to this study, not a cite. So you're doing the strawman dance, again. But you've got your book now, so read it! Come back and let me know what you think about American teachers' understanding of assessment.\n \n (5) I started this thread to mainly discuss the ethical parameters of teaching with respect to how teachers employ power in a classroom both legitimately and illegitimately (see post one). Ideally, it would be nice to have a conversation that wasn't so defensive and attack-filled, or where people fall into imaginery alliances with whoever's side they think they are supposed to be on.\n \n So I wait, with bated breath, for a contribution on that point, and in that manner. Thus far, I've seen plenty of teacher modeling of illegitimate means of employing power, but not much discussion about it. I have seen some legitimate means displayed, but without much discussion of that, either.\n \n \nSeriously, how black and blue does your XXX have to end up before you stop being so damn ridiculous?\n\n \n Seriously, is this how you talk to people face to face?

A sense of humor would help too.\n\n If you think there's a chance in hell that I'll \"lighten up\" because you want me to, you must be ill. You've heaped so much slander, dishonesty, misandry, and mass hatred into two threads that I can't believe you're deluded enough to think that I have a problem when I take offense. You're unbelievable.\n \n \n(2) My reference to your stereotyping concerned your understanding of home education. A stereotypical understanding that I see common to many. Whatever Steamroller said or meant, you'd have to speak to that poster about it.\n\n Your response was clear. My response to Steamroller was just that: a response to Steamroller. You elected to piggyback onto that comment, and you did so with a sweeping generalization. The real irony is that your statement suggested that my statement was entirely accurate, yet you still managed to imply that I don't understand anything. Pretty clever.\n \n \n(3) I do support teacher's unions, and for the reasons I've already stated. And I think I've clarified the source of any misunderstanding there. So I think it's fair, at this point, to say you're engaged in strawman.\n\n No wonder your conclusions are asinine: your idea of \"fair\" is completely contrived. You came out and said it. I posted your own words. I posted your own words in context. Now you're trying to write them off by saying, \"Yeah, well, you're mean, and I was mad.\" No, antonia. That's not a reason. That's the kind of excuse given by a grade-schooler. Your claim that you didn't really mean it doesn't correlate with the other statements you made in that thread (and, oh, you made plenty).\n But, but! you've managed to step it up another notch. You could have issued a real retraction, maybe even apologized, or explained that you have since changed your opinion, but you didn't. Instead, you hemmed and hawed and chose to accuse me of creating a strawman.\n Really. What the hell? What the hell, antonia? They're YOUR OWN ***DAMN WORDS.\n \n \n(4) I posted, more than once, a reference to this study, not a cite. So you're doing the strawman dance, again.\n\n But this was my point. You posted a passing reference -- your own knee-jerk, unread regurgitation of a talking point -- and demanded that we address this \"conclusion\" of the research. I asked you for a link, a citation, something that would actually allow me to know what the hell the actual conclusion said, to which you responded by attacking me for not using ERIC, which provides a very brief summary possibly not even written by the authors. In fact, you couldn't provide me with anything until I was metaphorically beating you over the head with demands that you quit being an intellectual pansy.\n \n \nBut you've got your book now, so read it! Come back and let me know what you think about American teachers' understanding of assessment.\n\n I said that I have Jumpstarting Jill. I'm supposed to glean from that conclusions about the entirety of American teachers' understanding of assessment?\n Can you please, please say again that I don't understand anything? Oh pretty please? Once more and I think you can be committed.\n \n \nIdeally, it would be nice to have a conversation that wasn't so defensive and attack-filled,\n\n I'm stopping you right there. If you want me not to be defensive, you'll have to stop with your inexcusable, credulity-stretching, slanderous accusations. You keep playing the persecution card because I'm calling you on your asinine assertions, two-faced positioning, strawmen, misandry, vacuous logic, misunderstandings...

Not so what you felt or imagined when you wrote it, but what you didn't consider them thinking or feeling upon reading the words. Or did you? Out of malevolence?\n\n I don't talk to people like that face to face, because nobody -- nobody -- that I have ever met in real life behaves the way you do here. Reference to your bruised XXX is not as if I have a right to assault you or anyone else but rather that you are getting a metaphorical XXX-kicking and continue not only to come back for more but also to make it so thorough. The intended message is that your \"points\" here have been almost entirely vacuous, and interacting with you has reminded me why I loathe meetings with those parents who behave as you do here; nobody in a position like mine should have to put up with somebody in a position like yours, pretending -- knowing next to nothing about me, my teaching, or the details of the teaching profession -- that you can draw conclusions about me, my teaching, and teaching in general such that you can declare that I'm a lousy, lazy teacher. You crossed the line, you crossed it multiple times, and you continued to cross it despite getting repeatedly slapped down by somebody who actually knows what the hell he's talking about.\n \n Just in case you couldn't quite connect the dots: every time I've mentioned fear for my job, or a desire to join the union, the impetus has been an understandable worry regarding unjust termination. I have no worry about losing my job for substandard performance. It's because of bigots who I suspect would take indefensible offense at my opinions (if I felt safe enough to share them) and because of nutjobs like you who decide that they don't like the way I do things because they'd rather not damage their childish understanding instead of getting their heads out of their asses.\n \n So, I'm going to take my overpaid, unable-to-teach, lazy XXX back away from 4forums so that I can make out test keys tonight in order to have time to help a former student with a college class tomorrow after school but before going to a banquet for select students and their favorite teachers, that way I have only grading and lesson planning left for afterward.\n \n antonia will, of course, believe that I've made this up. In reality, it's wishful thinking. See, I was pretending that there isn't also the part about being observed (and the associated paperwork) as well as the part about the meeting that eats my prep period.\n \n Here's what I got wrong: After stopping abruptly when classes started eight months ago, I thought that I actually had enough time to return to 4forums now and that threads would be entertaining or intellectually stimulating enough to qualify as a worthwhile change of pace. Clearly, a terrible miscalculation.",

You appear to be experiencing a lot of stress and taking it out on me.\n \n As for unions, and teacher's job protection, I am entirely for that. It's not my banner waving issue, but like I said, one of the reasons I support teachers' unions is because I am aware of job issues teachers had before they existed. \n \n Don't take this the wrong way, (though you probably will), but I suggest that you speak to someone about all this stress you're experiencing around your job (assuming you're really a teacher). Someone you trust. Perhaps a therapist who has experience working with teachers. Maybe even someone another teacher can recommend.\n \n (Though I wouldn't recommend asking any teacher you know, from on-line. Maybe a teacher's union would have further information.

   "This is my third post on 4forums and to say the least I find it interesting.\n \n I added my two cents on the topic to see where they would go. If it was addressed and I missed it I apologize, but I saw no response to my point about the dismal percentage of 4th and 8th graders math proficiency compared to the rest of the world. Our poor performance in this and other areas of education are a direct indicator of a failing system. That failing system includes teachers. (and let the finger pointing begin!!!)\n \n As for my comment about Homeschool Mom's... I'll take the average homeschool student over the average public school student any day of the week. Increasingly, so will many prominent colleges around the country, but the homeschool debate is another topic.\n \n As for \"Ethical Parameters of Teaching\"..... WOW.\n 1) it has been my experience that name calling and the need to fall back on profanity is a glaring admission of the inability to continue, or support an argument.\n 2) In the discussion of Ethical Parameters of teaching I can't help but wonder why the \"social agenda\" that is obviously being pushed within our public school system is not a greater part of this debate. What \"Ethical Parameters\" are we even talking about, you must have \"ethics\" before you can discuss any given set of parameters.\n CASE IN POINT: Why does the current system forbid the teaching of intelligent design and force a \"theory\" that has been found to be incredibly flawed at best. \"Ethical Teaching\" would at the very least allow both views to be considered by students.\n 3) If there are \"Ethiics\" in teaching, can anyone site one instance where a teachers strike was based on the student cirriculum, or some other reason that was solely based on the students educational welfare? I can only recall wages and benefits being the reason.\n \n I know that I am generalizing, perhaps to a fault. I also know that there are teachers who do a great job, and are very ethical. I had one once.\n \n However, referring to the first post on this thread, my stated opinions and fears are the very reason I am appalled at the very mention of a public school official, let alone a teacher, having access to any information about a student or their family outside the classroom.\n \n It is imperative to the health of this country that the schools revert back to thier original purpose of transferring \"factual\" information to young human beings to better equip THEM to make decisions as adults. Too many children of the 60's grew up to socially engineer this country through the public schools through thier teaching careers and that tradition remains. The success of this conspiracy can be quanitified in the recent Presidential election in which a candidate won after campaigning for two years and never fully defining one policy. This is not to turn this into a political debate, as much as it is a demostration of the success our educational system has had in \"the dumbing down of America\".\n \n Our educational sysytem is at the heart of what our country is, and will become. I would hope that it would concentrate on the \"education\" of our society, and not delve into the manipulation of it's social fabric.",

If so it hardly seems fair to blame the teachers. There are certainly problems related to the sort of maths you might teach to potential future mathematicians and physicists and what you might teach to other students. If those two groups are required to study the same undifferentiated curriculum then someone is going to get screwed by it. Given the smaller proportion of gifted students it is most often them who suffer. There are ways of teaching which are accessible to both groups but they tend to be unpopular with the 3Rs brigade because they don't feature learning times tables and lots of algorithmic calculation. My favoured compromise as far as the English curriculum goes is that provided by the Centre for Innovation in Mathematics Teaching - Centre for Innovation in Mathematics Teaching - Mathematics Enhancement Programme though I do also rather like the material available on the nrich website (nrich.maths.org :: Mathematics Enrichment :: May 2009 Front Page), and the materials produced by the Bowland Trust (Bowland Player)\n \n \n\n What I find interesting (and this isn't a reference to yourself, since I don't know you) -- is that I've heard teachers (IME, usually younger, and not being parents, themselves) claiming in frustration that they have this parent's child in their classroom X number of hours per week -- and much more than the parent.

I read the above quote as if you were referring to me as \"the NUT\". Which then made me believe you were accusing me of \"threatening industrial action\". Apparently your union is \"the NUT\" that is threatening industrial action. From the deepest part of my heart I pray that you are laughing at my misunderstanding and forgive my assumption.\n \n On this whole subject I suppose I am in over my head. I come at it strictly from a parents point of view and as a businessman. I also have quite a few members of my immediate family in the education field both as teachers and administrators.\n \n Though I would not want a teachers job, I suppose I would be a bit more comfortable if teachers would be a little more selective about the battles they choose to engage in.\n \n The beginning of this debate touched on a subject that sent chills up my spine. That being what the \"ethical parameters\" should be concerning teachers getting involved in the students personal lives as well as the students families.\n \n \nI am thinking more about greyer areas -- their being privy to confidential information about families, their position of power in relationship to that information and the lives of children whom parents love, and sometimes the lives of the parents themselves, and their freedom in our U.S. system to abuse that power.\n \n Take into consideration that teachers, at times, need (a) consulting networks, and (b) peer support systems, but that this is distinct from abuse of power, or colluding in the abuse of power, and, that such abuse should not be permitted to parade as either (a) or (b).\n\n \n Antonia, I have read your posts and consider you a thoughtful person. As to your queary in the above quote, I would suggest a third party be involved. The teachers job is to teach. While some psychology backround would obviously be helpful in the actual job of teaching, a problem student should be referred to specialist who would then probe deeper into the problem. This of course does nothing for the chills up my spine but it is an alternative to adding more to a teachers job.(BTW the \"specialist\" I was sent to was called a counselor... I believe it was \"Wild Turkey\" that his breath reeked of.)\n \n I have more but my kids just got home.",

   "Thanks, Steamroller. Perhaps I should have clarified. Because I wasn't thinking (in post one) of any scenario involving a child in a classroom, or teachers acting within the auspices of the public school system. So there's isn't even a problematic situation, to begin with, let alone calling a specialist in. That is, once you're out of the school system, for example, on the internet, the parameters or boundaries between government (or \"educational\" authority) and family should be even clearer.\n \n Regardless of whether or not such individuals have or had PSS experience for many years, or not .. it shivers me, too. Given the misunderstanding of the parameters in places clearly outside the domain of the school system, that such individuals could be associated with our schools, where the parameters regarding families and government is not always as clear.",

   "Jo Bennet, I beg for your forgiveness with a thousand apologies. I read the above quote as if you were referring to me as \"the NUT\". Which then made me believe you were accusing me of \"threatening industrial action\". Apparently your union is \"the NUT\" that is threatening industrial action. From the deepest part of my heart I pray that you are laughing at my misunderstanding and forgive my assumption.\n \n\n \n No worries. :p I should have made clear, the NUT is the National Union of Teachers, the oldest and largest teachers union in the UK.\n \n \n However, I think curriculum as big business, is a big part of the problem in the U.S. \n\n \n The best work over here is done by charitable trusts and university education departments, sometimes directly funded by central government, or sponsored by companies. I believe the CIMT is sponsored by Price Watehouse Coopers among others.",
