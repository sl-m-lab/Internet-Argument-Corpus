   "As promised, I have put together some solid evidence for evolution. If you have anything to add to the list, please post it.[*]The two most obvious structures are the tonsils and the appendix. View the links for information regarding their \"usefulness.\"[*]Another fairly obvious example is the coccyx. It is similar to the previous two in that it has a function but is not perfect or even very good for that function. Unlike the previous two, however, it is associated with a completely vestigial structure: the human tail.[*]Another example of structures that are obviously not used for their original (true) purpose are the wings of flightless birds.[*]Similarly, whales have retained their hind limb bones, \"finger\" bones in their forelimbs, and a very small layer of fur.[*]Human wisdom teeth are present but often unusable. Like the appendix and tonsils, if they don't work, they create substantial problems for people.\n \n Moving on to less well known examples...\n \n [*]A blind fish has no use for eyes, but it has the obvious remnants of them.[*]One response to stress is the formation of goose bumps. This response was practiced successfully by animals with more hair (i.e. our ancestors) to create the illusion of size. Now goose bumps are only useful when cold, but stress triggers them nonetheless.[*]Marsupials produce eggshells during development, but those are reabsorbed before birth.[*]Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain (and use) DNA, even though no other organelle needs it. This is an indicator that they were once separate organisms, as organelles are generally formed according to the main cellular DNA.Again, if you have anything to add, please do so.",

   "I found this joke at the the site that listed vestigial structures:\n \n \"A mechanical engineer, a chemical engineer and a civil engineer were discussing the human body in the pub. 'The body was clearly designed by a mechanical engineer... look at all the levers and joints.' 'No no no, it was obviously designed by a chemist, it's full of amazing chemical reactions!' 'I'm sorry' said the civil engineer, 'but it was undoubtedly a civil engineer. I've run countless sewage pipes through recreational areas myself...' \"\n \n \n It may also be interesting to note that there are several animals & protozoa that have incorporated algae as symbionts in their cells paralleling the endosymbiosis between archaea and cyanobacteria which led to chloroplasts (vestigial structures in all plants). Hydra & paramecium are two such examples. The Plantaris muscle is a great example of a vestigial structure, BTW. Another, more well known, example is the Auricular muscle behind the ears; it's the \"ear wiggling muscle\". How about the toes of humans? They are vestigial digits, which are no longer of any use for grasping objects or branches, and they have taken on a 2ndary function - that of maintaining balance for an obligately bipedal primate. And yet a more obscure example of vestigial structures involves the diminution of the haploid phase in plants & animals, becoming the pollen grain & female gametophyte in plants and the sperm & ovum in animals. Our pineal gland is like a vestigial \"3rd eye\", gathering light from the optic nerve instead of from a hole in the head. And don't forget that the base of the right Subclavian artery is a vestage of the right dorsal Aorta, or that the vas deferens is a vestage of the mesonephric duct, or that our teeth are modified vestages of Placoderm fish scales (which actually had dentin & enamel layers).

I had assumed from the first post that all of the evolutionists in this thread were taking the \"useless organ\" approach to the argument.\n \n Regardless, the same argument applies to the vestigial homology variation that you propose. The evidence you bring up is evidence against your perception of creationism, not evidence in favor of evolution. The underlying assumption behind your post is that an Intelligent Designer would never use the same design twice, or would never modify a design for re-use. I don't accept that assumption. I, for one, would have a hard time accepting Intelligent Design if no two designs were alike, because that would go against everything we know about clever designs. Smart designers don't create hundreds of entirely independent concepts. Rather, they use and vary the same design many times. One has only to look at every design from nails to computers to ballistic missiles to see that much. The reason for this principle of engineering is simple - if you only make one kind of a design, you waste a lot of potentially useful similar designs. Likewise, to use your example, instead of wasting potential, the designer probably applied the same design used in a mammal's leg to make an efficient, workable wing.\n \n \nThe plantaris muscle, on the other hand, is useless and sometimes even absent.

Do you have a reasonable explanation for the existence of whale leg bones besides evolution.\n\n \n I'll say from the start that I don't have explanations for all of your questions; I only have a theory with which you can work. While the number of supposedly useless structures has dropped over the years since Darwin, there are still a few whose functions remain unknown (if they even have a function). Likewise, I have no way of scientifically demonstrating a specific theory of how the organs came to be corrupted. Doing so is neither scientifically possible at this time nor necessary to defending the fundamental idea of Intelligent Design.\n \n \nWhat reason do you have for concluding that they were designed in the first place?\n\n \n I don't claim to have a positive reason that they are designed.
