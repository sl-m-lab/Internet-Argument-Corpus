The man is delusional.\n \n He brought up taking \"In god we Trust\" from the all of the money, and \"Under god\" from the pledge as examples of the State making law establishing religion. Putting them there in the first place was establishment of religion removing them would be setting them back to what they were before the 1950's. \n \n The fool is taking this as a victory, that he is somekind of martyr.\n \n He was going on and on about this being about his right to acknowledge god at all. No one ever said that he couldn't acknowledge god, only that he couldn't do it while sitting on the bench as a judge speaking for the State because that would be the violation of establishment of religion if he did. He was basically saying that all of the principles of law and government in the USA are based on his god's law only. He is wrong. That would make the USA a theocracy like Iran is if it were.\n \n http://www.internetcampus.com/fog25.htm",
