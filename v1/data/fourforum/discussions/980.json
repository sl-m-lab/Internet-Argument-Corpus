   "Here it is, the text:\n \n http://www.usconstitution.net/const.txt\n \n Almost all of the Constitution deals with what the government can not do, what protections \"people\" have, and what duties the government have to the \"people\". Almost none of it deals with what \"people\" can not do and what people owe the government.\n \n Only one part of deals specifically with what \"people\" can not do, the 18th Amendment. It was called pro-habition and it was repealled.\n \n The 1st and 2nd Amendment specifically deals with right of \"people\". Anti-gunners argument is that the right of \"people\" in the 2nd Amendment deals only with the right in the context of a militia. That is a long stretch, then \"people\" in the 1st Amendment only deals with what? In the context of a press, an assembly, or a grievance? Then artistic expression is not protected, painting is not protected, music CDs are not protected, and most forms of entertainment and non-political expression is not protected.\n \n \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" Substitute in the definition of miltia into the text and it becomes very clear who has the right to bear arms and under what conditions.\n \n A well regulated Militia(every man over the age of 18) being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

Perhaps there is hope for you after all.\n \n Everyone is innocent until they are guilty of something. The trouble is determining a way to stop the guilty from ever being able to carry through with their intentions. For example, my scenario of a group of Arabs going onto a plane heavily armed, those guys have bad intentions. They may be innocent as far as the law is concerned, but we can safely assume they are up to no good and therefore are probably guilty of planning something in which case they are not innocent. That is why it is difficult to know who is innocent and who is guilty. As easy as it is to say 'allowing armed innocent citizens' it is not as easy to make sure this is always the case.\n \n \nYour way takes all the choices away which makes it fundamentally wrong. If an airline bans guns on a plane, then so be it.

You can argue that bypassing the constitution is fundamentally under our system of law, but simply taking away choices regardless of the situation isn't fundamentally wrong.\n \n Of course you already know airplanes are not just for citizens to use anymore. Terrorist will love the choice of guns or no guns. Using a plane as a weapon is fundamentally wrong as far as the US citizens are concerned and your way provides a means for this to occur.

I keep reminding you about this inconsistency, which I'd like to clear up. Why, when the law quite clearly says \"no exceptions\" do you make exceptions - and why not for the government. They're a lot more important to your country than the local Try 'n' Save.\n \n However, I'll answer you anyway.\n \n The short answer: If I were in a life or death struggle, I'd choose my life over the assailant.\n \n However, I'd certainly prefer that he had a blade then a 9mm Glock. I don't understand why you don't acknowledge that a gun is far more deadlier than a knife, or a baseball bat. You seem to be trying to deny something you cherish, because it's the gun you want to carry, not the baseball bat. You know that guns are more deadly.\n \n Recall that 6 year old kid who shot another 6 year old. Whilst it's possible he'd have been able to kill her with a knife, he'd have had a lot more trouble wielding a baseball bat. Quite clearly there's a hierarchy of danger with regards to weapons.\n \n You want to carry around with you a very dangerous item, and you'd want everyone else to. The result is your exceptionally high death rate in relation to hand guns. You have to watch out if your neighbour hasn't had his vallium, because he's just as deadly as you are... carrying around an arsenal.\n \n In this country it's illegal to carry knives, as well as guns.\n \n That is not the issue however; self defence.

   "Basically, you might expect me to answer a question without answering mine.\n \n I know I'm only in Australia, and not that important, but I'd still like to know why you hold so dear to the Second Amendment as far as the government is concerned, but you'll waive this sacred law for an airline, or a department store. I keep reminding you about this inconsistency, which I'd like to clear up. Why, when the law quite clearly says \"no exceptions\" do you make exceptions - and why not for the government. They're a lot more important to your country than the local Try 'n' Save.\n \n\n \n The Right of the people...Shall not be infringed.... BY THE GOVERNMENT. Private businesses (although less and less) can make thier own rules regarding thier establishment... Strange concept eh?\n \n \n\n The short answer: If I were in a life or death struggle, I'd choose my life over the assailant.\n \n However, I'd certainly prefer that he had a blade then a 9mm Glock. I don't understand why you don't acknowledge that a gun is far more deadlier than a knife, or a baseball bat. You seem to be trying to deny something you cherish, because it's the gun you want to carry, not the baseball bat. You know that guns are more deadly.\n \n\n \n \n I find it interesting how down in Aussieland you get to choose what your assailant will attack you with.... very cool....\n \n \n \n\n Recall that 6 year old kid who shot another 6 year old. Whilst it's possible he'd have been able to kill her with a knife, he'd have had a lot more trouble wielding a baseball bat. Quite clearly there's a hierarchy of danger with regards to weapons.\n \n\n \n \n Is this a specific example or a hypothetical? The Pistol, rifle, grenade, hammer are the tools.... I am the weapon. How I apply myself whether to good or bad is how I shall be judged...... Another hard concept for the big fedgov socialists......\n \n \n\n You want to carry around with you a very dangerous item, and you'd want everyone else to. The result is your exceptionally high death rate in relation to hand guns. You have to watch out if your neighbour hasn't had his vallium, because he's just as deadly as you are... carrying around an arsenal.\n \n\n \n Cars are deadlier.... And I drive them! Its not about wanting to carry anything its the freedom to have that choice!\n \n \n\n In this country it's illegal to carry knives, as well as guns.\n \n That is not the issue however; self defence. The issue here is your wish to carry a gun as according to a law, which you don't really respect anyway, because you're quite happy to circumvent it all the time.\n\n \n \n HAIL CEASAR! do you feel safer now that you can't have a knife, a gun. Is that fedgov you got protecting your women from rape (going up by your own admission)... oh but I guess you aussies don't consider sexual assault a violent crime... \n \n \n I am visiting Australia in december...

Most gun deaths are between criminal elements not some wiley predator on random victims. You are a victim of propaganda my friend... How many people do you know have been shot? How many people do you know who know people who have been shot.... Keep going you will find this very interesting\n \n \n From GOA fact sheet\n \n GOA FACT SHEET\n \n Self-defense\n A. Guns save more lives than they take; prevent more injuries than they inflict\n * Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year, firearms are used more than 60 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2\n \n * Of the 2.5 million self-defense cases, as many as 200,000 are by women defending themselves against sexual abuse.3 \n \n * Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606).4 And readers of Newsweek learned in 1993 that \"only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The \"error rate\" for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high.\"5 \n \n * Of the 2.5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker.6\n \n * Handguns are the weapon of choice for self-defense. Citizens use handguns to protect themselves over 1.9 million times a year.7 Many of these self-defense handguns could be labeled as \"Saturday Night Specials.\" \n \n B. Concealed carry laws help reduce crime\n * One-half million self-defense uses. Every year, as many as one-half million citizens defend themselves with a firearm away from home.8\n \n * Florida. In the ten years following the passage of Florida's concealed carry law in 1987, there were 478,248 people who received permits to carry firearms.9 FBI reports show that the homicide rate in Florida, which in 1987 was much higher than the national average, fell 39% during that 10-year period. The Florida rate is now far below the national average.10 \n \n * Do firearms carry laws result in chaos? No. Consider the case of Florida. A citizen in the Sunshine State is almost twice as likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder. During the first ten years that the Florida law was in effect, alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 146 to 88 margin.11 \n \n * Nationwide. A comprehensive national study determined in 1996 that violent crime fell after states made it legal to carry concealed firearms. The results of the study showed: \n \n * States which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%;12 and\n * If those states not having concealed carry laws had adopted such laws in 1992, then approximately 1,570 murders, 4,177 rapes, 60,000 aggravated assaults and over 11,000 robberies would have been avoided yearly.13 \n * Concealed Carry v. Waiting Period Laws. In 1976, both Georgia and Wisconsin tried two different approaches to fighting crime. Georgia enacted legislation making it easier for citizens to carry guns for self-defense, while Wisconsin passed a law requiring a 48 hour waiting period before the purchase of a handgun. What resulted during the ensuing years? Georgia's law served as a deterrent to criminals and helped drop its homicide rate by 21 percent. Wisconsin's murder rate, however, rose 33 percent during the same period.14 \n \n C. Criminals avoid armed citizens\n * Kennesaw, GA. In 1982, this suburb of Atlanta passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in the house. The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89% in Kennesaw, compared to the modest 10.4% drop in Georgia as a whole.15 \n \n * Ten years later (1991), the residential burglary rate in Kennesaw was still 72% lower than it had been in 1981, before the law was passed.16 \n \n * Nationwide. Statistical comparisons with other countries show that burglars in the United States are far less apt to enter an occupied home than their foreign counterparts who live in countries where fewer civilians own firearms. Consider the following rates showing how often a homeowner is present when a burglar strikes: \n \n * Homeowner occupancy rate in the gun control countries of Great Britain, Canada and Netherlands: 45% (average of the three countries); and, \n * Homeowner occupancy rate in the United States: 12.7%.17 \n Rapes averted when women carry or use firearms for protection \n \n * Orlando, FL. In 1966-67, the media highly publicized a safety course which taught Orlando women how to use guns. The result: Orlando's rape rate dropped 88% in 1967, whereas the rape rate remained constant in the rest of Florida and the nation.18 \n * Nationwide. In 1979, the Carter Justice Department found that of more than 32,000 attempted rapes, 32% were actually committed. But when a woman was armed with a gun or knife, only 3% of the attempted rapes were actually successful.19\n Justice Department study:\n \n * 3/5 of felons polled agreed that \"a criminal is not going to mess around with a victim he knows is armed with a gun.\"20\n * 74% of felons polled agreed that \"one reason burglars avoid houses when people are at home is that they fear being shot during the crime.\"21 \n * 57% of felons polled agreed that \"criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\"22 \n \n \n \n \n This last one is very telling...",

   "You introduced the holly than thou argument. You country is not that holly. Just like the liberals in this country, you stick your nose into other peoples business. You take the prize, your sticking your nose in our business across borders and time zones.\n\n \n I replied with more facts. Now you're using personal assessments again, so I will continue to as well. (Except I've also got facts too!)\n \n Firstly, do you mean Holy?\n \n But the Holier-than-though argument was begun by you when you suggested that because I'm against gun ownership, I'm anti-freedom.\n \n You introduced the argument in post 10 \"You have constantly argued for protection with civil rights as an afterthought. You can not be for freedom, liberty, and due process; and continue to ignore the Constitution.\"\n \n Here you imply that I am anti-freedom. Based on what? The ownership of guns doesn't imply freedom. Guns are owned all through-out third world countries.\n \n Rather than address this you decided to suggest that Australia was some tin-pot dictatorship. You expanded on this suggesting that we have no rights because they're not all written down. On what evidence can you say we have no rights? I've clearly demonstrated that we can have heaps of innovations. And now you're upset because the bastion of democracy is shown not to be a world leader in granting rights.\n \n What's it matter if it's written down...\n Article 50 of the constitution of the former Soviet Union\n \"1) In accordance with the interests of the people and in order to strengthen and develop the socialist system, citizens of the USSR are guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, and of assembly, meetings, street processions and demonstrations.\"\n 2) Exercise of these political freedoms is ensured by putting public buildings, streets, and squares at the disposal of the working people and their organizations, by broad dissemination of information, and by the opportunity to use the press, television, and radio.\"\n \n I suppose you're going to argue that because they had it written down that the Soviet Union was one big wonder free place?\n \n What a dip-stick! I can't tell sometimes if you're really that dumb or you're pretending.\n \n Obviously by your rationale we're a Nazi totalitarian state! Great Britain must be even worse, because they've got no constitutional document at all.\n \n And, look how well you really support free speech...Now you're saying I have no right to discuss things on this forum. Well, I mean you're like the biggest cry-baby I've ever heard of. Does this really upset you does it, to have someone challenge you? Where on the forum does it say \"Americans Only\"? In fact you don't even know if I am an American citizen, living in Australia, now do you?*\n \n Some people actually believe that it's wise to construct an argument, you don't you just blurb and blubber, and then have a big cry about it if someone points out the rubbish your write. You're a (gun-totting) wuss, man! No wonder you carry a gun, to compensate!\n What are you going to do next? Shoot me?\n \n Anyway, now back to the real argument...\n In post 24 you said \"The 1st Amendment is absolute..\" But then you say not for slander, which means you really need to look up the word 'absolute'. You also imply that the second amendment is not absolute despite the term \"Shall not be infringed\".\n \n I'd really like you to address this rather than go off on tangents about democracy in Australia, which is something you know nothing about.\n \n So, why do you allow the infringement of your constitutional rights? It lists no exceptions at all. Is it a personal freedom that you have the right to decide who to make exceptions for?\n \n Basically, you want to own a gun, as a compensation for having a tiny one. And you're hiding behind the constitution because owning a gun makes you feel more of a man. It doesn't matter how stupid you are, because as long as you've got that gun, you mean something... people will 'respect' you. Even black men don't scare you as much!\n \n You make this personal issue into a patriotic one, by talking about freedoms you don't really respect, and which are pretty hollow; they don't seem to carry responsibilities.\n \n \n \n \n \n *I'll put you out of your misery, I'm 100% Australian, but you were just making an assumption based on no facts; a lucky guess. However, my father was born in Clay City, Clay County, Indiana so I have 'an interest' in America.",

From Satyagraha Leaflet No. 13, May 3, 1919 \" here why not give the pages, and the context... \n \n \n Besides Ghandi had no choice but to be non violent as the brits disarmed the entire nation. \n \n \n I am not big on Ghandi as his whole theory would be out the window in Nazi Germany.... In fact the Jews for the most part were complacent.... Thats how they got 6 million of them.\n \n \n \"The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.\"\n \n I will always be in a \"position to forgive\"",
