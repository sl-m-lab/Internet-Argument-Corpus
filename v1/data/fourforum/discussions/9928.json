Taxes reduce consumption, that is a basic fact of life. Basic supply side fundamentals that reducing taxes increases activity. Now we're talking about increasing public taxes and it won't reduce consumption? That makes no sense.\n \n It just seems that the claims of revenue neutral rely upon unfounded and quite unrealistic assumptions. \n \n \nRegarding recession, I would think there's a decrease in revenue even with the current income tax system. Jobs are lost. Therefore, revenue is lost. Just how much, I do not know.\n\n \n No doubt that revenue drops with recessions.

The first is fear of the IRS. We have all heard the horror stories. I found a long time ago that there is a trick to dealing with the IRS. If you try to rape them, they will get you bad. If you make an honest mistake, or honestly misunderstand something and are civil about it they will usually work with you. Sometimes they will even jsut let it slide.\n \n The other component I think is the perception that our tax system is complex and difficult to maneuver in. This is true....if you make a lot of money from a lot of different sources. 90% of our tax system does not apply to your average wage earner. You fill out your 1040 and you are done for the year. How complex is that really???? With the electornic filing systems available now it is even easier.\n \n I went on a little mini crusade during tax season to inform people about the IRS freefile program because I felt it was a good program that was poorly advertised. an hour in front of a computer punching in numbers that were provided by your employer, mortgage provider, etc... and you are done. No big deal.\n \n Beyond these problems, the only possible justification that I can imagine for the so called \"fair tax\" is that some people are just pricks and don't think that individuals who live below the poverty line are paying enough taxes. You can't squeeze blood from a stone, and trying to squeeze taxes from poor people is likely to be an equally futile exercise.",

   "Fairtax sounds wonderful. I wish it could work. But no way can it be revenue neutral. And just ONE reason for that (there are others) is that Fairtax depends on collecting about 800 billion dollars a year FROM the government on everything it buys.\n \n That might sound fun -- but its an illusion. NO real money is collected. For example, if the US Navy bought a 12 billion dollar aircraft carrier -- 3 billion of that would be sales tax. Who pays the 3 billion? The US Navy would pay it to the US Treasury. Who pays the bills for the US Navy -- the US Treasury.\n \n SO this 3 billion is an illusion. It doesnt exist, except as an accounting trick.\n \n So Fairtax I guess could be revenue neutral -- if the sales tax rate was like 50%. But do you really want a 50% sales tax on your gasoline -- cause this Fairtax applies to gasoline. DO you even want a 30% sales tax on gasoline?\n \n Plus its on your rent, on your medical cost, on your utilities, on your car insurance even. \n \n SO it might sound great -- its a fun idea! But how it would really play out would be a shock. The highest sales tax on earth on things like rent, gasoline, car insurance, medical??\n \n Be careful what you wish for.

I would hope that no U.S. president or congress would be so imprudent as to attempt transferring our nation's major revenue source in a single step. Any problem encountered within such an extremely hugh scale of tax modification would be financially disastrous.\n \n There's much less down side to simultaneous multi-step transfer of revenue sources but the scale of a single step problem could be nationally disastrous. Those that will accept only a single step transfer must also accept that a federal sales tax will never be enacted. \n \n I believe that an acceptable rate of sales tax could not feasibly replace the entire revenue we derive from income taxes, (i.e. the \"fair tax\"). If I'm wrong, sales taxes could completely replace income taxes. If I'm correct, after some incremental step the sales tax rate will approach an unacceptable rate and the transfer of the tax sources will have to be halted or interrupted.\n \n I agree with your analysis that there'd be little difference between an economy's proportional modification as reflected by tax revenues based upon incomes or upon general sales. \n \n Respectfully, Supposn",

   "I support the FairTax if for no other reason that it would get illegal immigrants and other groups of people paying taxes. That illegal immigrant on the construction site will probably want his burrito at lunchtime. Let's say he goes to the 7-11 and pays $2 for it. He just sent 46 cents (23% of $2) to Uncle Sam.\n \n Also, families would get \"prebate\" checks, which would \"untax\" purchases up to a certain amount. In 2000-02 I lived upstairs from a young welfare mother who had 7 kids, most of them by different dads. No husband and no job. Once Miss Welfare uses up her prebate, guess what: she starts paying taxes!",

   "Is there any indicators that a fair tax would bring in significantly less revenue then the current system?\n\n \n Obvious Child, fair tax proponents claim that a federal sales tax of 23% could replace all federal income taxes.\n \n Due to imbedded hidden sales taxes from prior transactions within a conventional sales tax method, a 23% sales tax would result in a significantly greater rate of sales tax paid by the purchaser at the final link of the commercial transactions chain. \n \n [The European Common Market nations and most other nation's that have since then enacted or modified a sales tax, have adopted the \"value added tax\", (VAT) method of sales tax because every purchaser actually pays no more than the total sales tax itemized within their transaction].\n \n The majority of states have their own sales taxes and additionally many cities and counties within those states also levy sales taxes. (NY City's total state and city sales tax is in excess of 8%). Thus under now existing state income tax laws, a 23% federal (conventional) sales tax would raise the total (stated sales tax to be in excess of 30%. The actual sales taxes paid by final purchasers at the last link of commercial transaction chains would generally be significantly greater than 30% in NY City. NJ State's sales tax is 6.9%. Wikipedia reports California state and local sales taxes as high as 10.75% . Connecticut has a 6% sales tax. Within some localities (as I previously explained) the actual tax paid by final purchasers are significantly greater than the stated tax sales tax rate. Do you think a sales tax rate well in excess of 30% would be an acceptable rate? \n \n I strongly doubt that a conventional sales tax of 23% would produce sufficient revenue to replace all federal taxes upon incomes. If a VAT (rather than a conventional) sales tax method is employed, total revenue for any given sales tax rate is significantly less. It is not feasible to attempt replacing all federal income taxes with any type of sales tax in a single step.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",
