   "Right, some of you might be like, 'OH, here we go again' emoticon_rolleyes \n \n I say, let's get down to business! \n \n The Arabs call them zionists. The Israelis call them terrorists. 1948, the declaration of the Israeli state took the Levant by storm, and immediately had a tremendous impact in the region.\n \n Lots of political actors, wars, conferences/negotiations have come and gone...but to no avail. The Palestianians still call for the lands of their grandfathers and great grandfathers. However, the Israeli state and infrastructure has expanded and developed at a RAPID pace since independence, thus justifying: \"We're not going anywhere.\"\n \n I have read tons of articles, a few books, lot's of research, and seen many documentaries about this issue, so I'll save my breath for now. \n \n One thing I'd like to make clear on this touchy subject: Initially, there is no side which can be labeled as 'RIGHT' or 'WRONG'. Both are here to stay, no matter what. \n \n Remember, this has been an ongoing conflict for over 50 years. Select a particular time frame if u want, and elaborate- what are your thoughts? What is to be done? Which actors from either side screwed up, or made a particularly clever decision? \n \n cheers",

That is the security threat Israel was worried about, because it would dramatically shift the demographic alignment and would make them more vulnerable to Hamas et al.

   "Originally posted by theLIBERTARIAN \n The Israelis did bomb a hospital early on.\n \n \n \n And the US bombed a girl's school in Denmark during WWII. The only point I can see you making here is that every army makes mistakes, esp. when you are dealing with terrorism. I agree with not providing weapons to another country, and not giving money to another country, unless they're going to pay it back. \n \n What exactly is Israel supposed to do anyway? They want peace, badly, but there is only so much one state can take while still remaining faithful to it's core valuse, like being a Jewish state. A newpaper column brought up an interesting point: If the Palestinians laid down their arms today, we would have peace. If the Israelis laid down their arms, they would be invaded. \n \n While looking up \"Right of Return\", one of the many sticky parts to the problem, I found one partial solution:\n \n \"One key reason why most Israelis are prepared to dismantle the many settlements that interfere with Palestinian territorial contiguity in the West Bank and Gaza and even to partition Jerusalem, is their growing awareness that their demographic security--the capacity to maintain a solid Jewish majority in Israel over the long term--is as important as their military security. Today they are acutely aware that even the modest achievement of a cold peace with Jordan and Egypt and a partial peace with Palestinians has prompted tens of thousands of Arabs to infiltrate Israel, with its relative prosperity, looking for work. This Middle East \"north-south\" microcosm poses a potential demographic threat for Israel. Hence Israelis' insistence that a refugee solution fully respect Israel's Jewish nature, and that peace look more like \"separation\" than \"integration.\" \n \n There is one additional problematic aspect of the right of return issue that requires specific comment: the readiness on the part of the world, including Israel, to acquiesce in a definition of refugee status that allows it to be passed on from generation to generation. Nowhere else in the world is a refugee problem officially in its fifth generation. Everywhere else, the children and grandchildren of refugees, including Jewish refugees, may still pursue property compensation claims--but not \"return\". Here, then, we must at least begin to contemplate an ominous possibility. The longer the Palestinian refugee/right of return issue remains unsolved, the more refugees there will be--until, through intermarriage, virtually all Palestinians will be \"refugees\" and, for better or for worse, the \"refugee problem\" will simply become synonymous with the \"Palestinian problem.\" \n \n \n \n This points to one possible area of compromise: conceivably, Israel could recognize some humanitarian right of family reunification, which Palestinians could label \"return,\" for all first generation refugees, i.e., those over 54 who were actually born in present day Israel, who wish to return and who have relatives that could assist in their absorption. Their number would not be large, nor would they affect the long-term demographic balance, but their \"return\" could provide a degree of satisfaction for the Palestinian narrative without seriously challenging the Israeli narrative. In exchange, the Palestinian leadership would agree that all other refugees be resettled or rehabilitated outside of Israel\"\n \n http://www.bitterlemons.org/previous/bl311201ed5.html\n \n \n While I believe both sides are at fault for the conflict, I do put more of the blame on the Palestinian side. They have tried mulitple times to win a conventional war and lost, and while I don't like war, I can understand them trying to get people off land that they percieved as theirs. However, using terrorist methods arewrong in every sense, and if you think about it, don't actually solve anything. It's quite possible that this is just me, but doesn't it seem that the majority of both sides just want peace, while the militants on either side just keep blowing it?",

The state was formed by sending stateless Jews with guns and tanks into Palestine and just taking the land. The land was not theirs. They took it by pushing Palestinians off it.\n \n In 1994, two men came close to peace in the middle east:\n Arafat and Rabin. They both won the Nobel Peace Prize.\n \n http://www.nobel.se/peace/laureates/1994/\n \n Rabin was killed by an Isreali who did not want peace. \"Yitzhak Rabin's confessed assassin told a judge Monday he made a coldhearted decision to kill the prime minister to stop the peace process\". \n \n http://www.kstatecollegian.com/issues/v100/fa/n056/AP-Rabin-Assassin-13.1-.html\n \n Now Isreal wants to kill the other partner who won the Peace Prize.\n \n No, the militians are not blowing it. The Isrealis are preventing it on purpose. From Rabins assasins own words, \"I did this to stop the peace process,\" he said. \"We need to be coldhearted.\"",
