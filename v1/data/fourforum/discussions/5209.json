   "Think about it...is this you?\n The Dynamics of Becoming \"Born-Again\"\n \n Becoming a born-again Christian usually entails the following: (1 )A person is consciously or sub-consciously concerned with the direction of his life. This may include a recent traumatic happening in his life such as a death, loss of a job, divorce mortgage foreclosure or any number of events which may cause one to look closely at the specific causes and effects in his life.\n \n There may be a \"spiritual hunger\", a strong desire to know \"Why am I here?\", and \"What's the purpose of my life on this earth?\". The realization that one is mortal and that at some time, death will overtake and this earthly existence will cease often plays a big role in \"seeking God\". There are many factors and these are only a few.\n \n (2)The person is in some manner exposed to the born again teaching. This may occur in church, at an evangelistic service, on television, by reading, or other media.\n \n (3)At some point, the person is told that (a) all humans have sinned (transgression or the breaking of divine law) and are therefore sinners. (b)That the bible is the word of God and it states that sinners cannot go to heaven and will suffer some sort of spiritual death forever and that (c)God has, however, provided a way for the sinner by placing the guilt of the sinner on his son, Jesus Christ, who came to the earth as a human and took the sins of all humanity on himself by suffering death by crucifixion.\n \n (4)The individual is strongly encouraged to \"accept\" this sacrifice by Jesus, and ask God to forgive his past sins. When the person does this, God grants him forgiveness and he may now enter into heaven or God's presence when he dies. He is taught that he is a \"new person\" or a \"new creature\" and that the spirit of Jesus Christ is imparted to him - something he didn't have before. He is now a \"spiritual\" being as well as a human being.\n \n The procedure I have described may vary according to different churches and their interpretations of the bible and its requirements for salvation but these are the basic guidelines for salvation. I say this for my Christian friends who may dispute the exact requirements.\n \n The \"new\" Christian is encouraged to become involved with others who have like beliefs. Once other Christians become aware that the person has become \"saved\" or \"born again\", they encourage him to attend fundamentalist churches. The attendance allows the new Christian to be exposed to older Christians who begin their indoctrination and conditioning.\n \n The new Christian is encouraged to attend classes and fraternize only with those who hold the same beliefs. Scripture is used to reinforced these ideas. The new Christian is then 'trained' in the ways of the Lord according to the beliefs of the particular church.\n \n There are many inherent problems with the \"prescription for salvation\" I have described above.\n http://www.anzwers.org/free/jesuschrist/why.html#three",

I think you are a perfect example of that.\n \n I do not see the constitution as any form of any \"god\". It is, however, whether you like it or not, the supreme secular law of the land. Your, or anyone else's religious views do not make them immune to it\n \n Would you prefer a government based strictly on religion? Whose religion? Roman Catholic with papal supremacy? Southern Baptist? Fred Phelps? Islam? Judism? Why, yours, of course!!! But suppose YOURS wasn't the most popular? Would you be happy being forced to practice some other religion?\n\n \n Well since Benjamin Franklin is your IDOL since he represents your god called the consitution you bow down and worship since it over-rules the laws of God, in your mind, then the only one you are fooling is yourself.\n \n Romans 6: 13 Neither present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as one living from the dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God. 14 For your sin shall not lord it over you, for you are not under law, but under grace. 15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Let it not be! 16 Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, you are slaves to whom you obey, whether of sin to death, or obedience to righteousness? \n \n BTW if you didn't know it but idol worshipers aren't entering the kingdom of heaven,either ( 1 Cor 6:9-11).\n \n Well correct me if I am wrong, but Christianity had it's roots in this country long before the constitution came into exisitence. And since God told Moses to establish kingdoms under God's laws then since Jesus was righteous and obedient to God, then He would have taught/practiced the same.\n \n Deut 17: 14 When you come into the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you, and have possessed it, and settled in it; and you shall say, Let me set a king over me like all the nations around me, 15 then you shall certainly set a king over you. You may not set an alien over you, one who is not your brother. 16 Only, he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to turn back to Egypt so as to multiply horses, since Jehovah has said to you, You shall not again return in this way any more. 17 And he shall not multiply wives to himself, and his heart shall not turn aside. And he shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. 18 And it shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law in a book, from before the priests, the Levites. 19 And it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear Jehovah your God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them; 20 so that his heart may not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he may not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or to the left; so that he may prolong his days over his kingdom, he and his sons in the midst of Israel.\n \n And look Jesus said to judge righteously . . . one the righteous can judge righteoulsy. \n \n John 7:24 Judge not by appearance but judge righteous judgment\n \n \n It would just seem out of character for Jesus, in whom God was well pleased, would tell his followers to set up any governement (righteous or unrighteous) they want by what ever, laws/morality they desired. . . .of course obviously that is the \"Jesus\" you preach (2 Cor11:4; Gal 1:8-9)\n \n http://img21.echo.cx/my.php?image=righteousmenjudgewithrighteous.jpg\n \n http://img209.echo.cx/my.php?image=whichformofgovernment0003za.jpg\n \n http://img183.echo.cx/my.php?image=pastorreptilesaysnorightgovern3.jpg",

He is known for\n the Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest known legal codes. The first stone of the Code depicts him receiving\n the law from the Babylonian Sun God.\n \n Moses (c. 1300s B.C.) Prophet, lawgiver and judge of the Israelites. Mosaic Law is based on the Torah, the\n first five books of the Old Testament. Moses is depicted in the frieze holding two overlapping tablets, written in\n Hebrew. Commandments six through ten are partially visible.\n \n Solomon (c. 900s B.C.) King of Israel and renowned judge. His name, meaning \"figure of the wise man,\" has\n become synonymous with \"judicial wisdom.\"\n \n Lycurgus (c. 800 B.C.) Legislator of Sparta. Lycurgus is credited with being one of the reformers of Sparta's\n constitution. He left Sparta after convincing the Spartan leadership not to change his laws until he returned,\n but he never did.\n \n Solon (c. 638-558 B.C.) Athenian lawgiver. He was appointed archon, an officer of state, and was charged\n with remodeling the Athenian constitution in 594 B.C. He was instrumental in codifying and reforming Athenian\n law, often revising the laws of Draco. His name has come to mean \"a wise and skillful lawgiver.\"\n \n Draco (c. 600s B.C.) One of Solon's legal predecessors in Athens. Around 620 B.C., he committed an Athenian\n code of laws to paper for the first time. His code included many strict penalties and death sentences, often for\n what seemed to be minor offenses. Thus, the word \"draconian,\" meaning harsh or cruel, is derived from his\n name.\n \n Confucius (551-478 B.C.) Chinese philosopher whose teachings stressed harmony, learning and virtue.\n Within 300 years of his death, the Chinese State adopted his teachings as the basis for government. Although\n officially abandoned by the Chinese government in 1912, Confucianism continues to have an influence\n throughout the world.\n \n Octavian (63 B.C.-14 A.D.) or Augustus. First Emperor of the Roman Empire. He brought widespread\n reforms to many facets of Roman life. He supported the concept of using previous opinions of leading jurists\n to aid in determining new disputes.\n The north wall frieze proceeds from right to left, starting with Philosophy:",

   "I should have made this post earlier in the thread, back when the discussion was of the founding fathers and why they are held in such high esteem. I believe I can adequately answer that question. Allow me to refer you to a quote by Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia, Query XVIII:\n \n \nIt is difficult to determine on the standard by which the manners of a nation may be tried, whether catholic, or particular. It is more difficult for a native to bring to that standard the manners of his own nation, familiarized to him by habit. There must doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of our people produced by the existence of slavery among us. The whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions, the most unremitting despotism on the one part, and degrading submissions on the other. Our children see this, and learn to imitate it; for man is an imitative animal. This quality is the germ of all education in him. From his cradle to his grave he is learning to do what he sees others do. If a parent could find no motive either in his philanthropy or his self-love, for restraining the intemperance of passion towards his slave, it should always be a sufficient one that his child is present. But generally it is not sufficient. The parent storms, the child looks on, catches the lineaments of wrath, puts on the same airs in the circle of smaller slaves, gives a loose to his worst of passions, and thus nursed, educated, and daily exercised in tyranny, cannot but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such circumstances. And with what execration should the statesman be loaded, who permitting one half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of the other, transforms those into despots, and these into enemies, destroys the morals of the one part, and the amor patriae of the other.\n\n \n I realize what is written here might be difficult to understand, so allow me to summarize it so that you may be able to read it again knowing what he means. Jefferson is questioning how slavery is allowed to exist, how United States citizens, believers in equality and freedom, have allowed slavery to continue. His conclusion is the existence of a society that accepts slavery. He states that our children saw slave masters, they saw their parents and their parents' friends. They learned through seeing this that slavery is acceptable; Jefferson lived in Virginia, a huge slaveholding state; he owned slaves himself; he saw it happen, children being raised to believe that slavery is an acceptable way to treat people, raised with a hatred for black people. Although Jefferson does not say it directly, it can be construed that the reason the north became so anti-slavery is that their parents never owned slaves, and they were not tainted by the opinion and actions of their parents in support of slavery. Jefferson says that if a slave-master cannot find it in his heart to show passion toward his slave, he should at least find that passion when his child is present, but the slavery owner usually does not.\n \n Jefferson goes on to say that our children learn to support slavery because they are raised in this society. \"The parent storms, the child looks on, catches lineaments of wrath, puts on the same airs in the circle of smaller slaves, gives a loose to his worst passions, and thus nursed, educated, and daily exercise in tyranny, cannot but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such circumstances.\" \n \n The man must be a prodigy. Jefferson and the other founding fathers understood that they themselves are not prodigies, that their own morality is limited by that which society has taught them, by the people society teaches them are bad. Because they understood this, they did not institute a government that took away the rights of those they disapproved of, they instituted a government that protected everyone's rights. They instituted a government that would allow society to change, that would allow slaves to eventually become free, that would allow women to eventually gain equal rights, and that would, I believe, eventually allow homosexuals to gain equal rights as well.\n \n The founding fathers of our nation were not great people because they held the best set of morals; they were great people because they didn't institute a system of government that would force their own morals upon other people. They didn't remove slavery, or give women the right to vote. But they institued a government where slavery would one day be removed and women would one day be granted the right to vote. They understood that promoting freedom and equality will lead to happiness. They understood that the morals their society taught them might be wrong, even if they didn't yet understand how or why.",

In compiling what has come to be called \"The Jefferson Bible,\" he sought to separate those ethical teachings from the religious dogma and other supernatural elements that are intermixed in the account provided by the four Gospels. He presented these teachings, along with the essential events of the life of Jesus, in one continuous narrative.\n \n This presentation of The Jefferson Bible offers the text as selected and arranged by Jefferson in two separate editions: one edition uses a revised King James Version of the biblical texts, corrected in accordance with the findings of modern scholarship; the second edition uses the original unrevised KJV. The actual verses of the Bible used for both editions are those chosen by Jefferson. Visitors should find the revised KJV text much easier to read and understand. Those seeking the precise English version Mr. Jefferson used when making his compilation can click on \"Unrevised KJV text.\"",

However, at that time people were more zealous for their religious beliefs. . . they picked up weapons for their beliefs and killed/kicked out the British. In fact, Jefferson was so \"brave\" in promoting his beliefs about denying the divinity of Jesus that it wasn't until after his death did the book finally get published.

It's funny how unbelievably removed that secularists of today are from people like Lincoln (though they don't know it) if they are willing to actually read the works and works about them and go a bit deeper than lobbyist websites and revisionist homepages of people on the internet trying to reinvent these men and remove any shred of religion from their legacy at all costs.\n \n \"That I am not a member of any Christian church is true; but I have never denied the truth of the Scriptures; and I have never spoken with intentional disrespect of religion in general, or of any denomination of Christians in particular....I do not think I could myself be brought to support a man for office whom I knew to be an open enemy of, or scoffer at, religion.\"\n \n \"It is the duty of nations as well as of men to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God, and to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon, and to recognize the sublime truth, announced in Holy Scripture, and proven by all history, that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord. \n \n \"Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us. It behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended power, to confess our national sins and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.\"\n \n \"In regard to this great book [Bible], I have but to say, it is the best gift God has given to men. All the good Savior gave to the world was communicated through this book. But for it we could not know right from wrong. All things most desirable for man's welfare, here and hereafter, are to be found portrayed in it.\"\n \n \"I invite the people of the United states (on Aug 6)... to invoke the influence of His Holy Spirit... to guide the counsels of the government with wisdom adequate to so great a national emergency, and to visit with tender care and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our land all those who, through the vicissitudes of marches, voyages, battles, and sieges have been brought to suffer in mind, body, or estate, and finally to lead the whole nation through the paths of repentance and submission to the Divine will back to the perfect enjoyment of union and internal peace.\" \n \n -- All by Abraham Lincoln",
