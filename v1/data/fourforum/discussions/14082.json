   "Christians claim that Jesus relieved them of the obligation to observe the 7th day of rest Sabbath. This understanding was not practiced by the first Christians and is contrary to scripture and is inconsistant with the themes presented in the Bible. \n \n Consider the following passages\n \n \nGe 2:2 - And on the seventh day Elohim ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.\n\n \n \nGe 2:3 - And Elohim blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which Elohim created and made.\n\n \n I was surprised at how many Christians seem to be unaware of these verses.

Obviously this is a day for man, as God would have no need to rest, but he does so as an example for man to follow.\n \n \nEx 31:16 - Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 17 - It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days YAHWEH made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.\n \n\n God doesn't say for a while or until such time he says forever.\n \n \nMk 2:27 - And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.\n\n \n is often used to support the Christian position, but to understand it like that breaks the pattern in the NT of Jesus' charge of the Pharisee being hypocrites and being more concerned with the process than the purpose of the law. \n \n I know there are other verses, but I will wait to address those as they are presented.",

   "Originally Posted by Easyrider : I don't have 3 years to go through it all. You can probably find a good deal of it on Google, typing in \"Thursday crucifixion.\"\n\n \n See my post above. This is a weak attempt to keep from having to admit there is an error in the Gospels.\n \n \nWho said I don't understand it - you? What the Sam Hill do you know? I understand it fine. I just don't want to spend days and weeks explaining something to a person who will just deny it anyway.\n \n \n I know that you can't admit you were wrong, nor it appears can you come up with a decent excuse or way to avoid the issue.\n \n Didn't I just say that to you? Show me I am wrong and I will admit it. I have been wrong before and come right out and said so. Can you say the same? \n \n \nJust like you deny the resurrection, which is confirmed in all four Gospels. So why should anyone spend an inordinate amount of time with you on something like this? You're not here to learn or receive the truth about Christ. You're here on your continuing effort to try to destroy the Gospel.\n\n \n You have the time to post a response completely off topic to a question I asked what a month ago maybe longer, but no time to back it up. It took me 1 minute to post 3 links to sites claiming scripture confirms their claim and refutes the other days. Is that the time you don't have?\n \n Why is showing that your following misunderstood doctrine trying to destroy the Gospels? If it's wrong how can following incorrectly be right? Would that not be in the realm of bearing false witness, being a false prophet even blasphemy just for starters?\n \n \nAnd I'm here to keep people like you honest.\n\n \n By all means do so, I have no problem with you making a case for a belief or offering a rebuttal to mine, but if it turns out your wrong then admit it and move on. What is the point of defending the error? At this point it's no longer a mistake, it's intentional.\n \n \nPappi, you're so far lost and so far out in left field that I doubt you will ever find your way home. \n \n You're probably better off taking up bowling or knitting or something, because you're just embarrassing yourself around here trying to diss Christ and Christianity. It ain't working for you. People, like you, have been trying the same thing for the past 2,000 years. They die and the Word of God lives on.\n\n \n Go scratch your cat or continue making your paper plane air force, the only one that should be embarrassed between the two of us isn't me. \n \n Good thing your not allowed to kill me or make laws preventing people from questioning or even reading the Bible. I realize those were effective ways to keep the faith strong, but hardly endorsed by Jesus.",

Whether it is a people issue or not is meaningless to the end result. That being the text has been added to, deleted, altered and misunderstood from the earliest records in existance to the most recently published editions. There is little desire to understand or even attempt to question existing concepts of what it should say and this was the primary method used to select the Canon, so the likelihood of it changing without compelling reason is pretty slim.\n \n \n \nAfter all, you're doing some of the very same thing in your posts. Anytime people adhere to a position of ideology (religious or not), there is the potential for being stubbornly dogmatic about it.\n\n \n \n I don't think your looking subjectivly. Being stubbornly dogmatic is not the same as defending a reasonable and/or verifable position. If I make a statement that at best can go either way I don't call it fact and ignore anything contrary. I may think one is more probable than the other, but still acknowledge it's only probable. That doesn't happen very often on the Christian side, at least in my experience.\n \n \nWhat's more important is that it really doesn't matter. Christianity doesn't owe you anything. If you don't like it, then don't become a Christian, but don't sit around and whine about them all the time either. After all, no one's holding a gun to your head trying to make you convert to any religion.\n \n \n What exactly do think the purpose of the forum is? Would you feel better about it if we argued about whether God was fantastic or just wonderful? \n \n A little naive in your thinking. If Christians would leave their religion at home a good portion of the opposition they face would cease, but since they are commanded to convert the rest of mankind that presents a problem for them and non-believers. You earlier suggested that religion and man are separate, but are they? How would you suggest opposing an ideology you don't think is right from being pushed on you? If they are right there is no need to argue, but if they are wrong why would it not be prudent to point that out? \n \n \nI get the impression sometimes that skeptics seem to think they are entitled to religion trying to constantly convince them. But that's not what religion is here for--if you don't want to buy into religion, then don't. But many do want to, and that's their business. \n\n \n I have no problem with somebody who wants to believe doing just that, but this is a debate forum. Sorry I get a little bored of hearing someone repeatedly bashing on gays or offering advice on why someone else's life isn't meaningful without Jesus. \n \n I am not telling anyone your belief is a lie, but I am pointing out that some of the things you belive are not based on fact. They then argue that it is. That is what happens here. You have been doing this long enough to know this. Is there a reason I should not be expressing my views in support or against statements posted?\n \n \nAs your posts exemplify, sometimes demands of critics of the Bible can be more literalist than those who accept the Bible. Again, much of Christianity has long come to grips with these issues you're rehashing; this is nothing new. \n \n \n So is my demand that if I am to be told in what manner I should think and behave that the reasons be based on fact unreasonable? If I point out something that is incorrect am I being to critical? Should I not object when I am told something untrue? \n \n Coming to grips does not mean to lie to oneself and others. It does not mean blindly accepting whatever someone says is fact. Again, you look to diminish my statement because why, it isn't something new enough to merit value? It has been addressed to your satisfaction, therefore it no longer is subject to question? What was the result that came about from Christians coming to grips with this? \n \n \nDo you really think many Christians haven't already thought about these matters and personally wrestled through them? Seriously, give people some credit! I think most everyone is well aware of what you are calling \"inconsistencies\"; it's really a matter of whether or not it's relevant in the grand scheme of things. \n \n \n Do you really think many Christians have already thought through these matters? To what end? There is still no clear concensus, and most don't know or don't care. All that is important is what they know and the the truth of what they know is meaningful if it supports what they know, but really isn't necessary. \n \n Why hide it or lie about it if it makes no difference in the big picture? Because that is what makes it a big deal. People want to impose the word of God on others, but have no problem changing the word of God to fit the needs. Then have the audacity to get upset when questioned about it.\n \n I use inconsistencies because I feel it a more respectful word than error, wrong, lie or BS and doesn't mean it is incorrect, but possess some reason that brings it's meaning into question. \n \n \nWhat you're doing is trying to get people to assume the bank robbery didn't even happen just because the 4 accounts of the robbery happen to have some differences.\n\n \n Really? That is what you got from what I wrote? Again I guess it would be better to just keep quite and agree that everything that Christians say is the truth or close enough. To be honest with you I could accept that, but only on one condition. The have to actually be right or at least have the decency to look at the basis for that truth objectively. \n \n Christians have not come to grips with the Bible, unless you mean the few who actually have looked have decided it's either right for the reasons believed or right just not for the reasons originally thought and anything contrary is anti-christian biased misinformation. \n \n When Christians stop pushing a belief system on those who don't agree to or accept their ideology and stop insisting that what amounts to an opinion, assumption or guess is fact, which is then used to justify their God given mandate to convert mankind, then these kind of disagreements will most likely not be much of a problem.",

   "If Passover (day of the crucifixion in the NT) is the 14th day of the Hebrew month (Leviticus 23), and The Feast of Firstfruits (Resurrection day for Jesus in the NT) is the 17th day of the Hebrew month, and if Jesus was resurrected on the 17th day (i.e. the first day of the week in the Gospel accounts), then you have to conclude it was a Thursday crucifixion.

The first occurrence of this word, shows that these \"Judahites\" represented the southern kingdom of Israel (the 2 tribes led by Judah), and they were fighting against Israel (the northern kingdom of 10 tribes led by Ephraim):\n \n 2Kings 16:6 & c.

The modern day Jews or Israelis (probably Kazars) are neither the Biblical Israelites nor Judahites of the OT.\n \n In the NT, the adjective \"Judahitish\" (Greek Ioudaios) which occurs over 190 times were mischievously rendered as \"Jew/s\" by corrupted Bibles/Babbles (Jew's tools = Devil's tools) like King James. According to Jesus Himself, these Judahitish people were offsprings of Cain (they were originally Edomites who married the daughters of the Canaanites), and that they are the children of Satan (John 8:44).

Anybody who would dare make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God.\n \n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with Him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all. \n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God? \n \n The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30, 31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead. \n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV).\n \n In another place He said, when asked for a sign, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spoke of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 21). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived. \n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection.

If that is all it takes then how about you be God on Tues and Sat and I will be God on Mon and Sun and Jesus can have the rest?\n \n \nThe high priest said to him, \"I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.\" \n \n \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. \"But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" - Matthew chapter 26\n\n \n Matthew wasn't there. How did he know what was asked and what was answered?\n \n \nNext, from John chapter 4:\n \n 25 The woman said, \"I know that Messiah\" (called Christ) \"is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.\" \n \n 26 Then Jesus declared, \"I who speak to you am he.\"\n \n Doesn't get any clearer than that.\n \n Not only that, BUT JESUS IS GOD!\n\n \n \n Again, How did John know what was said? He wasn't there. The disciples came at the end of the conversation.\n \n \n \nDid Jesus Claim to be God?\n \n Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case. \n \n Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said that he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen him (Jesus) has seen the Father (John 14:9). \n\n \n How come he doesn't mention the religious heads who were claimed to be God in human flesh? Why do Christians constantly misrepresent facts?\n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 14:9). \n \n The New Testament equated Jesus as the creator of the universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16, KJV), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God. \n \n \nNot only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies as well. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt on the part of the Jewish authorities. \n\n \n I would hope his friends would notice his claims, they paid attention to very little that he said while he was alive.\n \n \nWhen Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God\" (John 10:33, NASB). \n\n \n And the significance of claiming to be God is? \n \n \nThis fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings -- not the teacher -- are all-important. \n Confucianism is a set of teachings; Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Mohammed being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder. \n However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching mankind the truth; He claimed that He was the truth (John 14:6).\n\n \n I actually started to laugh as I read this. What Jesus says isn't what matters. What truth? If what he taught isn't important what is the point? Are we to just stare and think wow he is hot, but not in a gay way.\n \n \n \nWhat Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God? This was the claim He made for Himself.\n \n Suppose this very night the President of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\" \n\n \n According to the right he has.\n \n \nHe would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the Vice-President. Anybody who would dare make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God.\n\n \n Why are those the only choices? what about he was not telling the truth? Is that why what he says doesn't matter?\n \n \nThis is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with Him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all. \n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God? \n\n \n I agree \n \n \n \nThe Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30, 31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead. \n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV).\n\n \n But nobody knows if this was accurate since everyone forgot when it happened.\n \n \nIn another place He said, when asked for a sign, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spoke of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 21). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived. \n\n \n And those 7 other people who were raised from the dead in the Bible. \n \n \nAnyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection. Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God. \n\n \n \n Overwhelming does not require faith to be a fact. Overwhelming is a lie. What is so hard about just saying what it is? Nothing more nothing less.\n \n \nThis is an excerpt from the book, \"Answers to Tough Questions,\" by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart. \n\n \n Good thing honest isn't in the title.\n \n \nCome out of Sodom. Come out of Gomorrah. Flee from your folly!\n\n \n Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin",

   "\n \n \n Once again,\n \n http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/bib-docu.htm\n \n Stand to Reason: Is the New Testament Text Reliable?\n\n \n You show yourself to be a most willing example of a lamb being led to slaughter. The first link is a dead end, similiar to what you try to pass off as evidence. The second shows how misrepresentation is so easily spread and believed. Secure in your knowledge of being right you blindly accept whatever is given to you without regard to it's validity.\n \n Below are excerpts from the article that is the primary source of the article that you use as evidence.\n \n In recent years a small but growing number of New Testament scholars have been promoting what appears to be a return to the Textus Receptus, the Greek text that stands behind the New Testament of the King James Version......\n \n But the TR is hardly identical with the majority text, for the TR has numerous places where it is supported by few or no Greek manuscripts. ....\n \n Pickering also seems to embrace such a doctrine. For example in 1968 he argued that this doctrine is \"most important\" and \"what one believes does make a difference.\" 5 Further he linked the preservation of Scripture to the majority text in such a way that a denial of one necessarily entails a denial of the other: \"The doctrine of Divine Preservation of the New Testament Text depends upon the interpretation of the evidence which recognizes the Traditional Text to be the continuation of the autographa.\" 6 In other words, Pickering seems to be saying, \"If we reject the majority text view, we reject the doctrine of preservation.\" \n \n .....it must be stressed that as long as majority text advocates hold this view of preservation, no amount of evidence will convince them that reasoned eclecticism is right, because the majority text view is \"a statement of faith.\" 10 And as Pickering has so clearly articulated, this is not just a presupposition--it is a doctrine\n \n ...That the majority text proponents have held tenaciously to this doctrinal position--in spite of an ever-increasing mass of evidence--speaks highly of their piety and conviction. But nowhere do they explain why this view of preservation is the biblical doctrine. 12 At one point, for example, Pickering argues, \"I believe passages such as Isa. 40:8; Matt. 5:18 . . . John 10:35 [etc.] . . . can reasonably be taken to imply a promise that the Scriptures will be preserved for man's use (we are to live 'by every word of God').\" 13 But he gives no further argument, no exegesis. His one clear statement about preservation is this: \"God has preserved the text of the New Testament in a very pure form and it has been readily available to His followers in every age throughout 1900 years.\" 14 No proof text is given, just a bare statement. 15\n \n The present writer has several serious problems with this view of the doctrine of preservation, three of which are as follows. 16 First, Scripture does not state how God has preserved the text......\n \n Second, assuming that the majority text is the original, then this pure form of text has become available only since 1982. 18 The Textus Receptus differs from it in almost 2,000 places--and in fact has several readings that have \"never been found in any known Greek manuscript,\" and scores, perhaps hundreds, of readings that depend on only a handful of very late manuscripts. 19 Many of these passages are theologically significant texts. 20 Yet virtually no one had access to any other text from 1516 to 1881, a period of over 350 years. In light of this it is difficult to understand what Pickering means when he says that this pure text \"has been readily available to [God's] followers in every age throughout 1900 years.\" 21 Purity, it seems, has to be a relative term.\n \n Third, again assuming that the majority text is the original and that it has been readily available to Christians for 1,900 years, then it must have been readily available to Christians in Egypt in the first four centuries.....\n \n ...Among extant Greek manuscripts, what is today the majority text did not become a majority until the ninth century. In fact, as far as the extant witnesses reveal, the majority text did not exist in the first four centuries. Not only this, but for the letters of Paul, not even one majority text manuscript exists from before the ninth century. To embrace the majority text for the Pauline Epistles, then, requires an 800-year leap of faith. \n \n But textual critics do not usually give much weight to the church fathers. There are several reasons for this, some of which are as follows. First, when a church father quotes from the New Testament, it is not always possible to tell if he is quoting from memory or if he has a manuscript in front of him. Second, he rarely tells which book he is quoting from. He might say, \"as it is written,\" or \"just as Paul says,\" or \"our Lord said.\" Third, none of the original documents of any church fathers remains. Almost all the copies of these early patristic writers come from the Middle Ages.\n \n Final proof that the manuscripts known today do not accurately represent the state of affairs in earlier centuries comes from patristic references to variants once widely known but found today in only a few or even no witnesses. The \"longer ending\" of Mark, 16:9-20, today is found in a large majority of Greek manuscripts; yet according to Jerome, it \"is met with in only a few copies of the Gospel--almost all the codices of Greece being without this passage.\" Similarly, at Matthew 5:22 he notes that \"most of the ancient copies\" do not contain the qualification \"without cause\" . . . which, however, is found in the great majority today.\n \n ....Is the majority text identical with the original text? The present writer does not think so. There are no doctrinal reasons that compel him to believe that it is, and when all the evidence is weighed--both external and internal--it is quite compelling against such a view. Does this mean that the majority text is worthless? Not at all.\n \n \n The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical? | Bible.org - Largest Bible Study Site",

   "Jesus himself confirmed he was \"THE CHRIST\":\n \n The high priest said to him, \"I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.\" \n \n \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. \"But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" - Matthew chapter 26\n \n Next, from John chapter 4:\n \n 25 The woman said, \"I know that Messiah\" (called Christ) \"is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.\" \n \n 26 Then Jesus declared, \"I who speak to you am he.\"\n \n Doesn't get any clearer than that.\n \n Not only that, BUT JESUS IS GOD!\n \n Did Jesus Claim to be God?\n \n Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case. \n \n Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said that he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen him (Jesus) has seen the Father (John 14:9). \n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 14:9). \n \n The New Testament equated Jesus as the creator of the universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16, KJV), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God. \n \n Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies as well. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt on the part of the Jewish authorities. \n \n When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God\" (John 10:33, NASB). \n \n This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings -- not the teacher -- are all-important. \n \n Confucianism is a set of teachings; Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Mohammed being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder. \n However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching mankind the truth; He claimed that He was the truth (John 14:6). \n \n What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God? This was the claim He made for Himself.\n \n Suppose this very night the President of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\" \n \n He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the Vice-President. Anybody who would dare make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God.\n \n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with Him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all. \n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God? \n \n The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30, 31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead. \n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV).\n \n In another place He said, when asked for a sign, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spoke of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 21). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived. \n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection. Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God. \n \n This is an excerpt from the book, \"Answers to Tough Questions,\" by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart. \n \n \n Come out of Sodom. Come out of Gomorrah. Flee from your folly!\n\n \n You have a problem reading yah? That woman was a Samaritan, not a \"Jewish.\" Let me put it this way:\n \n 1) the noun, \"Jew\" (a one-syllable word) never occurred a single time in the Hebrew given texts of the Old Testament.\n \n 2) the noun, \"Jew\" (a one-syllable word) never occurred a single time in the Greek given texts of the New Testament.\n \n 3) the adjective, \"Jewish\" also never occurred a single time in the Hebrew given texts of the Old Testament.\n \n 4) the adjective, \"Jewish\" also never occurred a single time in the Greek given texts of the New Testament.\n \n 5) both the noun (Jew) and the adjective (Jewish) never occurred a single time in all older English translated Bibles, which include the King James 1611 Version. These words corruptedly crept into almost all the later versions of the English Bibles, and thus history was changed...\n \n Go find it out for yourself. Jesus was an outward Israelite (God's people) and a Judahite (Judah is only 1 of the 12 tribes of Israel, not counting Levi). Jesus was never a Jew and He was never a Jewish Messiah. \n \n The word, \"Jew\" derived from the religion, \"Judaism.\"\n \n When Jesus walked the earth, the Judahitish (this adjective is mischievously rendered as \"Jews\") people are, according to Jesus:\n \n 1) in the religion of Judaism (a degenerated religion of Moses), and/or\n 2) residents of Judea (the southern kingdom), and/or\n 3) Edomites/Cainannites, the children of the devil\n \n These people managed to get Jesus crucified with the charge:\n \n \"KING OF THE JUDAHITISH\" or rather \"HE SAYS HE IS THE KING OF THE JUDAHITISH.\"",

   ".... in 325 AD, the Council of Nicea set out to officially define the relationship of the Son to the Father, in response to the controversial teachings of Arius. Led by bishop Athanasius, the council established the doctrine of the Trinity as orthodoxy and condemned Arius' teaching that Christ was the first creation of God. The creed adopted by the council described Christ as \"God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance (homoousios) with the Father.\" 4\n \n Nicea did not end the controversy, however. Debate over how the creed (especially the phrase \"one substance\") ought to be interpreted continued to rage for decades. One group advocated the doctrine that Christ was a \"similar substance\" (homoiousios) as the Father. But for the most part, the issue of the Trinity was settled at Nicea and, by the fifth century, never again became a focus of serious controversy.\n \n Most post-Nicene theological discussion of the Trinity consisted of attempts to understand and explain such a unique concept. Gregory of Nyssa, in his treatise, That There are Not Three Gods, compared the divinity shared by the three persons of the Trinity to the common \"humanness,\" or human nature, that is shared by individual human beings. (Ironically, this initially promising explanation has been seen by some to yield a conclusion quite opposite than the title of his work.)\n\n http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/trinity\n \n Then, there is the Apostles Creed, supposedly derived from Matthew 28:19, but I suspect some editing was done in light of the Nicene Creed:\n \n I believe in God, the Father Almighty,\n Maker of heaven and earth,\n and in Jesus Christ,\n His only Son, our Lord:\n Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,\n born of the Virgin Mary,\n suffered under Pontius Pilate,\n was crucified, died, and was buried.\n He descended into hell.\n On the third day He rose again from the dead.\n He ascended into heaven\n and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,\n from there He shall come to judge the living and the dead.\n I believe in the Holy Spirit,\n the Holy Christian Church,\n the communion of saints,\n the forgiveness of sins,\n the resurrection of the body,\n and the life everlasting.\n Amen.",

It's obvious you've never read the Bible.\n \n What's more, you have your own miracles you have to believe in, such as the advent of the universe out of nothing and the incredible miracle of abiogenesis.\n \n On science&#8217;s attempts to explain / justify abiogenesis:\n \n &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any doubt that science, for the moment at least, is at a dead end. The optimism of the 1950&#8217;s is gone. The mood at the 1999 international conference on origin of life was described as grim &#8211; full of frustration, pessimism, and desperation. Nobody pretends that any alternative provides a reasonable path of how life went unguided from simple chemicals to proteins to basic life forms. &#8220;\n \n Quote by Walter L. Bradley, Ph.d., who received his B.S. in Engineering Science and his Ph.D. in Materials Science from the University of Texas in Austin. He taught as an Assistant and Associate Professor of Metallurgical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines before assuming a position as Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University (TAMU) in 1976. Dr. Bradley, also served as Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University and as Director of the Polymer Technology Center at TAMU. He currently serves as Distinguished Professor of Engineering at Baylor University. Designed or Designoid\n \n Klaus Dose, the biochemist who&#8217;s considered one of the foremost experts in this area, summed up the situation pretty well&#8221;:\n \n &#8220;More than thirty years of experimentation on the origin of life in the fields of chemical and molecular evolution have led to a better perception of the immensity of the problem of the origin of life on earth rather than to its solution. At present all discussions on principle theories and experiments in the field have either ended in stalemate or in a confession of ignorance.&#8221;\n \n Fred Hoyle was one of Britain&#8217;s best-known mathematicians and astronomers in the last half of the 20th century. He spent decades searching for answers to questions of the origins of life and the origin and age of the universe. In his 1981 book Evolution from Space (co-authored with Chandra Wickramasinghe), he calculated that the chance of obtaining the required set of enzymes for even the simplest living cell was one in 1040,000 (one followed by 40,000 zeroes). Since the number of atoms in the known universe is infinitesimally tiny by comparison (1080), even a whole universe full of primordial soup wouldn&#8217;t have a chance. \n \n Hoyle explained this in his typically lucid manner, and as with the &#8216;big bang,&#8217; his turns of phrase have found their way into popular culture. For instance, he wrote, &#8216;The notion that not only the biopolymer but the operating program of a living cell could be arrived at by chance in a primordial organic soup here on the Earth is evidently nonsense of a high order.&#8217;5 Hoyle originated the famous illustration comparing the random emergence of even the simplest cell to the likelihood that &#8216;a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein.\n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v15/i3/hoyle.asp\n \n  OH YE OF GREAT FAITH!!!!\n \n ROTFLOL!",

Jesus Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit yet he ALWAYS addressed God (YaHWeH) as his Father. How come Jesus NEVER (NOT EVEN ONCE) addressed the so-called \"The Holy Spirit\" as his Father huh?
