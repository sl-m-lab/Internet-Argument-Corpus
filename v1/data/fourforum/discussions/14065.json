   "Gas Line Cut at Perriello Family Home\n Posted: Mar 24, 2010 10:48 AM PDT Updated: Mar 24, 2010 11:22 AM PDT \n The FBI, along with Albemarle County's Fire Marshal, are investigating a cut gas line in the Peacock Hills section of Ivy. The home is owned by the brother of Congressman Tom Perriello (D).\n \n \"While officials are not willing to characterize the exact nature of the incident because of the ongoing investigation, it did not involve an immediate threat to occupants of the residence,\" says county spokesperson Lee Catlin in a statement to NBC29.\n \n The incident comes just hours after a Danville Tea Party activist mistakenly posted the brother's addresses as being the home of Congressman Perriello. The Danville Register Bee reports the activist, Nigel Coleman, believed it was the address of the congressman and posted it on a Facebook page, inviting people to \"drop by\" to \"express their thanks\" on the Congressman's vote on heath care reform.\n\n Gas Line Cut at Perriello Family Home - NBC29\n \n Look! You Right Wing Thugs!\n \n This is America!\n \n Not Nazi Germany of the last century!",
