I think 16 to 18 is reasonable, depending on the education they get from their parents. Too many parents are unable to talk to their children about this. They leave it up to the education system, and the children's peers. In the U.S., I think probably too much is influenced by the MTV music videos, rather than parents. \n \n I had one 15 year old come to me with tons of very intimate and personal questions, because her mother flipped out anytime the subject was even approched.

In this respect, I feel the popular opinion that the bodies (who reach maturity in the teens) are overtaking the maturity of mind (who reach maturity in the twenties) is wrong. \n \n It's rather our society going against our nature. We delay childbirth to late periods in order for the parents to be ready to provide for the child, but insofar as our bodies are concerned, this is pure nonsense. The pregnancies are harder to achieve and they are more risky to both the child and the mother. And, of course, we get to the problem of trying to keep our young from obeying their bodies' impulses.\n \n As things are, I think society should rethink the whole issue and somehow allow reproduction in the best childbearing period while still ensuring quality parenting and allowing the young parents to build up a career. I don't have a concrete proposal for this yet, but a society wide system of child care seems to be indicated (btw, it seems that a good system of child care, which lessens the burden on the parents is a good way to help encourage people to have children, a problem quite present in Europe).\n \n In the legal sense, I see no reason to make the age an absolute in the sense it is used currently.

First you figure for a girl at that age while they may mature physically faster....they usually live in the romantic fantasy land of true love out of cheesey romance novels. Girls are also easily manipulated into situations at younger ages due to lack of experience and pressure. Guys on the other hand are always rearing to go, but for a say a 30 year old guy to convince a 16 year old girl to engage in sexual activity...there is just something wrong. Now as I get older, 19, I understand what they mean by robbing the cradle. Girls are still innocent, at least where I'm from, at the ages of 14-15. \n \n So overall I don't know.

Most of the time it's down to experience. People who are 20 and new drivers are just as likely to reck as new drivers at 16. If we raised the age to 30, people would probably be more cautious, but I don't think that's going to happen.\n \n On the part of harder driving tests, I walked into the DMV and got my learner's permit without knowing anything other than riding with my parents. A standout question was \"If the light is green, but a police officer is in the road telling you to stop, what do you do?\" I got all of them correct, although you only need to get 17/20. At this stage they expect parents to be responsible and help the kid learn to drive, but I heard stories about parents who literally just took their kids to the highway to \"get the feel\" of driving. I can't imagine that, I was terrified my first drive around my neighborhood. And it's just a cul-de-sac.\n \n But back to the age of consent for sex. I think 18 is fine, but a law like that isn't going to really do much. You can't stop kids from having relationships, and I don't think 2 teenage kids, even if they are under 18, are going to care about the law about having sex. I think they usually let those slide anyway. Isn't the age of consent generally for people over 18 having sex with people under 18? I guess I can agree with the age of consent being 18.",

When one&#8217;s parents are legally liable for you, you cannot do these things, including have sex with whomever you wish.

Why should the two ages not coincide with the age of adulthood (legally liable for ones self)?\n\n \n Being legally liable for yourself happens in at least two steps. The first step is when the parents loose legal responsibility for the child`s actions. That is, the child becomes legally responsible for any illegal actions she or he may undertake. I don`t know the correct term in english, but I`m quite certain you have something like this since even people under 18 that commits a capital crime can be sentanced to death in certain states (or at least the US refuses to sign any international agreement that bans these kind of things).\n \n the other step is when you turn 18 and become a fully fledged citizen with all rights and responsibilities as an adult.\n \n I would claim that the age of consent for sex should coincide with the first step. I don`t see why not. Just as I believe that voting rights should be given at this age as well.\n \n \nThere is such a thing as responsible drinking, however.

Bah.\n \n\n \n It is not only about limits. It`s about damaging yourself. Alcohol is always damaging if you drink \"enough\". The younger the body, the more damaging and the easier you develop an addiction. Now, grated one could claim that it`s okay if young people drink \"a little\". The problem with this is that they don`t drink \"a little\", at least not in my country. \n \n \nSince you believe drinking is so much worse than unsafe sex, perhaps you should switch from teaching responsible sex to teaching responsible drinking.

What age these occur at is irrelevant, I was asking why they are separated. In addition, why this second step at 18? If one is considered responsible enough for sex, voting, etc, earlier there is no need for this second step at 18 imo. If you have this \"incremental responsibility\", then voting and drinking should come before sex. Yes, sex can be harmless, but, especially if you are male, you can harm the other party with unsafe sex. Drinking only harms yourself, and thus sex has more responsibility attached.

If one is mature enough to handle the emotional turmoil that occurs in relationships and especially when a sexual relationship is involved, one should be mature enough to sign contracts and live on ones own as well as other adult decisions. Sex has some pretty heafty potential consequences that can affect the rest of a person's life.

However, I doubt you could say that having a sexual relationship does not have emotional ties involved. Teenage girls would obviously have higher levels of academic achievement if they are abstinent. Less depression and emotional turmoil due to relationship problems if they are abstinent, as well as less domestic or partner abuse. Young people are not as emotionally mature as they would be if they were older and become more emotionally invested, especially if there is a sexual relationship.\n \n There is a distinct relationships between cervical cancer and having sex at a younger age. The National Cancer Institute lists risk factors, which does include an early age of intercourse. There is also a relationship between sex and sexual abuse and between sex and exploitation for sex (obviously :P).\n \n \n\n I don`t know how it works in the states, but we where taught \"responsible drinking\" at school...

While I don't think the age of consent is too young, it gets a little creepy in certain situations (14 year olds aren't children).\n \n The other laws as follows are you must be 15 (16 in some places) to drive, although children as young as 7 can drive farm vehicles and tractors. The age for drinking is 18 though many consider this excessively over protective and most people start drinking a few years before their teens (10 or so).\n \n I think Canada generally gives it's citizens more responsibility. I know of some 14 year old kids who are wards of the government and get a pay cheque every month as long as they continue going to school and live on their own. They do quite well.\n \n The concept of childhood itself is relatively new.... as late as the Edwardian era (even later, actually) children were considered to be tiny adults, but adult all the same. Children fought and died in wars (world war 1, the Russian Revolution, etc), started families at 10 and 11, worked hard and died young.\n \n Now we have 13 year olds who have no idea how to operate washing machines, or 3 and 4 year olds being PUSHED in strollers (and they don't have cancer or broken legs, they are just being coddled). \n \n Abortion is also provided to young teens without parental consent, but because Canada generally starts it's sex ed years before puberty (I remember being shown a model of a penis and shown how to put a condom on in school when I was about 7) the kids generally don't have as many abortions because they aren't misinformed, and because free condoms and spermicide are aviaible in virtually all school clinics and free clinics.\n \n I wonder if the pro life people also encourage the distribution of condoms and norplant implants and birth control pills. Probably not. Remove the problem and what would they have to complain about?

Without reproduction why wouldn't teen-aged sex, currently in place, be regarded as a normal circumstance rather than irresponsibility? \n \n As to adequate education not instilling a level of responsibility capable of avoiding reproduction through contraception, that's similar to stating pre-teens can't learn to not play in traffic or jump into a swimming pool without the training to swim. \n \n Unless you state otherwise, it sounds like your dislike of teen sex is based on \n a personal moral standard, not facts.",

It is the lack of nature and the lack of life experience.\n \n \nAs to adequate education not instilling a level of responsibility capable of avoiding reproduction through contraception,\nLike I said, the consequences of teenage sex is not just pregnancy.

When they do, those who are old enough to handle the consequences should be mature enough to have sex. Those that can't handle the consequences shouldn't be playing with fire.",

However, there is precious little that you have in the way of wisdom. Wisdom comes only with age and experience. It comes from having screwed up when we did not listen to those older than us. I would also say that you would be hard pressed to show that you are actually better educated than many here. \n \n The simple fact that a kid states that he is going to have sex and there is nothing we (adults) can do about it and therefore should just forget about it, is an indication of how unwise you really are.\n \n There are essentially two ways to learn things. 1) Listen to those who have experienced it, 2) experience it for yourself.\n \n I am more and more amazed at how little I really know. Saying that you know more at your age than I did at your age is one heck of a stretch of your imagination especially given that you have no idea about me or where I came from or when. To say that also does not mean that you know more, just that you knew more than I did when I was that age. That is really irrelevant and to base the argument that adults should just quit trying on that fact is very poor argumentation.\n \n Now, I am not saying you know nothing or that you are incompetent. Far from it. I am simply saying that if you choose to trust your own thinking over that of a well experienced adult, you are making a foolish choice.\n \n EF",

That is your choice, but don't try to say it is victimless or pointless to make a crime.\n \n EF\n \n Studies below.\n \n \n \nGene May Interact with Teenage Marijuana Use to Increase Psychosis Risk\n Starting to use marijuana as a teenager and having a particular gene associated with higher risk for schizophrenia may put some people at increased risk for developing psychotic disorders. The gene for the catecho-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, which breaks down the brain chemical dopamine, comes in two versions, met and val, the latter being associated with slightly higher risk for schizophrenia. People inherit two copies (one from each parent) of the COMT gene, so a person can have two of the same version or one of each. Drs. Terrie Moffitt, Avshalom Caspi, and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin have been following more than 800 New Zealanders from birth into adulthood to identify risk factors for mental disorders. In this sample, val, by itself, did not increase risk for schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders, nor did adult onset marijuana use. Yet, a significant relationship emerged when a person carried two copies of val and began smoking marijuana as a teen - a factor that also independently increased risk for psychosis in this population. Carrying two copies of the met version posed no increased risk for psychosis. The results suggest that for some people, adolescence may be a \"sensitive period of neurobiological vulnerability to cannabis,\" but marijuana use, even in combination with val, does not constitute a major cause of schizophrenia. People with two copies of val who used the drug as teens accounted for only one-fifth of those who developed psychotic disorders, which likely stem from multiple causes. However, the researchers point out that unless such potential gene-environment interactions are factored into studies, a gene's connection to a disorder may remain undetected.\n \n Caspi A, Moffitt TE, Cannon M, McClay J, Murray R, Harrington H, Taylor A, Arseneault L, Williams B, Braithwaite A, Poulton R, Craig IW. Moderation of the effect of adolescent-onset cannabis use on adult psychosis by a functional polymorphism in the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene: longitudinal evidence of a gene X environment interaction. Biol Psychiatry. 2005 May 15;57(10):1117-27.\n \n \n\n \n \nHow Are Mental Disorders and Violence Related? Much of the stigma attached to mental\n illness stems from perceptions that persons with a mental illness have an unpredictable and\n indiscriminate propensity for violent behavior. In fact, the majority of individuals with a mental\n disorder are not violent or ever convicted of a violent crime; conversely, the vast majority of\n convicted offenders have no history of a psychiatric disorder. NIMH-funded investigators\n examined data on 961 young adults born in New Zealand in 1972-73; purposely, the researchers\n did not predetermine whether persons in the study sample had ever had contact with either the\n health or justice systems. The data revealed that young adults who met diagnostic criteria for\n alcohol dependence, marijuana dependence, and schizophrenia-related disorders were 1.9, 3.8,\n and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely than control subjects to be violent, with violence\n measured by self-reports of criminal offending and a search of official conviction records. http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/cj.pdf\n\n \n \nConcurrent Validity:\n For American Indian youths, individuals considered at high risk for suicide (because they\n reported a suicide attempt within the last year and current suicidal ideation, or a history of\n multiple attempts) differed from youths at low-risk in several respects (Blum et al., 1992). The\n high-risk youths more often had a family member who tried suicide, or a friend who completed\n suicide, more often had been physically or sexually abused, more often were involved with\n heavy drinking and at least weekly marijuana use, and were more likely to have been pregnant,\n or to have caused a pregnancy (Blum et al., 1992) http://www.nimh.nih.gov/suicideresearch/measures.pdf\n",

   "here is a summary of another one:\n \n \nFrom the Director\n In the 1970s, the baby boom generation was coming of age, and its drug of choice was marijuana. By 1979, more than 60 percent of 12th-graders had tried marijuana at least once in their lives. From this peak, the percentage of 12th-graders who had ever used marijuana decreased for more than a decade, dropping to a low of 33 percent in 1992. However, in 1993, first-time marijuana use by 12th-graders was on the upswing, reaching 50 percent by 1997. Although the percentage of 12th-graders who have experience with marijuana has remained roughly level since then, there is still reason to be concerned.1 In 2002, an estimated 2.6 million Americans used marijuana for the first time. Roughly two-thirds of them were under age 18.2 Furthermore, the marijuana that is available today can be 5 times more potent than the marijuana of the 1970s.3\n \n The use of marijuana can produce adverse physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral changes, and - contrary to popular belief - it can be addictive. Marijuana smoke, like cigarette smoke, can harm the lungs.4,5,6 The use of marijuana can impair short-term memory,7,8 verbal skills,9 and judgment10 and distort perception.11,12 It also may weaken the immune system13,14,15,16 and possibly increase a user's likelihood of developing cancer.14,17 Finally, the increasing use of marijuana by very young teens may have a profoundly negative effect upon their development.9, 18, 19,20\n \n We hope that this research report will help make readers aware of our current knowledge of marijuana abuse and its harmful effects.\n \n Nora D. Volkow, M.D.\n Director\n National Institute on Drug Abuse\n \n http://www.nida.nih.gov/ResearchReports/Marijuana/default.html\n\n \n All of these things can hurt the person engaging, their family and friends. ardly victimless.\n \n Now enough about pot. We are talking about underage sex. I think I could easily show the same victimization happens (different reasons but still victims) where that is concerned.\n \n EF\n \n EF",

It will not defend anyone against its specific agenda even though their civil rights are being violated. \n \n \nUnresolved Problems Segment\n ACLU & NAMBLA\n Guest: Attorney Wendy Murphy \n The American Civil Liberties Union is defending the North American Man Boy Love Association, the group that promotes sex between men and young boys. Attorney and child advocate Wendy Murphy explained why she refers to the organization as the American \"Criminals\" Liberties Union. \"When we start talking about crime the ACLU loses all common sense, and they really do stand up for sex offenders against the interest of little kids. In state after state the ACLU has filed suit to block sex offender registries. They spend a ton of money and resources trying to insulate sex offenders from stigma and shame.\" The Factor cited one case that exemplifies the ACLU's radicalism. \"In Kansas a 14-year old handicapped boy was molested by an 18-year old boy in a group home, and the ACLU argued that a 14-year old has a Constitutional right to engage in sex with adults.\" \n \n\n \n \nACLU And The Second Amendment\n by Jay on 08-04-05 @ 12:00 am Filed under 2nd Amendment \n One would think that an organization that claims it's purpose is to protect our Constitutional rights would readily defend our second amendment. Sadly, this is not the case. The ACLU is completely absent in defending this right, and while it has not become active in fighting it, its policy clearly shows why they don't defend it....they don't believe in it!\n ACLU POLICY \"The ACLU agrees with the Supreme Court's long-standing interpretation of the Second Amendment [as set forth in the 1939 case, U.S. v. Miller] that the individual's right to bear arms applies only to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia. Except for lawful police and military purposes, the possession of weapons by individuals is not constitutionally protected. Therefore, there is no constitutional impediment to the regulation of firearms.\" -Policy #47\n \n\n \n \nIn August of 2005 the New York ACLU sued against random bag searches on the NY Subway. Ironically the NYCLU HQ has a sign warning visitors that all bags are subject to search.\n \n\n \n \nThe group's new data collection practices were implemented without the board's approval or knowledge and were in violation of the ACLU's privacy policy at the time, according to Michael Meyers, vice president of the organization and a frequent internal critic. He said he had learned about the new research by accident Nov. 7 during a meeting of the committee that is organizing the group's Biennial Conference in July. \n \n He objected to the practices, and the next day, the privacy policy on the group's Web site was changed. \"They took out all the language that would show that they were violating their own policy,\" Meyers said. \"In doing so, they sanctified their procedure while still keeping it secret.\"\n\n \n \n\"Hence, the reluctance of the ACLU to defend principle, that is, the exercise of First amendment rights by anti-abortion activists. Ironically, real fascists-like the American Nazis and Klansmen-have had their rights protected more often and with greater vigor by the ACLU than anti-abortion demonstrators.Twilight of Liberty\n\n \n I guess I am saying, give me a break and give me a real argument.

Its not the government's choice whether to put a victimless \"criminal\" in jail. Again I state what does it accomplish?\n \n Shooter",

   "For the most part I agree with you. The texas law is a bit odd but then again so is the law (in Kentucky I believe) that requires a horseless carriage to have someone walking in front of it waving a lantern. Hardly enforceable.\n \n Underage sex however is a different issue. I work in the disabilities field. I see far too many teenage parents who USED protection and gave birth to a child with a disability and now their lives are truly stressed. The law is there to protect the children. We do them no favors by condoning such behavior. We should not condemn them, but make it illeagal. There are lots of possibilites for those underage. Not always are they tried as adults. More often than not, their records are sealed as juveniles. It does not follow them in the manner you propose.\n \n EF\n\n \n Yet it will be abused, just like any other law. There is no way to be sure of what you said, and most likely what College Girl said would be true. It seems that you do not take into account human nature. How do you think you will be protecting that pregnant girl by putting her and her boyfriend in prison? That sounds stupid and foolish to me. There already are consequenses for having sex, so why criminalize it? Honestly, what kids do is their and their parents buisness. Not yours or the governments, and you have to right to put them in jail. There are other ways to help our kids other than imprisoning them. We must keep birth control and \"morning after\" pills always available over the counter. We must keep abortion legal and completely confidential, and we should also educate our kids on this matter. But Imprisoning our youth sounds like a foolish and ill thought out solution.\n \n Shooter",
