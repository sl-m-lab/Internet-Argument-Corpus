   "We can't destroy the mountain of good to simply punish the bad. No mater how you feel about the Roman Catholic Church and its teachings, we all can agree there are a high number of good people in it. The church in California has filed Chapter 11 and its under a massive financial obligation at the moment. The weight of the lawsuits will harm more than the guilty. \n \n We can't simply toss out the good with the bad. If we do that, we're no better than what was fought to begin with. Someone must heal the wounds of the debilitated and save the structure for the humble. If we don't, we will have raped those that seek their spiritual needs there, as surely as those that raped those innocent young people.\n \n Its open game to attack the attackers, that demand a state and your liberty. Its never good to attack the humble that do not force or bind anyone and only live in humility. There is good everywhere, and those of us that are awake, are duty bound to defend them. Freedom isn't a hollow word that only makes a case for the prefect or even the truth. Clearly..",

So don't have any large buildings if you don't have any money because you screwed up royally and have to now pay through the nose. Hold services in the Elks lodge or parking lot. You don't need buildings. \n \n Grandma won't suffer by not having a fancy church or if the priests don't take vacations and MAYBE Grandma will take notice and care about how her contributions are being utililized and demand more accountability in the future. \n \n Look, if you are not debating the guilt of these criminals then there no justification for mitigating the punishment of the guilty or remuneration of the victims. Ends justifying means is what caused this problem. \n \n I think you may be mistaken if you really believe that most clergy believe what they say.

They take the bullet when they are at fault - in some cases, criminals. Who else should take the blame for the behavior of priests? The nuns? And you are wrong anyway. The members love their local priest even if they hate the higher echelons. They make no demands locally while tut-tut the higher level chicanery. That is why there is a problem. Nobody said anything. \n \n No one is taking a congregation/family away from the priest or anything - I am talking about material posessions, something a priest has forsworn anyway. The hierarchy maybe ought to share the burden but they clearly are not. \n \n No priest would suffer from a less wealthy church. \n No congregant would suffer from a less wealthy church. \n A church does not need wealth or things. If it is worth anything at all, it can be very poor and keep itself spiritually rich. If the members like, they can give and make the church rich again. \n \n The church preaches forgiveness and confession, you say? In this case they are all for forgiving themselves even with nobody confessing. \n \n They deserve to be financially wiped out if that happens when restitution is paid.",
