   "The difference between the U.K. and the U.S. is that in the U.K., owning firearms is considered a priviledge, not a right.\n \n Yet, it doesn't matter. Either way, once you give it up, it is most likely gone forever.\n \n The purpose of government is to control. Any time a government is given the opportunity to place restrictions and remove freedoms, it will usually do so in the name of \"safety\" or \"protection\". Once these freedoms are removed, it is easier to CONTROL and maintain power over those the freedoms are removed from. \n \n Once control is established, why in the world should a government, a company, a person, or any other entity for that matter willingly surrender that control? There is no reason. \n \n So, once a freedom is removed, it is highly unlikely it will ever be reinstated unless there is a significant benefit to the power reinstating it.\n \n I'm afraid if the English want their guns back, they will have to violently revolt.....er.....wait......I guess they've surrendered the means to effectively do that.\n \n Oh, well Brits. Kiss your guns goodbye forever. I sure hope you trust your government to remain eternally benevolent. Although, you don't have much choice. If they declared marshal law tomorrow, you could probably resist the storm troopers......with a knife or something.",

   "Can you expand on that? When was the Constitution circumvented regarding gun control? (Mind you, I'm not saying it hasn't been...I just want to know the particulars behind your claim.)\n\n \n Our nation was founded by guys who fought a civil war against the government that tried to seize their weapons. They protested tax hikes and unfair taxation and lack of representation, but when the government tried to seize their weapons, they started shooting. \n \n What were they trying to seize? The arsenals at Lexington and Concord did not contain fowling pieces, rifles, and muzzles. It held cannons, artillery pieces, and thousands of pounds of powder for them. The potential sporting uses for such weapons are non existent, and they were not community owned...they were the personal property of individuals who opted to store them in the community arsenal because frankly storing a few thousands lbs of black powder in your basement is not advisable. \n \n Even the small arms they tried to seize were not the weapons used for hunting. They were, at the time, fearsom military rifles. Most were not accurate enough for hunting, but they could be loaded without wadding or ramming the load. You fired them, ran a patch down the barrel to ensure there was no burnign powder left (which would make the next part exciting), poured in your powder, tapped the butt on the ground to settle the powder, dropped in the ball, tapped it again, and fired. During a time where most weapons required a patched round, the firing rates you could achieve with a weapon like that was very nearly incomprehensible. They were the M-16 of their day. \n \n The guys who wrote the second amendment and later sold it to the American people...THAT is what they were trying to protect for us...the right to own artillery pieces and guns that were, at the time, referred to as \"death machines\" by those who opposed them (there have always been anti gunners). \n \n I point all this out to remind people that the second amendment is not about hunting or target shooting. It is only marginally connected to home defense and probably has nothing at all to do with concealed carry. The second amendment is about blowing your fellow man to hell if it becomes necessary. It is about defending the nation from both foreign enemies and, if necessary, from its government. \n \n Examples of unconstitutional infringement?? Easy:\n \n 1. NFA\n 2. GOPA\n 3. Brady bill\n 4. Import ban (arguably)\n \n \n Those are the easy ones.\n \n If anybody would like to argue that any of those ARE constitutional, start a new thread. I would be happy to argue it.",
