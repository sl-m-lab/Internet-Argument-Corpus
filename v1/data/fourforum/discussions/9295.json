   "We have a bird feeder in our yard that attracts a variety of birds. Recently, those birds seem to have attracted raptors. Several days ago we found the remains, mostly feathers, of a Eurasian collared dove. We suspected our cat, although she usually brings her catches into the house (pet door) and we always have a dead bird rather than feathers. And then we saw this guy/gal sitting on the fence one day. We suspect that this is the culprit in the case of the collared dove. Today, I was looking out the window and saw this bird swoop down after a sparrow. It missed and then perched on the fence, where I took its picture.\n 253\n The fence picket is 6\" wide, so this is a bird of considerable size. At first I thought that it might be a young Red Shouldered Hawk, but the color isn't right. After some research, I have come to believe that this is a maturing Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii). It has the breast streaks of a young Cooper's and is well on its way to develop the coloration about the head.\n \n But this one is a puzzler.\n 252\n The closest thing I could find is a Northern Goshawk. The problem is the head coloration and the \"Northern\" in the name of the bird. They just aren't found this far south. It doesnt resemble the most common hawks around here (Red Shouldered Hawks and Red Tailed Hawks). I have no idea what it might be. I took the picture last year. It was, no doubt, also attracted by the plethora of birds in my yard.\n \n I first began birding when I was in college. I took a course in ornithology and found that it was quite interesting and entertaining. After college, I lapsed into the more common state of inattention. Recently I retired and have again taken an interest in the winged beauty around me, especially when taking my dog for walks. It is amazing to walk through grass and have swallows swoop by within a foot as they go after the insects that are kicked up. My bird list since I retired is now at 68, 69 if the first picture is a Cooper's Hawk, and 70 if someone can help me with the other hawk.",
