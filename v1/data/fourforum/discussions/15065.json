   "Here I was losing hope that Mark Warner was a good senator after he voted for the awful health care bill when out of left field he supports the recommendations by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform that Obama put together. \n \n I've long said that this is the best plan out there that I've seen (other than my own of course) and it should be passed immediately. \n \n This is not to say it is enough but until Rand Paul is taken seriously and he takes defense cuts seriously we have no other options. \n \n Below is an email I got today from Senator Warner. \n \n \nFriends,\n \n With all of today's talk about short-term spending resolutions, congressional gridlock and even the possibility of a government shutdown, you might think we have lost the opportunity for serious action on our longer-range deficits and debt. I am convinced, however, that our country is at a critically important moment: we have to seize this opportunity to get our fiscal house in order for the long term. I want to keep you informed about my efforts to create a bipartisan deficit reduction plan that makes tough decisions in order to fix our nation's balance sheet.\n Since last summer, this has been one of my top priorities, and I've been partnering with my Republican colleague Saxby Chambliss of Georgia. Right now, we are working with our colleagues to try to turn the recommendations [pdf] of the President's bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform into legislation. Our current national debt stands at more than $14 trillion. If adopted in full, these recommendations would gradually reduce the debt by $4 trillion over the next ten years.\n \n Unfortunately, the current debate is centered around deep cuts in domestic discretionary spending, which only makes-up about 12% of the overall federal budget. The simple fact is, drastic and even painful cuts to these programs alone will not fix our structural budget problems.\n \n That's why Senator Chambliss and I have been working with a growing number of our Senate colleagues to address these fiscal challenges in a more comprehensive and responsible way. We must work together to control government spending, simplify our tax code, and eliminate our deficit. That is the only way we will fix our nation's balance sheet over the long term.\n \n Our \"quiet but determined effort,\" according to Judy Woodruff of the PBS NewsHour, may have been largely overlooked. But New York Times columnist David Brooks says our bipartisan initiative certainly should not be underestimated. The Washington Post concluded that it fills \"a vacuum of leadership\" in Washington. Last week, our deficit reduction initiative got some attention on National Public Radio's Morning Edition, and earlier this week the Wall Street Journal gave us credit for trying to forge this bipartisan consensus.\n \n The deficit commission's recommendations, while far from perfect, represent a courageous first step in tackling our national debt in ways that will make our nation competitive for the 21st century:\n \n * The commission laid out a plan to accelerate healthcare savings in Medicare and Medicaid, and it provides a responsible roadmap to strengthen Social Security for the next 75 years. The commission's plan protects Social Security, and does not use Social Security funds to balance the budget.\n * It dramatically simplifies a tax system in serious need of an overhaul. It proposes closing loopholes and phasing out some deductions while lowering overall tax rates for individuals and corporations. \n * It puts everything on the table, including entitlement programs and defense spending. We believe that this has to be part of the discussion, too. \n \n As you might imagine, various political opponents and special interests already are mobilizing to short-circuit our work on this legislation, which demonstrates why this is such a difficult challenge. It also shows why Washington's typical political response has always been to kick this can down the road, and push the tough choices to another day:\n \n * But these choices do not get any easier simply by delaying action. Every day that we put off these difficult decisions, an average $4 billion is added to the national debt.\n * Every dollar that we spend simply paying the interest on our nation's staggering debt is disappearing into a fiscal sinkhole. These are resources that cannot be targeted toward creating jobs, expanding the U.S. economy or addressing any of our other shared priorities. \n \n While there are plenty of recommendations in the commission's plan that I would not have chosen, this much is crystal clear to me and the other members of our bipartisan coalition: we simply cannot postpone this difficult discussion any longer. \n \n If you agree that our nation will be far better off with a comprehensive deficit reduction plan than without one, please share this message with a friend, post to your Facebook page, or link to our website.\n \n I promise to keep you informed on our progress, and I thank you for your time.\n \n Best,\n Mark Warner\n\n \n The title of the email \"A grown-up discussion about deficits\". I didn't know Daewoo was my senator :p",

   "I am not sure how I missed this post. \n \n I have actually been thinking a lot about this lately. The republicans just passed their 2 week extension to the budget. It includes $4 billion in cuts. They are still pushing for another $57 billion in cuts when they 2 weeks is up.\n \n What is making these cuts so difficult is that there is really no short term benefit to them. Government spending is generally non productive, so typically cutting government spending would free up capital to put to work in other parts of the economy. When it is deficit spending, ESPECIALLY when your central bank is directly monetizing your debt, that money you are not spending is typically not going to be spent in other parts of the economy. It is simply not going to be printed, so it is not going to be spent. \n \n Personally, I would still put the odds of a shutdown at well over 50%. Why? Because the democrats are acting like children...and not very bright ones at that. I can certainly understand why they dont want to pass the republicans budget cuts. They are basically a republican wet dream...they basically just go after programs that annoy the republicans anyway. Steve Womack (R-Arkansas) put forth an amendment to cut funding for president Obamas teleprompter and then had to withdraw it because he could not figure out how much that would save.\n \n If the democrats had any brains at all, they would be coming up with their OWN list of cuts, then when they sit down to negotiate, they are negotiating about WHICH cuts to make, not just refusing to make any cuts. There are things in the republican version that I would rather they did not cut. I dont want to see the health care reform de-funded. I dont want to see public broadcasting cut. \n \n IF the choice is the republicans cuts or NO cuts, though, we will end up with the republicans cuts because Americans are demanding cuts. If the democrats were actually bright enough to play this game, they would show up with $100 billion of their own cuts and demand that THOSE cuts be passed...at least make it LOOK like they are trying.",

It is simply not going to be printed, so it is not going to be spent. \nExactly right. One thing people aren't willing to accept, at least based upon polls I've seen, is that cutting government spending is going to hurt the economy and cut jobs. The benefit is that we are not selfish pr*cks who passed on enormous amounts of debt to the future. Furthermore, as you have often said, either we make the cuts now or they are made for us shortly after. Like I've said before, debt is basically borrowed growth so when the party is over you basically go down below where you \"should be\" until things even out and are back in balance. It is inevitable. \n \n Second, people are wrong when they say we can grow our way out of this. This is basically the reverse of the laffer curve idea. If we have enough \"investment\" it will pay for itself. Hmm, no. Now, we should invest in infrastructure because that is a government role but lets not pretend like this will pay for itself.\n \n \nPersonally, I would still put the odds of a shutdown at well over 50%.

If we do that than we cut nothing and probably add more. If I had it my way we'd do a priority list (republicans put one down, dems put one down); fund everything by 85% going down the list until we ran out of money and everything below the line is cut. You can't claim you were unfair then. \n \n Poll after poll shows that people want cuts so long as we cut nothing but foreign aid. In other words, screw the kid in Africa with AIDS, we want our Pell Grants. This same trend is happening in the states...\"cut spending just not people's pay, benefits, education, medicaid, or science/technology programs\". Umm, that's the entire budget in most states. Defense, Medicare, SS are most of the budget for the feds. \n \n Time to realize that we will have to suffer to make up for the mistakes of the past. Better now than later.\n \n Or, we can attempt to be like our parents and just say \"I'm gonna get mine...screw my kids\".",

Now, we should invest in infrastructure because that is a government role but lets not pretend like this will pay for itself.\n\n \n Of course we can grow our way out of this. All we need is 20% growth for the next 2 decades, along with spending freezes, and we will be there!! \n \n As far as infrastructure goes, done wisely it will pay for itself, but not quickly. Payback on most infrastructure projects is anywhere from 5-20 years.\n \n Frankly for a lot of infrastructure improvements, I dont know that the government needs to spend all that much money, they just need to be willing to actually use their regulatory powers. For example, it is not AT ALL unreasonable for them to tell telephone companies that if they are going to get a protected market for internet in urban areas, they are REQUIRED to service rural areas as well. Likewise it is not at all unreasonable for them to require system upgrades for our telecom and utility services. The companies will scream bloody murder and claim that it will drive them out of business, but it did not drive any of the European or Asian companies who have already done it out of business. If it was explained simply enough...that these companies have been given protected service areas for years and part of the deal was that they provide service for everybody and keep their networks up to date, that maybe as few as 25% of the population would run around screaming \"SOCIALISM\"!\n \n \nWith no offense to anyone but we can't go around picking what programs we like anymore.

Better now than later.\n \n Or, we can attempt to be like our parents and just say \"I'm gonna get mine...screw my kids\".\n \n\n \n I dont disagree, but I also dont think that we can afford to have one party being the cutters and the other party fighting not to cut...nothing will ever get done. Both parties need to come to the table and be ready to make some real headway. \n \n The only problem I see with your plan is that the republicans are going to put \"military\" at the top of their list, and we cant afford to fund the military at 85%. Hell, we cant afford to fund the military at 45%. \n \n Personally, what I think we need to do, and I am trying to spread this idea around as far as I can, is NOT pass any more omnibus spending bills. We need to break every spending category down to the individual program level and congress needs to review every one and either approve it or not. For example, dont put \"department of defense\" as a line item. In fact, dont even put \"DARPA\" as a line item. Make the DARPA flesh melting space ray its OWN line item, so congress can decide if we REALLY want to spend $100 billion on a flesh melting space ray that only works on koala bears. Make EVERY program its own line item and make whoever comes up with the budget for that particular program include the FULL budget, then give congress the ability to go in and trim individual items in the budget if they feel so compelled (everybody can bring a box of kleenex from home once a year just like grade school). \n \n Boehner did this to some degree with the spending cuts idea. He allowed people to put up anything they wanted and voted on it all. They need to do that with the budget as well. \n \n I realize the process would probably take a full month of hard work, and that congressmen are not used to that much hard work, but I really do believe that is the only way to put \"everything on the table\" and actually see everything get examined. I can tell you right now from dealing with the government on a contract basis as well as having been in the military, there are some government programs that are just mind numbingly STUPID. There is no way they would pass a congressional vote, but they are buried on page 778 of the defense appropriations act, and no congressman in the history of this country has any idea what is in there past page 18. \n \n I still think both parties would need to have a chance to prioritize programs because I am sure after about day 23 they would finally go \"FORGET IT...NOTHING ELSE GETS FUNDED\" and go home for a month of vacation.",
