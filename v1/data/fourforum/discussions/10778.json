Yet most who profess no belief in God almost always favor all of the above mentioned items. It is intresting that the christian values of those who profess to be christian do not translate into support for government programs to help the poor, hungry, and sick. More over the more fundamentalist christian someone is the more likely their are to support the party that believes that money is God and that corporations should be free to do what they want.",

   "Speculation:\n \n Because Christianity is a hands-on faith. \n Meaning charity is with the individual and not some faceless organization.\n \n I've read some statements that say one shouldn't use the 'church' to do charity and to help.\n This is based on the call in the bible to personally help. \n \n \n Many commentary I've seen on America and Charity pretty much holds this to be true. We give more as individuals than through faceless organizations like the gov't.\n We also have an in-built distrust of such organizations. Not trusting them to distribute the funds we've donated (or been forced to give) properly. Plus, we know about the cost of red tape and bueracracy and how it syphons the funds away uselessly.\n \n Psychologically, I also feel more rewarded when I do something good personally than have it done through a medium. Even if the 'good' is lesser in the big picture. Helping that lady (who looks like she needs it) with a 20 makes me feel good...even if it really doesn't cover her real needs of getting her rent paid and children fed.",

An example of this would be Kier Hardie who founded the Labour Party, he believed that his Christian beliefs where the major reason why he became a Socialist. \n \n If we want a more up to date example just have a look Liberation Theology of South America. They believe not only should the Church care for the poor but it should influence the State policies for the benefit of the poor. I think Jo Bennett has a quote from Dom H\u00e9lder C\u00e2mara( who was a major influence on Liberation Theology) \n \n \"When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a Communist.\"\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology\n \n In Scotland we also have Clergy men who are Anti-War and Anti-Nuclear weapons. They have even marched against the War in Iraq and they have also been part of the blockade of Faslane Nuclear Base in Scotland.\n \n http://www.tridentploughshares.org/article1242\n http://www.scotland.anglican.org/index.php/news/entry/mps_sent_anti_trident_message/",

The moon is round and the sun is bright. Everyone sees this and no one can deny it. So if Christianity is Truth, why is it not the only religion on earth.\nYou do bring up a valid question and one that seekers have asked over and again. The differences between religion and Biblical Christianity are as follows:\n \n 1) Whereas religion seeks to \"go to\" G-d, Christianity's G-d comes to Earth to seek man (Jn. 3v16)\n \n 2) Whereas religion seeks to do works to obtain salvation, Christianity, on the other hand portrays salvation as a gift. (Eph.2 vv8-9)\n \n 3)Wheras religion, for the most part, portrays man either as outright evil (such as Islam, Catholicism), or basically good (such as universalism, Eastern Mysticism), Christianity portrays man as both. IOW, G-d's loving creation, but since the Fall, wounded.\n \n With these differences in mind, the idea that the Creator of the entire Cosmos would come to Earth, pay the full penalty for our sins (basically, the sin of unbelief), and longs for a relationship with us is startling, and therefore frightening. I believe it is out of either pride, fear, or both that most people reject the Gospel message and that's unfortunate.\n \n Pride in that they (mankind) is unwilling to allow his/her life to be under the sovereign rule of G-d, and fear that they may have to give up things in their lives that ultimately may very well be destructive. I hope that helps. emoticon_xangel",

Maybe it was already getting it wrong at that time, since you and others claim it's getting it wrong now.

Modern scholars can't always agree on their provenance, or what should be there. There are lots of Christian scholars, including Catholic ones, who consider the book of Revelation, for example, to be very problematic, and that it probably shouldn't be there at all.\n \n As for St. Paul, it could be argued that Christians ought to be called \"Paulists\", considering the weight they give his writings, not all of which have been proven to be his originally, and some are suspected to be later forgeries. While I realise no-one here probably has the scholastic expertise to tackle such questions substantively, the fact that there are controversies among scholars of Christianity must raise questions in the minds of the faithful -- at least those interested in such things.",

   "There have been mutterings that the early Christian church was not the \"Catholic\" church, which only supposedly came into existence after the Reformation, when the Catholics supposedly split off from the true Protestant church(es). \n \n Well, this POV is problematic as well. There's an interesting discourse on it from someone who describes himself as an evangelical Protestant who converted to Catholicism, so it is from a biased perspective, but instructive in religious thinking on the issue:\n \n What Does Catholic Mean?\n \n \n...let's get back to the history of the word catholic. The first recorded use of the word is found in the writings of Ignatius of Antioch, who was a young man during the time of the apostles and was the second bishop of Antioch following Peter, who went on to become bishop of Rome. Ignatius was immersed in the living traditions of the local church in Antioch, where the believers in Christ were first called Christians (cf. Acts 11:26). He was taught and ordained directly by the apostles. From the apostles Ignatius learned what the Church was-how it was to function, grow, and be governed.\n \n History informs us that Peter was the bishop of Antioch at the time; in fact, Church Fathers claim that Ignatius was ordained by Peter himself. Ignatius must have worshiped with Peter and Paul and John. He lived with or near them and was an understudy of these special apostles. Ignatius is known and revered as an authentic witness to the traditions and practice of the apostles.\n \n In the existing documents that have come down to us, Ignatius is the first to use the word catholic in reference to the Church. On his way to Rome, under military escort to the Coliseum, where he would be devoured by lions for his faith, he wrote, \"You must all follow the bishop as Jesus Christ follows the Father, and the presbytery as you would the apostles. Wherever the bishop appears, let the people be there; just as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church\" (Epistle to the Smyrnaeans 8).\n\n \n Well, though an ex-Catholic myself, I don't pretend to be a scholar of church history, so I don't know whether this tale is true or not. But at any rate, the modern RC church maintains, with some justification from papal continuity, that IT is of the true line of apostolic succession from St. Peter. Of course, Protestant churches can make similar claims that it was the church of Rome that deviated, and I don't want to get into arguments about whose claim is more just -- it's irrelevant to me.\n \n The point is, that both Protestants and Catholics come of the stock that decided fairly arbitrarily what was scriptural and what was not; and both branches of this schism have gone on to create amendments and interpretations of scripture, while denying the validity of each other's innovations. \n \n Sola scriptura is all very well, provided one has confidence the original scriptura got it right in the first place and that one's interpretation is divinely inspired, but neither Protestants nor Catholics follow it in practice, anyway.",

I said that there was the church a certain way very early on (pre-Nicea, though not necessarily with that council causing the differences), which we can quite clearly be read about in very early writings from people like Ignatius, Clement, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, etc. Things that the later RCC considered very important are conspicuously absent from these writings, so clearly it is logical to assume that the RCC added them later. The reformation was over some of these very issues, so it seems pretty straightforward that the reformation was more of a return to earlier orthodoxy in terms of doctrines and focus.

   "Perhaps there have been such \"mutterings\" but that's not what it was I was arguing. I said that there was the church a certain way very early on (pre-Nicea, though not necessarily with that council causing the differences), which we can quite clearly be read about in very early writings from people like Ignatius, Clement, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, etc. Things that the later RCC considered very important are conspicuously absent from these writings, so clearly it is logical to assume that the RCC added them later. The reformation was over some of these very issues, so it seems pretty straightforward that the reformation was more of a return to earlier orthodoxy in terms of doctrines and focus. I'm not talking about structure here--in that sense the reformation caused fracture, obviously.\n\n \n Well, it seems fairly obvious to me that both Catholic and Protestant branches of modern Christian churches are equal offshoots from the original Christian roots. I wouldn't argue that one is more representative of early Christianity than the other. I think both are probably about equally distant, and both have added and subtracted beliefs, rituals and practices over that period of time. \n \n If you want to argue that Protestants are less guilty of this than Catholics, go right ahead, I don't plan to quarrel about it. I'll merely say that from my perspective, the differences between those branches are dwarfed by their similarities. Perhaps to people closer to the ground, the differences are more striking and important.\n \n \nI don't think it was so arbitrary as you say. It happened based on several well-understood criteria. One of them was that the books used had universal acceptance already, so it was sort of a foolproof way of doing it. I think a lot of people get into this revisionist idea of some dark conspiracy that went on where the church at the time where some books were subverted maliciously. Well, they were left out because they weren't generally accepted as the real deal. The ones that were, were kept.\n \n \n OK, I'll grant the selection wasn't entirely arbitrary, and relied a lot on custom and habit. However, I don't think that \"universal acceptance\" easily translates into \"foolproof\"! Some scriptures, modern scholars aver, have been noticeably altered from what must have been the originals, with subsequent additions and interpolations (one doesn't need to postulate some evil conspiracy to suppose that transcribers sometimes altered texts in the days before concepts of strict editorial integrity). I don't know whether there were \"dark conspiracies\", but clearly there were early battles between various branches of Christianity, and some were killed off, with the winners declaring the losers to be heretics. But how do you know the \"right\" side won? To me, of course, there is no \"right\" side.\n \n \n(shrug) Well, what we have is what we have. The standard is there, and you'd be awfully hard pressed to convince the world that the books we have in the Bible should be changed out for others.\n\n \n Again, I have never subscribed to the view that the majority is always right, or that stubbornness and persistence in a belief is evidence of its truth. I have no doubt few Christian believers would want to alter their bibles. But then, how do you reconcile the differences between the Protestant and Catholic versions? Surely they can't both be \"right\". And if only one of them can be \"right\", how can you tell which?

   "The RCC church (really, simply the Church, at the time) was much more consistent in terms of what constituted orthodoxy at the time of canonization than centuries later when tradition was given such status alongside (or even superseding) scripture in terms of importance. The medieval Church, with it's buying and selling of indulgences, over-emphasis on religious relics, etc., was much different and less orthodox than it had been centuries earlier. This is evident by the contrast of how the early Church Fathers deferred to scripture on issues in their writings. Sola Scriptura was a return to the early church as far as focus is concerned. While they no longer deal in indulgences, unfortunately the RCC still clings to some traditions that have little, if anything, to do with scripture.\n\n \n Oh you believe 'Sola Scriptura is a return to the early church.

To me, of course, there is no \"right\" side.\n\n \n Well, looking at the the early church fathers, even as early as the 1st and 2nd century, supports the idea that the form of 'orthodoxy' which won the day (in the battle against Arianism and gnosticism anyway) was more consistent with Christianity's roots, and therefore was likely a case of orthodoxy defending itself against 'heresies' that came up. I see a tendency among some revisionists to sometimes think of these early church \"battles\" dealing with heresies as just two equal groups of Christians 'duking' it out, and one group comes out on top and therefore becomes orthodoxy. But the early writings don't show that--they show the orthodoxy as we know it (consistent with the Apostle's Creed) to have been there from the get-go--earlier on than the battles--and Arianism to have been a heresy that came along. Granted, Arianism nearly took orthodox Christianity over at one point, but it was pushed back and orthodoxy (as had been there before) won out.\n \n \nAgain, I have never subscribed to the view that the majority is always right, or that stubbornness and persistence in a belief is evidence of its truth.

A person, IMO, call themselves catholic and not necessarily be religious. It's sort of like what we see sometimes in Judaism--people are in Jewish families, and therefore they are Jewish. It's an ethnic/cultural identity. Catholicism is sometimes this way--they may call themselves Catholic, but they may really only be so in the most nominal cultural way. And yes, that very same thing can happen in protestantism too, but I think it probably is more widespread in Catholicism. And I certainly also don't mean to say that Catholics can't be devout or religious.\n \n \n That hasn't been my experience of Catholicism. I do not regard myself as \"Catholic\" simply because I was born to Catholic parents. While many Catholics do feel it is a cultural identity, it usually isn't merely a ritual, it is a religious belief as well. Apostates do not often regard themselves as Catholic. They are more likely to describe themselves as \"recovering Catholics\".\n \n \nNeverthless, it is what orthodoxy was beforehand (Jesus as deity) and remained after the Arian controversy. It has nothing to do with whether God wanted it to be that way (though I believe it is)--it is simply a matter of fact that we can deduce from the writings of the time. To argue that such may not be the case because someone may have destroyed earlier evidence that would prove things differently is to argue speculation over fact. We have to base history on evidence we HAVE, not on evidence that we don't.\n\n \n Again, we do not really know the incidence of the Arian \"heresy\" because it was suppressed by the winning \"orthodoxy\". Probably the \"orthodox\" were in the numerical majority, otherwise they would not have won, but for all we know, it might have been by a whisker.",
