   "I've done some hard thinking the past 24 hours about my last post about name calling and hate. I have even discussed this issue with my clergy.\n \n I'm a pretty sensitive person and sometimes I can buy into the hate messages a little too much. As my clergy pointed out, how do I know that some of the people who have been spewing their hate out on this gay rights forum aren't some twisted, sick person already in jail for some hate crime or diagnosed with some antisocial problem or even worse, have an antisocial problem and not do anything to have it diagnosed or fixed? His message was that one can never truely know whom we are exchanging ideas with on the internet. He also said that those people who spread their hate, were not interested in an intelligent, friendly debate, but to spread their hate even more because that may be the only thing that they have left to give and to pray for them. It made a lot of sense, but I'm still a senstive person so...\n \n I'll be around posting in other forums, but won't be posting in this one. It's really not necessary to defend who G*d made me. I don't have to prove others are wrong...opinions can't be wrong or right, they are just opinions.\n \n I'm leaving this forum because I need to be in a more supportive place right now.\n \n To all of you who support gay rights, I appreciate the support. I know there are a lot more of you out there...more than there are people that hate (thank G*d).\n \n Anyway, the best of luck to everyone, G*d bless you all.",
