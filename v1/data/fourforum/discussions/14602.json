   "Sorry, Jack. The gun registry can't be saved\n \n \nJack Layton has a plan for the gun registry -- a compromise all Canadians can live with. He wants to drop the criminal prohibition for first-time non-compliers, drop registration fees and respect native treaties and the privacy rights of all gun owners. Sadly for Layton, his plan is a fiction, a farce. His proposal to save the gun registry requires him to introduce a compromise bill, which will then need to be debated, read three times, approved by the Senate and then given Royal Assent ...all in the two days before the registry's fate will be decided. Of course, Layton -- an intelligent, seasoned politician -- knows his plan doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of working. But that's OK. Because he doesn't intend for it to succeed. It's just a political ploy.\n \n The ploy is aimed not at the government or even the other opposition parties, but at a third of his own caucus -- the 12 NDP MPs who voted against keeping the registry last time and who are expected to do the same this month. Layton knows that these 12 NDP members, representing rural ridings where the registry is despised, cannot support the registry as-is and hope to be re-elected. So, by dreaming up this compromise, he's trying to give them something -- anything -- that they can take back to their constituents and say, \"Yes, I voted for keeping the registry today, but only so that I can reform it later in a way that will address your concerns! Please re-elect me.\"\n \n It won't work. Layton fundamentally misunderstands why the registry is so hated by millions of Canadians. It's not about fees or paperwork. The problem is that the registry, from its very inception, has symbolized the political elite's distrust of anyone so retrograde as to own a gun.\n \n By the very rationale advanced by the Chretien Liberals that introduced it -- making the public and police safer by collecting information on individuals and their property -- the registry could only ever serve to alienate those that it targets. Any law-abiding citizen, if told they must submit private information to the government for the safety of society, cannot help but feel that that very same society considers them dangerous.\n \n The registry remains a political monument to the victims of the Montreal Massacre, a tangible demonstration that the Liberal party stands opposed to mass shootings.\n \n Never mind the fact that the registry likely wouldn't have prevented Marc Lepine's rampage, or that the rifle he used is even now subject to the lowest level of scrutiny and restriction. The Liberals saw a chance to capitalize on the public's shock and outrage surrounding the brutal murder of 14 women and created the registry to show voters how seriously they took the issue of gun violence.\n \n But those who own firearms were as horrified by Lepine's actions as anyone else. They didn't appreciate that suddenly, government bureaucrats -- backed by the power of criminal sanction -- were nosing around their business, insisting that they register their property to prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again. How could they not conclude that they were being grouped with Lepine, lumped together in an association of murderous psychopaths-in-waiting because they happened to own a rifle?\n \n That's what Layton doesn't get. Lawful gun owners don't want the registry scrapped to save themselves a few minutes of paperwork now and then. They want this symbol of unfairness, of the suspicion with which their government regards them, destroyed, so that they don't have to feel like pariahs anymore. Everything that has happened since -- the massive cost overruns, the bureaucratic nightmares, the lost documentation and constant data-entry errors, not to mention the Liberal flip-flop on their promise to never use the registry to try and ban guns -- has merely added to the outrage.\n \n It's too late to redeem the registry. Either it gets scrapped or the political parties that support it must pay the consequences. Michael Ignatieff has come to accept this after his own earlier hopes to make the registry work for rural Canadians, which is why he's simply whipping his caucus to vote for its preservation. He'll pay the consequences in the rural ridings and accept as a trade-off the opportunity to have a little culture war and tell urban Canadians that Stephen Harper is soft on guns. Jack Layton should be honest with himself and his caucus and do the same. In or out, sir. The registry is far too hated, with too much justification, to permit anything else.\n",
