   "If guns are banned, people will die. No question about that. The question is how many.\n \n My kung fu grandmaster gave a very good short speech today about gun control. He is an ex-cop, and he used to train the police officers in our town. He is very wise and offers an interesting insight into gun control. He told us a story today, about a police officer that was off duty and in plain clothes who was approached by a man with a large knife. The officer told the man to back down, however the man kept coming at him. The officer was forced to pull out his gun and kill him. If this was a civilian, he/she would be dead.\n \n I gained a useful insight into what it feels like to be assulted during today's class. I was pinned down and being choked by a man 200lbs and over 1 foot larger than me. After awhile, I realized that there was almost no hope of getting out (this was training, of course. Not real.) If you are confronted with a situation like this, and are not carrying a gun or other weapon, most likely you will be injured or killed by the attacker. Even with martial arts training, our grandmaster acknowleges that in some situations, you have to just do what you can, and hope you get out alive, especially if you are a small person.\n \n Violent crime will continue to happen no matter what, however whether it rises or falls is up to the voters and the politicians. If you think violent crime will never happen to you, put yourself in the place of the people that it has happened to, especially the dead ones. Then think twice about voting for gun control.",

   "Uhhh smiley, it isn't as if banning guns hasn't been tried in England and is failing miserably. http://www.fff.org/comment/com0512f.asp\n In response, allow me to quote at length from &#8220;Gun Control in England: The Tarnished Gold Standard,&#8221; written by historian Joyce Lee Malcolm and published in the fall 2004 issue of Journal on Firearms & Public Policy:\n \n [Between 1997 and 2003] crimes with [banned firearms] have more than doubled.... In 2002, for the fourth consecutive year, gun crime in England and Wales rose &#8212; by 35 percent for all firearms, and by a whopping 46 percent for the banned handguns. Nearly 10,000 firearms offenses were committed....\n Clearly since the ban criminals have not found it difficult to get guns and the balance has not shifted in the interest of public safety....\n \n In the four years from 1997 to 2001 the rate of violent crime more than doubled. The UK murder rate for 2002 was the highest for a century....\n \n A recent study of all the countries of western Europe has found that in 2001 Britain had the worst record for killings, violence and burglary, and its citizens had one of the highest risks in the industrialized world of becoming victims of crime....\n \n And here&#8217;s the icing on the cake: &#8220;[A] United Nations study of eighteen industrialized countries, including the United States, published in 2002 ... found England and Wales at the top of the Western world&#8217;s crime league, with the worst record for &#8216;very serious&#8217; offenses.&#8221; [Emphasis added]\n \n And all this while crime in the United States, including violent crime, has been steadily falling. The &#8220;Wild West&#8221; seems to be 3,000 miles to our east.\n \n &#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; observed Derek Phillips, legislative advisor for the UK&#8217;s Office of Legislative Affairs, &#8220;&#8216;tough&#8217; legislative regulation, so evidently ineffective in achieving the purpose claimed for it, continues as a policy.&#8221; The UK&#8217;s ban on private firearms ownership has left the people there completely defenseless in the wake of rising crime. A young American turned British bobby has shown the courage to suggest that more guns might be the answer, but rather than take an honest and rational look at the evidence, the British would rather hide behind an irrational hatred for firearms and an even more irrational contempt for American sensibility on this issue. Guns in the hands of police officers &#8212; and private citizens &#8212; make everyone safer. Cowering from the criminal element and denouncing &#8220;gun drunk&#8221; Americans won&#8217;t change that simple fact.",

Here's the quote. Jesus understood that He had to die for the sins of humanity so he rebuked Peter for his actions, but He never told the disciples to lay down their weapons forever at all. On the contrary, he told them in Luke 22:36 to purchase swords before leaving on a mission to evangelize.\n \n \nThe bible is very clear in its warning that \"those who live by the sword (a weapon) will die by the sword\". By that, it teaches that the criminal who lives by violence will die by violence, and we see that result every day in the lives of violent offenders who are killed.\n \n And remember when Peter cut the ear off of the Centurion who came to arrest Jesus? Jesus rebuked him because Jesus knew He had to die for Humanity; so He healed the guards ear, but He never told Peter to lay down his sword. Neither the bible nor Jesus ever promoted pacifism at all. In fact, he told this to his disciples. Luke 22:36: \"Then He said to them, But now, he that has a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.\" So Jesus believed in self defense, but not offensive violence.

Yet you would rather kill those you feel may be of some threat to you.\n \n\n \n Oh really mr bible scholar? His giving His life couldn't have been because He knew He was here to die for our sins, could it? Pacifism had absolutely nothing at all to do with Jesus being crucified and if you understood the Gospel, you would know that. It was all about Him sacrificing Himself for the sins of Humanity and paying the price that only He could pay to redeem us. Here, smiley, read on from Luke 22:\n \n Luk 22:41 \n And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and prayed,\n Luk 22:42 \n saying, \"Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.\"\n Luk 22:43 \n Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him.\n Luk 22:44 \n And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.\n Jesus suffered greatly just at the thought of what was to come. See this link for the relevance of sweating blood. http://foraclearview.blogspot.com/2008/03/precious-drops-of-blood.html And He knew that He could call to 10,000 Angels and they would save him from this plight. So dying on the Cross had absolutely nothing at all to do with being willing to die for pacifistic reasons rather than fight for His life, but had everything to do with being willing to die for the sins of humanity rather than cling to a life that He loved very much. So once again you have shown how little you understand about what the bible really say's as you insist what you want it to say. \n \n And yet again, you offered no evidence other than your opinion that is full of misinformation and insults directed at me. Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing of actual factual value to this debate at all, but have just infused it with your secular humanist opinion of what you would like the bible to say.",

Just as drugs have been outlawed for decades, so are they available through an underground supply. We also know that criminals can buy weapons with less hassle and sometimes for less money than law abiding people. So cutting off the legal supply will only arm the very people who pose the problem while victimizing the people who need to be able to protect themselves from violent criminals.\n \n It's also offensive that the gun control advocates automatically assume that pro gun advocates are hungry to kill people with their weapons. I know that I have never aimed a gun at anyone in anger, or for any reason at all. And my home is alarmed so that it is protected against illegal entry. That is a primary defense against being placed in the position to be confronted on my own property.\n \n http://www.fff.org/comment/com0512f.asp\n \n Here is documented evidence that the Banning of handguns in GB has failed miserably if cutting down on crime and violence was the goal.\n [Between 1997 and 2003] crimes with [banned firearms] have more than doubled.... In 2002, for the fourth consecutive year, gun crime in England and Wales rose - by 35 percent for all firearms, and by a whopping 46 percent for the banned handguns. Nearly 10,000 firearms offenses were committed....\n Clearly since the ban criminals have not found it difficult to get guns and the balance has not shifted in the interest of public safety....\n \n In the four years from 1997 to 2001 the rate of violent crime more than doubled. The UK murder rate for 2002 was the highest for a century....\n \n A recent study of all the countries of western Europe has found that in 2001 Britain had the worst record for killings, violence and burglary, and its citizens had one of the highest risks in the industrialized world of becoming victims of crime....\n Why would the USA want to disarm its citizenry and subject ourselves to the same experiment when we can see how it is failing in GB?",

I found that in every instance the effect was not only temporary but also deeply regretted the following hung over mornings....\n \n Carrying a firearm has never given me a sense of invulnerability. I am rather more conscious of the tremendous responsibility I have for my actions when I do choose to carry. Self-defense is the first right of nature. Carrying a firearm for me is merely one way in which I exercise that right against those who would seek to do me harm. \n \n I disagree with the argument that the presense of a weapon gives rise to the motive to commit a crime, and that I am less safe with a gun than without.\n \n ---\n \n \"And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim\". Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n \n \"If a slave, says Plato, defends himself, and kills a freeman, he ought to be treated as a parricide. This is a civil law which punishes self-defense, though dictated by nature. . . .It is unreasonable. . .to oblige a man not to attempt the defense of his own life. . . .Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .[T]he laws of an Italian republic, where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things.\" Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans.

   "What you fail to realise is that those who want to shoot people would find it a great deal more difficult to actually do it if guns weren't so very easy to acquire.\n\n \n Really? Do you know how many people get shot in the UK? Handgun violence has gone up.\n \n \n \nPresumably your mugger would choose the city where no-one carries a gun (apart from the police or security personnel). But what if he also had no gun (he is only a mugger, not an experienced professional criminal), because he can't find one in every house he cares to break into. Wouldn't that also make the citizen on the street safer?\n\n \n Criminals don't obtain guns from houses, because if they break into a house with a gun in it, they will be shot. There is something called the black market, and it is extremely easy to buy things from here. Ever wonder how its so easy to get marijuana? Guns will be just as common as marijuana if they are banned. People don't get marijuana by burglarizing houses.\n \n \nNotice the two big ifs in your last paragraph. Do you feel safe knowing that you have a long way to go before these two ifs are conquered?\n\n \n So because we cannot achieve better ways to prevent the mentally ill from obtaining guns, we should just ban them all? Taking them out of the hands of honest citizens, and pretty much serving them on a silver platter to criminals? Don't you think there is a better way?\n \n \nI also fail to see how making it a bit harder to kill anyone who looks like they might be a threat is a infringement on your civil liberties.\n\n \n Once you find a way to make it harder to kill someone, please tell me. Not one of your proposals does this.\n \n \nLive with it, and let them live too. I gave up guns when I was about 10. I suggest it's time you did the same.\n\n \n Just because you are afraid of guns, does not mean that you are justified in characterizing honest gun owners as \"10 year olds\". If you don't like guns, fine. Don't buy one, however don't try to infringe on the civil liberties of honest citizens trying to protect themselves.\n \n Live with it.

   "And, making my point again, I still see a lot of drugs. Nothing is 100% or even close to it.\nYour entire argument can be analogised by this. Criminals are going to get drugs anyway, why not make all drugs legal? The simple answer is that criminalising an item reduces supply of that item.\n \n Will introducing gun restrictions decrease gun supply? Undoubtably\n Will decreased gun supply result in lower gun ownership? Absolutely\n Will this lower gun ownership be similar in criminals? Yes, but less so.\n Will increaced enforcement of gun control laws force criminal gun ownership further down? Absolutely.\n \n You are also focusing too much on 'criminals'. Every criminal was born an innocent child. As I've stated elsewhere, it is often crimes of passion, or of opportunity (in other words, crimes which are not pre-empted) where guns are used. If the individual in question did not have easy access to a firearm, they may still attack someone, or break into a house through an open window they happen to spot. But the chance of someone getting killed as a result is much less that if the the proto-criminal is armed.\n \n I'd rather be attacked by a knife than a handgun.",

Here's a sample of the actual numbers from iangb's link. I C&Pd them directly from the graph. The graph breaks GB up by Country. That includes populations, gun homicides, non gun homicides and households with weapons in them. Because each Country's stats per 100,000 are in accordance with their own population numbers, then by adding up the numbers in each category and totalling them as Great Britains total per 100,000 is totally accurate. Or as accurate as the numbers given in the graph is anyway. And if you have a problem with them, then talk to iangb cuz he posted the link to show that the USA has a much higher murder rate than England.\n \n What he forgot to take into account is that England Wales isn't the whole of GB. You must include Scotland, N. Ireland and Ireland to get an accurate tally to compare with the stats for the USA. And as the numbers show, GB has less guns in homes but more gun homicides per 100,000 than the USA does. Here are the numbers below again, and here is the link again, do some math yourself and stop beating a dead horse and making excuses for the obvious. http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcgvinco.html\n \n \n\n Country Year/ Population /----Total Homicide/--Firearm Homicide /Non-Gun Homicide /% Households With Guns\n \n United States3 /1999 / 272,691,000 / 5.70------------/3.72----------------/1.98--------------------------- /39.0\n \n N.

Just considering Great Britain's combined relevant numbers... \n \n Country / Total Homicide / Firearm Homicide / % Households With Guns\n USA ------------5.70--------------3.72-----------------------39.0\n \n Great Britain--10.36--------------5.57-----------------only 17.1 (not including stats for Ireland)\n \n So based on the number of people, and the much lower population in GB compared to the USA,and the number of households with guns, according to YOUR OWN STATS, it's like the wild west over their in peaceful and sophisticated Great Britain. We have more than twice the armed households and half the homicides. And even less firearm homicides than they do annually. \n \n What the gun control nuts always forget when condemning the USA's homicide rates is how much larger our population is and how many more armed citizens we have than those you're comparing us to. When those numbers are considered, we come out looking much better than they do statistically speaking.\n",

The combined population of 6,774,111 based on those two countries populations is still an accurate number based on the graph that iangb posted. \n \n And the numbers per capita are accurate and still higher than the USA when compared to our population of what was 272 million at the time the stats were recorded. The fact remains that according to iangb's link, the USA had a homicide rate of 5.70 per 100,000 and Great Britain, based on the same criteria had a homicide rate of 10.36 per 100,000. So to summarize, take same numbers iangbs link gives for the numbers per 100,000 based on America's population of 272 million and you'll come up with the number of homicides we had that year of 1999.

Country A has 2.24 homicides per 100K. Country B has 6.09 homicides per 100K. Assuming that A and B are the same size (not the case in the main example, but meh...) the combined homicide rate is 8.33 PER 200,000 or 4.165 per 100,000. It's basic mathematics!\n \n Let's go hypothetical again. Country C and Country D are equal in size, and for some unknown reason both have a homicide rate of 75,000 per 100,000. Particularly dangerous, you may think. However, by your logic, the combined homicide rate of C and D is 150,000 per 100,000. This is blatantly impossible. Instead, the combined rate of C and D remains at 75,000 per 100,000.\n \n Finally, in a vague hope at getting this into your skull, let's look at population division. \n Country X has a population of 800,000, and homicide rates of 10 deaths per 100,000 - so total homicides in X are 80. If I take a small (and representative*) sample of X, the homicide rate for that smaller sample will still be 10 per 100,000 - the most obvious example is if I take a sample that is 1/8 the size of X, I will get a population of 100,000 with 10 homicides. With me so far?\n \n Let's say that I split X into two equal parts, Y and Z. (Assuming Y and Z are representative*) Y and Z will both still have homicide rates of 10 per 100,000 - they will both be 400,000 in population and have 40 deaths each. When you recombine Y and Z to make X, the homicide rate stays at 10 per 100,000. If it did not, you could mess up any analysis simply by splitting up a country and then recombining it, over and over.\n \n And no, Ireland is not a part of the UK. This is why 'Northern Ireland' and 'Ireland' are listed separately.\n \n *If Y and Z are unrepresentative it still works as long as Y and Z make up the entirety of X, but I don't want to go into that because I suspect that it will confuse you.",

Remember, I've shown that enforcement leads to reduced crime.\n\n \n Dude, lemme try and make things understandable for you. In the places like California and New York and DC, where gun control is absolutely tight and crime is high regardless, the laws aren't going unenforced. To even get a gun, you need to get permission from the police to become a gun owner. The application process is very difficult, and it's not at all uncommon for it to be stretched out to over three years, just to find out you've been denied and need to start all over again.\n \n Nobody in these places legally owns a gun without the police having full say it in. You can't buy a gun from anywhere in these states without the full written authority of the police, and then you have to register the with them as well.\n \n Of course for the people in DC the laws are much worse. The ownership of handguns wasn't exactly banned per se, it was just that you couldn't own an unregistered handgun, and the registration program for handguns was terminated in 1977.\n \n The \"lack of enforcement\" excuse doesn't fly in this case. Lack of enforcement is why criminals keep getting out two years into a ten year sentence. Lack of enforcement isn't the reason that criminals are running around with guns and using them in an illegal manner.\n \n \nThe problem is that DC is unique among the other states in that it is a single city with a population density of ~9,000. That's really quite hard a place to enforce laws in.\n\n \n The population of Washington DC is about 570,000. New York City on the other hand, has a population size around 8,000,000.

So don't tell me that Washington DC is so damn hard to police and enforce the laws in, it really ain't that big or that crowded.\nYou've made exactly the same mistake as your last source, in that you rely on 'big numbers' without actually looking at a relative comparason.\n \n DC has a population density of ~9000 people per square mile, as stated above. From Ripskar's data (above) there were 57 murders per 10,000 people, or (to standardise) 5.7 murders per 100,000 people.\n \n New York City has a population density of 27,147 people per square mile. However, the FBI database (via Wikipedia) tells me that there were 7.3 murders per 100,000 people. Compare that with the 5.7 in DC and you've quite nicely proved my point.\n \n EDIT: Further investigation reveals a typo in ripskars data - the homicide rate is per 100,000, not per 10,000 - making the homicide rate in DC much larger. The data is 10 years old - more recent data from wikipedia give a rate of 35.7 per 100,000. Obviously this is still much larger than the more densely populated New York - feel free to disregard the 'smalled' text (this forum doesn't support strikethrough, alas) - I only left it there because it contains useful links.\n \n Instead, my reply would be that it is interesting to note that NY's crime has fallen massively in recent years - murder rate was ~4 times larger in 1990, as was violent crime (and the city's population was smaller by ~1/8th). While this still doesn't quite make it comparable with DC, a crime drop of this magnitude is interesting nonetheless. The drop is \"attributed by criminologists to [changed police tactics], the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes\" (wikipedia). The much slower rate of crime reduction in DC is merely attributed to 'gentrification' - essentially demographic changes. Doesn't this imply that the police in DC haven't been doing as much as the police in NY?",

Source is wikipedia, which gets it's sources from US census data - here and associated browsing links, which are immediately obvious on the relevant pages (click 'california' then each of it's four main cities, or 'vermont' and then it's main city).\n Source that the gun laws in the US are still largely similar is in that list of US laws you posted a while back.\n \n \nYour sources are for the (M)U(C)K, not the US.\n\n Aw, you feel the need to insult me. Bless.\n Unfortunately, you're entirely wrong. All four sources were for the US. Just for you, here are the links again.\n 1, 2, 3, 4.\n \n \nDo I sense overconfidence here?\nWell... given that Archangel has yet to respond to any of the 'ripping apart', I'd say it's fairly well placed confidence.\n \n \nYeah I guess you're right, those pesky things like constitutional rights really get in the way of enforcing the laws on the books. The Fourth Amendment really gets in the way of the police being able to carry out a warrantless raid on somebody's home to ensure that they don't have illegal guns anywhere. Maybe we should be more like Britain and have far less obstacles that would get in the way of official police business.\n\n Woah, you're really desperate about the UK thing, aren't you?\n Read my link. There was no unwarranted searching involved, simply frisking individuals that had already been pulled over/detained for various offenses.\n Furthermore, There are very few cases where unwarranted searching is allowed in the UK.\n \n \nYour point is flawed because you changed the number of DC murders to something much lower simply for the sake of argument. It doesn't work that way. DC has hundreds of firearm-related deaths each year, so considering their low population levels the rate would have to be 57 murders per 100,000 people.\n\n This is ironicly amusing to me. In fact, the source did make a typo, so you are correct in guessing that it 'should' be 57 murders per 100,000 - see my edit, above (I've quoted it below for your viewing convenience). However, the reasoning that you use: 'but there are hundreds of them!' is dire in the extreme. That 'I changed the numbers for the sake of argument' is entirely false - I changed the numbers so that they were comparable, per 100,000 each. It was only later that I investigated the source further and found the typo - something that you and Archie would be wise to do when you try to use maths.\n Meh. Read my edit, reply to that.\n \nFurther investigation reveals a typo in ripskars data - the homicide rate is per 100,000, not per 10,000 - making the homicide rate in DC much larger. The data is 10 years old - more recent data from wikipedia give a rate of 35.7 per 100,000. Obviously this is still much larger than the more densely populated New York - feel free to disregard the 'smalled' text (this forum doesn't support strikethrough, alas) - I only left it there because it contains useful links.\n \n Instead, my reply would be that it is interesting to note that NY's crime has fallen massively in recent years - murder rate was ~4 times larger in 1990, as was violent crime (and the city's population was smaller by ~1/8th). While this still doesn't quite make it comparable with DC, a crime drop of this magnitude is interesting nonetheless. The drop is \"attributed by criminologists to [changed police tactics], the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes\" (wikipedia). The much slower rate of crime reduction in DC is merely attributed to 'gentrification' - essentially demographic changes. Doesn't this imply that the police in DC haven't been doing as much as the police in NY?\n",

If you get in the way they charge you with obstructing justice. If you lie you're charged with that too.\n \n \nThat's my point. The law is to protect the police at the time of the incident, not to prosecute an individual after the fact.\n\n \n The point is, use of a fake weapon will still result in real charges. At least over here it will.\n \n \nSomeone with a fake gun doesn't have intent to cause violence, because he doesn't have the means to cause violence.\n\n \n Excuse me? What'd you say? Somebody without a weapon doesn't have the means to actually cause violence? You're saying that an unarmed man can't have intent to cause violence since he's unarmed? That's positively crazy and plain nonsense.\n \n Just because you're unarmed doesn't mean that you have no intent or means to harm someone. You can face charges for beating somebody to a bloody pulp with your bare hands.",

   "There's a difference in this instance. The fifth amendment is there so you don't have to incriminate yourself as having done something wrong.\nI'm aware what the fifth amendment states.
