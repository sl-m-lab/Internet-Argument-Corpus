   "An old movie I was reminded of on this forum, and thought I'd start a thread for those interested in sharing home DVD recommendations.\n\n \n no one is :p\n \n I don't care to recommend anything to you. And I know what is good and what it isn't and don't need no one to tell me different.\n \n But just as a farewell, no hard feelings sort of cr-p.\n \n One of the best movies I have ever seen is La Jetee. I watched the English version of it at least ten times on youtube, before it was removed. It as all done with stills except for a couple of frames. \n It is short, poetic, lyrical, intelligent, thought provoking, profound, in other word it is art. Chris Marker is an auteur, an artist who never sold out.\n \n You can still watch the original French version with English subtitles, the quality is extremely poor though. But even a scratched version of a masterpiece is better than nothing.\n \n YouTube - La Jetee (in French, English subtitles from 16mm) pt.1\n \n The original French version with Spanish subtitles is really clean and the translation perfect. French is easier to translate to Spanish than to English, and in my opinion nothing at all is lost in translation. For instance \"A la recherche du temps perdu\" I find the Spanish translation of it more \"French\" than the English translation. \n I never finished reading it, though, not even the first volume, I found it sohhh boring\n \n The same applies to \"La Divina Commedia\" Italian being so similar to Spanish. But \"La Divina Commedia\" is not boring, it is divine emoticon_xclown\n \n Vaya con Dios",
