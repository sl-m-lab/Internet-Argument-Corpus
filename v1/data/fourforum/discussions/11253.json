And all by betraying the men he served with by accusing them of being baby killers.\n \n I never went to Nam, thankfully, but I remember when Mcain was on the committee to normalize relations with Vietnam and all of the POW/MIA groups who pleaded with him to not abandon our soldiers who were left behind, and Mcain attacked their agenda as if they were attempting to capitalize on them, when all they wanted was evidence that none were still alive before giving up on them. None of that evidence was ever forthcoming, yet Mcain defended the Communist Gov't against our missing soldiers.\n \n Some believe that some of the very men he helped to sweep under the rug and abandon with an American/vietnamese pay-off were the very men he originally betrayed by cooperating with his captors while a POW himself. So once he had attained the political power to actually make a positive difference in saving POW/MIA's, was when he used that clout to put the final nails in their coffins by making sure all attempts to hope to find them were abandoned by normalizing relations with Vietnam without proof that they were dead.",

I thought that the first 2 pages spelled out exactly how rediculous some of the arguments were that are being regurgitated towards McCain. \n \n I find it distasteful for any American who has never spent 5 and 1/2 years locked in a 3rd world toilet prison camp while being both physically and mentally tortured to basically turn around and accuse a man like McCain of cowardice or abandonment.",
