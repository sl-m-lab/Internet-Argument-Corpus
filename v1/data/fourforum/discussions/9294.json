   "4Forums is pleased to announce the addition of JPSartre12 to the Formal Debate moderating staff. He is well-known in this neck of the woods, participating in some memorable past debates, serving as a judge, and guest moderating as well.\n \n It's our wish to provide blanket coverage for potential debates. Nothing is as frustrating as being anxious to begin your debate and having to wait for the moderator to come on the scene. Hopefully, one of us will be available to facilitate your wish to reality.\n \n This is a good time for a reminder: There are dozens of discussions taking place in 4Forums which could be enhanced by taking them to the Formal Debate section. You need not be experienced in formal debate to participate. You should only be motivated by challenging yourself to be the best you can be. A side benefit is the large number of views these debates generate. You absolutely have an opportunity to be persuasive. \n \n If you get the chance, congratulate JP in his new role. Feel free to contact either one of us.",

   "Thanks Billsco. Would you believe that I just now noticed this thread? I guess I'll have to change my subscription notices now. :) \n Those who know me, know that I'm a passionate debater and don't often give quarter. I probably hold the record for having the most debates ended via opponents crying \"uncle\". emoticon_wow \n I post routinely to three forums (including this one), so the best way to get ahold of me is via PM. I look forward to some good debates and will do my best to provide assistance and impartiality.",
