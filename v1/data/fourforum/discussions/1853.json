   "from a biological perspective, the greatest threat to humans is the escape from natural selection with modern medicine.\n\n \n I totally agree Fracas. Good point. It is true that with modern medicine and vaccination, we are creating an entire population with weak immune systems. \n Look to the example of smallpox. Back when my parents were children, smallpox was rampant. What did we do? We vaccinated almost the entire population. So a generation of people are protceted, and the world health org. declares smallpox eradicated. So why are we now scratching our heads and wondering what we will do when some terrorist poopmonkey drops a vile of smallpox into a small water supply or a crowded area? Well, first off, I doubt we have mass stockpiles of smallpox vaccine around. Second, since smallpox has not been seen in so many years, it is likely that there has been some mutation of it's structure, making the old vaccine invalid. Third, We have preserved the weak through the mass vaccination, instead of letting those who a particularly susceptable die. There are people who can be exposed to smallpox and not be infected, because they have a natural immunity. So now we have a larger population of people who have no natural defense to smallpox, and a greater potential to spread it. In any highly mobile society where you can get on a plane at one end of the country and be in the other end 6 hours later, this would spread like wildfire, and the chance of containing or quarentine of all who were exposed is not possible. \n \n On a broader sense, as Fracas suggested, we are breading a weak society protected by modern medicine which allows bad genetic traits to be carried on from generation to generation. It comes down to a question of ethics, whether it is more ethical to treat one person and prolong his life, allowing him the chance of reproducing, and passing his genetic predispositions on, or letting that one person die, and thereby breaking the genetic chain. In our society today, it is not hard to see which way we go.",

   "I agree with influenza more than smallpox. The reason? While I believe that smallpox might spread pretty darn quickly because of a lack of vaccines, the vaccine is from cowpox, a closely related form. Mutations that invalidate the cowpox vaccine are highly unlikely. As for influenza, it is constantly shifting and impossible to stop. Just look at the big flu season scares. The entire population will be inoculated with one strain and another will pop up.\n \n I think the scariest disease is actually a fictional bioengineered one: the Ebola virus with cancer genes so that it can last longer in the air and be communicated between people with coughs or sneezes.

   "@ Worldtraveller, Fracas and sundowner\n \n I think you are tking the Darwinism to far. After all, it is not really survival of the fittest. It is the survival for those who are most adapted to fit in the enviroment they are currently competing in. If we believe that we are weakening the human genome through medicines and helping the weak, we should actually at the same time be trimming the human genome to fit into our current enviroment where there is medicine and solidarity. Now, it is true that we would probably be less \"fit\" if there was a severe natural disaster, but in that case I would argue that international trade poses a greater threat. After all, the dependance on imports such as food stuff, oil (used to produce food), electricity etc. is surely more dangerous for our societies and species as a whole, than a few individuals with genetic problems (such as bad eyesight, or faulty hearts). \n \n Now, after writing this, I realise that we are talking about health problems. But my point still stands; if there is a huge disaster, genetics will not be our biggest concern. Nor is genetics any problem as long as we retain our ability to treat the diseases and/or compensate frailties (sp?).",

Some of these animals may carry disease, or an unknown disease might just be lying dormant in the environment. With human intrusion comes the risk of catching such an unknown disease.
