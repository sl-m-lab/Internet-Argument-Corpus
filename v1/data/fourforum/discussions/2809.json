   "Saturday I was flipping channels and landed on CNN. It seemed like they were just blatanly campaigning for Kerry. There was a latina woman being interviewed. She was being asked questions like \"Why do you think Kerry has earned the confidence of latinos in America\" \n \"Well, it's obvious when you look at the facts...\"\n \n Then, out of curiosity, I flipped right to FoxNews and wouldn't you believe there was a black man being interviewed. \"Why do you think Bush has earned the black vote?\" \n \"Well ,when you look at the facts...\"\n \n Then I flipped a couple up to Dennis Miller. \"So, how'd Bush do at the NUL?\" \"Oh, amazingly well....\"\n \n Then I flipped to Headline News showing a clip of Bush saying only \"the republican party has a lot of work to do\" Well, Bush 'tried' at least at the NUL, was the gist.\n \n I don't know, but I think this is the most blatant I've seen this sort of thing. Usually, it's much more subtle and if you're not looking for it you can miss the bias, which is a good thing.\n \n Well, my question is, does this make you sick? Do you feel informed by the news or grimy just for watching it? How can we trust what the news says when they are so blatantly and unashamedly biased? I know this isn't a new thing, but how can you feel confident in the voting booth when all you've heard are 2 sides, never an outside perspective?",

   "That's exactly why I never watch the tv news. There may be a channel out there that really is fair and balanced, but I don't know which one it is.\n \n When I want to research a topic, I generally go to news.google.com. Type in a headline and you get links to hundreds of articles. Some liberal, some conservative, some local, some foreign. It helps to get a fuller picture of what's happening.",

   "First of all I think you're missing the way things work. Two key points.\n \n The Democractic party has been news all last week and this week, big news. They planned it. Big hype around the running-mate announcement (last week), and now huge hype around the Democratic National Convention. This is not only normal, it's expected by both parties and welcomed. Of course, when the republicans kick off their convention, I'll be watching them all week in New York, just as I'm watching Boston this week. See how this thing works? The republican party leader said something like \"we exepct they will gain 12 points in the polls during this period\". Just as they expect to gain 12 or more points during THEIR period. He wasn't raving about it, it's the way it works.\n \n Secondly.\n \n Journalists for the most part, should serve the public and the almighty dollar.\n By serving the public they do this.\n \n Riddle me this, how much media coverage did John Kerry get in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 ('till recently).\n OK, now, how much media coverage did Pres. Bush get (aka the republican party).\n \n Now, are you aware that there is a slight discrepancy between how well the public knows Kerry as opposed to Bush? Add to that the discrepancy in how much overall media coverage the current republican administration got in relation to the democratic party leaders/platform? Aha, now we're getting somewhere.\n \n It's the media's RESPONSIBILITY to educate us on BOTH candidates, and this means Kerry has a HUGE gap to close before the public, we the people, can make an informed and educated decision on whether or not we think he will make a good leader for this country. We know Bush pretty well, don't you think? He's had ample time to show us how he leads a country and makes decisions.\n \n But as I said, the flurry the past two weeks is a planned and expected thing. The public DEMANDS to see what's news, when it's news. Just like when they played Dean's scream 80 zillion times. The public loved it, despite the horrible impact it had on a democratic front-runner. Right now it's democratic convention and \"get to know John Kerry\". Later, Republicans will have their NY convention and I, along with many other politically interested people, will DEMAND to see them in the news. Then both will be in the news, they will have debates, they will share air-time, then we go to the polls. What's confusing or different about this?\n \n And no, you'll never know the \"truth\" behind the campaigning or the media, or otherwise, it's specifically designed NOT to let you know the truth. It's about getting elected. Big difference. People are in generally not designed to spout out the truth about what they think/do. How could an entire political party be expected to? If we can come up with a better way, I'm all for it, and I think about it too...\n \n -mach",

   "you are talking about the news as if they were doing what they were supposed to do, but these news channels were not hiding the fact that they prefer one candidate over another\n \n i have no problem with them hyping a convention, that's not really giving any kind of opinion, but if you could have seen what was being said, you would probably agree that one channel preferred one candidate and the other channel preferred the other\n \n this is not authentic journalism",
