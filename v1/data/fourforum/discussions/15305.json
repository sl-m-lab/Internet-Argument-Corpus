   "Ron Paul announces possible Republican 2012 presidential bid | World news | The Guardian\n \n \nRon Paul announces possible Republican 2012 presidential bid\n \n Long-time Texas politician and Tea Party favourite has made a key step on the official route to the White House\n \n \n Ron Paul, a libertarian-leaning Republican congressman beloved of many Tea Party supporters, has announced he is exploring a 2012 presidential bid.\n \n The move is a key step on the official route towards announcing a final candidacy and thrusts the long-time Texas politician into a Republican field that has been more marked by hesitancy than any apparent fervent desire to take on Barack Obama.\n\n \n This will make me vote republican.\n \n I like to think that this time he has a chance. The same issues he was trying to push last time like the deficit and the fact that the fed is pretty much a bunch of fools seems to have moved to the mainstream.",

It never has been.\n\n \n I agree. Ron Paul is a man who not only understands the constitution, but actually follows it. Look at his voting record, it speaks for itself. People have been too quick in the past to write Ron Paul off as a dried up old coot. Paul is an intelligent and principled man who makes a lot of sense if you actually listen to him. I have not voted in a presidential election in years, but I will support Ron Paul 100%.",
