   "When considering that there are many species existing that exhibit genetic homosexual traits, it is impractical and illogical to argue that humans are any less prone to genetic traits that become building blocks for homsexuality components and therein erodes the notion that it is a choice or a lifestyle. Following is an article demonstrating the genetic factors existing in animals and as such, indirectly substantiates the pre-existing data that strongly evidences that homosexuality is genetic. \n ________________________________________________________________\n \n Brain Changes Seen in Gay Sheep, U.S. Study Finds \n \n Sun Mar 7, 7:35 PM ET \n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Researchers who found homosexual rams in a herd of sheep said they had found changes in the brains of the \"gay\" animals. \n \n The results, published in the latest issue of the Journal Endocrinology, tend to support studies in humans that have found anatomical differences between the brains of heterosexual men and homosexual men. \n \n The researchers at the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine found certain groups of brain cells were different between rams and ewes in a part of the sheep brain controlling sexual behavior. \n \n And in rams that preferred to mate with other males, this area was smaller than in males that preferred females. \n \n \"There's a difference in the brain that is correlated with sexual partner preference rather than gender of the animal you're looking at,\" said Kay Larkin, an OHSU electron microscopist who worked on the study. \n \n \"This particular study, along with others, strongly suggests that sexual preference is biologically determined in animals, and possibly in humans,\" added Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology who led the research team. \n \n \"The hope is that the study of these brain differences will provide clues to the processes involved in the development of heterosexual, as well as homosexual behavior.\" \n \n Animal experts have found that about 8 percent of domestic rams display preferences for other males as sexual partners. \n \n \"Same-sex attraction is widespread across many different species,\" said Roselli, who worked with a team at Oregon State University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (news - web sites)'s U.S. Sheep Experiment Station in Dubois, Idaho. \n \n They looked at 27 adult, 4-year-old sheep of mixed Western breeds including eight male sheep that preferred to mate with females, nine that mated mostly with males and 10 ewes. \n \n They found a densely packed cluster of nerve cells in the hypothalamus of the sheep brain, which they named the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus or oSDN. \n \n The hypothalamus regulates sex hormone secretion, blood pressure, body temperature, water balance, and food intake, and also helps regulate complex behaviors such as sexual behavior. \n \n The oSDN in rams that preferred females was \"significantly\" larger and contained more neurons than in male-oriented rams and in ewes. There were also hormonal differences between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual sheep.",

   "The study was announced on November 4th at Oregon Health sciences University, investigating the brain structures of a group of rams that mate only with other rams.\n \n The lead researcher, Dr. Charles Roselli, observed that some rams mount other rams, not ewes. They didn't pair-bond with these rams, like normal rams do with ewes. Their sexual attraction was strictly with other rams. though.\n \n Roselli believed that abnormal prenatal hormonal exposure of these rams brains may have caused them to develop in a sex-atypical manner.\n \n Abnormal....\n \n \"We are not trying to explain human sexuality by this study, \" Dr. Roselli cautioned, \"Whether this is a big component of what contributes in humans, it's still debatable.\"\n \n This \"gay sheep\" study is similiar to the recent study of frogs which suggested that prenatal hormonal annormalities can distort the normal growth of tadpoles.\n \n Atrazine, a common weedkiller, was implicated in that study as the apparent cause.",
