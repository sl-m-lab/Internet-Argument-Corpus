How does one determine what \"reasonable force is\"? This is where it is dangerous to take the law in your own hands. \n\n \n It depends on what country you are in. In America, you are generally able to use the greatest amount of force you can muster in order to defend yourself. The only real test of whether you are defending yourself is whether you feel you are in danger. \n \n \nI think that you should have the right to beat up a thug a little, knock them out for example.

That way, you stay alive and okay and hence, the situation does not escalate.\n\n \n How do you know they are ust going to take your stuff and leave? I know where I live (Kansas) you are more than welcome to shoot, stab, beat, bludgeon or kill anybody who breaks into your house, as long as they are actually IN the house. IF they are stealing your car in the yard, you can confront them, armed if you so desire, but you cannot shoot them from your window. \n \n THere are two problems with your theory. First, you are betting that somebody who is willing to steal from you is not willing to kill you. The fact that they are stealing from you in the first place puts their moral fiber in serious question. HOw do you know when they are done they are not going to kill you? You don't. Generally guidlines for such cases are that if the attacker is armed (most are) you are in mortal peril. I would argue that if the attacker is not armed, you are also in mortal peril, because if they have enough confidence in their abilities to go out robbing people unarmed, there is a good chance that they are skilled in unarmed combat. Are you?\n \n While you could argue that using the least amount of force needed to extricate yourself from the situation is the best policy, in reality that is a pretty serious bet to make with your life. If you have a chance to kill the guy and instead decide to run, you are betting that he will not chase you, and also that you are faster than the attacker. You get a chance to kill an enemy in combat, you take it. \n \n \nin most cases that i know of it is NOT ok to use deadly force to defend ones property. if you are in physcal danger, or are helping onother in physcal danger, then it could be consitered self defence. a lot depends on the situation. it would be hade to convince the cops it was self defence it a six and a half tall 300 lbs and riped, had to shoot the 6 foot atacker, but if the victome was a five and half feet tall weighing in at 90lbs, it would be easy to see why she shot.\n\n \n The best unarmed fighter I ever knew was a 4'9\" tall, 94 pound woman. She was quick, she was good, and she was absolutly brutal. She could break your leg, or arm, or neck, and you would never get a chance to get in a hit. You seriously need to re-asses your idea of a \"fair fight\". After years of bar brawling and bare knuckle fighting, I can tell you absolutly that the only fair fight is the one you win. NObody fights fair when they are getting their butt kicked, and the little guys are the ones you have to watch out for, because they are usually quick and brutal.",
