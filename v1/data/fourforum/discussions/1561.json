We have gone from racism to stopping racism, but now we need to reach the next stage. this is to stop this positive discrimination against the majority, before it gets out of hand. Dean, therefor, should be allowed to not have any black people in his cabinet as, while you may think it is racist to not have black people incabinet, is it not racist to go out of your way to not allow white people, who may be more capable, of having these jobs, it is not the color of your skin that makes you a politician, after all.",

Sharpton is not known as a reliable source where his political aspirations are involved. You state \"while you may think it is racist....\" (emphasis mine). To whom are your referring to in this? No one here has said that Dean is a racist or that he can have whomever on his cabinet. My comments about \"affirmative action\" are tongue-in-cheek really and intended to highlight Dean's on contradictions. I do not actually think dean is a racist, just a poor political strategist. \n \n My comment was specifically to silent poet and was stating that he would indeed have to go out of his way and isn't that the point behind affirmative action. You assume a great deal in your post. Could you please clarify your position.",
