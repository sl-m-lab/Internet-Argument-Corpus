My first and foremost concern is that the FCC is seeking to fulfill a person grudge against Howard Stern? And regardless of the FCC's reason, is it right to allow the FCC to dictate what we can and cannot listen to on a subscription basis?",

That Bush chose to make his first evening TV policy speech in over one year (SS policy) on the opening night of network sweeps that determine network revenue levels should be another indication of crusader arrogance. \n \n As to a personal grudge against Stern, that wouldn't surprise me. If you follow some of the posts on this forum supporting the current administration and their policies, hatred is a very prevalent factor in what thought processes they're able to put forth. Most have mental IVs to administration propaganda and talk radio that promote fear, resulting in people seeking someone, something to blame. Goebbels was very effective in putting the state ahead of personal responsibility.",

However, I really don't see this as a Bush administration vs. Stern type of deal. (BTW, did I mention that I cannot stand to listen to Stern?) I also do not see how the timing of the Bush speech has anything to do with the original topic of the post. This question was meant to be more non-partisan, focused on the FCC, not the republicans. Yes, I know that the current chairman of the FCC is a Republican, appointed by our Republican president. But, if you go back and read the original post again, you see that I was really asking if the FCC should have the power (or right if you will) to censor what people can access in a subscription based service. The personal vendetta against Stern is an interesting issue, but not salient to the major point.",

The personal vendetta against Stern is an interesting issue, but not salient to the major point.\n\n \n The FCC is, when taken in context, an infringement on free speech. Originally chartered to regulate government owned airwaves and create operating order in that then new technology, it evolved from a commission regulating bandwidth usage to being granted a mandate to regulate bandwidth content. With that combination of original charter and subsequent mandate, I fail to see how one can eliminate political influence on content.\n \n To directly answer your question, the FCC has the power to legally control content of 'their' bandwidth, regardless of who pays for operating expenses, advertisers or subscribers. Yes, I believe that control is an infringement on free speech.",

FCC content control is currently limited to 'public' bandwidth, defined as being broadcast programming open to all receivers without restriction. All it takes to include subscriber paid bandwidth under that control is congressional approval to expand the FCC mandate. Both are, IMO, flagrant violations of free speech, but try fighting city hall.",

   "In my opinion (some time has passed and I'm unsure of the latest updates) I don't think the FCC should censor satalite radio. Some one mentioned satalite radio as a subscription. So is HBO and Cinamax on cable. What people should listen to should be of their own choosing. I personally am not a big fan of Howard Stern but I will not pronounce \"Doom & Gloom\" on people who listen to Howard Stern. You know, there is such a thing as the 1st amendment. It's to a constatution that we have in the USA. Perhaps some of you have heard of it. Everyone has a right to free speech in this country. The only ones who should say that they don't want to hear that stuff are the listeners. Everyone knows what they feel comfortable listening to, don't they?",
