   "1) Where and how in the process of evolution did different genders and sexual reproduction begin? Even if an organism or animal developed sexual organs through mutations, they wouldn't be functioning organs, they would just be appendages, right?\nWe have no way of knowing exactly when, but by looking at sexual reproduction is \"simple\" organisms such as protists and algea, we can get an idea of the how. The typical two genders are likely to have arisen after sexual reproduction, not at the same time. There are, as far as I can remember, still living examples of organisms that have either just one, or in other cases, more than two genders. I can check the details if you want to know more. Sex organs are often complex structures that would have arisen long after sexual reproduction began.\n \n \n2) Along the same lines, how did the appendages created by mutations actually become something usefull? For example an animal might have developed a wing like appendage, but it wouldn't have the correct muscles that it would need to actually move the \n wings.\nThe number of answers is as great as the number of mutations. In the case of the bird wing, muscles to enable crude beating would already be there as the are just a form of tetrapod forelimb. In the case of insects, there are a multitude of hypotheses any of which could be the real answer. \n \n \n Similarly, what is the explanation for the organs found in humans and other animals. They are very complex and even if formed by very long term and complex mutations, how did they ever start working, and start working together? For example, how would a heart formed by mutation know that it is supposed to beat and send and receive blood from the body? For that matter, how did blood come about to be the liquid of choice for life? \nThe heart is an easy one: read up on how the heart develops within a fetal mammal for example. Its complex to describe, but a simple swelling within a blood vessel that pulses marks the start of the heart. It doesn't know its supposed to receive blood: it pumps blood. The simplest pumps in your body are no more than rings of muscle that relax and contract in sequence (such as when you swallow). Oh and blood isn't \"the liquid of choice for life?\", most organims doesn't have it.\n \n \n3) If evolution worked by the \"survival of the fittest\" theory, and humans evolved from apes because of their superior traits and characteristics which enabled them to survive better, than why are there still apes today?\nThis is easy: we didn't evolve from apes. Apes of today and humans evolved from a common ancestor (which wasn't any of the apes of today). What you ask is called a strawman by the way (ie you claim something about evolution, which evolution theory doesn't hold to be the case).\n \n \n4) Could someone direct me to some evidence of evolution between species? I have no trouble grasping the concept of evolution within a species, but I would like to see and understand the evidence for evolution from one species to another.\nGo to talk origins and search for new species. There are loads of them that have evolved in the last few decades. If you need me to find them for you though, let me know.\n \n \n1) Where and how was the mind created? How can the ability to think and reason be created by purely physical material? What was the mutation that caused brain cells to become something more than the sum of their parts?\nAssuming that the mind is purely a function of the brain, then the mind evolved the moment an organism had two brain cells to communicate with each other as the linkage between brain cells definitely adds more than the sum of the parts to a brain. \n \n \n2) Finally, are we as humans the final step in evolution?\nNo. Humans are no more or less evovled than any other species alive today.",

   "Hello, I'm interested in learning about evolution, I currently know almost nothing (as evidenced by my questions below).\n\n Forgive me if I doubt your sincerity, but you seem like a troll to me. I suspect that you aren't interested in learning about evolution at all. Your questions, while they do support your claim to know almost nothing, are pretty typical of creationist \"prove it to me\" questions.\n \nI would appreciate it if some of you experts could give me some simple answers to a couple simple questions and help me with some of my doubts.\n\n And that's why I think you are a troll. There really aren't any experts here. There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics, but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read. It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind.\n \nPlease forgive my ignorance and my incorrect terminology\n\n Neither is usually a problem if one is willing to learn. The problem is that over the years I have seen uncountable examples of someone who begins exactly as you have here. In every case, the purpose was not to learn but to somehow show that the theories of evolution (and science in general) were wrong. But since I am a sucker, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I know one creationists who actually apologized for beginning as you have and now asks real questions in an effort to learn.\n \n1) Where and how in the process of evolution did different genders and sexual reproduction begin? Even if an organism or animal developed sexual organs through mutations, they wouldn't be functioning organs, they would just be appendages, right?\n\n The problem is that you think of sex as something that happens between two mammals. You think that there are some complicated organs that are required. Many unicellular organisms actually reproduce sexually, and some of those have more than two sexes. On the other hand, some species of whiptail lizards have no males. When closely examined, it would seem that sexual reproduction is less efficient as a means of reproduction than asexual reproduction. But upon closer examination it seems that sexual reproduction offers a selective advantage. Computer models predicted that sexual reproduction would tend to give a population increased resistance to paracites. This has been confirmed in experiments with fish that breed both sexually and asexually. In environments where paracites are prevalent, the fish reproduce sexually. This is known as the red queen hypothesis. Read about it in The Red Queen, by Matt Ridley, Penguin Books, 1993.\n \n The topic was also covered in the PBS series, Evolution. If you have the opportunity to see the series, it is very educational. It will cover the basics of evolutionary theory.\n \n2) Along the same lines, how did the appendages created by mutations actually become something usefull? For example an animal might have developed a wing like appendage, but it wouldn't have the correct muscles that it would need to actually move the wings.\n\n I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.\n \nSimilarly, what is the explanation for the organs found in humans and other animals. They are very complex and even if formed by very long term and complex mutations, how did they ever start working, and start working together? For example, how would a heart formed by mutation know that it is supposed to beat and send and receive blood from the body? For that matter, how did blood come about to be the liquid of choice for life?\n\n Organs don't \"know\" anything. The do what they do. But there are animals with simple, one chambered hearts. They beat and they pump a fluid that carries oxygen to the body. Such animals had a selective advantage and they produced more offspring than animals without that advantage.\n \n Your argument is one of \"I just can't believe\", which is pretty much standard creationist ignorance. In other words, pretty troll-like.\n \n3) If evolution worked by the \"survival of the fittest\" theory, and humans evolved from apes because of their superior traits and characteristics which enabled them to survive better, than why are there still apes today?\n\n Standard fundamentalist christian YEC question. First, evolution isn't the \"survival of the fittest.\" That phrase was coined by the social economist, Herbert Spencer. Darwin never liked it and only used it, always followed by a reference to natural selection, only after it became popular, and only then at the urging of the co-developer of the theory of natural selection, Alfred R. Wallace.\n \n And to ask why there are still apes is pretty mindless. Evolution happens in populations. Two separate populations of a single species will diverge over time. Even the most fundamentalist of creationists has been forced to admit this. How else do you get 36 species of cats and 34 species of dogs from the dog kind and the cat kind? The question is mindless. We share a common ancestor with apes.\n \n A similar question might be if you are here, why are your parents still alive? \n \n4) Could someone direct me to some evidence of evolution between species? I have no trouble grasping the concept of evolution within a species, but I would like to see and understand the evidence for evolution from one species to another.\n\n Sure. Check this.\n http://home.houston.rr.com/bybayouu/graphics/Archaeopteryx_lithographica_1.jpg\n That's a bit more than you asked for since it is an example above the level of species, but I can give those too.\n \n For example, herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls share a common range but do not interbreed. But herring gulls range to the west to Iceland and southern Greenland, where they meet with the American herring bull. They freely interbreed and are indistinguishable in appearance. The American herring gull ranges to the west to Alaska, where it is adjacent to the Vega herring gull at the Berring Strait. These birds interbreed freely and there is little difference in appearance. The Vega herring gull interbreeds with Birula's gull, which interbreeds with Heuglin's gull, which interbreeds with the Siberian lesser black-backed gull which interbreeds with the lesser black-backed gull. Now go back and read the first sentence of this paragraph. Why are there still any of the other gulls? Since herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls do not interbreed, even though they share a common range, food source, and nesting environment, they are separate species. Isn't that strange since they are just the extremes of a continuous and continuous population of interbreeding birds?\n \nAnd now a couple deeper questions (by my standards)\n\n And these are going to be what are the ultimate questions from a fundy. These are the questions that prove, if an evolutionist can't explain them in detail, that it is some unknown, magical, supreme being that is responsible by some unknown, supernatural means.\n \n1) Where and how was the mind created? How can the ability to think and reason be created by purely physical material? What was the mutation that caused brain cells to become something more than the sum of their parts?\n\n So, if I whack you in the head with a baseball bat and you become a vegitable, where did your soul go? If you are still alive and wearing diapers and drooling, is your ability to reason purely \"physical material\"? How are your brain cells more than the sum of their parts? If the mind exists as something more than the physical operation of the physical brain, why does it disappear when the brain is damaged?\n \n2) Finally, are we as humans the final step in evolution? We appear to have stopped the process by not following the \"survival of the fittest\" law, through our ability to display love and compassion we don't kill off the weaker members of society, and we care for the sick, thus enabling them to reproduce.\n\n First, we aren't the final step. Only creationists claim that it is so. Second, we haven't stopped evolving. There are several examples of ongoing evolution in humans in recorded history. Third, there is no \"survival of the fittest\" law. That is an ignorant catch phrase used by those who don't wish to invest the intetrity to understand the principles of evolutionary theory. Natural selection is more complex and difficult to understand than the lazy way out of claiming that it is \"survival of the fittest.\" If you don't want to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose, how do you know that you oppose it?\n \nIf we have in fact stopped the process of evolution, doesn't that make us distinct from all the earlier species?\n\n Why do you think you could see evolution happening in the first place? What studies have you done that indicate that evolution has stopped? The problem is that you mistake an ability to control our environment, and thus control evolutionary pressure, with a cessation of evolution.\n \nAnd if evolution is still going on, what are some mutations that have happened or are happening to humans that could create a species more equipped to survive?\n\n Sure. Wisdom teeth. We eat a softer diet than our ancestors did. It takes less muscle to chew our food than our ancestors needed. This is evident from bone structure. Humans don't have a sagital crest and our jaws are smaller relative to apes. It is a simple principle of physiology. When you stress a bone, it becomes larger. So the huge jaw muscles that require a sagital crest and a huge jaw are no longer necessary to modern man. As a result of the smaller jaw, the last teeth to develop don't have the room to grow between the last molar and the back of the jaw. Thus, almost everyone has trouble with their wisdom teeth.\n \n The problem is that without dental care, the wisdom tooth becomes impacted and after a considerable time of pain and the inability to chew, at least one molar is lost as the wisdom tooth pushes it out. Sadly, the inability to eat is not a survival advantage. And this happens twice - once for each side of the jaw.\n \n So you go to an oral surgeon and he extracts the wisdom tooth. Still, any surgery is a risk. You may have a cardiac arrest during surgery or you may get a fatal infection as a result. Wouldn't your prospects be brighter if you never got wisdom teeth in the first place? Studies indicate that the number of people who don't have wisdom teeth is increasing. A good friend of mine didn't have them. The only explanation is a mutation that is becoming more common because it offers a selective advantage.\n \nThanks in advance for your help. I hope you all have a great day.\n\n You're welcome. And I hope that you will use your day to learn something that you didn't know before.\n \n And as Gormless says, no species today is either more or less evolved than either other. To state otherwise illustrates a failure to understand the topic.",

You told some story that just doesn't make sense to me and I offered some of the scientific hypotheses that I know about.\n \nI simply said, when one speice [sic] is divided one division can evolve quite diffrently [sic] from the other, and that is why we have people and monkeys.\n\n A bit simplistic. And using monkeys and humans as an example is really quite misleading. Humans share a common ancestor with the chimpanzees, which shares a common ancestor with the gorilla, which shares a common ancestor with the other anthropoid apes, and so on. But to claim a species divided and now we have monkeys and humans demonstrates more misunderstanding than understanding.\n \nBy the way, unless you provide links their [sic] is no way to test the validity of your sources.\n\n By the way, they are called books. They're really easy to get. Just take your library card and go to the library and get them. While these popular works are not the primary literature, each of the authors contributes to the primary literature and are well qualified to discuss these theories. Stringer and Tattersall are quite good at representing opposing theories fairly. In fact, referencing books is a better way to support material than is some web site. Even better would be the primary literature, but I don't read much of that in paleoanthropology.\n \n Oh, yeah. I gave you a link. Fossil Hominids: The Evidence for Human Evolution gives a lot of information, but I don't recall anything about being \"pushed to the coast.\" \n \nI said no such thing. Homo-erictous [sic] (however it is spelt) was simply an example, Homo erictous [sic] reached over the world (obviosuly not clear enough, but anybody who knows were [sic] homo erictous [sic] got started will be able to conclude it isn't going to be found in australia [sic])\n\n You said exactly that. You said, \"Homo-Erictous may have been around the globe,...\" But Homo erectus was not. If you did not mean \"around the globe\" then you shouldn't say \"around the globe.\" The point is if someone isn't familiar with the topic they might think that you meant \"around the globe\" when you said \"around the globe.\"\n \nI am sorry if not clearer, but I simply wanted to show, when a speices [sic] branchs [sic] that far, divisions are inevitable, and that is, again, why we have people and monkeys.\n\n But it isn't why we have people and monkeys. Maybe it is why we have herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls. Maybe it is why we have brown bears and polar bears. But it's pretty much of a leap when stated the way you did it. You skipped most of primate evolution.\n \nIt doesn't require textes [sic] and figures [sic], It is common sense and the basic understanding of evolution that would lead any person to reach the same conclusions.\n\n Don't be ridiculous. It isn't a matter of common sense but of study of texts and figures and data to support the theories. If it were just common sense then there wouldn't be competing theories and some people wouldn't be making statements to the effect that humans were pushed to the coast and that is why we have humans and monkeys.\n \nRegardless of the correct \"thiers\" [sic] or \"thens\" the prinicple [sic] of divided evolution is pretty simple.\n\n First you need to define the \"prinicple\" of divided evolution and offer some evidence that it is true. I'm not sure what divided evolution is. Now I know what allopatric evolution is and I know what sympatric evolution is and I know what punctuated equilibrium is, but I've never heard of divided evolution.\n \nI would like to hear your version of how people are here and monkeys are here as well without picking at my \"there\" and my \"then\"?\n\n I didn't pick on \"there\" and \"then\". I didn't mention either. I only mentioned what was not understandable in your post and I only did so in order to clarify. If you were not talking about Homo erectus then I was making it clear that I was. So in the future, if you don't want me to point out the difference between \"there/there/they're\", then don't misuse them.",

   "The idea that examples have to fit within the rules when trying to explain something is not true.

We take animal A, which is good at climbing trees and swinging from branch to branch. Animal A is doing good, rather balanaced with its surroundings. We shall say animal A is a herbavour (plant eater, I know BAD spelling), and that it is roughly 1 meter tall, 1/2 meter wide, and about 24 kilograms. Animal A is fine, it is happy doing its Animal A things (by god my names are creative), but things are changing. Animal A is built for the trees, but the trees are disappering (for whatever reason, lets say mechanized bugs).

But some of the population still exsit deep within the forest, were lions and tigers would eat anything that went on the ground, there are pure Animal A's without mutation. So for the things inside the remaining forest, their is not ablitity to go on the ground. So slowly the creatures on the ground, the thick-legged Animal A's slowly become stronger until they can no longer climb up trees. These thick-legged, skinny armed animals we shall call Animal B.

   "The idea that examples have to fit within the rules when trying to explain something is not true.\n\n what rules? You mean the rules that if you don't mean \"around the globe\" you shouldn't say \"around the globe.\"\n \nEinstien said that when with a female freind (not sure of the actual terms) an hour seems like a minute, while holding a burning pot (or some such negative thing) a minute seems like an hour. This had nothing to do with his true theory, and in some respects didn't go with his thoery of general realtivity, but it went with the basis for which general realtivity is based on and that he thought was the easiest way to explain something.\n\n But we aren't talking about an analogy. You made a statement of theory that isn't true as far as I know. If you are giving examples of a theory I think it would be better that they actually were examples that illustrated your point.\n \n You wanted to check my sources and then object to books. I notice that you didn't give any sources. As I mentioned before, your turn.\n \n And since you like web links, try this one. Becoming Human.\n \nAnd it proabably has a real name, but for my purposes we shall name it divided evolution.\n\n I see. In other words, you don't know what you are talking about. It has a real name but you don't know what it is. It may have been Asia but you're not sure, and so on.\n \nNow if we undertstand that evolution is simply the production of traits which are superior, and therefore more survivalable, then we can also understand that mutation will cause diffrent versions of the same creature to appear.\n\n But \"we\" don't understand evolution to be simply the production of traits of any kind. Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time. That is the definition of evolution used by evolutionary biologists. The theories of evolution explain the mechanisms by which this change takes place. Some of them are mutation, recombination, gene flow, natural selection, sexual selection, and genetic drift. The first three increase the genetic diversity in a population and the last three tend to decrease it. I say \"some of them\" because I presume that there may be other mechanisms that I didn't consider that change change the allele frequencies.\n \n You can read some chapter I kind of stuff about evolution on the Major Tenets of Evolutionary Theory page. I'm sure that you will be pleased that you can \"test the validity of [my] sources\" with a simple link, but I'm not sure what that is worth since the source of the information on that page is books - I've read them all. I recommend that you also do so. Start with Maynard Smith.\n \n And, of course, a \"superior trait\" is just one that provides a differential reproductive advantage in a particular environment. Therefore, organisms that have adventageous characteristics tend to survive to produce offspring in greater numbers. Thus, those traits become more common in the environment until such time as they are fixed. Eventually, the population may generally have characteristics that are very well adapted to the environment in which it lives. But large populations will also tend to have considerable genetic variability that has accumulated over time. Not every individual has every advantageous characteristic. Now, if the environment changes, what was an advantage may be less so. What was not, may become so. Thus the frequency of these alleles will change so that the population becomes better adapted to the environment.\n \nNow lets start from a point, and continue linearly down the line.\n\n Not linear. More like a branching bush.\n \nWe take animal A, which is good at climbing trees and swinging from branch to branch. Animal A is doing good, rather balanaced with its surroundings. We shall say animal A is a herbavour (plant eater, I know BAD spelling), and that it is roughly 1 meter tall, 1/2 meter wide, and about 24 kilograms. Animal A is fine, it is happy doing its Animal A things (by god my names are creative), but things are changing. Animal A is built for the trees, but the trees are disappering (for whatever reason, lets say mechanized bugs).\n\n Let's say changing climate, which is probably what happened.\n \nSo slowly as Animal A is pushed back, animal A mutations that can have stronger legs and can go faster to aviod predators on the ground become more numroeus.\n\n Not pushed back, changed as it adapts to a different environment. If the change in the environment is gradual, then some genetic variability that is advantageous in that environment may allow the population to adapt and survive.\n \nSlowly Animal A grows thick legs and skinny arms. But some of the population still exsit deep within the forest, were lions and tigers would eat anything that went on the ground, there are pure Animal A's without mutation.\n\n Did you know that chimpanzees spend much of the time on the ground? Did you know that gorillas spend all of their time on the ground? Did you know that lions live on the savannas, not the forests?\n \nSo for the things inside the remaining forest, their is not ablitity to go on the ground. So slowly the creatures on the ground, the thick-legged Animal A's slowly become stronger until they can no longer climb up trees. These thick-legged, skinny armed animals we shall call Animal B. Animal B needed to go faster and be stronger, so it evolved into something fast, large and built for 2-d travel. Un able to climb trees animal B branches out and continues to thrive as slouly ground-based animals while Animal a's are still tree swinging weirdo's\n\n A bit simplistic but I don't have any major problems with that.\n \nNow this differs from apolocpt (ya know, seperated by geography)...\n\n Allopatric.\n \n...because it is an example that any speices over a signifiently large area may become diffrent depending on what condisitions faced by those in those areas. The orginal animal could still exist in the habit in which it was built, while other original animals exist in habits diffrent then the one they were built for and mutate, creating diffrent speices while leaving the original alone.\n\n But it can also happen without any significant difference in the environment. The herring gull and the lesser black-backed gull are the extreme ends of a single population that encircles the globe, and they do not interbreed even though they share the same range. And humans, even though they live almost everywhere, form a single species.",

   "Draconis,\n \n Please allow me to back off a bit and apologize. I have been thinking and have reached the conclusion that I may have been too rough on you. You have actually stood up pretty well. You see, I have come to the conclusion that you may be quite young and, in my opinion, haven't yet had the benefit of anything more than an elementary education in evolutionary biology. It seems that you didn't come away with a complete grasp of the concepts. On the other hand, I am quite old and have been dealing with the subject for decades, and debating evolution v. creationism on the internet since the early 80s. A personal fault is that I am intolerant of inexact work. I don't like it when I am guilty and I tend to be intollerant of it in others.\n \n That is not to say that anything you have said is correct. In this venue you need to be specific. You are asserting ideas that you don't seem to understand. I think that your understanding of evolution is a bit muddled. You need to work on it.

   "Of course, I am 13. I do not pretend to be anything more then I am, it is up to other people to put me in brackets of were they think I am.\n\n Well, that explains a lot. But just as creationists who try to make their religion look scientific only succeed in making it look foolish, evolutionist who post bad science though ignorance make science look foolish. More than once I have seen a creationist use incorrect information posted by an evolutionist who doesn't know what he is talking about to try to show that science is wrong.\n \nBut I would really want to hear your definition of how humans are here with monkeys here as well? (or apes, or gorrillas, anything heary and poo-flinging)\n\n Life is not a ladder with one species evolving and changing in a linear fashion. Life is more likely to split - sometimes several times. That is why there are 36 species of cat, 34 species of dog, several species of horse, and about 850,000 species of beetle (but there were only 4 beatles). There are still apes and so forth because populations evolved for long periods of time in different environments. Eventually they no longer interbreed.\n \nand no I have to problem with books.

I am lazy and have no need to continue on a fake list of madeup books, but you get the idea.\n\n If you are lazy, then perhaps you should be studying macrame or doing beadwork. The internet isn't a very good way to verify information in science. It is quite easy to post really bad science on the internet. I could give you links to people who believe that the earth is flat, or the the earth is the center of the universe, or that the earth is between 6,000 to 10,000 years old, or that millions of species were crammed into a big box and that the whole earth was flooded. Anyone can post nonsense that I can use to back up what I say.\n \n It is easy to check if the books are real. I'll show you. Here are the books I mentioned, this time they are links. Click them to see.\n \n Ian Tattersall and Jeffrey Schwartz, Extinct Humans, Westview Press, Boulder, 2000.\n \n Ian Tattersall, The Fossil Trail: How We Know What We Think We Know About Human Evolution, Oxford Universtity Press, Oxford, 1995.\n \n Ian Tattersall, Becoming Human: Evolution and Human Uniqueness, Harcourt Brace & Co., Orlando, 1998.\n \n Alan Walker and Pat Shipman, The Wisdom of the Bones: In Search of Human Origins, Random House, New York, 1997.\n \n Christopher Stringer and Robin McKie, African Exodus: The Origins of Modern Humanity, Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1996.\n \n Roger Lewin, Bones of Contention: Controversies in the Search for Human Origins, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1987.\n \n Not one invented book. If you had done some reading on the topic rather than surfing you might have recognized some of the names. For example, Ian Tattersall is Curator, Division of Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History; Adjunct Professor, Department of Anthropology, Columbia University; Adjunct Professor, PhD Program in Anthropology, CUNY.\n \nFor references simply look for sites in which your point is shown. easyer for both.\n\n And easier to fake by linking to really, really bad science. You need to understand that science isn't done on the internet. Science isn't a matter of what people think. It is a matter of explaining why observations happen, predicting the consequences and then testing the predictions. Science is \"published\" in science journals, where other scientists can review and verify it. But regular people don't usually read scientific journals. But some scientists write popular books to explain the prograss of science for non-scientists. The books I listed are some of them. I could go on for pages listing books about a variety of scientific topics.\n \n The problem with the internet is that it is sometimes hard to tell what is XXXX. But I did give you two sites with really good information. One was Fossil Hominids: The Evidence for Human Evolution - the Fossil Hominid FAQ at Talk Origins. The other was Becoming Human, a nice audio-visual presentation that might help. You didn't even respond to either of those.\n \n And, I gave you This site which pretty much addresses your question exactly. No comment from you. I suspect that you haven't looked at any of it.",
