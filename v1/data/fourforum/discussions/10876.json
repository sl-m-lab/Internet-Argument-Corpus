   "\n Belgian firearm manufacturer FN Herstal specializes in military and law enforcement weaponry but has also made its Five-Seven handgun available to private buyers in the United States. The Five-Seven includes a 20-round clip and is capable of firing ammunition that penetrates the body armor commonly worn by law enforcement officials. The FN Herstal website boasts that with the Five-Seven handgun, \"Enemy personnel, even wearing body armor can be effectively engaged up to 200 meters. Kevlar helmets and vests as well as the CRISAT protection will be penetrated.\" \n \n These new guns clearly have no sporting purpose and no place on our streets. We should not ignore the concerns of our law enforcement officers with regard to these dangerous weapons. \n \n The law enforcement community is most concerned about the Five-Seven's ability to kill police officers, even while wearing protective body armor. Bernard Thompson, Director of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives commented on the Five-Seven, \"No one is safe from a weapon like this. Police body armor won't offer protection if a criminal has this pistol.\" \n \n The Legislative Director of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers Steve Lenkhart called the Five-Seven \"an assault rifle that fits in your pocket.\" \n [/B]\n\n senate.gov/~levin/newsroom/release.cfm?id=232639\n \n I hope one thing we can all agree on is this weapon should be banned. Lets support our local police. They protect us and we can protect them by banning this weapon.",

Specifically, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Section 921(a)(17)(B), the term \"armor piercing ammunition\" means-\n \n a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or\n \n a full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile. \n \n FTB has also examined a 5.7 X 28 mm projectile that FN Herstal has designated the \"SS196.\" The SS196 is loaded with a Hornady 40 grain, jacketed lead bullet. FTB classified SS196 ammunition as not armor piercing ammunition under Federal firearms statutes. \n \n According to FNH USA, FN Herstal tested the SS192 ammunition. SS192 ammunition did not penetrate the Level IIIA vests that were tested. FNH USA states that SS196, Hornady V-Max 40 gr. bullets fired from a 4-3/4 inch barrel did not penetrate the Level II vests that were used in testing. \n \n FNH USA has informed FTB that SS192 is no longer imported for commercial sale to the United States and that commercial sales of 5.7 X 28mm ammunition are restricted to the SS196 (not armor piercing).\"",

It was already tested with ammuniton available to everyone and shown to penetrate body armor.\n\n \n \"A brief controversy ensued in the United States in 2004 when it was claimed by the Brady Campaign that the civilian-legal SS192 cartridges are able to pierce Level IIA body armor when fired from the Five-seveN pistol. All civilian-legal game hunting cartridges, and even several pistol cartridges, are capable of such penetration. The ability of SS192 to pierce body armor as claimed by the Brady Campaign was not confirmed with facts or data by any authoritative agencies or sources.

   "I'm not exactly a supporter of gun culture, but I do know some stuff about the Five-seveN. Mostly because it's conceived around the same 5.7 ammo as the P-90 PDW.\n \n Essentially, the smaller firearms, pistols and submachine guns, tend to use larger caliber, but shorter ammunition (9mm, .45, ...). These have good \"stopping power\", however, the lower propellant charge and blunt shape of the bullet make them less capable at penetrating personal armor. A rifle, any rifle, including hunting rifles, uses much smaller caliber (compare 5.56mm to 9mm), which is however much longer and has a much greater penetrating power.\n \n Essentially, take it liek this: a 9mm is short but fat, 9mm diameter alond the whole cartridge. 5.56 has a thin, sharp, bullet, but a broader and longer body which also contains more propellant, so it shoots the bullet out with much more force compared. The sharper bullet shape also helps penetration.\n \n With armor becoming more and more prevalent, FN Herstal desired to create a handgun/submachine gun cartridge that would be capable of penetrating armor. So they came up with the 5.7 cartridge, specifically designed to penetrate armor. \n \n Essentially, a sharp bullet with a short but thick body.\n \n \n However, the key to the armor penetration is the specific cartridge. The armor piercing property is bound to the specific ammo, not the gun itself. So, I'd say that if other handguns are on the market, the Five-seveN is just as guilty or innocent as they are. The armor piercing property is only granted by the specialized ammo.",
