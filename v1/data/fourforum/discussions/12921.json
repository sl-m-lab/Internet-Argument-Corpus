   "Ignoring Known Gun Traffickers, Corzine Targets Gun Rights Instead - Scott Bach\n \n You've got to wonder what Governor Corzine's political handlers are thinking these days.\n \n Amidst an epic financial crisis, they've apparently decided that portraying the Governor as a gun banner is a distraction needed to win re-election. But they haven't done their homework and have picked a discredited issue fabricated by the gun ban lobby that's going to badly misfire and embarrass the Governor, not only for what it focuses on, but also for what it ignores.\n \n Since winning the Democratic gubernatorial primary on June 2, the Governor has been publicly pressing to ration the Constitutional right of law-abiding citizens to obtain handguns under S1774, in effect holding them responsible for gun crime and illegal trafficking.\n \n No matter that they've been thoroughly investigated and pre-approved by the State before a purchase can take place. No matter that they may have already waited 6 months for purchase permits. No matter that the sales are registered with State and local law enforcement, so we'd know in a heartbeat if there were any truth to the phony claim that handguns purchased in legal, government-monitored multiple sales from New Jersey dealers are illegally trafficked or used in crime by their purchasers.\n \n Trying to reduce gun crime by rationing guns to honest citizens is a little like trying to reduce drunk driving by rationing cars to responsible drinkers. It's absurd. It targets the blameless and does nothing to address the conduct of actual wrongdoers.\n \n Gun rationing schemes like S1774 have been tried before in other states, but they have either been voided, repealed, or shown ineffective, since criminals bent on illegal trafficking can spread purchases among multiple buyers in lieu of a single buyer purchasing multiple guns.\n \n The claim by supporters of S1774 that State-certified law abiding New Jerseyans are magically transformed into violent criminals and illegal gun traffickers when they buy more than one handgun on the same day (after waiting months for permits) has been thoroughly discredited. These claims are based on deceptive parsing of statistics and disingenuous use of misunderstood ATF nomenclature, to falsely characterize guns recovered from house fires, floods, natural disasters, estates, and gun buybacks as \"crime guns.\"\n \n The only publicly available ATF statistics show, irrefutably, that less than one half of one percent of guns traced by ATF originated as New Jersey multiple handgun sales, which also means that more than 99% of traces originated as individual (not multiple) sales. There simply is no evidence that licensed multiple sales in New Jersey are trafficked or used in crime by their purchasers, and objective evidence demonstrates precisely the opposite.\n \n At the same time that Governor Corzine chooses to pursue restrictions on the rights of honest citizens, he completely ignores a well known and documented source of illegal gun trafficking and crime guns -- organized gun theft. One of the best known examples came last year, when an Eatontown, New Jersey FedEx worker was charged with stealing 146 handguns from legal shipments and illegally selling them in Jersey City and Newark - cities plagued by gun crime, whose ironic response has been to scapegoat law-abiding citizens as well.\n \n That incident, and others like it, should have been the Governor's wake-up call to deal with an actual source of illegal guns that needs to be meaningfully addressed. But instead of calling for laws mandating background checks on shipping employees who handle sensitive packages, or requiring special safeguards on those packages, the Governor is instead targeting our Constitutional rights, as if you and I are responsible for those guns hitting the streets in Newark and Jersey City. The Governor's response to the known source of those illegal guns? Deafening silence and incomprehensible inaction.\n \n It's a political blunder that's going to backfire badly on the Governor. He needs to go after the real source of illegal guns and leave the rest of us alone.",
