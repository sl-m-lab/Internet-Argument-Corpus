In a September of 1984 edition of The 700 Club, Robertson suggested that special church tribunals could be called upon to discern if a believer had in fact received an authentic word from God which compelled him to break a civil law. According to Robertson, if this church tribunal did determine the believer had in fact received an authentic message from God -- how they could reach this conclusion without issuing God a suboena wasn't made clear -- then, Robertson said, the church tribunal would have the civil authority to provide the believer with immunity from prosecution.\" (Gerard Thomas Straub, speech before the San Fernando Valley Chapter of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, September 11, 1995, quoted from Harry Schwartzbart, \"Pat Robertson Proposes Immunity From Prosecution For Criminals Who Commit Crimes On Instructions From God\", http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm) \n\n \n Thoughts of what these religious leaders are trying to do - on top of President Bush is trying to do - should convince atheists, agnostics, and members of minority religions here in the USA, to start signing up as members of the Freedom From Religion Foundation (www.ffrf.org).",

   "Intermediate between single-cell and multi-cell? What are your examples?\n\n \n Here's something I have stored in my personal notes.\n \n \n \n A couple of other perplexing evolutionary questions:\n \n 1) How could multicellularity arise?\n \n 2) How could sexual reproduction arise?\n \n It's not actually all that difficult to conceptualize a solution to the first: only two main steps are needed.\n \n \n 1a) Unicellular organisms clump together to form a colony: each individual is autonomous and identical\n \n 1b) Some of the cells in the clump differentiate: for example, some become specialized for reproduction\n \n \n \n A series for the second question might be more difficult to conceptualize, but we can at least cover a good deal of it.\n \n 2a) Meiosis arises (the part not explained here)\n \n 2b) Two identical haploid gametes - which swim by means of flagella - merge to form a new individual\n \n 2c) The two swimming gametes produced come to be of different sizes, but otherwise are still fundamentally alike\n \n 2d) The larger, less mobile gamete loses its flagellum and becomes immobile\n \n 2e) The large, immobile gamete becomes specialized for storing nutrients and cytoplasmic determinants, while the other, mobile gamete becomes specialized for delivering just a nucleus\n \n \n \n And lucky for us, we can even see such intermediate forms, for both 1 and 2, in a single group of organisms!\n \n \n\"The Volvocaceans\n \n The simpler organisms among the volvocaceans are ordered assemblies of numerous cells, each resembling the unicellular protist Chlamydomonas, to which they are related (Figure 2.11A). A single organism of the volvocacean genus Gonium (Figure 2.11B), for example, consists of a flat plate of 4 to 16 cells, each with its own flagellum. In a related genus, Pandorina, the 16 cells form a sphere (Figure 2.11C); and in Eudorina, the sphere contains 32 or 64 cells arranged in a regular pattern (Figure 2.11D). In these organisms, then, a very important developmental principle has been worked out: the ordered division of one cell to generate a number of cells that are organized in a predictable fashion. As occurs during cleavage in most animal embryos, the cell divisions by which a single volvocacean cell produces an organism of 4 to 64 cells occur in very rapid sequence and in the absence of cell growth.\n \n The next two genera of the volvocacean series exhibit another important principle of development: the differentiation of cell types within an individual organism. The reproductive cells become differentiated from the somatic cells. In all the genera mentioned earlier, every cell can, and normally does, produce a complete new organism by mitosis. In the genera Pleodorina and Volvox, however, relatively few cells can reproduce. In Pleodorina californica (Figure 2.11E), the cells in the anterior region are restricted to a somatic function; only those cells on the posterior side can reproduce. In P. californica, a colony usually has 128 or 64 cells, and the ratio of the number of somatic cells to the number of reproductive cells is usually 3:5. Thus, a 128-cell colony typically has 48 somatic cells, and a 64-cell colony has 24.\n \n In Volvox, almost all the cells are somatic, and very few of the cells are able to produce new individuals. In some species of Volvox, reproductive cells, as in Pleodorina, are derived from cells that originally look and function like somatic cells before they enlarge and divide to form new progeny. However, in other members of the genus, such as V. carteri, there is a complete division of labor: the reproductive cells that will create the next generation are set aside during the division of the original cell that is forming a new individual. The reproductive cells never develop functional flagella and never contribute to motility or other somatic functions of the individual; they are entirely specialized for reproduction. Thus, although the simpler volvocaceans may be thought of as colonial organisms (because each cell is capable of independent existence and of perpetuating the species), in V. carteri we have a truly multicellular organism with two distinct and interdependent cell types (somatic and reproductive), both of which are required for perpetuation of the species (Figure 2.11F). Although not all animals set aside the reproductive cells from the somatic cells (and plants hardly ever do), this separation of germ cells from somatic cells early in development is characteristic of many animal phyla and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 19.\n \n Although all the volvocaceans, like their unicellular relative Chlamydomonas, reproduce predominantly by asexual means, they are also capable of sexual reproduction, which involves the production and fusion of haploid gametes. In many species of Chlamydomonas, including the one illustrated in Figure 2.10, sexual reproduction is isogamous (\"the same gametes\"), since the haploid gametes that meet are similar in size, structure, and motility. However, in other species of Chlamydomonasas well as many species of colonial volvocaceans swimming gametes of very different sizes are produced by the different mating types. This pattern is called heterogamy (\"different gametes\"). But the larger volvocaceans have evolved a specialized form of heterogamy, called oogamy, which involves the production of large, relatively immotile eggs by one mating type and small, motile sperm by the other (see Sidelights and Speculations). Here we see one type of gamete specialized for the retention of nutritional and developmental resources and the other type of gamete specialized for the transport of nuclei. Thus, the volvocaceans include the simplest organisms that have distinguishable male and female members of the species and that have distinct developmental pathways for the production of eggs or sperm. In all the volvocaceans, the fertilization reaction resembles that of Chlamydomonas in that it results in the production of a dormant diploid zygote, which is capable of surviving harsh environmental conditions. When conditions allow the zygote to germinate, it first undergoes meiosis to produce haploid offspring of the two different mating types in equal numbers. \"\n (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=dbio.section.203)\n \n",

If I've made an assertion, trebor will be able to find it. \n \n I asked whether he was saying that god didn't do it, and he proceeded into argument. To me that means that he's taking up that position. \n \n \nSame question - same answer. What trebor is saying is that there is no evidence, one way or the other. And yet, you are demanding proof of a negative assertion. It's just not logical. \n\n Of course it's logical of me to ask for proof. He's apparently trying to argue that god didn't do it. He not only started into argument, but also recall he stated:\n \nI don't believe there is any deity what so ever.\n\n From this it appears that he isn't merely unsure about the existence of god, but actively disbelieves it. \n \n \n I suspect that trebor can. The answer is that there is no evidence either for or against the existence of your god. Obviously, you can't present any.\n But he didn't make that claim. What he is saying is that because you \"feel\" that your god exists isn't evidence. Neither is the existence of the universe evidence for your god. \n\n Trebor's position is one that you may not like, but it's one that he's gotten himself into. You may think that it's an illogical position to take, but perhaps you are underestimating trebor. If he is atheistic, and he'd like to defend that position, then who do you presume to be to say that he shouldn't argue it? If you don't think he should argue it, then perhaps you should be talking to him; after all, it is his position that you seem to think is completely untenable.\n \n \n Really. Try to understand the arguments logically. If you think that you have evidence that you are correct, then please present it. \n\n I understand every argument quite well, thank you. If trebor thinks I have asserted something (i.e., something to be \"correct\" about), he'll quote me. \n \n You've made your points, and if trebor wants to use any of them, he certainly can follow through himself. Now, please go away, unless you'd like to take up trebor's position (which, all evidence suggests, you think is hopeless).",

Let him show us already that god didn't do it. If he can't demonstrate it, then he should be retracting his implication that god didn't do it.\n Trebor already said that I was trying to shift the burden to him inappropriately, so I'm not sure what you are adding to his argument.

(If I misinterpret your position, feel free to clarify.) My position is that if there is no evidence of X, then it is reasonable to conclude that there is no logical reason to believe in the existence of X. This takes no faith. (Consider definition #2 at Dictionary.com: \"2. Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence.\") Rather, it takes reason and logic.\n \n Now, if one were to claim that \"It is 100% certain that X does not exist!\" then we would ask them to produce evidence to back up that statement. I think this is probably where you are coming from. As far as I can see, no one on this thread has suggested that it is 100% certain that X does not exist. As far as I can see, others are saying essentially the same thing that I'm saying: \"There is no logical reason to conclude that X exists if there is no evidence that X exists.\" It is still possible that X exists.

It makes no difference to me what the title of the thread or board is, invalid reasoning is still invalid reasoning. And I will point it out when I see it.

It is not as though we have had multiple experiences of existence and have had experiential evidence in those cases.\n \n \n \n On the same note, even if I do not recognize the shape of the holes, I still have reason to believe that they were caused by something which I know exists and creates holes, and I therefore have reason to disbelieve that it is a vampire bite. \n\n Again, the analogy doesn't seem to hold together. What if nothing you knew created holes? Wouldn't you be the least bit tempted to guess that perhaps there was something unknown creating the holes? I think part of the problem here is that the analogy isn't strong enough.\n \n \n It served as a comparison between an idea which has scientific evidence supporting it, and one which does not. My argument was surely understandable without such a comparison, but I thought it would be a relevant point on a thread which started by comparing creationism and evolution. . \n\n Well, I'm going to ignore it.",

Your position goes a bit further than what I have stated. You are correct in my opinion, 'goddidit' is ultimately an unwillingness to face any rational answer.

They declare that the mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen is historically accurate, in every detail that they selectively recognize (while rejecting the obvious contradictions).

   " toby, you have not responded to my question in post 110 in the grounds that you deem the question irrelevant. i am granting myself the same privellege. at my discretion, i can deem any question you pose as irrelevant and not respond \n\n That's a mature technique. Didn't you leave out the nanny-nanny boo-boo, though? I challenged you to show the relevance of your questions in #110 by showing a relevant quote. You could not. I do quote you and show the relevance. I notice that you only take your mature stance of fallacious irrelevance now. I wonder why not earlier. I guess that's all part of the mature debating technique on which you are schooling me. So far the mature debating technique has the following steps:\n \n Step 1: Arrogantly get involved with a debate without knowing what is being debated, or what arguments have already been made.\n Step 2: When admonished, reluctantly skim the history, missing the salient points, and maintain your erroneous assumptions. See the trail of dismissed challenges, yet arrogantly plow ahead having no thought as to how to answer the arguments made. At no point, read and comprehend the sister thread in the religion forum. \n Step 3: Employ patronizing ad hominem to poison your opponent's well and proclaim the intellectual high ground. \n Step 4: Attempt to change the debate by baiting your opposition with non-sequiturs. \n Step 5: Complain that your opposition doesn't answers those non-sequiturs, however hypocritically don't answer relevant questions put to you.\n Step 6: Use the mature argument of whose questions came first; don't argue the relevance issue. Later when it's hopeless, in an attempt to get the last word unopposed, employ the non-argument argument (of claiming relevance having no way of supporting the claim). \n Step 7: Having failed to do your homework, employ ad hominem circumstantial via a skit which labels your opponent, but does so erroneously. Fallaciously forecast your opponent's argument. \n Step 8: Patronize your opposition by utilizing another poster's answer and posturing that the question had already been answered. When challenged, deny that the other poster speaks for you. (I agree: The exclamation marks were my fault.)\n Step 9: Employ the fallacy of hedging (\"not necessarily\"). \n Step 10: When your positions unravels, employ the very mature technique of taking your ball and going crying home to mommy.\n \n \n irrelevant. this has nothing to do with the discussion\n\n Mommy.\n \n \n this is irrelevant\n\n Mommy.\n \n \n wrong. i am not obligated to entertain or addreass any beliefs you have invented on my behalf. you cannot invent beliefs on my behalf. i need not respond because your presumptions are irrelevant. besides, this is not a thread about scientific notation. please stay on topic\n\n I already have said that you needn't address my claims; let them go unopposed. I can make any claim I choose. It isn't my fault that you have not considered the implications of what you say. The failure to consider the implications is a hallmark of mature debate. After all, in mature debate one really can be totally unprepared, since one can rely upon fallacious steps 1 through 10 to subdue any opponent.\n \n \n until you can post something that is relevant to this topic, do not expect any replies from me. i refuse to carry on a discussion with someone that keeps creating irrelevant assertions and asking irrelevant questions\n\n Your objection is fallacious. What irrelevant assertions have I created? What irrelevant questions have I asked? Quote me. \n My \"claims\" are not at all off topic. That you don't understand the relevance doesn't mean there is none. This fallacy of arrogance is a hallmark of mature debate. Instead of merely asking for the relevance, you assume there is none. My \"claims\" attempt to show that you don't understand the implications of your position: That if the claimant of a negative claim does not have the burden of proof, he can create all kinds of idiotic claims that are essentially impossible to defeat. \n \n Your (apparent) position that the claimant is burdened only if it his claim could be logically supported (when proving such a claim is not illogical) is lunacy. You seem to be arguing that the more idiotic the claim, the less liable the claimant should be. That's makes zero sense to me. People should not be rewarded for making idiotic claims. Nobody is being forced to make a negative claim. If a negative claim is folly, then I can see no logical reason why such claimants should be bailed out.\n \n An additional problem with assignment of burden to the \"affirmative position\" is that it assumes that the \"affirmative position\" is the necessary counter to a negative claim. In this case of \"god didn't do it\", the objection may be epistemological. If that is the case, it may be that the assumed \"affirmative position\" (god did do it) also has epistemological problems. In this case, the \"affirmative position\" is in a double bind: he cannot argue epistemologically against the claimant's position without sabotaging the \"affirmative position\" as well. This is doubly bad, because the claimant is under no compunction to defend his position, since the burden has been shifted to the \"affirmative position\". It is triply bad, because the claimant can then just self-immolate (deny his own position) and win the debate on epistemological grounds. Therefore, in general there should be no assumption that the \"affirmative position\" exists, until such a claim is made. An affirmative position is one alternative to counter a negative claim, but not the only one.\n \n If placing the burden of proof on the claimant of \"god didn't do it\" is repugnant, consider the analogous case for the claim \"the big bang didn't do it\". In the latter case, is the opponent forced into the position of \"the big bang did it\" and has the burden of proof on him? Well, we can't have it both ways.",

   "i would like to introduce my opinion that both the creation theory and the evolution theory are correct and can exist toghther.\n\n But that's an old, often \"introduced\", and well debunked opinion. One reason that you are wrong is that you are using the word \"theory\" with two different meanings, since the theory of creation is a religious assertion and the theory of evolution is a scientific concept. In other words, you are using both the common definition of the word (a guess or speculation) in the case of creation theory, and a set of statement or principles devised and tested that explain a group of facts or phenomena. Actually, the creation theory isn't even a theory in the vernacular sense, since it is a religious assertion based on unobserved, untested dogma.\n \n Most creationists rank ideas in the order of their importance as follows: Hypotheses -< Theories -< Laws -< Facts. Most creationists don't realize, and even when they are told refuse to accept that scientists rank the importance differently: Facts -< Hypotheses -< Laws -< Theories.\n \n Let me say that again so that I'm sure that you understand what I'm saying. The common use of the word theory refers to a wild guess that is unsupported by any empirical observation. In science, a theory is as good as it gets - a theory is predictive and has been strictly tested and found correct.\n \n Some examples of scientific theories are the theory of gravity, the germ theory of disease, the heliocentric theory, atomic theory, nuclear theory (that is used to build bombs and run nuclear power plants), the theory of relativity, plate tectonic theory, and of course, the big bang theory.\n \ni seek to bring in another reference. in many eastern faiths, the supreme being created the universe and it did not take him billions of HIS/HER years but a shor time. notce i said HIS or HER time. this is because a short period of HIS or HER time would be billions of years on earth. \n \n the source for this information is any one of the 18 major Puranas - Hindu texts.\nI don't see how your sources are any more relevant to science than are any other religious assertions.\n \npressing on, if a person is creating some project such as a statue or a house, would there not be a simple foundation before details can be added? this explains any evidence that can suggest that we descended from simpler forms of \"life.\" think about it.\nSo the creator isn't omnipotent? He/She/It is restricted in the manner of creation? And from the construction of some of the details, it appears that the creator was drunk at least part of the time.\n \ni leave quoting Albert Einstein:\n \n \"When i see the glories of the cosmos I can't help but feel that there is a divine hand involved.\"\nSomeone already pointed out that Einstein wasn't referring to the standard creationist god. You'll have to look up Spinoza's concepts of god to understand. Spinoza was expelled from the Jewish community for his heretical ideas.\n \n P.S. By the way, the religious mythology of creation of any faith is neither credible nor a theory.",

And the evening and the morning were the second day.\n 3rd day - And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n 4th day - 6 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day\n 5th day - it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\n 6th day - THIS IS WHERE WE COME IN!! YAY! And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. 31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. \n THEN THE 7TH DAY .... God rested. because he saw all was good.\n \n \n Let me point out some discrepancies in this genesis account of 6-day creation (+ 1 day of rest):\n 1) The creation of the Moon on the 4th day is out of place with the creation of seed plants on the 3rd day, since we now know that Moon rock dates at 4 1/2 billion years while seed bearing plants came much later during the Mesozoic Era less than 1/4 billion years ago.\n 2) Fish, being created on the 5th day, are out of sequence here with seed plants on the 3rd day since the earliest fish date to the Cambrian period 1/2 billion years ago.\n 3) Reptiles that \"creepeth upon the Earth\" on the 6th day are out of sequence with the fowl that fly on the 5th day, since birds descended from theropod dinosaurs 150,000 years ago, well over 100,000 years after reptiles first took to land.\n \n Gee, this account isn't very accurate for the inerrant word of God. It can't get the sequence right, and the time frame is so far off as to be laughable were it not for the fact that some people actually believe this biblical account.",
