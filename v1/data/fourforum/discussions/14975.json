   "Guns: Doctor's office no place for anti-gun politics - South Florida Sun-Sentinel.com\n \n \nDo you own a gun? How many guns do you have? Do your children have access to guns in your home? Did you know that having a gun in your home triples your risk of becoming a homicide victim?\n \n These are questions your doctor may ask you or your children as part of routine physical examinations or questionnaires. These are ethical boundary violations that violate privacy rights of patients and families.\n \n Gun-related questions in doctors' offices are based on a medical political movement against gun owners. That movement is led by the American Academy of Pediatrics, although the AMA and other physician groups have launched similar efforts against gun owners.\n \n Sometimes a doctor is right to ask a patient about guns in the home. A mentally disturbed patient who has expressed intent to do harm would be an example where such intervention is justified. But in most cases, questions about guns do not reflect a physician's concern about gun safety. Rather, they are intended to prejudice impressionable and trusting children and their parents into thinking that guns are somehow bad.\n \n That political motive makes these questions ethically wrong. Any doctor who asks them is committing a form of unethical conduct known as an ethical boundary violation. And any doctor who commits an ethical boundary violation should be disciplined.\n \n Patients who file written complaints with respective state consumer agencies are rare, compared to the number of patients whose rights are abused. Patients fear retaliation from their doctors and medical staffs. Those fears are not unfounded.\n \n Patients/families have been verbally abused and chastised by doctors and medical staffs for refusing to answer gun questions. Doctors have even denied care to children whose parents have refused to be submissive to these ethical boundary privacy violations.\n \n In reality, state agencies rarely do anything other than notifying a doctor of a complaint - creating an even more hostile environment.\n \n Patients and families shouldn't have to suffer in silence. They shouldn't be intimidated or coerced into disclosing personal information about their gun ownership to politically motivated doctors.\n \n Unethical doctors who abuse your trust to advance a political agenda against law-abiding gun owning families must be stopped.\n\n \n No more citing of the New England Journal of Medicine when it comes to talk of gun control. Doctors aren't qualified to make any form of judgment on the matter.",

These people are doctors, physicians. Doctors are trained in only one area and that area is medicine. That's the only thing a doctor is qualified to handle.

They're not qualified to be making any sort of determination regarding \"proper storage and handling of firearms\" as they call it.

'As written, the bill is absolutely unacceptable, and we will fight it,' said FMA general counsel Jeff Scott.\n\n \n I personally don't see any justified authority for allowing any doctor to invade a patient's privacy and ask personal questions regarding how they exercise their constitutional rights. Such standards would be quickly shot down if doctors were asking their patients if they chose to practice hinduism rather than christianity. We'd never stand for a questionnaire asking patients if they supported an amnesty program or a closed border policy.

   "ALERT:\n \n Gun Owners of America - Gun Owners Of America \n \n \n \nTuesday, February 1, 2011\n \n \n Things are happening fast and furiously in connection with our efforts to destroy the anti-gun ObamaCare law.\n \n This law would allow the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to troll a national medical database in order to impose gun bans on persons with ailments such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\n For this reason, GOA has been working with Congress to ensure that this abomination is not just \"tweaked,\" but totally repealed.\n \n Here are some recent developments:\n \n ObamaCare Declared Unconstitutional In A Lawsuit Brought By 26 States\n \n In a massive blow to the Obama administration's socialist anti-gun agenda, Florida federal district judge Roger Vinson held on Monday that ObamaCare was unconstitutional and \"non-severable.\" This means that, if the decision is upheld, the entire law goes into the trash bin. \n \n The Obama administration will appeal Judge Vinson's decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta -- one of the more conservative circuits. Ultimately, the case is expected to be decided by the Supreme Court.\n \n When GOA first became involved in fighting ObamaCare during the winter of 2009, at least a half-dozen Republican senators were cosponsoring the \"individual mandate\" that all Americans must buy insurance. And many more were thought to believe it was a good idea. GOA members throughout the country blasted GOP senators like Utah's Bob Bennett for their support of the mandate, and ultimately forced moderate Republicans to reverse their support for it -- setting the stage for a united GOP to attack ObamaCare on the basis of its unconstitutional mandate. \n \n House Repeal Bill Brought Onto The Senate Calendar\n \n At the urging of GOA, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has used the provisions of the Senate rules to bring the House-passed ObamaCare repeal bill, H.R. 2, directly onto the Senate calendar. At this point, it is possible for ANY senator to move that the Senate take up this bill at any time.\n \n All 47 Republicans Cosponsor DeMint Repeal Bill\n \n A close friend of GOA, Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC), has introduced Senate legislation to repeal ObamaCare. That bill is comparable to H.R. 2, which passed the House. All 47 Senate Republicans have agreed to cosponsor the DeMint bill -- meaning that the Republican Party is united behind the ObamaCare repeal and the Democratic Party is nearly united in support of ObamaCare.\n \n ObamaCare Repeal Test Votes To Occur This Week\n \n The first Senate vote on ObamaCare repeal will occur on a McConnell amendment which will be offered to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill, S. 223, which is currently pending in the Senate. \n \n Unfortunately, this is not an ideal strategy. Even if the McConnell amendment were adopted, it could be objected to by the House because it would be a Senate-initiated revenue bill, in contravention of the constitutional requirement that such a bill originate in the House.\n \n Furthermore, anti-gun liberal Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has indicated that he would pepper the FAA bill with amendments highlighting the \"popular\" provisions of ObamaCare. Schumer indicated, on Sunday talk shows, that his intention was to turn the ObamaCare repeal effort into \"Swiss cheese.\"\n \n It would have been better for McConnell to simply move to proceed to the House bill. \n \n Nevertheless, this is the hand we've been dealt. And the significance of this test vote is huge, as we'll begin to see where wobbly senators stand. \n \n",

   "Truth-O-Meter:\n \n Conclusion, \"we find that claim false\".PolitiFact Florida | Florida lawmaker suggests doctors can use gun information against you\n\n \n Ok, so they found the claim to be False, But then again this is another Biased Web site hell bent on doing whatever they can to repeal health care. \n \n The ACTUAL Law says... And I quote...\n \n The health care law and guns\n \n So much can be revealed by simply reading the health care law, formally called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Or if that's too much -- just try searching for keywords. We accessed the final version of the law through the White House's web site.\n \n Then we searched for the word \"gun.\"\n \n Here's what we found: \"(c) PROTECTION OF SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS.\" So we read on.\n \n The gun provision of the law has two main thrusts -- that no one in the government can use the health care law to collect gun information and that insurance companies cannot adjust their rates because someone owns a gun.\n \n \"A premium rate may not be increased, health insurance coverage may not be denied, and a discount, rebate, or reward offered for participation in a wellness program may not be reduced or withheld under any health benefit plan issued pursuant to or in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or an amendment made by that Act on the basis of, or on reliance upon -- (A) the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition; or (B) the lawful use or storage of a firearm or ammunition,\" the law reads in part.\n \n That gun language was added by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid specifically to placate gun owners, who argued that the health care law could be used as a way for the federal government to create a national gun registry or charge gun owners more for insurance. So to avoid any (more) backlash about the law, Reid included a provision to further protect gun owners from either seeing their insurance rates increase, or from having their names collected and entered into some federal gun owner database. \n \n This came from your source, it clearly says there is nothing in the Bill to effect Guns or Gun owners. They are not Creating a new Data base or Registry, this is a Conspiracy started by Politicians to fight against their own Ideas of what Health Care should be. \n \n Their Conclusion is wrong, and they probably know it but won't admit it.",

If you're treating someone for Chron's Disease you don't ask them about whether or not they supported the taxpayer funded bailout of companies like GM.\n\n \n BUT their right to free association DOES.

If you walk into a doctors office and the guy is a jerk and does not want to do business with you for whatever reason, the solution is to go to another doctor, NOT to go insane and try to pass a law that curtails one of his FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS in order to keep him from being a jerk to somebody else.\n \n I also find this reprehensible because it is essentially a tempest in a teacup. The doctor in this case did not refuse to treat anybody because they owned guns. They kicked an unruly jerk out of their waiting room for making a scene about a question on the intake form. Now we want to pass a law curtailing EVERY doctors right to free association because one guy had to find a different doctor because he was a jerk in a waiting room.\n \n If knee jerk, rights curtailing legislation in response to isolated incidents is a logical response in your book, why dont you team up with brady and start lobbying for a high capacity mag ban in response to the shootings in arizona?

Some guy had to go to a different doctor. It is not like there is only one to choose from. \n \n This is really reshaping my view of second amendment supporters. I have always honestly believed that most second amendment supporters respected people rights and frankly were more concerned with the preservation and exercise of those rights than a lot of other people.

NOTFDB He doesn't have the right to ask if you exercise a right or does borrowing form the gov't tie you guys up with an obligation to be a good snitch? It is NOYFB either! Driving a vehicle with exempt federal plates don't exempt you from State law either. You still have to get a D.L. and State inspection stickers. Do you feel a great obligation to the government or the taxpayer out of whose pocket it came and was so graciously bestowed upon you? When you go into a government controlled business and use and accept their monies you automatically come under several acts such as civil rights acts, 1983,1986 and become an EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER...no discrimination. You don't lose your rights but you sure can't interfere with others' rights. What purpose is served by finding out if a patient owns a gun and will the next thing be lists of serial numbers, make and model? \n \n \n Yes, they can refuse to treat somebody because of their personal bias. My doctor refuses to provide abortions. Same thing. You have the right in this country to choose who you associate with.\n \n \n So according to your 'wisdom', Blacks can be denied service and made to ride in the back of the bus and women can be treated like the Taliban do because that is \"your right\". I don't know what abortions have to do with it. Do you need one?\n \n \nBS. First of all, only about 1% of hospitals in this country are taxpayer funded. Second, hospitals rarely keep pediatricians on staff. Different doctors have privileges at the hospital. They do not WORK for the hospital. \n \n \n You seem to forget that AMA had to fire a director and bow to the Doctors' For Integrity in Medical Research and CDC was prohibited from running any more \"gun studies\". On your claim of hospital funding, every darn one of them is paid for by some taxpayer either by force or voluntarily. If, big IF, what you say is true, why do you want obamanation care controlled entirely by the government? None of my buddies do!\n \n \n \nThe judges ruling on had nothing at all to do with Obamacare and gun control.\n\n \n Who said it did? Two separate issues in this case which was backed by 26 States. I thought you were a 2A advocate and WTH does that have to do with medical care unless it is forced upon you like they are currently trying now with the FAA bill? Good attempt at a strawman and false delimma though, do keep it up.\n \n \n \nDoc, It is pretty rare that I do this to anybody, but I think I am going to put you on my ignore list. You are simply not bright enough to waste time on. You have a worse understanding of the concept of rights than anybody I have ever met. You have no understanding or comprehension of the constitution whatsoever. Your post essentially consist of one ignorance soaked conspiracy theory after another and frankly we are all dumber for reading them. \n \n \n If you can't take the heat it is a good idea to stay out of the kitchen. Ad Homs are your forte and your attempt to twist logic to the point of pretending to quote other people with your own words are legend. No, that apology was not enough. \n \n \nOn a more personal note, I really truly do hope that you get some help for your mental problems. I am sure that with the proper therapy and medication you can become a reasonable and productive member of society.\n \n \n Keep pretending antipodean. I already been a productive member of society for longer than you will live. I can see you know squat about the Psychiatry also. Bear in mind this is a gun board and you are not a licensed, specialized doctor of any type much less a 2a and XIVth Amendment supporter of rights. You statements above basically say doctors can infringe on your 2A rights by asking questions that may harm you or even kill you...segments of society have more \"rights\" than others LOL You have freedom of association so don't let the doorknob catch you in the rump on the way out. :)\n \n \nGood Luck!!\n\n \n Your false sincerity is underwhelming.",

   "?Say ?Ahhh.? Does Daddy Have A Gun? | The Barr Code\n \n \nSB 432, a bill passed last week by the Florida Senate, will stop doctors from prying into the private lives of families by asking children or their parents if there is a gun in the home. This effort has paired unlikely partners - the National Rifle Association and the Florida Medical Association. These groups have worked to improve the legislation.\n \n Reflecting the fact that occasionally a doctor may see a patient he considers to be potentially suicidal, the legislation was modified to provide an exception to the prohibited questions in such cases. The bill also has been amended to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage or increasing a premium based on the fact the person owns a gun.\n Of course, the AAP doesn't like this legislation. But this hardly is surprising, considering the organization openly supported the city of Chicago's draconian anti-gun ordinance that last year was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court - a ruling the child doctors found \"distressing.\" To them, the appropriate solution to children being harmed by firearms is simply to \"get guns out of their homes, their neighborhoods and where they play.\"\n \n Apparently, the Hippocratic Oath taken by these pediatricians includes a footnote to ignore the Second Amendment guaranteeing Americans the right to own a firearm.\n",

All they're upset about is that their nearly unlimited authority is going to be restricted. It doesn't matter over what that their authority is going to be cut, all they care is that it's going to happen.\n \n Have you ever met a doctor before? They're arrogant and have a god-like ego.

The \"43 times more likely\" argument is debunked and has been for a long time. Dr. Kellerman tried pulling those shenanigans in a cheap attempt to get women to not allow guns in the home because we'd supposedly be shot first before any home intruder. Nobody buys it anymore, even Kellerman doesn't agree with it anymore.\n \n The board rules specifically mention that lies aren't allowed in debate. And as many times as you've posted Kellerman and his work and been informed of its debunked nature you have absolutely no reason to believe it's anything but a lie. And as such you've been reported for violating the board rules.\n \n \n\"If the law passes, parents could report doctors who inquire about gun ownership to the Florida State Medical Board.

If the doctors feel that there's an imminent threat to the wellbeing oe the child, so imminent in fact that they feel compelled to ask about gun ownership, shouldn't be feel it necessary to ask about anything that could lead to harm? Shouldn't the doctor also ask about safety belt use, the type of cleaning chemicals in the home and where they're stored, if all the kitchen knives are out of reach, if all the blinds have cords strung up out of reach, or if there are sufficient obstacles that would prevent said child from falling down the stairs?\n \n If the arrogant doctors feel that a child is in even the most remote of potential danger then the law requires them to alert the police and Child Protect Services immediately and let them handle it. The doctor's office is a place of medicine only and nothing else.\n \n \nSo is this proposed law really a good idea?\n\n \n Yes it is. There are laws against malpractice and they should be expanded to include improper questioning. As others have told you before Galileo gun ownership is a constitutional right. Gun ownership isn't an indicator of anything wrong anymore than ownership of the christian Bible would. There's no secret standard of review that would suggest gun owners are more likely to commit harm to their children than non-gun owners. You can't just look at the gun and say \"That's all we need to know, you're a reckless danger to your own child\" it doesn't work that way.",

   "I wonder if they also ask questions about uncovered swiming pools and if cabinets with chemicals are easily accessible (many more deaths from drowning in a pool or poisonings among children than there are gun accidents). I'm guessing not. \n\n \n Why, yes, in fact, they did. The question was part of a form from the AAP that was given to parents who had kids and included all kinds of questions. The form was intended to help doctors identify and discuss possible dangers around the house with the kids parents...mostly first time parents. \n \n If you are a first time parent, you may not realize, for example, that as soon as your little bundle of joy graduates to being a toddler, everything closer to the ground than about 4 ft becomes their domain...and within a few months they will have learned to climb as well. At that point the 1911 you keep in your desk drawer suddenly becomes a serious hazard for the kid, because it takes them about 90 seconds to figure out that if they stand in the bottom desk drawer they can reach the neat stuff you undoubtedly have stashed in the top one. \n \n Personally I disagree with the entire thing...just like I disagree with the parenting classes that most OBGYN's send their expectant mothers (and the dad) to. Stupid people are likely to have stupid kids. The world is probably better off if they DONT get the parenting class and kill off little johnny before he can become big johnny the welfare king. Face it, if you cant figure out how to change a diaper, you are a retard who should not have kids anyway. \n \n \nThey certainly never had at any of the ones I have been to (although many asked about guns).\n\n \n \n Could you name a couple of those, please?? I would be interested in calling them and finding out why they were asking for that information. In the case in florida, the doctor was using a standard form from the american academy of pediatrics...but that only came out in 2008. Prior to that I cant seem to find any reference anywhere to physicians asking about gun ownership. If there were some doing it, I would be interested in contacting them to find out why. \n \n As far as the program that launched this particularly stupid bit of outrage, if they answered \"yes\" to the gun question, they were given a pamphlet. Here is the description of the pamphlet from the promotional material:\n \n \n\"Your Child is On the Move:\n Reduce the Risk of Gun Injury\"\n Discusses guns as a household safety issue, to be\n addressed with other household hazards. This\n brochure advises parents on how to protect their\n newly mobile babies from gun injury as they explore\n their surroundings.\n\n \n Pretty brutal stuff there. \n \n I cant believe how many nitwits are so upset about this.",

You promote a bias and try to defend it any way you can all of which are unconstitutional. The doctors, all 3, ran head on into the 10th Amendment.

If they did, doctors would first focus on their own practice as over 150,000 die each year from medical mistakes. You are 9 times more likely to die at the hands of a doctor or hospital than you are from any gun related activity. The doctors can talk all day long if they want, they just can't force you to divulge your business to them nor expect your medical records to be safe digitally stored in a distant location viewable by all.\n \n Citi Bank was hacked recently and all customer information was stolen, IDENTITY THEFT. This is the same kind of scam the brady bunch wants to use the doctors for. Would you trust Dr. John Edwards alone with your wife or daughters much less their trusted information?

State of Georgia ruled, \"broken into in any way\". So NO, doctors do not enjoy any special considerations for a political agenda and like politicians they are NOT above the law to invade your rights excusing themselves by parroting free speech...that is a two edged sword.\n \n brady and vpc picked the wrong venue again, government cannot require speech either since you have the right to remain silent and exactly what crime are you committing by refusing to answer probing political questions?\n \n You are off your rocker star gazer and out of your league and been brainwashed by the gun grabbers in their frenzy for any type of victory since their membership is dwindling like a brief shower on a sunny, hot day.",

If you don't like it then find another doctor\n\n \n \nWorse yet, these groups have even called on their members to ask young children about the guns their parents may own. These questions have often been followed up with lectures on the \"dangers\" of a gun in the home, usually citing pseudo-science studies published by anti-gun researchers.\n - Chris W. Cox\n \n So star gazer, do I need to remind you for the umpteenth time that Dr. Spock's own son committed suicide when he was 18? \n \n Spock wrote books detailing child rearing that was eagerly bought, digested and practiced by parents of several generations. I for one, questioned the good doctor and found many things wrong with his methods and child rearing in general. As it turned out, I was right and raised mentally stable children who are successful in both love and life.\n \n I am not buying a cents worth of what AAP is peddling, meddling and trying to fight a cultural and political war from an imaginary pedestal while dressed in a smock of the trade and preying on children and teaching them to spy on their parents and answer questions to inherently unstable people with an agenda...to demonize a perfectly legal and Constitutional RIGHT under the guise of practicing medicine.",
