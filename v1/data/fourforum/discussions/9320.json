   "Hi, i used to be homophobic up until about 3 years ago, and no, it wasn't me that came out the closet, it was my brother lol. I was always making fun of gay men and totally denied that they were genuine. I feel bad that I was like that now because my brother had to live with that and he is still ashamed to admit it. He actually wishes he weren't gay (he's never had gay sex before) but gay tendancies is the only thing he's known his whole life. He can't remember ever fancying a girl, he's 19 now. I still am a bit homophobic (in the physical sense, not verbally), I can't help it, but I still want to understand. What is it that makes a person gay? I used to think that it was feelings that went a bit perverted and out of controll but now I don't know at all (e.g. it could be biological). I especially want to know now because my brother fighting his urges is causing him depresion. Plus, he can't really become fully gay because of his religion. Any comments?",

   "My thought is for you to educate yourself and not here. Seek out the real science about homosexuality from real sources. My suggestions on the science? Start here...http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/09/60minutes/main1385230.shtml\n \n As for what does it feels like? It feels like everyone else? Homosexuals are attracted to the same sex in the same way you are attracted to the opposite sex. Simply enough if you would like to understand, think about yourself in reverse.\n \n Do you only like the opposite sex for sex? I doubt it.\n What do you seek in a relationship? So do gays\n The world makes this way more complicated than it is...and fills it with misconceptions. The simple way to see it.....everything you might feel about the opposite sex....gays feel for the same sex.\n \n Being gay isn't about sex, it is about who you want to spend your life with......\n \n As for the religion I think everyone has to make their own peace with god. I have done that, I hope your brother does as well. But I urge him to seek counseling if he is depressed. If he had a tooth ache he would see a doctor. He he was feeling sick he see a doctor. Depression is treatable, even in short term episodes. Please support any effort and encourage him to seek support from a mental health or medical professional.",

(By the way, if you didn't want to compare homosexuals to pedophiles, why did you?)\n \n Now I know apologists like jyosh say its OK to be gay as long as you never act on it and ever have sex. That is easily said by the straight boy who knows that god would never ask him to be celibate. (He would counter than sometimes the straights are called to celibacy. Other than priests, I don't know who that is, and if it ever happens, no one remains celibate against their will. And they never suffer depression and anxiety because of it. His argument is XXXX.)\n \n You disagree with \"it's what's inside that counts\", but you misunderstand our points if that is the conclusion you are drawing. No one is saying that all urges and feelings should be acted upon without restraint. Far from it. We are merely saying that some of us out there are gay and it is not bad, it just is. There is not a single other thing inside you that is normal and healthy that your bible and god asks you to repress. If you can think of a single thing, I would like to hear it.\n \n Like much of the content of the bible, the practictioners of religion find what they can to support their pre-existing ideas. You are doing your brother a great disservice to consider his sexuality (and any subsequent desire to act on it) as a sin and somethings to suppress. He will be unhappy unless he is able to be who he is. If you really love him, you should really think about this. His life may literally depend on it. \n \n The religious folks are wrong. Purely and simply. Being gay is normal. Sexuality is normal. We are all sexual beings and as a result we engage in sexual behavior. That is not opinion, that is incontrovertable fact. That is the way your god made us.\n \n I don't think you really wanted advice or information. It sounds like you wanted someone to confirm what you already thought.",

He may in fact decide to turn his back on his religious beliefs, and that's his choice. God is still forgiving, regardless. And God will love him no matter what, so that's a great example to follow.

   "That expectation would be based on the assumption that you wanted to have an actual reasonable conversation. If someone doesn't share you faith, than faith based arguments are meaningless. If all you want to do is harangue and persecute, then go with the religion angle.\n\n \n But we aren't talking about just \"faith based arguments.\" We're talking about a religious issue--because we're talking about religious gays. Talking about the issue while ignoring what is one of the most fundamental aspects of the issue is a very poor way to approach the matter. Not to mention religious gays themselves would probably not like you pretending that issue wasn't a very real part of their lives. And certainly no one is even talking about \"harranguing and persecuting\", so I'm not even sure where that came from.\n \n \nOr somebody can elighten me as to why my scenario is inaccurate, and there being a clear distinction inbetween calling ALL gays to be celibate (which I realize is just plain irrelevant to some, primarily because they don't want to address it) and calling a rare few straights to be celibate, when it's really a voluntary thing. If a straight wants to be celibate, he is. If later he decides he doesn't want to anymore, he doesn't.\n\n \n Well sure, if gay behavior is against the will of God, then yes, He would be calling gay people to celibate lives (even if it means all of them). But that's still no different than Him calling some straights to celibacy. Your beef here seems to just be over numbers. And I don't know why you seem to think that a straight person being called by God would have any more freedom to disobey that calling than a gay person. Both are still examples of disobedience toward God (even your priest-who-left-the-priesthood example).",
