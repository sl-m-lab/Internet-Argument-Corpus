   "Any nation's money is only worth what it will buy. Meaning, you don't convert to the Ruble to buy French wine. And you don't convert to the dollar to buy a television (you can but the source of the product is cheaper).\n \n Currently the U.S. is an import country, even though the size and natural resources are hardly an issue. Japan for example has limited space and is starved of natural resources. Japan will always be a slave to its resource needs. \n \n A Nation that has high import demands must have export assets to meet those needs. Clearly Japan has that. No nation on the earth doesn't have a desire to obtain Products developed from Japan. So Japan's economic engine runs quite well, as specially considering the deficits the country has to overcome.\n \n The real question of our generation; Why would a country want the dollar? Why does China hold over 2 Trillion in U.S. Bonds? The reasons are sound; clearly no nation allows fools to operate their banking. The reason is a question every American has to address in order to understand their nations Interests. The posture of a nation is directed toward its national interests and explains their stance on world issues.\n \n China doesn't hold 2 trillion in Bonds to buy a Chevy. Not even close to the reason they would hoard such a massive savings of U.S. currency. The answer is in what they can buy with the Dollar. Currently in the Middle East, you buy Oil with the U.S. Dollar. You don't convert to their currency (which would have real value because of their export products) to buy a barrel. Starting to see the National interests of the United States a little more clearly yet?\n \n Our generation has failed its country and harmed the interests of our hares because of our overwhelming failure to provide a worth to our country. Our failure to have assets found to be worthy to the world economic complex is the single greatest reason why our military is so tasked. If you think we are throwing American bodies into Iraq for the indigenousness populations there, your in a dream world. There are plenty of people in the world with desires for freedom. Ask the Saudis.\n \n Now you can get a better understanding of our key national interests. Global warming is hardly an issue our country can stand behind because oil props our dollar and gives it value. We are burdened with alliances that are questionable at best (Saudis). Saddam's biggest single mistake was getting off the dollar, that disturbed our national interests more than his attack on Kuwait.",

   "Yeah oil's a big one, pretty much every oil producing country asks for payment in $US.\n \n \nCurrently the U.S. is an import country, even though the size and natural resources are hardly an issue.\n\n \n In a free market, when a nation imports more than it exports, this results in a declining value of money in that nation, which tends to resolve the balance of payments. (As their money becomes worth less internationally, they have a reduced incentive to import, and the people of other nations have an increased incentive to purchase their exports).\n \n So we could predict that the $US should decline, however the actions of other national governments around the world are at present preventing that, for various reasons. As is the use of the $US as a proxy-currency around the world where inflation is rampant locally, which somewhat reinforces the value of it, but would never alone sustain it without the continued action of eg China's central banks. This situation won't hold forever though. So it's a good long run bet, but it's hard to say when exactly it will drop sufficiently that the balance of payments is restored.\n \n I also disagree with the idea that \"Japan will always be a slave to its resource needs.\", the resources present within a nation need not constrain the prosperity of the people living there, so long as international trade barriers do not restrict their ability to purchase those goods internationally. In fact, national boundaries are meaningless under such circumstances, the only real burden people living in such places must bear is the cost of transportation.",

   "I am interested in knowing the effect the Middle Eastern peace deal had on the dollar. Could it be that Jimmy Carter's peace deal with Israel and Egypt had a massive impact on the use of the dollar through out the Middle East? Could it be that aid given to Egypt actually promoted the value of dollar more than the loss in funds we suffered by issuing the aid?",

   "If you want an empirical answer, I don't know if such a thing would be possible to realise. Perhaps a team of economic historians an mathematical modellers could dedicate a few years to deriving an estimate of the net result.\n \n It is certainly possible that propping up foreign regimes in exchange for economic boons granted to the United States has resulted in net economic gain for the people holding its currency, but this is a cost born by the people of those nations who would otherwise be free to sell the produce of their labour to the highest bidder in any currency.\n \n Such an idea is hardly foreign to the occupants of those nations, and the burden they have had foisted upon them by their rulers is the source of great political discord, the further activity of the US military in supporting these regimes has lead directly to the precarious geopolitical situation in which the US now finds itself entangled, and of course, directly, to the attacks of september 11th 2001, and the massive expansion of government powers directly following those attacks, including the cost of two wars, and the cost of maintaining permanent military bases around the world.\n \n So I would find it difficult to believe that the result of this activity has been positive for any but a few, regardless of its direct effects on the dollar's value.\n \n And of course, once such arrangements end, as they inevitably will, they will end in a crisis situation as the malinvestments it has engendered are liquidated. Your guess is as good as mine as to how that will play out, but you can guarantee it won't be pretty.",

   "A lot of the strength of the dollar is propped up by the requirement by the IMF and World Bank that currency reserves are held in dollars, as I understand it.\n\n \n \n Its doesn't hurt having your currency held by other nations, though you can surely print your way right over its current trade evaluation. And clearly those nations that accept the dollar aid in its value, which is basically my point. I would say; holder beware, its still only worth what it will buy and its easy to see where the dollar is used most. The questions to ponder are; Why do the Saudis take the dollar? Could it be that they do so mostly because we are the worlds only superpower? Isn't this why the current Iraq war is so vital to begin with? The thing to think about is; What happens if we lose? Wouldn't that nullify the chief reasoning the Saudis deal in the dollar? Are we worried about how the Middle East will see a withdraw?",
