   "It seems to me that if the founding fathers of this country were very bright, and I think that they were, then their intentions to form a \"Christian Nation,\" or at least a nation founded on \"Christian principles,\" would be clearly evident in our founding documents. I mean, aside from their private writings where no indication of such intent can be found, wouldn't such intent be clear in the very documents that declared and established this country? With that in mind, I have examined some of the early documents written by these founding fathers upon which this nation was founded searching for these \"Christian principles\" to which \"Christian Nation\" advocates wish to return. \n \n First, there is the Declaration of Independence. While the view of the founding fathers was that the Declaration did not found a new nation, but rather returned the power to govern to the source, i.e., the people, this document is often cited as evidence of a \"Christian Nation\" by advocates of a repressive theocracy. The Declaration of Independence left the 13 Colonies without a legislative body and without law. As the founding fathers expressed at the time, the people were returned to the state of nature. \n \n Second, I have examined the eleven constitutions, written concurrently with or immediately after the Declaration in 1776 and 1777, which re-established governments in ten of the newly independent states, and also established the independent Republic of Vermont from the disputed territories that were claimed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York. Three colonies (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) didn't draft and adopt constitutions until later and instead reverted to a previous charter. \n \n Third, I examined the Articles of Confederation, the initial founding document of The United States of America, The Constitution itself, and the Bill of Rights. \n \n So here are some questions about these documents. Keep in mind that the intent of the founding fathers to form a \"Christian Nation\" should be quite clear in these documents, if that were their intent. Even if their intent were less than a \"Christian Nation\" but was only to found a nation on \"Christian principles,\" I think that that too should be clearly evident.\n \n These remarks are from the introduction to the test. Page down once to bypass.\n \n So follow this link to The Christian Nation Quiz and test your ideas, and maybe learn something in the process.\n \n Any discussion or comment appreciated.",

Questions such as who their son or daughter could marry, among a variety of minorities, showed atheists were the most objectionable.

My own hometown means \"Between Two Rivers\" in the Wampanoag Language. I mourn for the suffering caused so the white man could enrich himself at their expense. And Slavery, although started by the Dutch Traders was adopted all too easily by the Americans who justified the practice with claims they were needed to remain productive and profitable as a growing Nation.\n \n But our conscience caught up with us and we fought a civil War to rid ourselves of a practice that would have eventually destroyed us had we not repented and changed our ways. I have seen Racism in my lifetime in the South and understand that pockets of ignorance still exist today. But the Government and the Laws now protect minorities, women and all people with Civil and Human rights Laws. \n \n What you fail to realize and take into account is that during that period of time the whole World was a much harder and more brutal place. And after the Civil War even blacks emigrated to the USA to escape the abuses of their homelands. And the same story applies to people from all religions and ethnicities from every Country on every Continent on Earth. My question for you America hating liberals is why, in every post do you find a way to condemn the Country that has been the land of opportunity for so many over so long a period of time ? \n \n Why can't you balance our past mistakes with the times and pressures that existed for us yet you simultaneously make excuses for our enemies who never had a righteous or honest concern for humanity from then till now. And yet you defend them as you condemn the Country that has done so much for you personally. I truly feel sorry for the young Americans who are defending this Country in uniform for people who hate this Country and the sacrifice it's making for our defense.

   "I'm a little confused about why any of this matters.\nIt matters because of the continued attempts by christian fundamentalists to impose their religion on everyone by law. It matters because they claim that they have the right to do so because this nation was founded as a \"christisn nation\" on \"christian principles.\"\n \nLets assume for a minute that our first set of government was heavily influenced by religion...a Christian one...and that our founding fathers did use God in a lot of their work.\nIf by \"first set of government\" you mean the pre-independence colonial governments, then yes, all but one were, at one time or another, religious in that they established state churches. There were in all requirements that office holders had to be members of the church. In fact, sometimes civil and ecclesiastical positions were the same. Thus, both George Washington and James Madison were vestrymen in their Anglican parish even though neither was a christian.\n \n...what does this matter to laws of today (unless the law still exists)?\nIt matters because other laws and practices exist that have been established since. The Constitutional provision in Maryland that any office holder had to profess a belief in God was enforced until it was found unconstitutional in 1961 (Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488). Christian prayer was practiced and passive observance by non-christian students was required at many school functions in many Texas schools until 2000. My own school district allowed prayer until the decision by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the District Court decision. (I do not live in the Judicial District but I do live in the 5th Circuit) That decision was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court (Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, 99-62). And recently there was the case of Judge Roy Moore who erected a religious monument in the Alabama Supreme Court and the case of the Bible display outside the Harris County Court House in Houston, TX. What matters is that some christians are still trying to use the government and tax money to impose their religion on everyone. Arguments against each of the latter three cases were made that christians were being deprived of their 1st Amendment right to the free practice of their religion.\n \n It seems to me that these christians haven't read the Bible and are unaware of Mat 6:6: \"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\" \n \nAs far as I know the constitution really is there to set up a framework for government...not to answer moral questions or decide how people should think.\nWell, we agree on that. But, of course, that was pretty much the point of the \"Christian Nation quiz.\" Whizzed right past you I guess.\n \nThis goes for both sides by the way. Laws can be changed. Our Christian laws of the past can and have been changed and we could go back if the society so chooses.\nActually, I doubt it. Most of the \"Christian\" laws weren't actually changed. They were found to be unconstitutional. So in order to go back to the days when it was acceptable for christians to use the government to impose their religion we would have to amend the Constitution.\n \nThat is why we have a democratic system set up...that is what our constitution does.\nNo it doesn't. Did you flunk your high school government course? Our Constitution establishes a representative republic, i.e., a representative (or liberal) democracy.\n \nOur constitution doesn't set up a system where you can only make laws based on \"logic and reason\" nor does it say you have to stick with a religious influence. ...if just says you can decide things and sets up who gets to decide them.\nNo. It doesn't do that either. The christian majority doesn't get to decide that they can use the government to impose their religion. Clearly, if you consider the actions of Congress and our President you are aware that logic and reason have nothing to do with it. And the Supreme Court is establish by the Constitution to decide questions about whether the actions of the other two branches agree with the Constitution.\n \nI find it odd that both sides here are trying to look at the past and at the constitution as if it had all the answers...as if it were the Bible.....when it reality the answers to the questions are supposed to be decided by our legislatures of today.\nSo you are saying that our legislatures do not take oaths (or affirmations) to support and defend the Constitution? So you are saying that they shouldn't consider whether or not a proposed law is Constitutional? So you are unaware that laws by our legislatures can be challenged in our judicial system, and if found to violate provisions of the Constitution - looking to the past or not - they are set aside?\n \nGood grief.:xbanghead\nRight. My sentiments at your response, only more. :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead\n \n I do want to congratulate you in that you misspelled fewer words that I did.",

   "It matters because other laws and practices exist that have been established since. The Constitutional provision in Maryland that any office holder had to profess a belief in God was enforced until it was found unconstitutional in 1961 (Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488). Christian prayer was practiced and passive observance by non-christian students was required at many school functions in many Texas schools until 2000. My own school district allowed prayer until the decision by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the District Court decision. (I do not live in the Judicial District but I do live in the 5th Circuit) That decision was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court (Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, 99-62). And recently there was the case of Judge Roy Moore who erected a religious monument in the Alabama Supreme Court and the case of the Bible display outside the Harris County Court House in Houston, TX. What matters is that some christians are still trying to use the government and tax money to impose their religion on everyone. Arguments against each of the latter three cases were made that christians were being deprived of their 1st Amendment right to the free practice of their religion.\nPerhaps the question here is why it was allowable for so long. Could it be because perhaps it is ok to have laws based soley on religious principals? The answer here is yes.\n \n \n\n Well, we agree on that. But, of course, that was pretty much the point of the \"Christian Nation quiz.\" Whizzed right past you I guess.\nAlright, it is very clear that you don't know what you are talking about. Once you resort to insulting when I was presenting an opinion that favored much of your opinion then we might as well not even talk to you. But I'll continue anyway assuming you were just having a bad day.\n \n \nActually, I doubt it. Most of the \"Christian\" laws weren't actually changed. They were found to be unconstitutional. So in order to go back to the days when it was acceptable for christians to use the government to impose their religion we would have to amend the Constitution.\nThis isn't really true. The ones that were found \"unconsitutional\" were done so using the living constitution doctrine which I reject. In reality most aren't unconstitutional. This idea that everything has to have a non-religious or moral reason is crazy. Find me a good non-moral reason for animal cruelty laws.\n \n \nNo it doesn't. Did you flunk your high school government course? Our Constitution establishes a representative republic, i.e., a representative (or liberal) democracy.\nOh dear God.... :xbanghead I should have known from your above comment that you are one of those unreasonable people. \n \n Yes, I realize we are officially a representative republic but we often refer to ourselves as a democracy. I assumed you haven't been living under a rock and you knew this...my mistake.\n \n \n \nNo. It doesn't do that either. The christian majority doesn't get to decide that they can use the government to impose their religion. Clearly, if you consider the actions of Congress and our President you are aware that logic and reason have nothing to do with it. And the Supreme Court is establish by the Constitution to decide questions about whether the actions of the other two branches agree with the Constitution.\nOur constitution doesn't set up a system to decide who makes what decisions/laws/etc? And I am the one that \"flunked high school government\"?\n \n Should I refer to Article I section 8 of the constitution, Article II sections 1-2 and part of 3, Article III section 1, The 10th amendment, Article IV and V, even the decision on ratifying the constitution is laid out in the constitution. What on earth do you think this documentdoes?\n \n As for the first part. A christian majority in fact could decide to impose religion on government via a number of ways. They could amend the constitution and make a state religion, they could support or encourage laws that adhere to their views (such as abortion or marriage laws), they could vote for legislatures that think in way they do. I was unaware that christians were not allowed to think.... \n \n \n \nSo you are saying that our legislatures do not take oaths (or affirmations) to support and defend the Constitution?\nThat's a pretty bad guess at what I was trying to say. No.\n \n \nSo you are saying that they shouldn't consider whether or not a proposed law is Constitutional? \nAnother bad guess\n \n \nSo you are unaware that laws by our legislatures can be challenged in our judicial system, and if found to violate provisions of the Constitution - looking to the past or not - they are set aside?\nVery aware. In fact, the federalist papers mentions this exactly. \n \n Perhaps I should rephrase so you can better understand. \n \n The constitution is not here to answer every question you might have. The answer to the question \"do you have a right to drive a car\" is no where in the constitution. To say a law prohibiting 12yr olds to drive is constitutional is kind of a bad way of putting it. It isn't that the constitution specifically allows it but that no higher law trumps it (such as the constitution). I realize that saying something is \"constitutional\" is really meant in the way I just spoke of but I find it to misled people into thinking the constitution has an answer for everything. So when people start saying \"you can't use religion as a justification for law\" I find it hard to believe this. The constitution says nothing of the sort. Even if you say an religious idea (such as no abortion) with only religious backing is \"establishing a religion\" I'd like one to find a history of where the first amendment was meant to mean this. Seems to me that all the history behind the creation of this amendment from its beginning would suggest that the purpose behind the 1st amendment was to keep Congress from hurting religion...not keeping religious thoughts out of government. I can get into the true meaning of the amendment later.\n \n In sort, you can't limit a reasoning behind a law.",

   "Because without a 'creator' to give inalienable rights magically, we'd have to look at where inalienable rights originate from.\nHopefully you are aware that it isn't the christian creator that is mentioned in the Declaration of Independence. The idea of inalienable rights comes directly from the philosophers of the enlightenment, especially John Locke. The Creator is actually nature as expressed in the Declaration. But we don't have to look somewhere else for any rights. There are certain rights that are specifically mentioned in the Constitution, especially in the Bill of Rights. These are rights recognized as belonging to all persons in a nation of laws and specify the relationships between citizens and between citizens and the government.\n \nCould slippery sloap it into there is no rights that are inalienable and thus they can be taken away more easily. By majority rule, by judicial decree, by despotic use of naked power.\nSure. Could happen if you were willing to set aside the Constitution. The point of this discussion is that the \"christian nation\" crowd is perfectly willing to do that. Christianity doesn't have a very good record of recognizing anyone's rights. Christians have always been perfectly willing to deprive anyone who disagrees with them of life and liberty.\n \nI much prefer a 'common consent of the people' thing backed up by despotic checks and balances in the hands of a dictator...justto make things interesting. emoticon_xkill\nWell, of course it is \"We the people...\" who established and keeps our government under the Constitution, not some god. I always find it amusing to hear a christian nation advocate claim that the Constitution was written by christian men, based on christian principles, who wanted to establish a christian nation. I wonder why many of the christian delegates to the Constitutional Convention walked out because the Constitution is Godless? Why was it that the established churches opposed the ratification of the Constitution?",

The answer here is yes.\nNope. Laws must have \"...legitimate secular purpose.\" (Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 1971).

How is your opinion more meaningful that that of the Supreme Court?\n \nIn reality most aren't unconstitutional.\nA meaningful example, please. How about the case law I cited? Not really unconstitutional?\n \nThis idea that everything has to have a non-religious or moral reason is crazy.\nHere's the first part of your bait and switch.

Exactly what is it that you think that the Constitution does? Offer guide lines?\n \nAs for the first part. A christian majority in fact could decide to impose religion on government via a number of ways.\nAgain you miss the point. My meaning was that they can't do it under the Constitution as it currently stands.\n \nThey could amend the constitution and make a state religion,\nThey could if they repealed the 1st Amendment with a 28th amendment. But given the thousands of christian religions, I don't think that it would work.\n \nthey could support or encourage laws that adhere to their views (such as abortion or marriage laws),\nBut of course, that is their right. It is only when those laws are in violation of the Constitution that there is a problem.\n \nthey could vote for legislatures that think in way they do.\nRight. And then pass an amendment that allows the majority to deny rights to minorities. That's what christians are all about.\n \nI was unaware that christians were not allowed to think....\nBut no one claims that they are not allowed to think. The problem is that they think that they are right and wish to impose their religion on everyone.\n \nThat's a pretty bad guess at what I was trying to say. No.\n \n Another bad guess\n \n Very aware.\nActually, it was a pretty literal reading of what you said.\n \nIn fact, the federalist papers mentions this exactly.\nThen I can only wonder why you said what you did.\n \nPerhaps I should rephrase so you can better understand.\nPerhaps you should since you don't seem to be able to express what you mean clearly.\n \nThe constitution is not here to answer every question you might have.\nI didn't claim that it was.\n \nThe answer to the question \"do you have a right to drive a car\" is no where in the constitution.\nHow is this even relevant? Why do you think that this babble is meaningful?\n \nTo say a law prohibiting 12yr olds to drive is constitutional is kind of a bad way of putting it.\nBut I didn't mention any such law. How is any such law relevant? Are you claiming that such laws are religious in nature?\n \nIt isn't that the constitution specifically allows it but that no higher law trumps it (such as the constitution).\nWhat? Did that actually make sense to you when you typed it? We were talking about religion and the Constitution. Were you distracted by something?\n \nI realize that saying something is \"constitutional\" is really meant in the way I just spoke of but I find it to misled people into thinking the constitution has an answer for everything.\nMaybe if you don't understand the Constitution. I can see how you might be confused if you think that driving laws have something to do with Constitutional prohibitions against laws based solely on religious motivations.\n \nSo when people start saying \"you can't use religion as a justification for law\" I find it hard to believe this.\nAgain the point sails past you. I didn't say that and that isn't the point. The point is that religion cannot be the only justification. If there is a legitimate secular reason, the the law might stand. You don't seem to understand that under our Constitution you may not legislate religion.\n \nThe constitution says nothing of the sort.\nYes it does. Read the 1st and 14th Amendments and the case law.\n \nEven if you say an religious idea (such as no abortion) with only religious backing is \"establishing a religion\" I'd like one to find a history of where the first amendment was meant to mean this.\nWell, we all know that a coat hanger in the bathroom is so much more moral and religious. But never mind that. That's no more relevant or meaningful than discussion about 12 year old driving.\n \n So let me explain. In the Constitution the role of the Supreme Court is defined such that it has the power and authority to decide on the meaning of the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has decided that laws against abortion are solely religious and have no secular purpose, then they violate the Constitutional rights of citizens. There is no claim that the framers of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights were able to foresee moral decisions in the future. That's why the Constitution has an amendment process built in and the Supreme Court has the authority and responsibility to decide what laws do or do not conform to the Constitution.\n \nSeems to me that all the history behind the creation of this amendment from its beginning would suggest that the purpose behind the 1st amendment was to keep Congress from hurting religion...not keeping religious thoughts out of government.\nduh.\n \nI can get into the true meaning of the amendment later.\nIs your \"true meaning\" based on your \"true faith?\"\n \nIn sort, you can't limit a reasoning behind a law.\nI have no idea what that means.",

How about the case law I cited? Not really unconstitutional?\nWould \"shouldn't be unconstitutional\" be a better term for you?

You're not going to tell me that it's a tenant of christianity, are you?\nYour post seemed to suggest that morals are not a good enough justification for laws. If this is incorrect then just say so. For example, if you thought gay marriage was wrong for the sole reason that you think it is morally wrong then it would be ok to make a law that suggests this.\n \n \nYou misspoke and I pointed it out. It wasn't clear that you understood the difference between a democracy and a republic, since the distinction is relevant. Your wording was sloppy, and while we are all guilty of that more often than we would like, in this case it made you wrong. It has nothing to do with being reasonable.

I just assumed you were above a petty wording argument.\n \n \nIt sets out who makes laws, who makes executive decisions, and and who makes judicial judgements. Exactly what is it that you think that the Constitution does? Offer guide lines?\nYeah, that is exactly what it does. Another word for guidelines could be boundaries. The constitution sets up the boundaries in which our government can operate and within that which aspects of the government can do what. And if you think otherwise I'll just go ahead and quote Justice Breyer who said it almost exactly as I have. You wouldn't think your word was \"better than the Supreme Court\" would you?\n \n \nBut of course, that is their right.

If you follow Lemon then we already are in trouble.\n \n \nAgain the point sails past you. I didn't say that and that isn't the point. The point is that religion cannot be the only justification. If there is a legitimate secular reason, the the law might stand. You don't seem to understand that under our Constitution you may not legislate religion.\nYou don't need a secular reason. That is my point. You certainly can legislate a religion. You can also legislate no religion short of saying \"you can't practice religion X\" or course. The best example of this is gay marriage. There is absolutly no reason outside of religion for saying homosexuals should not be allowed to marry (and for that matter marriage itself is fairly religious). These laws are still constitutional though as they do not establish a religion in anyway. They agree with a religious idea but do not establish any religion and are not reasonably prohibiting the free exercise of others. To go from establishing a religion to establishing no religious idea is a big leap...it certainly didn't mean this for the first 150yrs of our constitution, not sure why it means this now.\n \n \nYes it does. Read the 1st and 14th Amendments and the case law.\nI'd be willing to bet I've read more case law than most here. From the mid to early 1900s on you find case law using substantive due process and the \"living constitution\" doctrine. I reject these. Not sure how you think the 14th amendment applies other than to somehow make the bill of rights apply to the states. Not sure how that happened either. Seems odd that one could construe the constitution to say an amendment that begins \"Congress shall make no law\" really applies to the states.\n \n \nSo let me explain. In the Constitution the role of the Supreme Court is defined such that it has the power and authority to decide on the meaning of the Constitution.\nNo they don't. They decide how the meaning of the facts from a case and apply it to a static law that has only one meaning. If that is what you mean't by \"meaning\" then yes.\n \n \nSince the Supreme Court has decided that laws against abortion are solely religious and have no secular purpose, then they violate the Constitutional rights of citizens\nWell, that is not what they decided for abortion.\n \n \nThat's why the Constitution has an amendment process built in and the Supreme Court has the authority and responsibility to decide what laws do or do not conform to the Constitution.\nAnd yet they don't have the power to change the meaning of the constitution from time to time...do you agree with this? If so, then please show me how the 1st amendment suddenly means establish no religious views.\n \n \nIs your \"true meaning\" based on your \"true faith?\"\nThe true meaning is based on the origins of the 1st amendment from state constitutions, the reasoning behind the amendment to begin with, the early case laws dealing with religion and the 1st amendment, and other various historic documents that are ignored. But if historical meaning is worthless to you (ie you believe in a living constitution) then this would be a waste of time to explain.",

   "In what way do you feel the 14th amendment applies?\nYou're joking, aren't you? You really have no business discussing constitutional law if you don't understand how the 14th Amendment applies. It pretty much makes everything you say moot.\n \nnotice the time of this case...any case from 1940 (give or take) onward is probably wrong.

The try Lynch v. Donnelly (465 U.S. 668, 1984). Government actions may not endorse religion. Above I only cited a single prong of the Lemon Test, and that sentiment has been expressed in other cases. I cited some other cases in a previous post in which the Lemon Test was applied by the Supreme Court. One of those was in 2000.\n \nHow does the Supreme Court saying something is \"unconstitutional\" actually make it so?\nDid you even take a high school course in government? How is it that you don't understand that it is the job of the Supreme Court to decide on the constitutionality of laws.\n \nThe court has ruled things unconstitutional and then reversed and then gone back. Does that mean they were correct every time! I think no.\nActually, in principle, they are right every time. You don't get to decide what is or is not constitutional. That is what the Supreme Court does.\n \n Please cite 10 examples of the Supreme Court reversing and going back, whatever that means.\n \nThe Supreme Court is made up of 8.5 humans (Stevens is only half cause he is so old....joke obviously) and like any human they can make mistakes.\nNice. Insult the Justices.\n \nWould \"shouldn't be unconstitutional\" be a better term for you? The fact that something is currently ruled unconstitutional doesn't make it so in reality.\nI understand. You shoot your mouth off and you can't back it up. In fact, unless you reject the Constitution, if something is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, then it is.\n \nWhat if your morals are based on a religion and a religion alone? Would you say that morals based on religion are not allowable!\nNow you are being silly. Yet another bait and switch because you confuse religion with morality.\n \nYour post seemed to suggest that morals are not a good enough justification for laws.

Yet a third part to your bait and switch that includes a gross distortion of what I said.\n \nFor example, if you thought gay marriage was wrong for the sole reason that you think it is morally wrong then it would be ok to make a law that suggests this.\nBut those who claim that it is morally wrong do so for religious reasons.\n \nI didn't misspeak. I just assumed you were above a petty wording argument.\nAgain, your wording was sloppy and wrong. And now you defend your sloppy wording with claims that you are correct.\n \nYeah, that is exactly what it does. Another word for guidelines could be boundaries. The constitution sets up the boundaries in which our government can operate and within that which aspects of the government can do what. And if you think otherwise I'll just go ahead and quote Justice Breyer who said it almost exactly as I have. You wouldn't think your word was \"better than the Supreme Court\" would you?\nHow funny. Above you were telling us that the Supreme Court was wrong because you don't agree. Now you are holding up to me an authority that you have rejected.\n \nAnd it seems your idea of when a law is unconstitutional is incorrect. If you follow Lemon then we already are in trouble.\nRight. It should be OK for you to use the government to impose your religion on everyone. Good call.\n \nYou don't need a secular reason.\nNot if you are a christian nation advocate.\n \nThat is my point.\nI know.\n \nYou certainly can legislate a religion.\nBut not in this country.\n \nYou can also legislate no religion short of saying \"you can't practice religion X\" or course.\nAnother example of your confused bias.\n \nThe best example of this is gay marriage. There is absolutly no reason outside of religion for saying homosexuals should not be allowed to marry (and for that matter marriage itself is fairly religious).\nActually, marriage is a civil contract to which people lend religious meaning. Opposition to gay marriage is a matter of religious belief, not morality.\n \nThese laws are still constitutional though as they do not establish a religion in anyway.

To go from establishing a religion to establishing no religious idea is a big leap...it certainly didn't mean this for the first 150yrs of our constitution, not sure why it means this now.\nYet again, you are confused.

From the mid to early 1900s on you find case law using substantive due process and the \"living constitution\" doctrine. I reject these.\nWell good for you! Reject away. That puts you in the wrong.\n \nNot sure how you think the 14th amendment applies other than to somehow make the bill of rights apply to the states.\nDuh.\n \nNot sure how that happened either. Seems odd that one could construe the constitution to say an amendment that begins \"Congress shall make no law\" really applies to the states.\nReally??? Have you actually read the 14th Amendment? Have you read the case law? It seems not.\n \nNo they don't. They decide how the meaning of the facts from a case and apply it to a static law that has only one meaning. If that is what you mean't by \"meaning\" then yes.\nWell, that was pretty vacuous.\n \nWell, that is not what they decided for abortion.\nThen please explain what they did decide.\n \nAnd yet they don't have the power to change the meaning of the constitution from time to time...do you agree with this?\nNo.\n \nIf so, then please show me how the 1st amendment suddenly means establish no religious views.\nBut that doesn't follow. The Constitution has nothing to do with religious views because it says so. Our government can make no laws regarding an establishment of religion.\n \nThe true meaning is based on the origins of the 1st amendment from state constitutions, the reasoning behind the amendment to begin with, the early case laws dealing with religion and the 1st amendment, and other various historic documents that are ignored.\ndid that bit of run-on actually make sense to you when you wrote it? It didn't come from \"state constitutions\", it came from Virginia. From bills written by Thomas Jefferson and George Mason, and followed up by James Madison.\n \nBut if historical meaning is worthless to you (ie you believe in a living constitution) then this would be a waste of time to explain.\nAh!

   "You're joking, aren't you? You really have no business discussing constitutional law if you don't understand how the 14th Amendment applies. It pretty much makes everything you say moot.\nI'm asking you how you think the 14th amendment applies. Why can't you just answer.\n \n \nOK. The try Lynch v. Donnelly (465 U.S. 668, 1984). Government actions may not endorse religion. Above I only cited a single prong of the Lemon Test, and that sentiment has been expressed in other cases. I cited some other cases in a previous post in which the Lemon Test was applied by the Supreme Court. One of those was in 2000.\nAnd I still reject the Lemon test for the reasons already stated. \n \n \nActually, in principle, they are right every time. You don't get to decide what is or is not constitutional. That is what the Supreme Court does.\n \n Please cite 10 examples of the Supreme Court reversing and going back, whatever that means.\nHAHA, you are right everytime? Nothing changed! Did the supreme court just change the constitution out of no where. I guess you are one of those that think the constitution is a \"living breathing document\"\n \n Anyway, I don't feel like digging up 10 cases but you can look at death penalty for one...or the other way around you could look at sodomy cases which were a mere 15yrs apart or so. Any case that was overturned would be one that meets my requirement...it does happen you know.\n \n \nI understand. You shoot your mouth off and you can't back it up. In fact, unless you reject the Constitution, if something is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, then it is.\nThis makes no sense. You are saying that if the Supreme Court ruled today that eating Tacos is unconstitutional than this is correct and then if they reversed it tomorrow than that is correct. \n \n This thinking is just plain wrong. The constitution is static and if a judge \"interprets\" it incorrectly then they made a wrong decision. What you are saying would be like a contract saying you owe someone $10,000 and you telling them that it is $300 when it clearly says otherwise. \n \n \nNow you are being silly. Yet another bait and switch because you confuse religion with morality.\nSome people have morals based solely on religion.\n \n \nBut those who claim that it is morally wrong do so for religious reasons.\nMy point exactly. You think that if someones morals are from religion then they don't count. This is just an incorrect look at the 1st amendment. Its about time I bring out Kurt Lash's articles on this and prove to you exactly that this \"secular only\" mindset has no basis in the constitution.\n \n \nHow funny. Above you were telling us that the Supreme Court was wrong because you don't agree. Now you are holding up to me an authority that you have rejected.\nHuh? Wrong on cases doesn't mean wrong for everything. So do you agree with that assessment of the constitution or not? You can insult me all day long but you haven't answered anything as of yet.\n \n \nNot if you are a christian nation advocate.\nYou also don't need it if you believe in a constitution that has meaning.\n \n \nActually, marriage is a civil contract to which people lend religious meaning. Opposition to gay marriage is a matter of religious belief, not morality.\nit is the moral belief based on religion. Either way, they are morals.\n \n \nYet again, you are confused. You don't seem to be able to discern between morality, religious, and legal. And somehow you seem to be able to trivialize the free exercise clause by throwing it into your bias.\nYou seem to not have the ability to realize that morality and religion relate for a vast majority of people. If your morality is based on a religion then you have moral beliefs but they are of religious dissent. As it relates to legal issues, there is no restriction on ways to think when creating laws.\n \n \nReally??? Have you actually read the 14th Amendment? Have you read the case law? It seems not.\nYes, I've read all of that. It wasn't exactly a convincing argument either. Saying the Due Process clause of the 14th amendment makes it so the 1st amendment applies to the states is rather odd.\n \n \nThen please explain what they did decide.\nIn Roe they decided that it violates liberty...in Casey, they kind of said the same thing but stated more along the lines of a womans health and things like that. It had nothing to do with \"secular reasons\". If you want I can go into further detail about the exact rulings of this case. Hopefully you are confusing \"secular reasons\" with \"legitimate state interest\"...that would be embarrassing.\n \n \nNo.\nRight, so you think the constitution is meaningless then? If judges get the change the meaning then please tell me how they chance it? Based on what their own person views are by any chance?\n \n \nBut that doesn't follow. The Constitution has nothing to do with religious views because it says so. Our government can make no laws regarding an establishment of religion.\nI'm very confused that you argue I am wrong when you think the constitution means whatever 5 outta 9 people want it to mean. In theory, if 5 justices decided tomorrow that the 1st amendment doesn't apply to anyone in the US then you would agree with this ruling and you would be ok, legally, with a Christian nation.\n \n \ndid that bit of run-on actually make sense to you when you wrote it? It didn't come from \"state constitutions\", it came from Virginia. From bills written by Thomas Jefferson and George Mason, and followed up by James Madison.\nI doubt you would be concerned about its history anyway. The religious bill introduced in Va was one aspect that helped form the amendment...\n \n \nAh! When you are defeated, finish with an insult. Good form.\nThe only times people have used some sort of \"HAHA You have been defeated!\" is when they are in grade school...so I'm going on that assumption from now on.\n \n You never answered the implied question of whether or not you believe in a living constitution and thus history wouldn't apply.",

   "It is said that Lincoln was an atheist. At least his wife was known to remark on more than one occasion that he was not a Christian.\n\n \n I'll bet you've never seen an anti-religion rumor that you didn't believe.\n \n \nNope. Laws must have \"...legitimate secular purpose.\" (Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 1971). Of course, that is not to say that there cannot be any religious reason at all. Hopefully, that's what you meant to say, but I doubt it. Nevertheless, that's what the Supreme Court said.\n\n \n I find it rather strange that it took us 193 years to figure out that laws had to have a legitimate secular purpose (what a loaded statement chocked full of subjective criteria). Do you have an explanation for why it took so long before we figured out that this is what the constitution says? The most logical (and in this instance, correct) reason is that it didn't say that.\n \n \nHere's the first part of your bait and switch. In an off-handed way, you equate religion with morality. No one has ever claimed that laws don't have to have a moral justification, only that the sole justification cannot be religion.\n\n \n Actually, somebody did say that laws could not be based solely on morality. I forget who it was. Oh yeah, it was the Supreme Court.\n \n \nAnd the second part of the bait and switch. What does animal cruelty have to do with religion? You're not going to tell me that it's a tenant of christianity, are you?\n\n \n That was obviously used as an illustration to make a point, mainly, if laws cannot be based solely on a moral preference, than animal cruelty laws are in serious jeopardy. And that minor point serves to show a much larger point: that the Supreme Court has actually changed the constitution. And, interestingly enough, that is exactly how the Doctrine of Separation came to be in the United States, i.e., Constitutional revisionism by the judges.\n \n \nSince the Supreme Court has decided that laws against abortion are solely religious and have no secular purpose, then they violate the Constitutional rights of citizens.\n\n \n That's not what they said.",

   "[QUOTE=billsco;256437]It appears to be time for another quiz:\n \n When did God's name appear on our currency?\n \n a) In the 1950's\n b) Right from the getgo as Archangel states\n c) Neither. \n The Congress passed the Act of April 22, 1864. This legislation changed the composition of the one-cent coin and authorized the minting of the two-cent coin. The Mint Director was directed to develop the designs for these coins for final approval of the Secretary. IN GOD WE TRUST first appeared on the 1864 two-cent coin.http://www.ustreas.gov/education/fact-sheets/currency/in-god-we-trust.shtml\n \n \n Who is preventing any individual from praying at any public event?\n \n a) Those meddling atheists as Archangel alleges\n b) No one. Anyone can pray assiduously and as long as desired at any time anywhere. Most public schools provide time before classes begin for private prayer as well.\n c) Neither. The answer is \"the court\".\n A federal appeals court ruled that student-led prayers that are \"nonsectarian (not limited to one specific religion) and non-proselytizing (do not attempt convert)\" are allowed at graduations, but banned before football games -- which the court said aren't serious enough to be \"solemnized with prayer.\" \n \n The school district responded to the lower court ruling by implementing strict guidelines banning pre-game prayer, and warned senior Marian Ward, elected by fellow students to deliver religious messages before football games, that she would be disciplined if she prayed. http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/jan-june00/school_prayer.html\n \n When did many of the long standing traditions of which Archangel alludes to first appear?\n \n a) Our Founding Fathers sanctioned them\n b) Most are rooted in mid-19th and early 20th century society\n c) Depends on which Founding Father you pick. \n \"When a Religion is good, I conceive it will support itself; and when it does not support itself, and God does not take care to support it so that its Professors are obliged to call for help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one.\" - Benjamin Franklin (from a letter to Richard Price, October 9, 1780;) \n \n I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of... Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all.\"- Thomas Paine (The Age of Reason, 1794-1795.) \n \n\n You know, words mean something. When Christians begin crying for a return to the Christian heritage evident in our Constitution, us \"liberals\" are compelled to take the words at face value. It scares me to no end to think it could happen unless vigilant citizens are barring the way.\n \n\n I don't care if we remain a Christian nation as long as we remain a moral nation.

   "Because I asked you. I see that you don't know.\n \nOk, so no response. It was a simple question (one which you never asked me)\n \n \nI'm not sure what that means. The Constitution is a document that specifies how it can be changed and where the authority to interpret the meaning resides.\nNo, it doesn't say that in the way you mean. Perhaps it says who is supposed to find the meaning but the meaning is static...it just needs to be found.\n \n \n \nI'm sure you don't. Yet another question that you can't answer.\n Again, cite 10 relevant cases.\n Please cite 10 examples of such actions by the Supreme Court.\n\n Cite 250 examples of where the Supreme Court upheld the Lemon test otherwise your point is useless to me.\n \n The above sentence is what your post sounds like to me. If you don't know what cases involved the death penalty and which involved sodomy (among others) then why debate with you?\n \n Anyway, you are looking for 10 cases that were overturned.\n \n Bowers (overturned by Lawerence)\n Dredd Scott (aspects overturned later..most overturned by the 14th amendment)\n Brown v. Board (overturned earlier cases)\n Loving v Virginia (more or less)\n Penry v. Lynaugh\n Coleman v. Miller\n Hamilton v. Regents of U. of Cal\n \n I think you get the point...now where are my 250 cases?\n \n \n \nBut, by definition, the interpretation of the Supreme Court cannot be wrong.\nOnly by your definition. It certainly can be wrong...When they overturn another Supreme Court case you admit that case was incorrectly decided....unless you use the logic that everyone is right (some weird happy world).\n \n \n\n Stop with the straw men. That's nonsense. Have you actually read the Constitution?\nyes, now why can't you respond to anything in my post. So far, nothing you have said has any substance.\n \n \n\n Actually, I don't think so. But nevertheless, morality and religion are not the same. You continue to confuse the two.\nYou think wrong then. Can you show me how they are not related? My morals without a doubt come from religion...I'd like to know where yours come from and how it is impossible ot have morals come from religion.\n \n \nYou miss the point. I'm not making any claims about morality or religion in regard to the 1st Amendment.\nNo claims about morality or religion huh? Then what are we talking about. The 1st amendment has everything to do with religion.\n \n \n \nYou're kidding. So you accept the Supreme Court when you agree but reject it when you do not?\nYes...just like I support my congressman when I agree with him but don't support him when I don't.\n \n \n\n But I do believe that the Constitution has meaning. That's what I'm talking about. You reject the Constitution when you don't like what it says.\n\n You can't claim it has meaning when it changes from judge to judge. Like the example I gave above with the contract. You think that it is not what the contract says that matters but what any given person wants it to mean that matters. A contract that says \"you owe me $50,000\" means exactly that. A judge saying it means \"you owe me $10,000\" would be wrong.\n \n \nEither way, they have no standing under the Constitution. Grow up.\nI assume if you lived in 1890 that you would believe they did have standing.\n \n \n\n And you as so immature that you don't realize the morality and religion are not the same. Again, grow up.\n Did that bit of gibberish actually make sense to you when you typed it?\n And so it would to a \"christian nation\" advocate who wants to impose his religion on everyone.\n You're a twit.\n Actually, my point is that you think that the Constitution is meaningless because you disagree with how it works. Please explain what you were trying to say in the part I bolded above.\n How silly. The main problem is that a christian nation would deny the 1st Amendment.\n Duh.\n but you resorted to insult when you found that you couldn't answer. You continue with the insult, which is an implicit admission of defeat. Your latest effort here is mostly nonsense and trashing without logic.\n \n Jeeze, Steeeeve, get back on topic or give it up.\n \n Please cite anywhere in the Constitution that christian principles are mentioned. Please tell me where some god, or Jesus, or Christ is even implied. Please point out every sentence that is based on so called christian principles.\n And you never answered the explicit question that I proposed above. If this is a christian nation the show me where it says so.\n\n \n The best way to deal with our immature grade school folks is to smile and nod emoticon_xgood",

   "perhaps this will help:\n \n \nStrict constructionism is a philosophy of judicial interpretation and legal philosophy that limits judicial interpretation to the meanings of the actual words and phrases used in law, based on historical evidence of usage at the time of adoption, and not on other sources or inferences, such as precedents, desired outcomes, or policy preferences. Adherents look strictly at the text in question, but if that is not clear, to the legislative intent (as gleaned from contemporaneous commentaries or legislative debate) or to ideas such as natural law as understood by the lawmakers. It is often used as synonymous with originalism or textualism.\n \n There is, however, some disagreement among those who style themselves \"strict constructionists\", \"textualists\", or \"originalists\". Some of the doctrine's most forceful proponents have been Supreme Court of the United States Justice Hugo Black and former U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Chief Justice of Australia,Owen Dixon. However, Justice Antonin Scalia, who calls himself a \"textualist\", finds no rights in the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution despite the plain words and historical evidence of the many rights understood to be included in it, and statements from founders like James Madison that historical evidence had to be examined to interpret correctly. Some \"textualists\" argue that historical evidence should not be consulted to find the meanings of the words, while others argue that the inherent ambiguity of the words and the ways the meanings have changed since they were written make examination of historical evidence unavoidable, not only of the meanings, but of the then current rules of construction of words in legal usage.\n \n \"Strict construction\" is also used loosely as a term of art in American political discourse to refer to \"conservative judges\". This usage is legally problematic but pervasive. On the campaign trail in 2000, for example, President George W. Bush promised to appoint \"strict constructionists in the mold of Justices Scalia and Thomas\", even though Scalia has said that he is \"not a strict constructionist and no-one ought to be\". The meaning of \"strict construction\", then, may turn on who uses it in what context; an appellate judge asking counsel at oral argument whether the statute should be construed strictly is likely using the term in its legal sense; a candidate on the campaign trail who promises to appoint strict constructionists is likely using the term as a surrogate for a broader set of conservative legal views.\n \n \n",
