That's why I asked you to support your assertion! You then said that because the bible didn't mention the ToE, that meant it was against it. At which point, I posted as quoted above, pointing out to you that none of these other theories were mentioned in the bible either. Now, please explain to me HOW THE HELL IT IS DISHONEST TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE A SIMPLETON!?!

You're not making any sense.\nNo sense to you perhaps, but then with the ignorance you have displayed, not much would at all make sense to you.\n \n But again, this is detracting from you lying about Evidence for Evolution actally existing in Scientific Journals",

   "Hi Archangel. elec here.\n \n You may remember me from such asskickings as... well, anywhere you've tried to pass of more nonsense on this forum.\n \n I have a degree in chemistry, which -- you may know -- is a science. In order to get such a degree, I have to know how science works, which means that I know what theories are, what hypotheses are, and what facts are.\n \n I teach advanced high school chemistry. Chemistry, as you may know, is a science, and education standards mandate that I teach my students what a theory is, what a hypothesis is, and what a fact is. In order to do this, I need to know these things.\n\n \n emoticon_smile emoticon_xgood Excuse me while I get myself off of the floor. I read this post a half hour ago but have needed this much time to compose myself. You're a high school science teacher and I'm supposed to be both humbled and impressed? You know what they say about those who can't do? They teach. But those with advanced degrees at least teach college, not high school kids. So please don't puff yourself up like some intellectual who knows much more at all than how to define the theory of evolution.\n \n \nSo, should we take the word of you, Professor Quantum Mechanics, who repeatedly exposes his ignorance of science, or of me, who has the education and the career that requires him to know these things?\n \n My multiple qualifications say that you're wrong. My experience says that you don't care what qualified people say.\n\n \n Hey genius, you've just admitted you have the qualifications of a good high school student. Am I supposed to be impressed or intimidated? The only one in this conversation impressed by your puffed up self importance is YOU.",

   "No, it was a lying claim you made, that \"adaptation\" is not Evolution. That lie of yours is STILL a lie.\n A fact is a directly verifiable event. A \"theory\" outside of Science is a belief, a speculation. In Science, a \"Scientific Theory\" is the culmination in formulating a conclusion of all the evidence gathered through research in many areas.\n \n So the difference between a fact and a SCIENTIFIC Theory is that the numerous Scientific facts all sum up together in a Scientific Theory that best explains all the evidence, all the facts. You mean YOU didn't know this?\n Nope.\n Ah, only one is a \"belief system. My Christianity is Faith, and is not dependent on evidence, it is not dependent on \"seeing\" God. It is not like creationists or like the Israelites who needed the tangible golden calf to evidence their beliefs. \n \n Science, on the other hand is based on actual evidence on what is directly observable. These two concepts complement each other and do not compete outside of the concrete, absolutist, narrow-minded creationists so weak in their faith that they desperately need evidence to justify their faith.\n \n Now, none of ANY of this is anything other than you trying to distract attention away from the challenge to your actual lie of \"adaptation\" (or rapid adaptation) not being Evolution.\n \n It all indicates that you either lie about Evolution or don't know what it is.\n\n \n OK genius, regarding the bolded; now that you copy and pasted your definition from a link you failed once again to post, tell me what testable observations in real time they made to reproduce the big bang? Or how large was the laser they used to measure the light beam that traveled to the point that the big bang occurred proving how long ago it actually happened? \n \n And how about reproducing the original single celled bacteria that formed in the primordial ooze. Show me how they have reproduced in labs this bacteria growing into intelligent self sustaining life. I'd like to see it breathing our air and raising children. So get real and stop lying to me Dane. Lie to yourself if you like but stop trying to con me because I know a fraud and a fairy tale when I see one.",

You just let loose with a slew of ad hominem.\n \n \nYou know what they say about those who can't do? They teach.\n\n I \"did\" for the better part of a decade. I like teaching better because I can educate students who might otherwise turn out like you.

I met yet another high school teacher with a doctorate at a workshop today.\n \n \nSo please don't puff yourself up like some intellectual who knows much more at all than how to define the theory of evolution.\n\n It's not so much that I'm puffing myself up; I'm just making it clear that little ol' me puts you to shame.\n \n \nHey genius, you've just admitted you have the qualifications of a good high school student.\n\n A good high school student has completed a degree? A good high school student teaches advanced science classes. Amazing.

Care to document how your lie is true?\n\n \n Thanks for confirming how weak and disingenuous your beliefs are dane. When ever you, as in an evolutionist, get cornered by an opponent, you must then back up and departmentalize every aspect of science claiming them to be separate and unique with no connection to each other. But we both know that in reality they are all pieces of the same pie that makes up the scientific World view of ANY evolutionist out there today.\n \n So rather than my just accepting you once again reinterpreting my last post to be a statement of fact rather than a question for you to show how smart you allegedly are, which you failed miserably at btw, let me clarify why those questions were relevant to any scientist interested in answering the questions regarding our origins. If I asked an evolutionary scientist to explain the process by which humanity got to where we are today in 5 points or less; he would respond that point one was the occurrence of the Big Bang. Point Two was the process of Abiogenesis which led to the beginning of life on Earth. And point three was the process of evolution, and viola, allow time for Natural selection by way of Random mutation and here we are sitting here typing on our Apples, or at least I am. It's all very elementary and simple as it has been departmentalized so that mind numbed robots like you could follow it easily enough.\n \n But for you to now write this post claiming they have nothing in common proves just how either ignorant you are, or how deceitful you are. So which is it Dane? Are you ignorant? Or just attempting to deceive, as in lie about the connection these aspects of our alleged origins have to each other according to the alleged science you depend so rabidly? Being the good and faithful christian that you are of course. \n \n Now, on to the next example of your blatant ignorance:\n \n \nWho said scientists used a laser? You continue to astonish us with your outright ignorance.\n\n \n I did say scientists use Lasers Dane. Ignorant ole me, the Creationist. I thought someone as enlightened as you are would have a clue about how lasers are used to measure distances. Stupid me to assume that you would have any actual knowledge that went beyond the brainwashing in what you were told to think regarding evolution. Just admit it Dane, you aren't any deeper than a puddle. Here's a link to learn by, better still, make that 3 links.\n \n http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/RemoteSensing.html\n \n http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=511473&id=5&qs=N%3D4294697579\n \n http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn12130-moonbased-lasers-could-uncover-exotic-physics.html \n \n With an excerpt:\n Moon-based lasers could uncover exotic physics\n 14:55 25 June 2007\n NewScientist.com news service\n David Shiga\n \n Enlarge image\n A reflector left on the Moon as part of the Apollo 14 mission consists of many closely spaced reflecting prisms arranged in a grid (Image: NASA)\n \n NASA is funding the development of lasers that could be placed on the Moon to check for subtle deviations from the standard theory of gravity.\n \n Lasers have been used to make very precise measurements of the Earth-Moon distance since the Apollo era, when astronauts left reflectors at three sites on the lunar surface. A fourth reflecting device is attached to a robotic lunar lander launched by the Soviet Union.\n \n To pin down the Moon's distance, scientists bounce light from Earth-based lasers off of these reflectors and measure how long it takes to return. Because the Moon's motion is governed by gravity, such studies can be used to test whether Einstein's general theory of relativity gives an accurate description of this motion.\n \n Some speculative theories of cosmology, such as one inspired by string theory that involves exotic particles called dilatons, predict deviations from general relativity.\n \n Other theories predict that the gravitational constant (G), which measures the basic strength of gravity, is not constant at all, but varies with time. These deviations are predicted to be very subtle, so more precise measurements are needed to either detect them or rule them out.\n So my question about if Lasers have proven the time distance from the big bang till now was very reasonable to anyone who had an actual clue about modern scientific techniques and theory. You are obviously a poser trying to pass for someone who has a clue, but in fact you only know what you have been told to believe. Come back when you grow up dane, and stop calling me a liar until you can prove the anti christian fairy tales that you place your secular humanist faith in. emoticon_xgood",
