The strain hasn't been seen in the wild before making it unlikely to have come from elsewhere.\n The government lab was working with \"limited quantities\" of the virus.\n Merial was working with industrial quantities for a production run of vaccine within the last 2 weeks.",

   "Foot-and-mouth you say? Some wreckers decided to do dirty on British cattle-breeding. So what? That's common economical competition. At least Poles see it this way. But I think they actually lack brain to do this sort of thing. Imho American secret services have a finger in the pie. They've been working in that Merial lab where this virus leaked you know. And obviously they support their closest ally Poland. Poles thirst for revenge after Britons refused to back them up in case with inadequate sanitary norms agricultural production export. And now it appeared in Kent and in Chessington World of Adventures. And that's worries much. For from the same lab virus of legionellosis leaked not long ago. One man is already by near death. And it turns out that Yankees use biological weapons against Britons! But our authorities distort data not to spoil our \"friendship\" with the USA. Authorities crying on every corner about foot-and-mouth and conceal information about imminent pestilence. Worry about people, not about cattle!",
