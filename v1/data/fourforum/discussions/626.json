   "Wow, the story of this war is getting more interesting. First Rice said we are unlikely to find WMD, now Rummy says they may have been destroyed before the war.\n \n \n Iraq May Have Destroyed Weapons Before War -U.S.\n \n Tue May 27, 4:33 PM ET\n \n By Grant McCool\n \n NEW YORK (Reuters) - Iraq (news - web sites) may have destroyed its purported chemical and biological weapons before the U.S.-led invasion in March, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said on Tuesday in an effort to explain why none had been found.\n \n President Bush (news - web sites) and British Prime Minister Tony Blair (news - web sites) cited their belief that Iraq had banned weapons of mass destruction as the main reason for the March 20 invasion that ousted President Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)'s government.\n \n Rumsfeld told the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations think-tank he did not know why Iraq had not used chemical weapons against the invaders as Washington had predicted it would.\n \n He said the speed of U.S. advance may have caught Iraq by surprise, but added: \"It is also possible that they decided that they would destroy them prior to a conflict.\"\n \n Rumsfeld told his audience of foreign policy analysts, diplomats and business leaders that he suspected \"we'll find out a lot more information as we go along and keep interrogating people.\"\n \n Rumsfeld said Iraq was as large as California and search teams had only been working there seven weeks. He said there were hundreds of suspected sites to investigate.\n \n \"It will take time,\" said Rumsfeld.\n \n On May 13, Maj. Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, also raised the possibility that Iraq had destroyed its weapons stocks.\n \n \"I just don't know whether it was all destroyed years ago -- I mean, there's no question that there were chemical weapons years ago -- whether they were destroyed right before the war, (or) whether they're still hidden,\" Petraeus said.\n \n MOBILE LABORATORIES\n \n Rumsfeld said U.S. intelligence agents had confirmed that two trailers found in northern Iraq were mobile biological weapons laboratories. No actual biological weapons were found on either trailer, U.S. officials have said.\n \n The Pentagon (news - web sites) was working with the Central Intelligence Agency (news - web sites) and other U.S. intelligence-gathering agencies to assess U.S. information obtained before the war and compare it with what has been found since, Rumsfeld said.\n \n But he insisted there were no disagreements between agencies.\n \n \"We are looking at, before the conflict started, the kinds of things that we can benchmark,\" Rumsfeld said.\n \n The defense secretary, who wrote in the Wall Street Journal Tuesday that Washington would prevent a \"remake of Iraq in Iran's image,\" said Iran was \"being unhelpful today with respect to Iraq.\"\n \n \"My personal view is that I'm still amazed at how fast it went from the Shah of Iran to the clerics, to the ayatollah,\" Rumsfeld said.\n \n \"Maybe we'll be favorably surprised some day that it will go back to something ... where the people of that country will have a broader voice and an opportunity to affect their lives, which clearly they're restricted from doing.\"",
