A teen who was raised in a family of outdoorsmen and exposed to firearms in a responsible, constructive fashion would react much differently than a teen who's only exposure to firearms is his way-cool arsenal in Call of Duty.\n \n I think that much the same results could be obtained with exchanging the \"gun\" with a football. Putting a dozen or so 18-22 y.o. in a room with nothing but a football would ensure that an athletic pecking order would be established very quickly. Domineering males would be throwing the football around in a competitive, even punishing fashion, submissive males would be cowering, hoping nobody throws the ball to them. Elevated testosterone levels would be expected in both; some from competition and some from fight / flight. . .\n \n Both groups would exhibit the \"aggressive\" behavior the study offers for diametrically opposite reasons. This effect is compounded because of the anonymity; the domineering would want to prove manhood and superiority and the submissives would want to inflict revenge, . . . especially if it is on an unsuspecting non-participant. I would go so far as to hypothesize that the submissives would put more hot sauce in the water than the \"aggressive\" domineering subjects.\n \n I actually laughed out loud when the overly concerned testers believed they needed to defuse the potentially deadly aggression they caused in the test subjects:\n \"Because of the potentially arousing nature of the experiment, we wanted to ensure that all subjects were reasonably calm when they left the lab.

   "I don't know why you would claim that I've backed Bellesiles \"to the hilt\" and you might want to wonder why people on your side have defended a fraud like Lott.\n\n \n Lott's argument is that legal gun ownership saves more lives than criminal firearms possession ends. There's truth to this fact.\n \n \nLook at the context. I was replying to a claim made by Doc Jones. I often get the idea you don't read others' posts carefully when responding. Seek to understand before being understood.\n\n \n What do you know about context? You're constantly cherry picking stuff to try and make a politically motivated point.\n \n \nI don't know how you come up with such straw man arguments. Something can influence a person's thoughts and behavior without completely taking over their will.\n\n \n The argument could easily be made that anything capable of serving as a weapon could easily yield the same results, which would devastate your little parroting post here.\n \n And as has been pointed out by others, socialization plays a big part in what you're claiming. If the extent of your firearms knowledge is limited to what you see in movies, where killing people is glorified and glamorized to the point that it is, you're going to obviously experienced increased testosterone, but that doesn't mean the gun did it. On the other hand, if you were raised in a manner that taught you firearms knowledge and safety from as early as you can possibly remember, then you're not going to experience anything.\n \n You fail.
