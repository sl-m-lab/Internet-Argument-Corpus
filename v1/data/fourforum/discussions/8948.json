(I don't know what the exact definition of species is these days.) This change has been gradual and it's hard to say what the \"immediate ancestor\" would be. As I alluded to, a distant ancestor of yours is a hominid ancestor and his descendents are \"intermediate\" forms until you came along. So please define what you mean by \"immediate, direct line ancestor.\"\n \n 2. I guess you are asking what the species is that would be considered Homo sapiens sapiens closest older species. As I said, this is likely not an answerable question given the way things work. I am truly not trying to be evasive. You must word you question more precisely.\n \n 3. I really don't even know which of the Homo spp. is the closest genetically, so I couldn't answer you. Even if that is known, that doesn't preclude another intermediate species.\n \n 4. You asked the question, \"You can't even identify, with conclusive DNA evidence, the hominid you think is man's immediate, direct line ancestor.\" Please specify what you would consider \"conclusive DNA evidence.\"\n \n 5. In any event, what is your point? Are you seriously suggesting that is the creation story has some basis in fact?",

For example, it doesn't apply to systems far from thermal equilibrium, to nanoscale or microscale systems, or to open systems (although if a boundary is defined and \"bookkeeping\" is done, the law can be applied to open macroscopic systems).\n \n Third, you are ignoring the empty half of the box for your initial state. It is not as if this half does not exist merely because no marbles are contained therein.\n If you were to take the viewpoint of the marbles, as you seem to want to be doing, then in the initial state, all the marbles have \"distributed themselves evenly\" and have reached a maximum entropy possible for a system with infinite potential energy boundaries (a.k.a. impermeable barriers and box walls). When you remove the middle barrier, the marbles then \"redistribute themselves evenly\" and have reached a maximum entropy possible for a system with infinite potential energy boundaries.

   "I think you're making a handful of small mistakes here.\n \n First, I'd like to point out that while \"disorder\" can sometimes be adequate for illustrating entropy, \"disorder\" is too simplistic (and subject to .. well, personal opinion) to be useful in some cases.\n \n Second, the second law of thermodynamics applies only in certain conditions. For example, it doesn't apply to systems far from thermal equilibrium, to nanoscale or microscale systems, or to open systems (although if a boundary is defined and \"bookkeeping\" is done, the law can be applied to open macroscopic systems).\n \n Third, you are ignoring the empty half of the box for your initial state. It is not as if this half does not exist merely because no marbles are contained therein.\n If you were to take the viewpoint of the marbles, as you seem to want to be doing, then in the initial state, all the marbles have \"distributed themselves evenly\" and have reached a maximum entropy possible for a system with infinite potential energy boundaries (a.k.a. impermeable barriers and box walls). When you remove the middle barrier, the marbles then \"redistribute themselves evenly\" and have reached a maximum entropy possible for a system with infinite potential energy boundaries. In other words, if you insist on (wrongly) using only the point of view of the marbles, there is no change in entropy (save for the average altitude of the marbles being halved (which, frankly, would be an increase in entropy, not a decrease)), not a decrease in entropy.\n \n\n You've tossed a lot of variables out there in order for it to \"work\" or \"apply\" in all conditions. In that case, it doesn't deserve the term \"law\". I like Theory better.\n I'm not ignoring the empty half of the box. What other viewpoint would you suggest if not the marble's? Mine? Yours? But that's subjective, and that's my point. All of science is. We observe, and come up with theories that work most, but never all, of the time. \n The half of the box they're contained in is a state. As far as they're concerned, it's the only possible state. It isn't as if they know there's a barrier present, and that just on the other side is a new, equal space. \n What word would you use, if you don't like disorder?\n And given that this \"law\" isn't a law anyway, but a theory, what makes my interpretation of it invalid?\n The barrier is not natural, it's man-made, part of the experiment. Pile the marbles up into a pyramid, then wait for it to collapse: that I would accept. Placing arbitrary barriers and then removing them doesn't prove anything.\n Like I said, my problem begins with the standard textbook example.\n \n electrolyte wrote:\nThen you don't look hard.

This is basic logic. When two experiences are contradictory, at least one is necessarily wrong.\n \n That is true, but very misleading. Person A has the \"religious\" experience that tells them that God lives inside a block of Swiss Cheese underground, only venturing into daylight on Leap Year Good Friday's.

   "Sorry, electrolyte, that I'm just not very intelligent. Forgive me for questioning the holy laws of physics. I guess after all I am a nihilist, or at the least pseudo-Buddhist. This...\nThe problem with calling it a theory is that it's not a set of well-supported hypotheses that describe a phenomenon.\n...I don't believe is true. Seems as if that's exactly what it is since you yourself admitted it doesn't apply under all conditions, and especially since \"all\" is a very big term that could never be proven anyway. That was my whole point, unintelligent as it was, that Science in general is simply a set of hypotheses based on observations that can't ever be proven true in \"all\" circumstances. Maybe I'm being to metaphysical, maybe I've bounded off into the realm of fantasy but I can't help it. To me, this whole freakin' world is a fantasy. Just when you think you understand it something else comes along and forces you to rethink things.\n We can talk about that box of marbles all day long and you're never gonna convince me that the idea of entropy increasing is a universal truth. It's in the eye of the beholder. IMO the barrier in that box represents a flaw in the experiment. You can correct my grammar and syntax, too, if it makes ya feel better. It's my fault, since at times I type so fast I don't pay enough attention to exactly how I'm wording things. So this...\nNo, it's not; \"the half of the box in which they're contained\" is a location. The state the marbles are in could be described as \"at rest within one half of the box.\"\n...would've been the correct description; but was likely unecessary as I get the idea you understood what I meant. Thanx for correcting it tho.\n You can't tell tunnelling electrons a thing, since they have no ears that we can see, and are moving so fast we'd prob'ly sound like turtles on quaaludes to 'em. But if your idea was to compare them to marbles sitting in a box it sounds just silly. Marbles can't move of their own volition. I don't think that was your idea, but who knows? \n For what it's worth, I think the example you used to was misleading, since it was in response to this comment...\nI don't see that as a contradiction at all--it just means religious experience is different for each person. IMO it's still indication that God is real. Or at least I don't see how the idea that people get a different picture than each other invalidates it.\n...by jyoshu.\n It seemed as if (and forgive, j, if I'm putting words in your mouth; or text under your hand :P ) he was saying that you can't discredit the existence of God, or the possibility that a particular religion has validity compared to \"science\", just because they don't all agree with each other. But since a religious person isn't ever going to be convinced that any form of science has precedence over God, or that God had nothing to do with setting it all up; and since no atheist will ever be convinced that a Supreme Dude floating on a cloud put him on earth for some obscure reasons of his own, the whole thing is rather pointless. I read your posts here and I think you're very condescending and patronizing, but that's just my opinion.\n You're probably a very nice guy, but you're coming off in print just a wee bit pompous. I'm probably only saying that cuz I don't want any more arithmetic lessons, lol. I do enough math every day, thnx. I don't wanna do it in the evening too. emoticon_xhoho \n \nYou've still yet to explain why all six billion people are as specially qualified to interpret religious experiences as climatologists are to interpret climatic data.\n...to jyoshu.\n Here's the explanation: Each and every individual on this planet is uniquely qualified to interpret his/her religious experience, bar none. No one is qualifed to interpret another's religious experience validity. God can and maybe should be capable of every- and anything. That's what makes It God. God can lie. It's God, who's gonna stop It?\n \n So again, sorry if I'm coming off pompous, arrogant, condescending or patronizing. I think I'm gonna leave the room, cuz this conversation's not gonna go anwyhere once we start comparing religion and science and debating the validity of each one, or how much weight their respective followers grant the truth of their ideas. I'm gonna go get a drink and some fresh air. \n Good luck, tho, to all.\n :)",

Logic is universal; even should I not be entitled to interpret another's religious experience, I can analyze his or her interpretations. If Alice says that God told her to kill Bob, and Bob says that God told him that nobody should ever kill, how are we to know which person is correct? We have no objective basis for comparison. Every contradictory experience leads to another version of God, such that there are surely hundreds if not thousands or more Gods sending messages... That is, unless experiencers of all but one version are simply mistaken. But then, how are we to know which version is the special version that is representative of reality? Sure, we can't figure which one (if any), but that means that all the others are XXXX. That means that jyoshu's original argument of \"consensus\" goes out the window.\n Your only resolution is that God lies (1 Kings 22:23 (also 2 Chron. 18:22), Jer 20:7, 2 Thess. 2:11). Fine, let that be your personal resolution. Most believers feel that God either cannot or does not lie (Num 23:19, Titus 1:1-2). If God lies, once again we are left with no reason to believe any one version of experiences.\n You see, Yossarian, my points to jyoshu refute his assertion that \"consensus\" leads us to the conclusion that God exists; they in themselves do not explicitly turn his argument into an argument against the existence of God.",

   "What the contradictions DO show is that the different writers had different viewpoints and theologies, and therefore were not getting their beliefs via an infallible pipeline to \"GOD\". That fallsifies certain of the fundamentalist claims.\n\n \n But Christianity is based on the principles that are unified throughout scripture. There are certain priniciples in Christianity that are consistent throughout ALL the Christian books. For instance, Paul is in agreement with the gospel writers from the gospels AND Acts about the validity of the ressurection and from Matthew through Revelation, the ressurection is a theme at various points. That is not a contradiction, it is an agreement. You're focusing on contradictions as if that matters to the validity of Christianity (which isn't based on the contradictions!). The main matters that all Christians believe are matters that scripture mostly (if not all) is in harmony on. You're arguing the exceptions over the rule here, a problem I see a lot among skeptics.\n \n But more to you point, \"Infallible\" by the way, means a lot of different things to different people. Some view that term as meaning the scriptures cannot contain any error whatsoever. Others view it as a spiritual and thematic infallibility, that the Bible truly is infallible in terms of getting it's message across and serving as the Word of God.

It may be the way you feel about religion, but all I can say to the tactic is that you are dealing with things that people hold deeply sacred and dear. You might as well, for instance, be insulting people by making light of their feelings about their deceased relatives in terms of how people take this sort of things sacredly. That's what frustrates me the most by your movement--it simply tends to be, well, mean. Not in it's content and points, but in the way those points are made because it makes light of and makes fun of things that people take very dearly. I have no problems with what you're saying (other than I disagree, but that's normal debate and discourse). I DO have a problem with tactics like that and the lack of sensitivity. There's just no need to do that. With that out of the way, let me now deal with your point . . .\n \n This is is only true in part because some gods and spirits were considered such long ago as well, and some gods today are still viewed as human (christ is one such example). They just don't view the human-god 'as being among us.' However I agree with you to some extent, at least in your observations. I don't see that as demonstrating any weakness in religion however; I don't see that it devalues religion in any way that greek thinking (\"spiritual existence\") and the enlightenment effected religion. In fact there is a vein of thinking in religion that would say such reasoning is a gift of God in and of itself to help us understand things better. Seems reasonable to me.\n \n \nYou're sort of missing the whole point of not believing in something. I don't think god is damaged by . . . . .I'm passing moral judgement on your acceptance . . . .\n\n \n That's not the basis of the argument I was responding to, which is why I didn't respond based on what you're saying. In fact, the comment you're referring to wasn't a response to you at all, but someone else's post.\n \n \nDo you really think the god of the fundamentalists is damaged or reduced in some way by you passing moral judgement on it? Do you really think he's any less because you don't believe in him or choose not to follow him? And this time it's not a silly question, because you're not an unbeliever.\n\n \n Wow, you've really missed the point here. The point isn't that the 'god of the fundamentalists' is immoral--the point is that it's innaccurate. It's out of the mainstream of Christianity in terms of interpretation. You'd like to hold the fundie perspective up as a standard because it suits your desire to emphasize inconsistencies out-of-balance, but it's simply not. Again, it's arguing the exception over the rule.",

   "Optical illusions CAN be proven as unreal, measuring light, showing differences, similiarities, etc. Religious experience can't.\n\n \n Only to you it can't, because of the god-wall in your head. We demonstrate illusion and misperception by measuring reality and allowing what we discover to overrule our subjective perception. We allow the possibility that our senses are decieving us. The same kind of research can and has been carried out in the religious domain.\n \n \nWell that's your smugly (and slightly offensive) scientific opinion. On the other hand, billions of people believe in the effectiveness of prayer in helping ailments, so perhaps by your standards there are a lot more \"XXXXXX\" in the world than you realize.\n\n \n I apologise profoundly for making such a thoughtless statement.

The largest, best-controlled and best-funded study, supported by the pro-religion Templeton foundation, found that prayer had no statistical effect if the recipient was unaware of it, and actually made matters worse if they knew (possibly because of anxiety caused by thinking they needed praying for).\n\n \n Ah yes. This study has been dealt with here in the forums before at length by myself and others. The problem with your intepretation of the results is this. It measures prayer in the sense of working like a drug. But prayer is nothing more than asking God to intervene. It is NOT the prayer itself that does the healing. If there are 100 people, and 1 person out of that group is affected by prayer and the other 99 are not, then prayer has worked because there is more healing than has taken place than would be otherwise. In other words, even healing, to ANY degree by prayer, means that it has been effective. So if person A is prayed for but doesn't get better, and person B is prayed for and does, then we might as well assume that prayer works even though person A didn't get better. See what I mean? In other words the fact that person A didn't get better doesn't mean that prayer doesn't work. It's a glass half empty/half full issue. So once again, skeptics are stuck with the same problem that they can't truly prove prayer doesn't work. There's really no way to truly disprove it. I'd also say there's no way to prove it's effectiveness as well, but I believe it is your side that seeks for definitive proof on this issue given that for some reason the study is often held up as proof prayer doesn't work by people such as yourself.\n \n \nWere we discussing the effectiveness of a drug treatment, or a surgical operation, you would not hesitate to accept the results of such a study. Yet because this is prayer, you will apply some evasive reasoning to explain why your beliefs are still right, ignoring the fact you would be trumpeting that same study from the rooftops if it had supported your position.\n\n \n You're right that I would not hesitate to agree on a study of a drug treatment; but that sort of system can't work on prayer for the reasons I just gave. Prayer is something that is hoped will work to ANY degree, so if 1 out of 99 get better in a test after being prayed for, then prayer has worked. Now you will probably come back and say that such standards of thinking 1 out of 99 being good results is absurd, and it would be if it were a drug. But we're talking about prayer where ANY degree of divine intervention would be welcome. \n \n \nNevertheless, the world as it appears to operate does not require a sentient, omnipotent overmind, and nor does any appeal to any deity appear to have the slightest effect on it. You can redefine god to make the universe require one if you like, but a god of quarks and quanta and relativity and physical constants does not imply a god of salvation and redemption and concern for human affairs, and it is that kind of god for which there is no evidence or requirement in the operation of the universe.\n\n \n Again, you are making claims that you cannot possibly know for sure. From the cohesive force within atoms to the unknown of exactly how gravity works (normally called \"a property of matter\"), there is plenty you can't account for. And even with what IS there to account for, what's to say you aren't looking at the mechanism rather than the root? I'm quite comfortable with the idea that the laws of physics are means by which God maintains the universe. No, this can't be proven, but so what? Religion is not, nor ever has been about proof. The problem is that you view it as inferior or a weaker state of thinking as a result of that difference in emphasis. And therein really lies the root of problems between the scientific and religious communities, IMO. \n \n \nIt isn't me missing the point. And I think if you do a headcount you'll find that the 'mainstream' interpretation of the bible is that it's just an old book. Remember to include everyone.\n\n \n Of coruse, but I wasn't talking about mainstream in the sense of all 6 billion of the world's population. I said specifically \"out of the mainstream of Christianity.\"\n \n \nYou're happy to tell me, as a non-christian, that my opinion of god - my judgement of his behaviour and teachings - doesn't impact on the 'reality' of him, but when I observe that your own faith is also based upon your opinion of what the 'right' interpretation of the bible should be, that's somehow different. Thus I ask again:\n\n \n Look; you keep holding up differences of interpretation like it's an issue here. What I don't think you must realize is that what I view as standard interpretation cannot possibly be questioned reasonably with any reasonable reading of the NT. There really does come a point where when someone interprets differently what is read, that it is rather obvious the interpretation is erroneous. It's not like the Bible doesn't say, for instance that Christ ressurrected. It's there, plain as day. Someone cannot reasonably read the New testament for what it says and come away thinking that the Bible doesn't mean to say Christ ressurrected. As I pointed out to Trebor recently, Christianity has been built on the unifying factors of the Bible, so it's odd to me that someone would hold up discrepancies as a sign of weakness in the religion. Like it or not, there really is sound reason to think that some things are more correctly intepreted a certain way. And these are the consistent matters of the Christian faith.\n \n \nDo you think your belief that you are interpreting the bible correctly makes that interpretation more likely to be correct than the fundamentalist one? And if so, why? I firmly believe my interpretation of the bible is correct. EZ does the same. How shall we compare 'firmness'? Because I should warn you: I have weight of numbers.\n\n \n Fundamentalist views are the less accurate IMO, because they deviate from what is written. For instance, a common Christian fundamentalist understanding of scripture is that a Christian should not drink alcohol. However, that's not what the scriptures say; they say one should avoid drunkenness and excess. So yes, I believe my interpretations are more correct, and I believe the reason is that mine (more the mainstream Christian one, IMO) is truer to what the Bible actually says in the New Testament.",

I'm hungry: God's sending me a message that I should eat. I stub my toe: God loves me. I think God's telling me that there is no God: God is hungry and has stubbed His toe picking up a dollar bill on His way to the refrigerator....\n Again, you've built your case to be unfalsifiable: x was (believed to be, mistaken or not,) experienced, therefore God exists.\n \n If, as you insist, \"religious experiences\" are often misinterpreted, why should we assume that they're related to religion at all? Why can we conclude that my hunger means that God wants me to eat? In fact, why don't we assume that that eerie feeling I got at church wasn't my brain remembering that time I stubbed my toe? If humans' interpretation of these inklings is so lousy, how can you justify explaining them by using rose-tinted glasses?\n \n \nAgain, the only thing we have to go on regarding this is that the people who have them claim them to be more meaningful.\n\n And this could mean any number of things, many of which are more logical than believing in a supernatural idea-implanter.

Neuroscientists have found that stimulation of a certain region of the brain induces the subject to undergo what the subject describes as a religious experience. I don't have a source handy, but I know it was mentioned on this forum, if you'd like me to locate it. Does God watch these experimenters and decide to work his mojo at the precise times that they stimulate the brain, then stop upon their cessation?

After all, you say most are lousy at it...\n Or I could just whip out the deja vu thing that you seem to keep avoiding, then -- depending on your response -- say the same thing.\n But seriously, I'm telling people no such thing. Instead, I'm saying that there is no logical reason to believe that God is the source of these experiences, for reasons explained at length above. I don't have to know a thing about their actual experiences. \n \n \nThat's the 800 lb elephant here.

It does raise other curious questions, however, such as: Why does God send messages that He knows will be misinterpreted? Why not send different messages that He knows will be misinterpreted in a way that results in the correct interpretation? If God doesn't want program-running humanity, why does He provide programs? Worse, why does He provide programs that He knows will not work properly?\n If you would like to address these questions, feel free, but I suggest doig so in another thread. (Not that I can make you do so or would even loudly object if you did otherwise.) They're included here just as examples of things you'd need to resolve in order to maintain the consistency of your position.\n \n \nYour response avoids the heart of what I said.\n\n Not at all.

   "Perhaps not prove or disprove, but I can toss in a monkey wrench that you will find terribly hard to explain. Neuroscientists have found that stimulation of a certain region of the brain induces the subject to undergo what the subject describes as a religious experience. I don't have a source handy, but I know it was mentioned on this forum, if you'd like me to locate it. Does God watch these experimenters and decide to work his mojo at the precise times that they stimulate the brain, then stop upon their cessation? That is the necessary logical consequence of your position.\n\n \n I've read about it already. By that logic, then you might as well be questioning whether drugs really work as well and that perhaps drugs are being pumped into the brain at those precise times as well. See, just because one form of external stimulation is taking place (the experimenters) doesn't mean other forms of stimulation (drug hallucinations, supernatural visions from God) don't also take place. The stimulation of the brain speaks to the stimulation of the brain, and that's all!\n \n \nNot at all. If we can attribute any trait to God and show that that trait results in contradiction, we have shown that there cannot be a God who has that trait. It does not show that absolutely no God exists. However, logical arguments deny God so many of the basic claims of Christianity; if the \"God of Christianity\" has traits a, b, c, etc., and we show that no God can have trait a (or, say, no God can have both trait a and trait c), then we've ruled out the existence of the \"God of Christianity.\" If you want to change the traits your God possesses in order to resolve the logical inconsistencies, feel free, but you'll end up with an awfully impotent God.\n\n \n I'm sorry, but I just haven't seen you do this. All you've done is take examples of \"good\" and say they are inconsistent with examples of \"evil\" that you also read in the scriptures, but there are so many problems with that method on your part that it loses it's teeth and doesn't even work. From the disregard of context, to ignoring what I've been telling you that an omniscient God would have reasons to do things we aren't privy to, you've neglected very key points. And then there's the whole issue of assuming God should be beholden to a higher standard of morality than He is to begin with. Logic is useful, but only if you consider ALL the factors.\n \n \nWhether it is safe for \"my KIDS\" to handle a firearm is not a question of morality. Do not confuse questions of safety or wisdom with questions of morality. The question is whether shooting the rabid dog is moral. It is completely independent of the shooter.\n\n \n Of course it is! Because it would be immoral for you to let them take that action if they can't handle a firearm--they might hurt themselves! But the point is that God . . . er, the parent doesn't let the kid shoot the dog but does so himself is because he/she has good reasons for doing so that the kids don't understand. Heck, the kids don't even WANT the dog killed. To them it seems downright vindictive and evil of God . . . er, the parent, to shoot an innocent dog. What kind of parent would do that sort of thing?

I never suggested there aren't cases where some think they have a religious experience and they might be in fact having something else.

If someone claims a religious experience soon after drinking peyote, then I'd say there's a very good chance it wasn't a truly religious experience.

   "Well, if a given experience wasn't caused by God, then it's not truly a religious experience, now is it?\n\n And finally you have acknowledged the problem. You have defined \"religious experience\" as an experience caused by God. In other words, you're saying that those experiences caused by God are experiences caused by God, and those that aren't caused by God aren't caused by God. Yet you have no criterion for determining which experiences were caused by God and which were caused by other factors.

(the God-looks-evil-sometimes-argument). \n\n No, I recognize fully well that this is your argument. My point is that the universality of this argument is its downfall: you can claim that any and every action that God takes is justified, even were it bad. Presume there were some action x that would be wrong (by His standards) for God to perform. If God did perform action x, your justification would still hold that God's action was not wrong. Your justification is therefore an unreliable assessment of whether God's actions are right or wrong.\n \n \nBut it IS morally wrong for the KID to kill the dog. Sigh. Never mind.

He has not been trained to use a gun properly. He sees a dangerous, rabid dog while his parents are not around. He grabs a gun and shoots the dog, killing it. Was the boy's action immoral?\n No, the boy's action, however dangerous, was not immoral.\n \n Is an experienced marskman shooting a harmless, healthy dog immoral? (Yes.)\n Is an experienced marskman shooting a dangerous dog immoral? (No.)\n \n Is an inexperienced child firing a gun immoral? (No.)\n Is giving an inexperienced child a gun to fire immoral? (Yes.)\n And appropriately,\n Is an inexperienced child shooting a dangerous dog immoral? (No.)\n Is giving an inexperienced child a gun with which to shoot a dangerous dog immoral?

You're confusing the idea of showing something about prayer is not disproven with the idea of proving prayer.\n\n \n No, no, no.\n \n I wasn't talking about the study (but I will in a sec), I was talking about how you view the world. How you observe something and what information you take from that. You said something to the effect that if you prayed for 100 people, and only 1 got better, then that could mean that prayer had an effect.\n \n Well it could. But so could an infinite number of things, and they would be no more or less likely. Anything could have had an effect, but I would have no way to know that. And I wouldn't hang my hat on it. As such I could make no statement about the effect of any of those things, including prayer. Therefore, I should have no belief in my mind and heart about what had an effect on that one person getting better. \n \n I could say, I like to believe that prayer had an effect, or it makes me feel good to believe that prayer had an effect, but there is no way I could know with any degree of certainty that prayer had anything to do with it. And if that is the case and that is how you feel, why would you put any reliance in the value of prayer over anything else?\n \n Now, about the study. You made a distinction between a study that uses prayer to heal versus one that would use a drug. When you study something scientifically, the world doesn't change. The scientific experiment is only a structured way of observing the world, because when we look at the world the way we do every day, there is a whole lot going on to confuse us into thinking something may be happening that in truth is not. \n \n \nThe real purpose of the scientific method is to make sure Nature hasn't misled you into thinking you know something you don't actually know.\n -ROBERT M. PIRSIG, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\n When you pray for someone or if you give them a drug, the universe still behaves the same in both circumstances. You mentioned something about the study disproving something. Science never does disprove anything, nor can it. It can't prove anything for that matter. The basic premise of an interventional study such as this is that the world behaves the same with or without an intervention. The intervention may affect the outcome, but it didn't alter the way the world behaves day in and day out. \n \n So the given, or null hypothesis, is that there will be no difference between people who get prayed for and people who don't. To believe that there is a difference (which you say you do), the outcome after the intervention should be statistically different than the group for which there was no intervention. The difference is one of likelihood. With a statistical degree of certainty, a difference will or will not be seen. In the case of the study in question, no difference was seen; the null hypothesis was not rejected. If this is done with a p value of less than 0.05, which means that what we saw may have happened by chance, less than 5% of the time. The average number of healings in one group was no different than the average number of healings in the other, statistically speaking. \n \n Anyway, your concept that somehow things are not comparable because we were using prayer as an intervention makes no sense. If indeed prayer makes a difference, shouldn't it be observable at least sometime? If there is no way to observe a difference, there is no way to have any degree of confidence there really is a difference.\n \n You can't have it both ways. Belief and certainty.\n \n If you say faith-based beliefs can never be empirically demonstrated to have validity, you are saying that faith is not based on reason or logic. Believing in something for which there is no evidence or for which there never could be any observable evidence that suggests that belief is false, is admitting irrationality.\n \n So, I can accept someone saying there is no rational reason to believe that prayer makes a difference in the way the world works, it just makes me feel better. But please at least admit the rejection of rationality. \n \n You have to admit therefore, that praying to the Christian God is as effective animist incantations, crystals and pyramids or my magic wand.

How do we know, for instance, that the people in the group that got worse wouldn't have gotten better without prayer? It is equally \"logical\" based on your reasoning to come to this conclusion as it is to come to yours.\n\n \n I agree, it could go either way (or neither). But I'm not the one out to prove/disprove anything here.",

   "I think we might be at impasse here. To a rationalist this statement is self-defeating and plainly flawed: we can never know how much improvement there would have been otherwise, and the probability that prayer has lowered it is, in the absence of contrary evidence, as great as the probability that it has raised it. (Both will centre on zero.) \n\n \n Actually, that's exactly what I'm saying you can't disprove prayer. \"we can never know how much improvement there would have been otherwise\" is dead on.",

   "\n ... because for people that pray, ANY amount of improvement post-prayer is more than there would be otherwise. \n\n \n I still cannot fathom how you can maintain this statement. Please explain. It seems so obviously false, I must be missing something.\n \n \n\n First, I definitely question those findings. I highly doubt them, and would prefer to see how the study was conducted and the specifics of what all it entailed. \n\n \n 1. On what basis do you doubt the findings? It was sponsored by a religious organization. What specifics would you like to see? Perhaps I can provide them for you.\n 2. Why do you care of the specifics when you maintain that the results are irrelevant anyway?\n \n I recognize that this was only one study. The more such data could be replicated, the more powerful the conclusions can be. Nonetheless, it was well designed and should count for something.\n \n \n \n \n\n But again, even if one group did get worse after being prayed for as the study supposedly claims, how does that prove that prayer doesn't work? How do we know, for instance, that the people in that group wouldn't have gotten worse regardless? \n\n We know that because of a matched control group. \n \n \n \n \n\n Frankly, I'm surprised you guys are treating this study like it disproves prayer because I honestly thought you guys knew better than this.\n \n Indeed we know better. We never said that.\n But thanks for the snotty condescension.\n \n \nFor anyone who believes in prayer, they know it doesn't work like a drug. It's not a medicene. It's asking a deity to intervene--that's ALL it is. The act of prayer--asking--doesn't mean someone will be healed, and religious people generally realize this. You can't accurately measure prayer. It just doens't work that way.\n\n How does it work then? And more importantly, how would you ever know?\n No one was measuring prayer anyway, they were measuring outcomes with and without prayer. \n Anyway, who says you can't measure prayer?",

   "\n yes, I've already told you now very clearly that I'm not out to prove that prayer works. my post was in response to you thinking that the study DISPROVES prayer. It doesn't. \n\n Stop it. Stop it.\n You can't disprove anything. No one has asserted that. You deleted the part of my post that said that. I said\n \nScience never does disprove anything, nor can it. It can't prove anything for that matter.\n\n why did you ignore that.\n \n \n \n\n you have no way of knowing if it did or didn't. If I recover from a terminal disease for unknown reasons, and it just so happens I was prayed for, there's no way you can know for sure that the world, in that way, would have behaved the same way without the prayer (OR with it). See, you can't measure that. You'll never be able to show me conclusively that the world behaves the same regardless of prayer because you've got no way to know if it would have turned out differently had I not prayed. \n But again, because you have no way of knowing how things would have turned out for the group that WAS prayed for had they not been, those stats don't really mean anything here.\n I agree, it could go either way (or neither). But I'm not the one out to prove/disprove anything here.\n\n Neither are we, you &$*$^&*&%\n \n You don't listen. Are you saying we can draw no conclusions from paired interventional stuides such as this?",
