   "And besides, why get so defensive about polygamy anyway? It's not like it's some horrible thing to be compared to.\n\n \n The problem is not that we are associated with polygamy, it is that you consider marriages as such: opposite-sex marriage, and everything else. So instead of consider same-sex marriage on it's own terms, you have chosen to believe that it is only possible have same-sex marriage if we also have everything else.\n \n Yet we've shown that we can have opposite-sex marriage without having everything else, haven't we? And there is no logical reason to believe that opposite-sex marriage is any less like polygamy than same-sex marriage, is there? So it appears to me that evidence is on the side of those who claim that same-sex marriage does not mandate polygamous marriage.\n \n Further, even though being associated with polygamy is not a bad thing, such an association tends to make people forget that there are reasons to deny polygamous marriage which do not apply to same-sex marriage. So all a person has to do is say, \"I know polygamy's wrong, so same-sex marriage must be wrong too.\" But in truth, no person is any more justified in saying that than they are in saying, \"I know polygamy's wrong, so I know opposite-sex marriage must be wrong too.\"\n \n As I have stated in the past, instead of stating that same-sex marriage mandates polygamous marriage, explain why the harms of polygamous marriage that I described are either false or also apply to same-sex marriage.",

But equality is not always the right move. If equality can be shown to be more harmful than it is helpful, then we should not allow that equality.\n \n But equality is a good thing. I can say, \"We should allow incestuous marriage because it would be more equal.\" That is a logically valid point, and it accurately describes one of the benefits of incestuous marriage. However, incestuous marriage also has a lot of good reasons that we should disallow it as well. We've got to weigh the benefits of incestuous marriage against the harms, and we have to see which one comes out on top.\n \n Certainly the arguments of freedom and equality apply as equally to same-sex marriage as they do to incestuous marriage, but foundation of the debate is the harms incestuous marriage creates. Those harms are not present in same-sex marriage.\n \n In the case of polygamous marriage, I'm not so certain that claims of inequality or no freedom can be made. Polygamists are as able to use the benefits of marriage as anyone else is, they just can't extend those benefits to everyone in their relationship. Though realistically, no one is allowed to extend those benefits to more than one other; I really don't think that constitutes inequality or a denial of freedom by promoting one lifestyle over another.",
