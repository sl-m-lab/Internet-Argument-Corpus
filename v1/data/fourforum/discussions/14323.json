The rig, one of the largest and most sophisticated in the world, had been under contract to BP, the London-based oil giant, since September 2007. The Deepwater Horizon accident spewed thousands of barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico, and experts said it could become the largest accidental oil spill in history.\n \n BP is responsible for the cleanup, but has pointed out repeatedly that Transocean had been operating the rig and was the owner of the \"blowout valve'' that was designed to cut off leaking oil, but which had proved impossible to activate.\n Transocean's corporate motto is \"We're never out of our depth.\" But that assertion has been increasingly called into question since the spill began.\n \n Throughout its history, Transocean has been known for pushing the envelope. The company, the leading player in offshore oil drilling, proudly breaks records for drilling the deepest wells, while finding ways to keep oil and gas flowing under the most extreme pressures and temperatures. On the financial side, Transocean has pursued aggressive tax strategies and bought up competitors.\n Transocean Ltd - The New York Times \n",

But while 90 per cent of energy is lost when one organism eats another, the toxin accumulates as the bigger fish eat the numerous small ones they need to survive. \n \n Plankton, the drifting organic soup that fills the sunlit upper waters of the Gulf of Mexico and every other productive patch of sea, is the first stage to be affected by the oil. It is made up of algae, microscopic animals, tiny invertebrates, larvae and more, but the composition depends on time of year, water conditions and location. \n \n Most plankton will simply die if exposed to enough oil, but what happens next depends on what was in this soup. If fish have been spawning in the area - as the highly endangered Atlantic bluefin tuna have been - then an entire year could be lost. Dispersed into specks the oil may be ingested directly through the cell walls, or by the tiny animals that normally eat algae or the fish that eat plankton. Once inside a living body, some toxins will start to poison while others are stored away in tissues as a toxic time bomb. \n \n Eventually, these will reach the very top of the marine food web, to the swordfish, wahoo, tuna and snappers so prized by game fishermen and restaurateurs. In waters closer to shore, filter feeders such as shellfish and shrimp accumulate them directly. At the end of the food chain, they end up in our own fatty tissues, waiting for the moment when those reserves are broken down before they are released into our systems.\n\n \n This is exactly what I just read in Silent Spring! emoticon_angry Only then, it was intentional stupidity with the use of pesticides on land. \n \n As described in this article regarding underwater life, the same exact thing happened with landlife: the soil was made toxic, the smallest lifeforms there became toxic, the birds feeding on the worms became toxic, the mammals feeding on them became toxic...all the while, the toxicity levels multiplied, and were stored in the fatty tissue.\n \n The same thing happened in the rivers, ponds and lakes: starting with the smallest and passing on to the fish and then the birds and mammals that ate them.\n When the water was tested in one lake, it showed no sign of the toxin but, the plant and animal life had levels off the chart!\n \n As admitted in every article I've read on this, this is a science experiment in progress - no one knows what to do or, how it will turn out.\n One thing is sure though, Life will survive. It may take tens or, hundreds or, thousands or, millions of years and humans may not be here to see it but, Life will prevail - even if in some alien, mutant form. emoticon_xbouncer\n \n Changing the chemistry of the Gulf may even produce some interesting mutants in our lifetime. emoticon_cry",

Deep water drilling is not easy because once they start drilling they really dont know what they are going to hit. It took them 40 years to understand the physiological impact of microgravity on the human body (and they are still studying it), and they had the advantage of firsthand observation. Figuring out how the pressure at 5000+ ft is going to impact a well that you are drilling is pretty much a shot in the dark until we have done it enough times to understand it better. \n \n The simplistic view you take on this leaves me wondering about your cognitive abilities. I lost a Bulldozer this week. It is a Cat D9. Worth about $500,000.00. It was on top of a pile of shot rock pushing it down to the pit floor where a pair of wheel loaders were picking it up and loading it in a crusher. The thing started to overheat. The PROPER thing to do would have been for the operator to shut it down right away and report the problem. He thought he could make it down to the pit floor before it overheated completely. He was wrong. The ramp to the pit floor that he had planned on using had been taken out, so he had to backtrack all the way back across the blast face. Halfway across, the engine blew. On inspection it turns out that the problem was a bad thermostat....available at any auto parts store for about $12. \n \n By your thinking, that was not just an equipment failure followed by a bad judgment call. It was obviously a nefarious plot to cost me a small fortune on a replacement engine because, after all, if we can put a man on the moon SURELY we can push rock off a hill without mishap. Hell, Caterpillar must be in on is because if we can put a man on the moon, surely we can build a thermostat that does not fail! \n \n Fortunately for the guy running the dozer, I am an adult, and one thing I have learned in my life is that $h1t happens. When I pulled in and he walked up to my truck crying (jobs are very hard to come by around here, he has a wife and 3 kids, and was sure he was going to be joining the ranks of the unemployed) instead of demanding a criminal probe before I had any idea what the hell was going on, I told him \"I buy your mistakes, too....get the anchor chains loaded and up there so we can drag the thing down\".\n \n Honestly, I would have made the same call if I was him. It was not overheating too badly when he decided to run for the floor. Obviously it was a bad call since it caused a small fortune worth of damage (still waiting to find out exactly what a new engine is going to cost), but, as anybody who has ever been in any kind of position of responsibility can tell you, $h1t happens.",

I guess I agree emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n How cute is that. I guess personal liability doesn't exist for you. Anything that goes wrong is just a mistake. Negligence is just a mistake in judgment, lying would be a mistake in telling the truth, disregarding standard procedure or stated practices is just mistakenly doing something that is not supposed to be done or not doing something that is supposed to be done. \n \n And the point you wanted to make with this is?\n \n \nWell, we have no evidence of a shortcuts or malicious intent...all we have is some guy making a bad call combined with a freak malfunction of the BOP. \n\n \n We have a little more than that and I said if there is no negligence and it's just fate then liability is limited. I don't expect they break out tarot cards and predict what will happen, I don't even expect they follow every single procedure to the letter, but they better be close and they better be prepared to take a hit if they deviated enough to cause the accident.\n \n Is that unfair to you?\n \n \nThe regulatory agency wouldn't have prevented anything. From all of our extremely limited knowledge of drilling oil 5,000ft under the sea I doubt we can claim pumping salt water instead of heavy mud was speeding up anything. In fact, from what Daewoo posted it served no benefit either way. Furthermore, it was a guy who is now dead that made the decision...not like the BP execs were ordering they pump salt water in. \n\n \n That is the function of regulators. The determine best practices and insure compliance. It is believed that regulators failed to act on reports and tests that the blow out shear valves may not work at that level. Testing of batteries to make sure they still have a charge and understanding the potential risks associated with pipe pressure readings will now be things that regulators will seek to insure oil rig operators are competent in.\n \n \nNo greed, just negligence but someone combined with equipment failure. Lucky for you sitting in a cushioned computer chair, when you make a mistake at work you don't cause a disaster so no one jumps all over you. It's a risky job and a freak accident happened and BP is cleaning it up....what more can you say or want?\n\n \n Just think there are 11 guys who can't do that anymore because what all 11 made a boo boo, 1 or 2 were guilty of monkey business or horsing around?

   "[QUOTE]\nNo, they dont, because they dont know what \"best practices\" are.\n \n Being a federal regulator/inspector is frankly a job for semi competent people who want to throw their weight around. Anybody who actually fully understands (or at least understands as fully as possible) deep sea drilling is working for an oil company and making $170,000 per year. The federal regulators who are making those rules make $80,000. The inspectors who are enforcing them (if you can call it that) make $65,000. If those regulators and inspectors actually knew what the hell they were doing, they would be working for the oil company pulling down 2-3x what they are making to annoy the oil company. \n \n\n \n \n Prove it. \n \n Not the compensation, but that all the regulators are incompetent. \n \n Until then your opinion is noted.\n \n \nThis brings to mind the explosion at the massey energy mine not long ago where so many people here were eager to blame the mining company and condemn them. Then they actually get in to investigate and it looks increasingly like MSHA....the federal regulators....blew up that mine. They have found cracks in the floor where, they think, methane came up, reached explosive levels, and detonated. This happened because MSHA, despite strenuous objections from the mining engineers at Massey, made them adopt a ventilation plan that decreased air flow which allowed the methane to ignite. \n\n \n Ok first why are you comparing two completely different events expecting the circumstances to be the same speculative theory for both? \n \n But lets for a moment play what if. In 2004 when regulators told Massey to make changes to the ventilation system it was to increase it. Now what isn't being talked about is why 5 years later regulators wanted to install a system that would reduce ventilation nor why Massey would not argue (they are allowed to do that) Regulators, even the dumb ones typically don't make a company downgrade safety features unless request is made by the company because it is overly burdensome. \n \n Any ideas why?\n \n Interesting about Massey also\n \n The company is targeted by the FBI for possible criminal negligence, National Public Radio reported earlier on its website.\n Safety Violations\n In a preliminary report to President Barack Obama this month, the Labor Department said it had been watching Massey and Upper Big Branch closely because of violations. The operation racked up 639 U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration violations from January 2009 to the accident.\n Three of the company's mines are among the top 20 in the U.S. ranked by the number of \"significant and substantial\" violations accrued since January 2009, according to MSHA data. Upper Big Branch, with 238 S&S citations, had two fewer than the 20th-ranked mine. \n \n FBI Said to Conduct Criminal Probe of Massey Explosion - Bloomberg\n \n \n Why do you feel BP has little or no liability?\n \n \nMSHA, of course, is saying that Massey is responsible for all operations at the mine, including the air flow plan....even though MSHA forced them to adopt it.\n\n \n And of course Massey being pure as the driven snow is just the poor misunderstood victim. \n \n Once more nobody knows who did what, well except for you.\n \n \nAn MSHA engineer makes about $70,000 per year. A mining engineer at a company like Massey start at about $65,000 right out of college and can expect to be north of $100,000 within 10 years.\n\n \n And I bet they can make twice that working for the government and then going to work for the oil company. It's what DA's do so after 5 years they have all kinds of defense experience and contacts or are they XXXXXX also?\n \n \nSo who are the engineers at MSHA? Sucky engineers who could not get jobs anywhere else because they are dumber than a box of rocks. \n \n Even if the government DID pay better, you would still find nothing but losers and half wits doing it because anybody who is actually GOOD at that kind of thing is going to want to be out there DOING it, not sitting behind a government issued desk somewhere making life difficult for those who are.\n\n \n Prove they are all worthless and you might have a point otherwise you have an opinion",

   "And negligence is not always criminal either.\n\n \n \n That is right. Did I say negligence is always criminal?\n \n \nYou don't know what a mistake is and you certainly don't know what negligence is.\n \n \n Ok, tell me what have I said was negligent and really wasn't? What did I say was a mistake and wasn't?\n \n \n \nIf a BP employee was driving a gas truck and speeding and then crashed you might say the employee was negligent. BP would be responsible for the damages. I would say this applies. I don't think there is any evidence that BP was negligent in the design or \"cutting corners\" as you say and more importantly not criminally negligent. \n \n \n You don't think. You thought enough to make a comment a paragraph before, but now you don't know for sure. At the bottom of this, sorry for the length, is an article from the Wall Street Journal. I tried to take just the really relevent points but there were alot\n \n \n \nSo you admit to having no clue what happened?\n\n \n Did I specifically say this is what happened?\n \n \nI think Daewoo nails this one. I could add some things as a former auditor (which is similar in idea to an inspector) but why bother unless you want to know.\n\n \n Maybe you should Daewoo didn't convince me\n \n \nYeah, exactly. One person makes a bad call and people die. That's why you try to be as safe as possible but you can never fully stop \"stupid\". It only takes one lapse of judgment...one slip of the knife.\n\n \n No kidding I thought I made that pretty clear when I said pretty much the same thing. I just continued on with the thought \n \n \nNo fate, all just a bad call with equipment failure. I suppose you could call it fate since the chances of both happening at the same time is small but a chance still mean it could happen and it did. BP is liable and should clean it up...but to say the company is a bunch of crocks or something based upon this event is silly.\n\n \n Like I said before a mistake would be choosing to not put into place procedures that are over and above requirements which results in an accident. That mistake isn't really negligent just a bad call. Choosing to ignore warnings, disregard test results, bypass required procedures and rush through something dangerous that you have little experience with is a mistake that is also considered negligent. \n \n Now if the oil folks know better than the regulators there is nothing that prevents them from doing more to insure safety they just are not permitted to do less, but it seems they did anyway.\n \n \n Oh I just wanted to point out also the guy in charge of the rig, the oil guy who making the big bucks knows more about drilling than the regulators. Didn't know jack about deep sea drilling. He was there so he could learn.\n \n \n BP, for instance, cut short a procedure involving drilling fluid that is designed to detect gas in the well and remove it before it becomes a problem, according to documents belonging to BP and to the drilling rig's owner and operator, Transocean Ltd.\n BP also skipped a quality test of the cement around the pipe-another buffer against gas-despite what BP now says were signs of problems with the cement job and despite a warning from cement contractor Halliburton Co.\n According to a company document seen by the Journal, BP approved spending $96.2 million and about 78 days on the well. The target time was much less-about 51 days. By April 20, the well was in its 80th day, owing to delays such as one that had begun on March 8.\n That day, workers discovered that gas was seeping into the well, according to drilling reports from the rig reviewed by the Journal. Workers lowered a measuring device to determine what was happening, but when they tried to pull it back up, it wouldn't budge. Engineers eventually told them to plug the last 2,000 feet of the then-13,000-foot hole with cement and continue the well by drilling off in a different direction.\n The episode took days to resolve, according to drilling reports, not counting time lost to backtracking and re-drilling. Each additional day cost BP $1 million in rig lease and contractor fees.\n Other problems arose. The rock was so brittle in places that drilling mud cracked it open and escaped. One person familiar with the matter estimates BP lost at least $15 million worth of the fluid.\n Halliburton, the cementing contractor, advised BP to install numerous devices to make sure the pipe was centered in the well before pumping cement, according to Halliburton documents,\n In an April 18 report to BP, Halliburton warned that if BP didn't use more centering devices, the well would likely have \"a SEVERE gas flow problem.\" Still, BP decided to install fewer of the devices than Halliburton recommended-six instead of 21.\n BP said it's still investigating how cementing was done. Halliburton said that it followed BP's instructions, and that while some \"were not consistent with industry best practices,\" they were \"within acceptable industry standards.\"\n The cement job was especially important on this well because of a BP design choice\n Despite the well design and the importance of the cement, daily drilling reports show that BP didn't run a critical, but time-consuming, procedure that might have allowed the company to detect and remove gas building up in the well.\n Before doing a cement job on a well, common industry practice is to circulate the drilling mud through the well, bringing the mud at the bottom all the way up to the drilling rig.\n Circulating all the mud in a well of 18,360 feet, as this one was, takes six to 12 hours, say people who've run the procedure. But mud circulation on this well was done for just 30 minutes on April 19, drilling logs say, not nearly long enough to bring mud to the surface.\n Three offshore engineers the Journal asked to review the drilling reports all pointed to the failure to circulate the mud completely as a serious mistake.\n BP also didn't run tests to check on the last of the cement after it was pumped into the well, despite the importance of cement to this well design and despite Halliburton's warning that the cement might not seal properly.\n BP told the Journal Tuesday that the tests weren't run because they were needed only if there were signs of trouble in the cement job, and the work seemed to go smoothly. But the same day, BP officials told congressional investigators there were signs before the disaster that the cement might have been contaminated and that some cementing equipment didn't work properly, according to a memo from two Congressmen.\n A little after 5 p.m., to check the well's integrity and whether gas was seeping in, rig workers did what is called a \"negative pressure test.\" It was supervised by a BP well-site leader, Robert Kaluza. His experience was largely in land drilling, and he told investigators he was on the rig to \"learn about deep water,\" according to Coast Guard notes of an interview with him. BP declined to comment on his experience.\n The test initially strayed from the procedure spelled out in BP's permit, approved by the MMS, according to the Coast Guard interview with Mr. Kaluza. When the first test results indicated something might be leaking, workers repeated the test, this time following the permitted procedure. The second time, pressure rose sharply, with witnesses saying that the well \"continued to flow and spurted,\"\n Earlier this month, BP lawyers told Congress the test results were \"inconclusive\" or \"not satisfactory.\" On Tuesday, according to the Congressmen's memo, BP said it saw signs of \"a very large abnormality.\"\n BP's plans for the well, approved by the MMS on April 16, called for workers to remove the mud before performing two procedures designed to make sure gas couldn't get into the well.\n The first called for installing a giant spring to lock the seal at the top of the well in place after removal of the mud. There's no evidence in rig-activity logs the spring was ever installed. If gas was coming up the sides of the well, pushing against the seal, this spring would have helped prevent leakage.\n Second, BP opted to remove the mud before placing a final cement plug inside the well.\n BP Decisions Made Well Vulnerable - WSJ.com",

Because I said so worked when you were 3 and it came from your mom. I don't hold much hope, but you can try it again if you want or maybe you can prove that all the regulators are incompetant. \n \n \n \nI am not comparing the 2 events...I am comparing the 2 regulatory agencies which are both structurally flawed and for the same reason.\n \n \n Oh and here I thought this was about whether BP had a string of unforeseeable accidents coupled with a mistake or two. Random chance and a bad call. or whether the mistakes they made consisted of not following required procedures and disregarding safety measures in order to complete the job faster and cheaper despite warnings that by doing so they were potentially going to have a malfunction.\n \n Instead you want to compare two unique scenarios not with each other but with the agencies that regulate them. Because there appears to be mistake made by one that by default means the other must have as well since all regulators are half witted failures who couldn't get a better job. Sound about right?\n \n \nNope, because while MSHA admits that they forced Massey to change their ventilation system, they are not saying why, and the folks at Massey apparently have no idea...they say the entire change was nonsensical and expensive. Massey DID argue. Unfortunately all you get from MSHA is an internal review...unless you want to spend a couple million dollars fighting it in federal court. \n\n \n So the change could be anything from MSHA was wrong to Massey bribed the regulator to there was a valid reason for the change. \n \n Funny Massey argued but doesn't know why they lost the challenge and neither do the regulators who denied it. What prompted the change? It had been in place for 4 years and a regulator had to provide something other than because it's drafty in his order for the change. Seems to me it should not be all that hard to determine why. Now once they determine that that was the cause this will be relevant to the Massey case, but still won't matter as far as BP is concerned.\n \n \n \nNo all that surprising. A whole bunch of people die and the FBI is conducting a criminal probe...which does not indicate there is any evidence whatsoever that a crime occurred, merely that they are looking to see if there was one.\n \n\n \n Yeah the FBI typically gets involved in work related injury/death claims. It lightens the load on local law enforcement. \n \n True one is innocent until the verdict comes back guilty. Even BP.\n \n \nSince I have been given an S&S violation for having an extension cord with worn (not worn through, but you could see where it had rubbed on something) insulation, I have trouble getting too excited about the number of S&S violations a mine has received. I will leave that to people like you who like to get really excited over things they know absolutely nothing at all about. \n\n \n That isn't even a nice try. If that is the best you can do you are better off spending your day looking for a new extension cord or getting yourself some electrical tape. By the way who gets written up for having a worn extension cord? Must have really made an impression on that regulator and this happened despite all that knowledge you posses. The world is just an evil place.\n \n \n \nThere is a significant incentive for Massey to NOT blow up mines, thus losing tens of millions of dollars in equipment, production, and compensation to the families of dead miners. \n \n That is part of the reason that you look like such a fool for arguing that what happened on the deepwater horizon was not a mistake, or that it was not an accident.

They did not do that on purpose, and it is reasonable to assume that they would have done their VERY BEST to ensure that it did not happen. \n\n \n I get a special little feeling when someone goes out of their way to come across as superior only to trip and fall flat on their aXX.\n \n Yes, Mr. T pity the fool he might be you one day. I am not arguing that what happened on the DH wasn't an accident or the result was the intention. I never said it was nor even implied it. What I am saying is that the mistakes that were made appear to be the intentional choice to not perform required steps that are in place not to completely eliminate possible accidents, but significantly reduce the chances. Unless someone is looking for an insurance settlement, which I don't think BP is, they don't intend for an accident to happen. If your late and you run a red light sometimes you will make it and sometimes you won't. The odds of being in an accident are significantly higher by running the red and the accident will be your fault. Why because you made a mistake and were negligent. The other driver maybe hit the accelerator instead of the brakes. That was a mistake but not negligent.\n \n You think you have it now?\n \n \nWell safety, like mining safety, is one of those areas where market forces really have solved the problem. Workmans comp and insurance rates have pretty much killed the days when evil mine operators traded lives for production. Injuries and deaths on the job are simply to expensive to allow dangerous working conditions to exist.

IF workers comp had half the weight you want to give them credit for we would all walk around in bubble suites. \n \n Are you just hoping I am as dumx as you are acting with this statement or are you not acting? You have heard of that terrible urban legend where a company figures what the worst case scenario could be and then the likelihood of it happening. Then they figure out the earning potential verse the liability potential and for some if that earning potential is enough above the liability and the likelihood is small enough they will risk it.\n \n I am not a big fan of government control, but people cry out for regulation when industry fails to regulate itself. Had BP not cut some corners the new stiffer rules for the oil industry that will come from this wouldn't happen. Example I think anybody who wants to have a gun should be able to have one, but as a society we there are far to many people who are irresponsible with them to permit that. Because of those people gun laws are put in place. You want to crack down on government because it is performing its function which is to maintain stability and protect the population. Instead of Industry whose function is to be profitable. The formula is very simple\n \n Blow people up = stricter regulations\n Don't blow people up = relaxed regulations\n \n Not difficult or do you disagree?\n \n \nThis is really the best plan you can come up with??\n\n \n Which plan would that be?\n \n \nNope. It works for DAs/attorneys because by working in the prosecutors office and then on the defense side they see both sides of the process. The other side of mining is not MSHA...it is a hole in the ground...and a person can not work for 5 years as a hole in the ground or a rock. The regulatory agency is not the other side, they are just a major pain in the butt that comes with digging the hole. \n\n \n That would be a good guess but not really the correct answer. Would you like to try again?\n \n \nI have seen several instances where somebody who was with MSHA leaves and tries to open a consultancy for mines. They don't last very long because 20 years at MSHA does not really provide any benefit since the next ignorant loser that they send out will likely have his own set of ridiculous rules.\n\n \n Spoken like somebody who makes his own rules because he knows better than anybody else. You must become so frustrated with others who don't know as much as you. How come you don't know how to fix that?",

   "\n Now here is something worth a chuckle. Because I said so worked when you were 3 and it came from your mom. I don't hold much hope, but you can try it again if you want or maybe you can prove that all the regulators are incompetant. \n\n \n ROTFLMAO\n \n Straw man. \n \n \n \nOh and here I thought this was about whether BP had a string of unforeseeable accidents coupled with a mistake or two. Random chance and a bad call. or whether the mistakes they made consisted of not following required procedures and disregarding safety measures in order to complete the job faster and cheaper despite warnings that by doing so they were potentially going to have a malfunction.\n \n Instead you want to compare two unique scenarios not with each other but with the agencies that regulate them. Because there appears to be mistake made by one that by default means the other must have as well since all regulators are half witted failures who couldn't get a better job. Sound about right?\n\n \n You made an asinine, poorly thought out, and ill informed statement about regulators setting forth \"best practices\". This is an offshoot from that. It is absolutely illogical for you to assume that the regulators are going to be the experts that set \"best practice\" since they are not the best out there....unless of course they are all humanitarians who are working for half what they could make in the private secotr because they just love the long hours, crappy pay, and lack of respect so much. \n \n \n \nSo the change could be anything from MSHA was wrong to Massey bribed the regulator to there was a valid reason for the change. \n \n Funny Massey argued but doesn't know why they lost the challenge and neither do the regulators who denied it. What prompted the change? It had been in place for 4 years and a regulator had to provide something other than because it's drafty in his order for the change. Seems to me it should not be all that hard to determine why. Now once they determine that that was the cause this will be relevant to the Massey case, but still won't matter as far as BP is concerned.\n \n\n \n No, they did not have to prove anything. MSHA issues an order for a change like that and puts a compliance date on it. If you have not made the change by the compliance date, they close you down. So you lose millions in production while you argue it out with them. \n \n And MSHA STILL does not have to prove anything at all ever. They do not even have to give a REASON for the change. \"Because we said so\" is all they need. \n \n \n\n Yeah the FBI typically gets involved in work related injury/death claims. It lightens the load on local law enforcement. \n \n True one is innocent until the verdict comes back guilty. Even BP.\n\n \n 20 dead in a federally regulated facility? Yep...the FBI is going to be looking into it no matter what the circumstances are.\n \n \nThat isn't even a nice try. If that is the best you can do you are better off spending your day looking for a new extension cord or getting yourself some electrical tape. By the way who gets written up for having a worn extension cord? Must have really made an impression on that regulator and this happened despite all that knowledge you posses. The world is just an evil place.\n \n\n \n Wrong, and shows how little you know about the industry. The MSHA guidelines say no worn insulation. Inspectors are REQUIRED to write tickets for violations...they have little or no discretion. SO anybody who owns a mine that has a worn extension cord on it is going to get the ticket if an MSHA inspector sees it. \n \n The MSHA inspector that handles our area LOVES me. I figured out a long time ago that social engineering will get you a lot further than anything else. When he shows up, I get a call. I show up smiling, take him to lunch at a 4 star restaurant, pretend I like the worthless sack of monkey excrement. I dont get anywhere NEAR the tickets that other mines get. My last inspection the total fines came to $1300 for both my mines. Most operators figure about $5000 per location (and they jokingly call it a tax) per inspection. That is where the social engineering pays off. Buddy up to the guy and he does not look quite so hard. \n \n \n\n \n There you go, reach a little higher and you just might reach one of those straw your grasping at. IF workers comp had half the weight you want to give them credit for we would all walk around in bubble suites. \n \n Are you just hoping I am as dumx as you are acting with this statement or are you not acting? You have heard of that terrible urban legend where a company figures what the worst case scenario could be and then the likelihood of it happening. Then they figure out the earning potential verse the liability potential and for some if that earning potential is enough above the liability and the likelihood is small enough they will risk it.\n\n \n That is not an urban legend. It is called a risk assessment, and companies do it every day. IT is why we are not all walking around in bubble suits. It is also why over 70% of companies exceed federal workplace safety training guidelines....because increased training has been shown to be the best way to reduce workplace injuries...even though it is expensive they still do it. \n \n \nI am not a big fan of government control, but people cry out for regulation when industry fails to regulate itself. Had BP not cut some corners the new stiffer rules for the oil industry that will come from this wouldn't happen.

Instead of Industry whose function is to be profitable. The formula is very simple\n \n Blow people up = stricter regulations\n Don't blow people up = relaxed regulations\n \n Not difficult or do you disagree?\n\n \n The problem is that you assume that more regulation will somehow result in fewer people being blown up and that is an illogical assumption. If MSHA had not had the power to regulate Massey, that explosion would not have happened. \n \n It is ignorant and naive to believe that regulators sitting in a government office somewhere are going to be more knowledgeable than people actually working in the field on a daily basis.\n \n Bad news...the folks who are the best are out there doing it. They are not sitting around inventing rules to annoy people who know more about the field than they do.\n \n The blowout presenter that failed was designed and manufactured to US government specifications. It was approved by the MMS as a failsafe device. Obviously it was not. \n \n Sadly, though, you are correct. We in the mining industry are still waiting to see the new regulations that come as a result of the Massey explosion. The thing is that, just like the BP disaster, it does not really matter what happened. Ignorant bafoons who know nothing at all about the industry will scream for ungle sam to \"do something\" and uncle sam will comply. We could find out tomorrow that space aliens caused the BP mess and there would still be a whole raft of ridiculous new regulations drafted by a bunch of bureaucrats who have never drilled a well in their lives.\n \n I can guarantee you that no deep water driller will ever again consider a BOP a failsafe...even though the government says it is. I will guarantee that they are all going over their operations, and what we know about what happened on the DH with a fine tooth comb to make sure they never end up in the situation that BP is in.",

   "ROTFLMAO\n \n Straw man. \n\n \n When you pick yourself up and brush yourself off and wipe the tears from your eyes how about you either\n \n A) prove your statement \n or\n B) try something other than misdirection or demeaning responses\n or\n C) admit it was an assumption based on your opinion\n \n \n \nYou made an asinine, poorly thought out, and ill informed statement about regulators setting forth \"best practices\".

Who said regulators have to lead the industry that they regulate? No one, why, because it isn't necessary. This is something you know, but haven't considered. Regulators do so reactively behind the industry. They don't go dig a mine and then tell the industry how they did it. They don't go and make equipment and say how to use it. Those people are called miners. Regulators come in after the fact and try and come up with the safest way to do what the industry wants to do. Sometimes they don't have good people to do that, either because they are not competent, they like the perks they get or they just don't care, but if you look at the safety records of the US compared to a country that lets industry do what it pleases the US manages to do a whole lot with a lot less dead or injured people. And no that isn't because the industry polices itself so well. \n \n So before you go spewing forth half cocked what you think someone is saying make sure your right and you won't come across like one of those regulators you are so fond of. \n \n \n No, they did not have to prove anything. MSHA issues an order for a change like that and puts a compliance date on it. If you have not made the change by the compliance date, they close you down. So you lose millions in production while you argue it out with them. \n \n And MSHA STILL does not have to prove anything at all ever. They do not even have to give a REASON for the change. \"Because we said so\" is all they need. \n \n Really are you sure about that? It took me all of about 5 minutes to come across the 233 page report on the Aracoma mine which shows Massey not only repeatedly failed to comply with violation notices and orders to correct the ventilation, but had gone and made at least 5 changes to the approved plan without telling anybody. \n \n http://www.msha.gov/readroom/FOIA/2007InternalReviews/Aracoma%20Internal%20Review%20Report.pdf\n \n I can give you more if you need it.\n \n Do you BS on purpose or do you just not have a clue what your talking about. Here is a nice article discussing the backlog in contested penalties cases, one of the primary reasons Massey had not been shut down despite numerous violations.\n \n Mine safety suffers as coal companies challenge violations, bog down courts, many critics claim\n \n So what does that mean? No MHSA does need to prove the violation and the mines not only have to not spend millions to dispute it they actually can do so and are not subject to enforcement until the case is resolved. Once more you are wrong, but I am the one making illogical asanine comments.\n \n \n \nWrong, and shows how little you know about the industry. The MSHA guidelines say no worn insulation. Inspectors are REQUIRED to write tickets for violations...they have little or no discretion. SO anybody who owns a mine that has a worn extension cord on it is going to get the ticket if an MSHA inspector sees it. \n\n \n \n So far you you have shown you know how to fabricate and mislead and not very well either.\n \n \nThe MSHA inspector that handles our area LOVES me. I figured out a long time ago that social engineering will get you a lot further than anything else. When he shows up, I get a call. I show up smiling, take him to lunch at a 4 star restaurant, pretend I like the worthless sack of monkey excrement. I dont get anywhere NEAR the tickets that other mines get.

That is where the social engineering pays off. Buddy up to the guy and he does not look quite so hard. \n \n \n yet he dinged you for an extension cord. Well isn't that nice instead of making sure you are in compliance with safety laws you find it more effective to take monkey dung out to lunch and your proud of this. People worse than you do the same thing just on a bigger scale and guess what happens just like playing lotto eventually you will pick some if not all of the correct numbers and boom your mine blows up. Enjoy your lunch.\n \n \nThat is not an urban legend. It is called a risk assessment, and companies do it every day. IT is why we are not all walking around in bubble suits. It is also why over 70% of companies exceed federal workplace safety training guidelines....because increased training has been shown to be the best way to reduce workplace injuries...even though it is expensive they still do it. \n\n \n I didn't sarcastically bring it up so you could latch on to it like it was your idea. I was pointing out how weak your statement that workers comp and industry make sure all is safe and cutting corners isn't practical.\n \n Would that not mean that @ 30% don't.\n \n Yes training is expensive and in the long run it pays for itself, we are talking about the ones who for whatever reason decide to circumvent those guidelines sometimes or often and have accidents as a result.\n \n \nThe problem is that you assume that more regulation will somehow result in fewer people being blown up and that is an illogical assumption. If MSHA had not had the power to regulate Massey, that explosion would not have happened. \n \n\n \n emoticon_wow :p :p\n \n Tell me did you type that with a straight face? How about if Massey had complied with the regulations there would have been no explosion? Could that be a possibility? Maybe, just a eeny weeny bit possible?\n \n So you feel less regulation would make things safer? Exactly how many deregulated industries became safer as a result of deregulation and how many unregulated became more unsafe as a result of regulation?\n \n \nIt is ignorant and naive to believe that regulators sitting in a government office somewhere are going to be more knowledgeable than people actually working in the field on a daily basis.\n\n \n Whew good thing I explained already they aren't supposed to be leading the industry, that is what miners are for. See miners submit how they want to do something, why and regulators say yes, no or do it like this. Not that it matters since apparently they go do what they want anyway.\n \n Bad news...the folks who are the best are out there doing it. They are not sitting around inventing rules to annoy people who know more about the field than they do.\n \n \nThe blowout presenter that failed was designed and manufactured to US government specifications. It was approved by the MMS as a failsafe device. Obviously it was not. \n \n \n And if that is determined to be the sole cause of the accident then was just a bad day to be on that rig. The problem is it is starting to look like there were several other instances of failing to follow procedure. That is what they are there for. It is assumed that something will go wrong, if your doing what your supposed to the way it is supposed to be done then the chances of catching it or minimizing it are much better. BP it appears deviated to far from what they were supposed to be doing and as a result missed warning signs and when a system failed couldn't fix it before the whole thing blew up. That can be unintentional oversight or it can be intentional negligence. Not because they hoped it would explode, but because they thought they could get away with it \n \n \nSadly, though, you are correct. We in the mining industry are still waiting to see the new regulations that come as a result of the Massey explosion. The thing is that, just like the BP disaster, it does not really matter what happened. Ignorant bafoons who know nothing at all about the industry will scream for ungle sam to \"do something\" and uncle sam will comply.

I will guarantee that they are all going over their operations, and what we know about what happened on the DH with a fine tooth comb to make sure they never end up in the situation that BP is in.\n\n \n I think that is a premature statement. Although right now it doesn't appear to be the case it may be determined that BP's errors were not the cause or that it was something else.\n \n Not all regulators are incompetent and not all companies are ethical it is unfortunate that competent regulators are grouped with the worst of their kind just as ethical companies suffer because of the worst of their kind.",

   "This is a long one so I'll just cut out what I don't feel is worth responding to..if you wish for me to respond to something let me know.\n \n \nLike I said before a mistake would be choosing to not put into place procedures that are over and above requirements which results in an accident. That mistake isn't really negligent just a bad call. Choosing to ignore warnings, disregard test results, bypass required procedures and rush through something dangerous that you have little experience with is a mistake that is also considered negligent. \nI take it you are not familar with negligence in a legal sense. To be honest, I'm no expert but last I checked it was a requirement on the CPA exam and accounting students learn this in a law class so needless to say I've been exposed to it. Don't bother reading Wikipedia, you aren't going to learn from that. In any event, BP is without a doubt negligent legally because that is where our case law is today. As such they are required to clean up all that mess. Anyway, the question really is was this BP acting recklessly to save money and time as the media suggests. To that I say there is currently no evidence that this was anything more than equipment failure combined with bad judgment calls on the ship. \n \n Lets get to the meat of this lengthy post...\n \n \n \nBP, for instance, cut short a procedure involving drilling fluid that is designed to detect gas in the well and remove it before it becomes a problem, according to documents belonging to BP and to the drilling rig's owner and operator, Transocean Ltd.\nDo you know if this is common practice? illegal? Against common procedures? Occurs often by BP run wells? Was a decision by one guy that was wrong and goes against written BP procedures? \n \n If you don't know then this shows nothing.\n \n \nBP also skipped a quality test of the cement around the pipe-another buffer against gas-despite what BP now says were signs of problems with the cement job and despite a warning from cement contractor Halliburton Co.\nWhich, as you state later, was not a warning that it was outside of spec...just outside of what Halliburton recommended for best practice. Also, the same questions above apply. \n \n \nThat day, workers discovered that gas was seeping into the well, according to drilling reports from the rig reviewed by the Journal. Workers lowered a measuring device to determine what was happening, but when they tried to pull it back up, it wouldn't budge. Engineers eventually told them to plug the last 2,000 feet of the then-13,000-foot hole with cement and continue the well by drilling off in a different direction.\n The episode took days to resolve, according to drilling reports, not counting time lost to backtracking and re-drilling. Each additional day cost BP $1 million in rig lease and contractor fees.\n Other problems arose. The rock was so brittle in places that drilling mud cracked it open and escaped. One person familiar with the matter estimates BP lost at least $15 million worth of the fluid.\nSo wait, problems occurred drilling a well a mile down where you can't see and don't know what is down there? Get out! I highly doubt these were unusual for drilling rigs but please tell us if it was. Still, until you are prepared to show me how this was unique to this well and how they didn't respond normally then I say you have nothing here.\n \n \nHalliburton, the cementing contractor, advised BP to install numerous devices to make sure the pipe was centered in the well before pumping cement, according to Halliburton documents,\n In an April 18 report to BP, Halliburton warned that if BP didn't use more centering devices, the well would likely have \"a SEVERE gas flow problem.\" Still, BP decided to install fewer of the devices than Halliburton recommended-six instead of 21.\n BP said it's still investigating how cementing was done. Halliburton said that it followed BP's instructions, and that while some \"were not consistent with industry best practices,\" they were \"within acceptable industry standards.\"\nAs an aside, I like how Halliburton is all of a sudden a trusted source (nothing to do with you). Anyway, the relevant part here is \"within acceptable industry standards\". That kind of kills your argument, no? \n \n \nBefore doing a cement job on a well, common industry practice is to circulate the drilling mud through the well, bringing the mud at the bottom all the way up to the drilling rig.\n Circulating all the mud in a well of 18,360 feet, as this one was, takes six to 12 hours, say people who've run the procedure. But mud circulation on this well was done for just 30 minutes on April 19, drilling logs say, not nearly long enough to bring mud to the surface.\ncan you show where this was common industry practice..or more importantly that what BP did was out of industry standards?\n \n \nThree offshore engineers the Journal asked to review the drilling reports all pointed to the failure to circulate the mud completely as a serious mistake.\nLet's assume this to be true. Do you think the corporate executives are advising the oil rig drillers to not circulate the mud? I doubt they even know what they means at that level. They are just saying \"get the well done\". From the little I understand about this it seems that could happen (using thinking at the time) would be the well doesn't work...something I doubt BP wants. Oddly enough these things were found by what was written in the BP logs. What makes you think they would write down things they did that were out of industry standards and regulations? If you don't know then how should the rest of us.\n \n \nBP also didn't run tests to check on the last of the cement after it was pumped into the well, despite the importance of cement to this well design and despite Halliburton's warning that the cement might not seal properly.\n BP told the Journal Tuesday that the tests weren't run because they were needed only if there were signs of trouble in the cement job, and the work seemed to go smoothly. But the same day, BP officials told congressional investigators there were signs before the disaster that the cement might have been contaminated and that some cementing equipment didn't work properly, according to a memo from two Congressmen.\nSo nothing outside of regulations or industry standards here.\n \n \n \nA little after 5 p.m., to check the well's integrity and whether gas was seeping in, rig workers did what is called a \"negative pressure test.\" It was supervised by a BP well-site leader, Robert Kaluza. His experience was largely in land drilling, and he told investigators he was on the rig to \"learn about deep water,\" according to Coast Guard notes of an interview with him. BP declined to comment on his experience.\n The test initially strayed from the procedure spelled out in BP's permit, approved by the MMS, according to the Coast Guard interview with Mr. Kaluza. When the first test results indicated something might be leaking, workers repeated the test, this time following the permitted procedure. The second time, pressure rose sharply, with witnesses saying that the well \"continued to flow and spurted,\"\nOk, so they identified a problem as they were supposed to do. And this is probably were someone decided to act stupidly and we all know what happened after that.\n \n So basically you have nothing here. You have no idea if what was done was outside industry practice, you have no idea if BP officials advised those drilling wells to cut major corners that could lead to a disaster (even more so with the thought that the BOP was failproof), you have no idea if this was anything more than equipment failure combined with a bad call by someone. You said it yourself that it would be a mistake if it turned out they didn't have procedures that were at or above industry standards.",

   "So wait, you want someone who owns two mines to prove that regulators (of mines) are incompetent? First off, he said \"semi-competent\"...secondly, how would you propose he prove that on an internet forum? Seems silly and as a former type of \"regulator\" aka auditor, I agree with that assessment. The only difference is when the auditor (who is normally straight out of college) gets competent after a few years they are captured by one of the companies they audited. From the way Daewoo describes his regulators it sounds similar.\n\n \n In addition to that he said among other things\n \n Even if the government DID pay better, you would still find nothing but losers and half wits doing it because anybody who is actually GOOD at that kind of thing is going to want to be out there DOING it, not sitting behind a government issued desk somewhere making life difficult for those who are. \n \n They don't last very long because 20 years at MSHA does not really provide any benefit since the next ignorant loser that they send out will likely have his own set of ridiculous rules. \n \n What I took exception to is his implication all regulators are bad and are the best they will ever be. If he is going to try a use a ridiculous statement as primary support for his argument then he better be prepared to back it up with something other than because. I asked 3 times prior to the above and each time he gave a sarcastic answer basically defending it instead of just saying in his experience or generalizing the statement.\n \n And no I mentioned getting experience and moving on his response is above.",

   " Steeeeeve: In any event, BP is without a doubt negligent legally because that is where our case law is today. As such they are required to clean up all that mess.\n\n \n Okay, I'll bite: HOW are they going to clean up their mess?\n The oil is just 60% of what's gushing from the hole in the ground - another 40% is methane.\n The dispersant did nothing in the way of 'cleaning up' but did only what it was supposed to do: disperse...which means that all of that oil is still there, only now in tency-wency little particles that make it more portable and easier to move out of the Gulf and more difficult to collect, and much, much more toxic.\n \n The 'booms' appear to be worthless as evidence by the pictures of them lying on the beach seeping oil...and the pictures of the workers on the beach with little shovels pushing around little oil balls is a joke. I got a good laugh of the picture of the team of cleaner-uppers in hazmat suits walking behind a 4-year-old, barefoot, in a bathing suit. emoticon_ic\n \n Kevin Costner's little separators may or, may not work.\n \n All the while it seems that no one has even mentioned the methane that is building up in the Gulf water. Apparently, it does not dissipate into the air but pretty much stays where it is and becomes food for a type of bacteria - which will consume all of the available oxygen in the water in the process of eating the mess...which will leave the Gulf one huge Dead Zone with absolutely zero life.\n \n So, Steeeeve and daewoo, tell me: Exactly HOW will BP fix this problem? emoticon_angry\n \n Oh, and if you can, tell me: What do you call H2O that has no oxygen? emoticon_frazzled\n \n I found an interesting paper on this subject, known as, 'Biogeochemistry and microbial ecology': http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~bah/BIO471/Reader/Valentine_2002.pdf\n \n and then this:\n \n Methane clathrate: Information from Answers.com\n 'In the less common second type found near the sediment surface some samples have a higher proportion of longer-chain hydrocarbons (<99% methane) contained in a structure II clathrate. Carbon from this type of clathrate is isotopically heavier (&#948;13C is -29 to -57 &#8240;) and is thought to have migrated upwards from deep sediments, where methane was formed by thermal decomposition of organic matter. Examples of this type of deposit have been found in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caspian Sea.[8]'\n \n And you had the gall, daewoo, to state that they don't know what's down there? \n \nSpace is relatively easy because you can see it. Deep water drilling is not easy because once they start drilling they really dont know what they are going to hit. It took them 40 years to understand the physiological impact of microgravity on the human body (and they are still studying it), and they had the advantage of firsthand observation. Figuring out how the pressure at 5000+ ft is going to impact a well that you are drilling is pretty much a shot in the dark until we have done it enough times to understand it better. \n \n\n You're suffering from a case of EZitis.\n If the guys at BP didn't know what was down there, the scientists sure did...maybe BP should have asked them for some advice before they started poking around.",

   "[QUOTE=Steeeeve;405100]This is a long one so I'll just cut out what I don't feel is worth responding to..if you wish for me to respond to something let me know.\n \n \nI take it you are not familar with negligence in a legal sense. To be honest, I'm no expert but last I checked it was a requirement on the CPA exam and accounting students learn this in a law class so needless to say I've been exposed to it. Don't bother reading Wikipedia, you aren't going to learn from that. In any event, BP is without a doubt negligent legally because that is where our case law is today. As such they are required to clean up all that mess. Anyway, the question really is was this BP acting recklessly to save money and time as the media suggests. To that I say there is currently no evidence that this was anything more than equipment failure combined with bad judgment calls on the ship. \n\n \n Sorry your losing me here. You say I am not familiar with what negligence is and then proceed to state BP was negligent which I didn't even go so far to say. If your trying to imply I am not aware of the difference between negligence and gross negligence, don't worry I am and no not from Wikipedia. There is also a slight difference in the application for the purposes of accounting and law. \n \n I will only go so far as to say most likely BP was negligent there are bits and pieces of information that could show gross negligence, but there is not enough information to make that determination so far.\n \n \nDo you know if this is common practice? illegal? Against common procedures? Occurs often by BP run wells? Was a decision by one guy that was wrong and goes against written BP procedures? \n \n If you don't know then this shows nothing.\n \n\n \n You might be right, but not for the reasons above. Is it common practice to cut short testing for a highly flammable gas that the rig has been warned about specifically and has been a problem for this well on several occasions? I hope not, but which person would make that call? The person whose priority is safety or whose priority is finish quickly with the least amount of additional cost.\n \n By itself it may be nothing and at the end of the day it may still be nothing, but then again maybe not and maybe coupled with other events becomes very important. Only time will tell.\n \n \nWhich, as you state later, was not a warning that it was outside of spec...just outside of what Halliburton recommended for best practice. Also, the same questions above apply. \n\n \n Seriously, you have someone build you a bridge over a 2000 foot drop and they tell you it's not a good idea to walk across the bridge it might collapse. Do you walk across or give it some time to make sure it doesn't?\n \n \n \nSo wait, problems occurred drilling a well a mile down where you can't see and don't know what is down there? Get out! I highly doubt these were unusual for drilling rigs but please tell us if it was. Still, until you are prepared to show me how this was unique to this well and how they didn't respond normally then I say you have nothing here.\n\n \n Let's see you want to take into account that drilling this deep in the ocean is fairly new and therefore a little leeway should be given when looking at procedures, but at the same time as long as procedures were followed as if this was being done in shallower waters BP that is close enough. Who cares if the well had been giving them problems or contractors were telling them not to do it their way.\n \n \n \nLet's assume this to be true. Do you think the corporate executives are advising the oil rig drillers to not circulate the mud? I doubt they even know what they means at that level. They are just saying \"get the well done\". From the little I understand about this it seems that could happen (using thinking at the time) would be the well doesn't work...something I doubt BP wants. \n \n \n Yes something I have already addressed. You want to suggest the only scenario is BP executives don't want the mine to fail so they try to do everything right or they wanted it to fail which makes no sense. How about they didn't want the mine to fail, but wanted it made ready as quickly and cheaply as possible. They cut corners, to save time and money. It happens every day and often it works out, but sometimes it doesn't and I think at the end of the day that is going to be what happened here. \n \n \nOddly enough these things were found by what was written in the BP logs. What makes you think they would write down things they did that were out of industry standards and regulations? If you don't know then how should the rest of us.\n \n\n \n How about the documents were never intended to be viewed by anybody but the intended recipients. It is somewhat necessary that internal documents concerning the status of the well should be accurate, don't you think? As an auditor and CPA you have to have experienced this.\n \n \nMuch of the information came from oth\n So nothing outside of regulations or industry standards here.\n \n \n Ok, so they identified a problem as they were supposed to do. And this is probably were someone decided to act stupidly and we all know what happened after that.\n \n So basically you have nothing here. You have no idea if what was done was outside industry practice, you have no idea if BP officials advised those drilling wells to cut major corners that could lead to a disaster (even more so with the thought that the BOP was failproof), you have no idea if this was anything more than equipment failure combined with a bad call by someone. You said it yourself that it would be a mistake if it turned out they didn't have procedures that were at or above industry standards.\n\n \n I am just going to cut to the chase, I am not going to rewrite previous posts. Basically it sounds like you want to establish that BP may have deviated from standard procedures in some instances but if they did it was still within acceptable guidelines or maybe if they did it was a decision poorly made by on site personnel most likely without the knowledge or consent of BP executives.\n \n Your intention is to show that BP is not guilty of gross negligence but responsible since it is their well.\n \n You acknowledge documents that show BP deviated from what they were supposed to do, but then try and diminish the content by stating they are from BP and because the letter says they were to do x and they did y doesn't mean y wasn't acceptable or that x wasn't optional. Which isn't very convincing. I already explained how incriminating documents would exist and the article exceprts that you chose selectively provides greater detail. I only pasted not even half of it because it was so long.\n \n Read the documents and then explanations they are not that hard to find. Prior posts have links to get you started. \n \n I repeat myself for the umpeenth time. I have not convicted BP. I have not said without question they are guilty and should fry. I have said the evidence gathered and made available so far points to negligence, whether the execs knew or not doesn't matter as we are not talking about criminal negligence. There does exist the chance that on site people were guilty of gross negligence. \n \n As you like to point out this well is different and the technology in drilling deep sea is somewhat new. The guy running the show had 0 experience doing this kind of drilling. It was the reason he was there so he could learn. \n \n So you have a drilling operation that is giving you a lot of problems. Both from equipment and procedurally. Your contractors are telling you you should be aware that you should not proceed until certain steps are taken to prevent accidents. You have nothing to compare this to because so few have been done that the information isn't enough to base SOP on. Does a reasonable person\n A) proceed with caution following what is considered the safer, but costlier and lengthier operating procedures, following the advice of contractors who are far more knowledgeable than you in their specific areas and making sure everything is working properly.\n B) Disregard contractor recommendations, only run partial tests, skip others and try to complete the project as quickly as you can and with the least amount of resources you can. \n \n My point in all this is they may or may not of done B, but they should have done A and they didn't. If you know the well has the potential for trouble you don't treat it as if it doesn't. Especially when your unfamiliar with the processes and even if you do everything right could still fail because their new",

As an auditor and CPA you have to have experienced this.\nThose logs are viewed by regulators all the time are they not? And as a former auditor you weren't allowed to just take whatever you wanted...the client gave it to you. \n \n\n I am just going to cut to the chase, I am not going to rewrite previous posts. Basically it sounds like you want to establish that BP may have deviated from standard procedures in some instances but if they did it was still within acceptable guidelines or maybe if they did it was a decision poorly made by on site personnel most likely without the knowledge or consent of BP executives.\nNo, I'm saying you can't say they didn't because you have no clue how oil rigs operate...in fact, not many people do.\n \n \nYour intention is to show that BP is not guilty of gross negligence but responsible since it is their well.\nNo, my intention is to show that you can't reach a conclusion based upon your lack of experience and lack of facts. \n \n \nI have said the evidence gathered and made available so far points to negligence\nNo it doesn't...even more so since that \"evidence\" might be selective for making a good news story. All you have shown is that selective evidence seen through mad colored glasses makes BP look bad. It's like listening to a political opponents TV ads and basing your decision on that.\n \n \nSo you have a drilling operation that is giving you a lot of problems. Both from equipment and procedurally. Your contractors are telling you you should be aware that you should not proceed until certain steps are taken to prevent accidents. You have nothing to compare this to because so few have been done that the information isn't enough to base SOP on. Does a reasonable person\n A) proceed with caution following what is considered the safer, but costlier and lengthier operating procedures, following the advice of contractors who are far more knowledgeable than you in their specific areas and making sure everything is working properly.\n B) Disregard contractor recommendations, only run partial tests, skip others and try to complete the project as quickly as you can and with the least amount of resources you can. \nHere is what I'm trying to convince you of. YOU ARE NOT A REASONABLE PERSON. You have zero experience in that field and absolutely no context for anything you mentioned. What a reasonable person might do in that situation means what a reasonable person who knows that job might do in that situation. \n \n Reference for the head of Shell (former): John Hofmeister, former President of Shell Oil, on BP and the Gulf Oil Disaster | Nightly Business Report | PBS",

   "By mid-April, 2010, the BP Deepwater rig crew had tapped into an oil and gas reservoir, 18,000 feet deep, in 5,000 feet of sea water. At this depth, normal pressure would be about 8,000 pounds per square inch (psi), but actual \"formation pressure\" can build up to twice normal, so the rig crew would have been prepared for 16,000 psi. That is a lot of pressure. A typical fire hose operates at about 100 to 300 psi.\n \n Having reached the oil and gas formation, the crew had to temporarily shut down the well while they replaced the drilling rig with a production rig. To do this, they need to seal off the bottom of the hole with a cement plug, called a \"shoe.\"\n \n The well is lined with \"casing\" pipe, seven inches in diameter at the bottom. This means the hole has an area of about 38 square inches, and at 8,000 psi, this amounts to about 300,000 pounds of pressure on the shoe plug. The world's strongest human can resist about 500 pounds for about two seconds.\n \n According to documents released by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee this week, BP officials had rejected a $7 million casing liner and a time consuming procedure to install more casing stabilizers. \"It will take 10 hours to install them. I do not like this,\" a BP executive insisted. \"Who cares, it's done, end of story, will probably be fine.\" Six days before the blowout, in an email, BP engineer Brian Morel called Deepwater a \"nightmare rig\" due to these cavalier safety risks.\n \n To shut down the well, the crew ran a series of \"casing integrity tests\" to confirm the shoe is sealed, and no pressure is leaking from the oil and gas pocket into the well. While conducting these tests, the BP crew encountered three red flags that told them they had a \"wet shoe,\" meaning that oil and gas were leaking into the well. The BP brain trust ignored these three warnings. \n\n The Tyee &ndash; What Happened on the BP Oil Rig?\n \n Another case of greedy and brainless corporate execs overruling common sense.\n \n Stupidity overruling science once again, as the setup has been during and after the Bush/Cheney administration.",
