   "They're screwing up the world - scriptually-stunted politicians who get on their high horses and embarrass themselves, or pass ungodly laws that can bring the wrath of God down upon a country.\n \n Case in point: Vice President and loony-left Kool-Aid drinker Joe Biden.\n \n Biden slams Jerusalem housing plan\n Associated Press 3/9/2010\n \n JERUSALEM - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden condemned a new Israeli plan to build hundreds of homes in disputed east Jerusalem on Tuesday, casting a cloud over a high-profile visit that had been aimed at repairing ties with the Jewish state and kickstarting Mideast peace talks.\n \n Biden slams Jerusalem housing plan - Mideast/N. Africa - msnbc.com\n \n Hey Joe - didn't you read Ezekiel Chapter 37??\n \n 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from all around and bring them back into their own land. I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel.'\n \n So Joe - you must think it's a splendid idea to antagonize God and give the land that belongs to Israel over to their enemies? Real nice, Joe. Have you never read Genesis 12:3 (God's promise to Abram)?\n \n \"And I (the Lord) will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.\"\n \n And since Abraham is the 'Father' of Israel, then when Joe Biden lambasts Israel, he is storing up the Lord's wrath on himself and America both.\n \n The purpose of this thread is to expose Biblically-challenged politicans and their like-minded constituents, and debate the related issues.",

If there's nothing wrong with abortion, then why do they need to be more rare? And if there is something wrong with abortion, why isn't the Butcher-Enabler-in-Chief pro life?

Is that not one of the most grevious practices in the whole universe, to butcher the innocent unborn? And you feel proud about that man? And yourselves?
