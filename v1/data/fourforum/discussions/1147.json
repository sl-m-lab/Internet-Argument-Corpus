   "S.659 is absolutely necessary. The suits against the gun industry must be stopped. It is threating not just gun sales, but potentially the sale of every product in the USA. The new legal theory used by anti-gunners is called \"market share liability\" where your products even if they are not used criminally, you are still liable as a group.\n \n \"A legal doctrine that has been applied to products that harm consumers but cannot be traced to a single manufacturer. It imposes liability on all manufacturers of the product in proportion to their shares of the market for the product. \" - http://insurance.cch.com/rupps/market-share-liability.htm\n \n Why is this imporant? Guess who is up next to get sued if this passes:\n \n Drug trade\n Paint trade\n Auto trade\n \n This goes beyond irrational. It is given by the anti-gunners that they do not know who made the gun that is responsible for the crime. Instead what they are doing is sueing everybody who makes a gun that can fire the caliber bullet responsible for the crime. They don't even know if the gun was flawed, defective, or unsafe. They are just sueing everyone that makes a gun that can shoot that caliber bullet.\n \n http://www.law.cornell.edu/ny/ctap/comments/i01_0040.htm\n \n Thanks be that they lost.",

Ideas such as \"we do not know who is a criminal so get them all\" kind of rationale is typical.\n \n Just like the babies, everyone is INNOCENT, until proven guilty. You can not even begin to restrict rights, assume guilt, or perform pro-active crime prevention without some major civil rights violations.",
