   "Ah! The unwavering criminality of corporations!\n \n \nA Los Angeles judge has blasted one of the nation's leading plaintiffs firms in asbestos litigation for attempting to obtain an upper hand in the case through what he called a \"type of judicially sanctioned extortion.\"\n \n The judge's statements came in a lawsuit filed by Waters & Kraus on behalf of a Los Angeles man who died of mesothelioma in December 2007. Six months before, the man had been deposed in Texas, where the case was first filed. The case has since been re-filed in California. During the past month, industrial product manufacturer Crane Co. sought to exclude the man's deposition from the case. In court papers, Crane argued that the information gleaned from the deposition, which under Texas law is limited to six hours, was insufficient to obtain summary judgment in California.\n \n On April 7, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Aurelio Munoz, while refusing to grant summary judgment, concluded that Waters & Kraus had re-filed the case in California intentionally as a means to force a settlement. Calling such tactics a \"waste of the court's time,\" Munoz noted that Waters & Kraus has played the same \"grisly game of asbestos litigation\" in at least nine cases.\n\n http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp\n \n They're only mere humans! Let them die if they threaten corporate profits!",
