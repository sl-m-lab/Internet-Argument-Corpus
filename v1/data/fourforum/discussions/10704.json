But, so long as he 'toes' the line, he's ignored and isolated.\n \n As for the hypocracy on forgiveness in these situations.\n WofF pastors are typically treated as mini-Popes who's words and teachings are divine law. You could walk into such a church and let loose a string of profanity and sacrilidge against 'God' and they'd say 'You poor thing.' But, voice any criticism against their pastor and you could easily be physically assaulted for 'touching his anointed' or 'laying your mouth on the man of god'.\n See, people who blindly follow these leaders accept that they are part of them. Therefore, when the leader falls, you fall also because you accepted them. Cognative disonance would go to suggest denial and/or seeking a quick restoration so that you too can be fixed and your commitment to the cause vindicated.\n When it comes to others though, the believer hasn't invested much of their emotional and, well, entire self into them so the criticism and abuse leveled is justified. You're only hurting the sinner, not yourself as well.\n You'll often find that such church leadership who've been accused and convicted of serious crimes will have a slew of supporters who never lose faith on their man of god. One example of this would be Terry Hornbuckle, a WofF leader in TX. accused of rape (including congregants) and convicted and of meth abuse.",

They paraded him around the country to show their \"success\".\n \n But then he talked to some gay people who were real. They had partners. They were living lives that didn't wind up HIV+ and addicted to drugs.\n He eventually left the \"ex-gay\" movement, and promptly the ex-gay crowd started claiming he was never a part of them.\n \n Just look at the whole \"Ted Haggard\" thing. How often did they refuse to acknowledge he was GAY.\n And then they \"cured\" him in just a few short days? Or was it just hours?",

Do your daughters live in fear of your wrath?\n\n \n TBH, probably no more than my children who express a variety of beliefs.\n \n My youngest (now 10) discovered 'atheism' at 8 when he realized that most of what some had told him was bogus and there was no evidence for it.\n I repeatedly discuss various faith issues with him and did so last night while grocery shopping.\n Met a 'Christian' woman whom I'd describe as a good one.\n \n He asked about her as he remembered I'd mentioned her before.\n I went on to inform him that no individual or portion of a group speaks for the whole all the time. And that there are Christians who live by their guiding principles and beliefs and seek, in humility, to be as best as they can. Like most humans, they often fail. They aren't hypocrits and seek to help those when asked rather than persecute.\n Then there's the lion share of people who just exist with a vague semblence or anything. People 'christian' in name only. Then there's the people who are the worst case scenarios for any group. Loud in the proclamations of self rightiousness and harmful to members of their own chosen group as well as those outside it. Those are the ones you should work to avoid or eliminate. No matter who they are. Christian, Muslim or Atheist or otherwise.\n \n And while you can get caught up in the moment of your own self rightious crusades, you should always deal with the individual before condemning them to some spurious link by association and always be hesitant to enforce any judgement you have. Seeking to come to mutual agreement and compromise before whipping out the assault rife and whacking them.\n \n Misplaced anger is not the course anyone should take and will lead to self destruction.",

It is both tiring and to be expected as you judge me while never holding yourself or your allies to the same standards you so willingly impose on others.\n\n Talk about twisting reality... emoticon_rolleyes \n No matter how much you try to ignore my REAL point, it is easily repeatable so I can refute your strawman at my leasure.\n \n The issue is your HYPOCRISY.\n YOUR Hypocrisy is demonstrated in that you demand others follow your religion, but you DO NOT follow your religion. Your religion tells you not to judge others, yet you EAGERLY look to judge others.\n \n I find your religion unreasonably restrictive. That's why I don't follow it.\n Ergo, it's not hypocrisy for me to not follow a religion I never claimed to.\n It IS hypocrisy for YOU to pretend that you follow your religion, and then you demonstrate over and over again that you DO NOT CARE to follow some words that came STRAIGHT from Jesus...\n \n \n \nThis is a debate forum and in giving my opinions I point out your hypocrisy.\n\n Do you even know what hypocrisy is?\n Hypocrisy is when a person professes to have standard X (as you profess to follow your religion), and then that person wantonly breaks standard X.\n You claim to follow a religion that tells you to \"judge not\", yet you EAGERLY do it anyways.\n THAT is hypocrisy.\n \n It is not \"hypocrisy\" for a person who DOES NOT have standard X to expose hypocrisy in somebody who does.\n I'm amazed that you think it is.\n \n \n \nIf you want to insist that I am breaking christian laws of judging you then fine. I know that God can tell the difference.\n\n And there is that arrogance again... emoticon_rolleyes \n Yes. YOUR God, which supposedly set this standard, CAN see through the thin veil of obfuscation whereby you ignore your own standard.\n \n And for the record, there IS NO DIFFERENCE.\n The only justification you have attempted so far is a feeble attempt to proclaim that you can judge others who are not fellow Christians.\n But as I pointed out, the \"judge not\" bible passage makes no distinction whatsoever on who you can judge.\n You have never supplied any real reason how you are not \"judging\".\n \n There is no difference Archie.\n Deep down, you KNOW that, but you refuse to allow yourself to recognize it because it is your favorite sin to sit in judgment of others. To act haughty and arrogant as you presume your religion makes you superior to others.\n \n \n \nBut your agenda is what it always has been, to demonize me and all believers who disagree with your atheistic and secular humanistic perspective on life, not to mention your radical gay agenda.\n\n 1) I'm not an atheist. You're obviously ranting about thing that you don't even know at this stage... emoticon_rolleyes \n 2) And can't we claim the same of you?\n You refuse to admit that you are judging, but your reply is INCREDIBLY reflective of your own agenda.\n You are trying to \"demonize all non-believers who disagree with your christian perspective on life, demanding others capitulate to your belief\".\n 3) Quite frankly, your accusation is wrong.\n It would be more accurate to say that I expose people WHO WANT TO PERSECUTE GAYS through governmental discrimination, and justify such discrimination.\n Quite frankly, I care not for the \"Christian\" belief that homosexuality is a sin as long as you don't shove it in my face and force me to yield to your beliefs.\n \n \n \nSo have at it. I trust in ultimate and absolute justice by a righteous and perfect King.\n\n You trust in your own self-righteousness.\n And your statement that you just made PROVES how incredibly NON-christian you are.\n \n Most christians can admit that if their god WERE to work on \"justice\", NOBODY would be saved.\n It's only by god's *grace* that people are saved.\n \n And here you are thinking that you would survive \"justice\".\n You \"trust\" in God's \"justice\"????\n How perfectly arrogant and non-christian.\n You are incapable of realizing that you are just as deserving of hell-fire as I am. The only difference, according to your dogma, is that you would be excused just cause you believe. Not by works, lest any Archie should boast.\n \n You expose yourself far more than I could ever hope to.",
