   "\"NASA's chief agreed Thursday to review his decision to cancel the Hubble Space Telescope's final servicing mission and let it deteriorate and go out of operation. The decision comes after the space agency was bombarded by pleas to save the craft.\"\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/01/29/hubble.plea.ap/index.html\n \n I'm on the side of the people who want the Hubble saved simply because we will not have a replacement for the Hubble until 2010 and without maintenance the Hubble will stop working years before that. Especially when we are suddenly interested in exploring space again as the Bush plan dictates we will probably need the service of Hubble for one reason or another therefore making it important to maintain it. I don't know that there is any good reason to let it simply deteriorate.",
