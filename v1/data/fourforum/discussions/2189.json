But I see your point on looking to God. The pope is only a messenger. I also do think that being Catholic is like being Republican or Democrat. There is a wide diversity of Catholics that is true and a total generalization should be avoided. But to be Catholic one must hold to certain core beliefs that are non-negotiable and a generalization of that can be made.\n \n Kerry said in the last debate, \"I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.\" Well, he is legislating his article of faith on to others. It is a liberal article of faith and it is not the Catholic article of faith.\n \n I tire of hearing John Kerry referred to as a Catholic  presidential candidate or the Catholic  presidential candidate. It would be more appropriate to call him the anti-Catholic  presidential candidate. \n \n Kerry was elected for his liberal platform. But he says that is not who he is personally. It seems that he is leading a double life. He puts his politics before his faith when it should be the other way around. Candidates should put their views out there prior to election and let the people decide (many have done this and been elected as pro-life, conservative Congressman). If you're liberal and pro-choice then put those views out there. If you are conservative and pro-life then put those views out there. But don't run on a platform that is in direct opposition to your faith and try to capitalize on your liberalism and your faith at the same time.\n \n As I said previously, the Methodist is the more Catholic presidential candidate.",

But we must also confront those who are in a state of continual sin with no effort at repentance--for their own sake. Even the earliest Christians realized this.\nWOW! No I'm not aware. But then I'm not Catholic. It certainly explains everything. I simply don't share that point of view. But then the Catholic church also bars women from priesthood and priests from marriage.\n \n The bottom line is that Cheney and Edwards are also Methodists. As you can see, the differences are vast. The three can't seem to agree on much -- that's inclusiveness.\n \n The following is an article published by the church. If you read it you may understand what I'm saying about GWB not being representative. He does not have unconditional backing of his policies as say FOR EXAMPLE the Catholic church and pro-life. Everyone knows that Kerry's view conflicts with that of the Vatican. The only thing that I asked, from the beginning, is that you realize that GWB's points of view are a source of controvery even inside the church - not only among the membership but among the leadership - not only on the war but many other issues as well. That's why I asked you to leave my church out of it. Everyone does not know that GWB's views are not necessarily endorsed. In fact most don't know that. For that reason, it's just inaccurate the leave the impression that they are. GWB is the most visible member of the church but that doesn't mean he speaks for it, either.\n \n -----------------------------------------------------------\n \n President Bush is proud of his United Methodist faith and speaks of it often. But he is not the only United Methodist candidate in this presidential election. \n \n Vice President Dick Cheney and U.S. Sen. John Edwards also are United Methodists, putting the denomination in a unique position at a time when Protestantism is declining and outcry is mounting over the political weight of the religious right.\n \n The United Methodist Church is the nation's second-largest Protestant denomination, with a diverse 8.3 million U.S. members that resemble the nation's electorate. Its conservative and progressive factions have chafed for years on issues such as homosexuality.\n \n The church's up-front role in this election comes as its congregations-like those of most Protestant denominations-grapple with declining membership that soon could cost Protestantism its status as the nation's top religious movement. Some United Methodists see an opportunity for the denomination in this election. \n \n \"It certainly says that we are a very big tent, that Edwards and Cheney and Bush all could be thought of as Methodists,\" says the Rev. David F. McAllister-Wilson, president of the Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington. \"We'd like to believe that since Methodists have people who have a wide variety of political persuasions, that means we can bring lots of voices to the same table and talk together about what God requires for the 21st century.\"\n \n The church's role in the election points to a shift in American politics, as a denomination that is seen as more progressive than the evangelical right assumes a key spot in Washington, says Mike McCurry, a Kerry campaign senior adviser and former press secretary in the Clinton administration. McCurry also served as a delegate last spring to General Conference, the United Methodist Church's top legislative assembly.\n \n \"For some time, the Democratic Party has sort of ceded the question of faith and politics to the evangelical right,\" he says, in an interview with United Methodist News Service. \"What's happening in this campaign is the progressive faith community has found its voice again.\"\n \n But the Rev. James V. Heidinger II, chairman of the Association for Church Renewal, a fellowship of evangelicals within the mainline Protestant denominations of North America, believes the church's role merely illustrates the diversity of the so-called religious right.\n \n \"I think the whole term 'the religious right' ... is an imprecise term,\" says Heidinger, who is also president of Good News, an unofficial and nonpartisan United Methodist evangelical group. \"You have to say a whole lot more than just sling around the phrase 'the religious right' to really know just who it is that you're speaking about, because there are many evangelicals in all the mainline churches that cover a broad continuum of social-political positions.\" \n \n Bush has talked easily of his faith ever since naming Jesus as his favorite political philosopher during the 2000 presidential race. He justified the war in Iraq in his address to the Republican National Convention this year by saying, \"Freedom is not America's gift to the world, it is the Almighty God's gift to every man and woman in this world.\" He supports a constitutional ban on gay marriage but said in his State of the Union address in January, \"The same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has dignity and value in God's sight.\" \n \n Bob Woodward of The Washington Post quotes Bush in his book Plan of Attack as saying that he prayed \"for the strength to do the Lord's will\" in Iraq.\n \n \"His faith is authentic,\" Heidinger tells UMNS. \"He not only talks about it, he tries to live it.\" \n \n Cheney is much more private with his faith. Nonetheless, the Bush campaign recognizes how important religious voters will be in this close election, and it has designated a team for religious outreach, spokeswoman Sharon Castillo says. \n \n \"We've started earlier and are devoting more resources,\" she says.\n \n But Bush declined to speak last spring at General Conference, the United Methodist legislative assembly held every four years. Before then, efforts to arrange a meeting with the president and United Methodist bishops broke down after some bishops spoke out against the president on the war in Iraq. \n \n \"War is, for us, not the first step you take to get to peace,\" argued Bishop Melvin Talbert, then-ecumenical officer for the United Methodist Council of Bishops, during a press conference at General Conference. \"It's the last resort. It seems the commitment to the common good has dropped off the radar screen for this administration.\" \n \n Bush also has drawn criticism for his faith-driven leadership. \"We did not elect him as the priest of the nation,\" complained Bishop McKinley Young of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, speaking at the same press conference. \n \n However, Clayton Childers of the denomination's Board of Church and Society, its social justice arm, believes Bush's faith should be part of his leadership. \n \n \"I'm proud he's not ashamed of his faith,\" he says. \"For me, faith also applies to how we live our lives, and the choices we make about hunger and poverty and homelessness, inadequate health care, how we try to be peacemakers in the world. ... I wish the government would step up to those challenges.\"\n \n Sen. John Kerry, a Catholic, famously attacked Bush's faith-driven leadership in his address to the summer's Democratic National Convention by saying, \"I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side.\" \n \n Nonetheless, the campaign also has appointed a team to religious outreach that is perhaps the first of its kind for Democrats, McCurry says. \"It's the largest effort that we Democrats have ever undertaken.\"\n \n Kerry running mate Edwards may not talk as often of his faith, but it played a role in his decision to enter politics in 1998, says the Rev. Roger Elliott, pastor of the 3,600-member Edenton Street United Methodist Church in Raleigh, N.C., where the senator and his wife attend services. Edwards grew up attending church, but the 1996 death of his son in a car accident reinvigorated his faith, and he served briefly on his congregation's administrative board before his campaign for the Senate, Elliott says. \n \n \"He met with me several times before he ran for the Senate, just to bounce some possibilities off of me like how does this relate to the Christian faith,\" he says. \n \n The candidates' religious beliefs will remain up for debate as long as faith-based issues such as the war and gay marriage are in the news. Some surveys show regular churchgoers tend to vote Republican, but Shaun Casey, assistant professor of Christian ethics at Wesley Theological Seminary, says many of those votes still are up for grabs. He says some estimates are that 8 percent of Catholics and 8 percent of white evangelicals remain undecided. \n \n \"Those are big chunks of the electorate,\" he says. \"The key is going to be undecided religious voters, particularly in these swing states they keep talking about. The ticket that is most successful in swinging those demographics may well win the election.\" \n \n *Green is a freelance journalist based in Nashville, Tenn.

   "One thing that scares me is having a president that has to answer to a sect or church. The pope would have a much louder voice with a catholic president. Maybe that's what America needs, more of a religious base rather than a government seeking money ok of a minority group. Should Kerry be one of the few catholic presidents or should he lose?

   "Kickin,\n I am enjoying our discussion. I find it very interesting. Thank you for sharing some of your ideas and the Methodist teachings.\n \n \nIt was an example and a complete coincidence with Kerry. It had nothing to do with that. My point is that communion is offered to everyone, including nonmembers.\n\n Why would you offer communion to those who are not in communion  with you? Why would you offer communion to those who hold vastly different theological and moral ideas? Paul speaks on the unity that should be present with those who partake of communion in 1 Corinthians 10:17: \"Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.\" John 10:16, 1 Corinthians 1:10, and Phillipians 2:2 also speak to the unity of faith that should be present in the Church. \n \n Hypothetically, would you also extend communion to atheist nonmembers?\n \n \nWOW! No I'm not aware. But then I'm not Catholic. It certainly explains everything. I simply don't share that point of view.\n \n You are not Catholic but you are Christian. That verse is in all of Christian scripture. What do you think of Paul's words in the verse I cited (1 Corinthians 11: 27-30) on the fact that there is a detrimental effect if one does not discern the Body and Blood of Jesus in communion? What do his words mean if communion is only symbolic? Does the symbolic view gel with other verses in scripture such as 1 Corinthians 10: 16-17  and Chapter 6 of the Gospel of John? \n \n Christianity is not about a personal view it is about a Christocentric view. We should hold the true view that is closest to the original Christian teaching.\n \n \nBut then the Catholic church also bars women from priesthood and priests from marriage.\n\n For good reason.\n \n \nThe bottom line is that Cheney and Edwards are also Methodists. As you can see, the differences are vast. The three can't seem to agree on much -- that's inclusiveness.\n\n Or divisiveness depending on how one looks at it.\n \n \nThe following is an article published by the church. If you read it you may understand what I'm saying about GWB not being representative. He does not have unconditional backing of his policies as say FOR EXAMPLE the Catholic church and pro-life. Everyone knows that Kerry's view conflicts with that of the Vatican. The only thing that I asked, from the beginning, is that you realize that GWB's points of view are a source of controvery even inside the church - not only among the membership but among the leadership - not only on the war but many other issues as well. That's why I asked you to leave my church out of it. Everyone does not know that GWB's views are not necessarily endorsed. In fact most don't know that. For that reason, it's just inaccurate the leave the impression that they are. GWB is the most visible member of the church but that doesn't mean he speaks for it, either.\n\n I did not make any statement on whether Bush's views were consistent with the Methodist Church or endorsed by it. I simply stated a fact--George Bush is Methodist. Because you say that the Methodist Church is all inclusive then it is a fact that G. Bush is a member. You said that G.W. Bush was not representative of the Methodist Church and I asked why. I realize now that you will not present me with those facts. You said to leave your church out of it when I hadn't even brought your church into it. \n \n I was doing the same as you when I said that Kerry was definitely not representative of Catholicism, especially since our Church does have written and spoken teachings in place denouncing his philosophy and actions. I would not really consider Kerry a Catholic but an anti-Catholic since he holds views in direct opposition to the Church. Our Church is inclusive, just as yours, but it teaches to correct those who hold views contrary to clear Christian teaching. It is a denial of Christ for one to do that and Christ said that he would deny those who deny him.\n \n Many people have trouble with Bush leading us into war. I am not sure this war had to be fought but I do believe war can be justified in the Christian religion. I do believe there are beneficial and adverse effects of this war in terms of its effect on terrorism, and the people of Iraq (and Afghanistan). I do believe a war against radical Islamic terrorism must be fought. Many of those Christians who are against Bush because of the war don't realize that Kerry's policies allow ~4,000 babies a day to be killed. Whereas the Iraq war death toll is around 1200 people(U.S.). I do not mean to present this as a numbers game because each person is important and their families hold them dearly. But many forget about the persons victimized by abortion. \n \n \nSen. John Kerry, a Catholic, famously attacked Bush's faith-driven leadership in his address to the summer's Democratic National Convention by saying, \"I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side.\" \n\n I'm not sure that Kerry's stance on abortion will ever allow God go be on his side.",

What I won't do is synopsize for you and take portions out of context. They've put a great deal of time and effort into choosing their words carefully. I won't undo that by making generalizations.\n \n It's religion. It is what it is. Blind faith. There just is no point in arguing the correctness of one over another. You say that there is good reason for priests to be single men. I'm ok with that. However, I - and my church - and 8.3 million members - and probably GWB - respectfully disagree with you. Chances are excellent that your president worships or, at very least, has worshiped with a clergywoman. (and she was probably married, too). It's hard to find a UMC that doesn't have a women on the alter in some capacity. Does that give you any insight into why he speaks so passionately regarding women's rights in Afghanistan.

I won't touch that one with a ten foot pole. I'm just not big on picking one sentence out of the bible and basing and entire society, government, or even religion on it. Statements about who's side God is on -- no -- just no. I will say, though, that Kerry hasn't said or done anything to offend my religious beliefs. I can't say that about GWB. So, maybe I am as guilty as the rest. I guess I am about to cast a vote based on religion. My vote is for everybody to pick their own. Meet you upstairs.",

What's a voter to do who thinks our foreign policy stinks but is all for \"family values\". What's a voter to do who thinks our position is the world really is more tenuous than on 9/10 but is all for \"family values\".\n \n Did you see the report yesterday out of the pentagon. It's official. \"Insurgents\" have doubled to 12,000 and they apparently have unlimited money. You had to watch Wolf Blitzer on CNN at 5:00 to see that. It was his lead story. I also watch NBC Evening News. They didn't report it at all.\n \n The decisions facing us, as voters, are too important. This absolutely is a water shed election.

Yet, in an election, GWB is willing to take it head on and suggest eliminating it because he's so sure that millions of people can't look past religion. I know you're going to say he's not eliminating it. So, how about if I say it's probably forced 401K contributions into a vehicle chosen by your employer. Pick the wrong vehicle, and we're a society of old people eating cat food. He hasn't been very specific about something that's that important. I'd listen. He just doesn't talk. He doesn't need to.\n \n There's another board here where I picked apart his \"health care\". Go to his website. Picking it apart isn't difficult. He's devoted an entire 6 paragraphs to totally revamping our health care system. I'd listen. He just doesn't talk. He doesn't need to.\n \n Prescription care. It's a joke. Pay your premium. Zero benefits to the $250 dollar deeductible. 75% benefit to $2500. Zero benefits again to $4000. 40% after that. This isn't even a benefit for the sickest and poorest. And the cost of the medicine is top dollar. I know. It's something for those who have nothing. Is it? When the cost of the medicine goes up? And what about all those who have prescription care already and their benefits are going down. Seriously down. Wait 'til my father in law finds out. He thinks he's out of this fray because he has coverage. You and I know he won't have it for long. You and I know we'll never have it. Nobody will. But his will be the first to go. He's a government pension. But he's free to vote totally based on \"family values\". And he will.\n \n I've been very proud of us for not mentioning the big A. But that's what it's all about. It's the elephant in the room. Everything else is taking second place. War, pestilence, famine. All minor.\n \n At this point, I'll tell you what I think of the big A. I'm pro-choice. But elections and politics is about looking at all the issues and weighing them. Nobody will ever be my perfect candidate. I wish that abortion was still a state issue. I lived in New York when it became legal there. That was pre Roe v. Wade. It was our choice in New York that brought about Roe v. Wade. If it has to be a national decision (and I wish it weren't) I'd be willing to give it up. It's not worth this. I don't think it would make any difference anyway. They'll just sell the morning after pill as a street drug and on the internet. It would become the new drug of choice is high schools. \n \n We can't vote to clean up drugs. Afghanistan doesn't care. South America doesn't care. Parts of Europe doesn't care. Hell, we can even vote to clean up the internet. Remember that every time you type WWW. WORLD wide web. Smut's always going to be available from other countries. Countries that don't care. There's no going back. We can't vote for 1950. It's not on the ballot. No matter how hard anybody tries they can't legislate morality. Remember how well prohibition worked out? And that was a constitutional amendment. Do we really want them to try again?\n \n I remember those good old days as the days of duck and cover. We practiced duck and cover under our desks, in the hall way, and in the school basement. We're too smart today to believe that silliness. Today, lucky us, we know we're all gonna meet our maker. One change, instead of a shadow on the wall, we'll die of cancer - like Chernobyl. Except we have a history of winning this before. The cold war. This time, we're not doing what was successful last time. We're gonna go for the gusto. People say what would have happened if Gore had been president? Answer: Obvious: The WTC would still be dust. I've got a better question. What would have happened if Kennedy wasn't president. A lesser man would have had it out with Russia. As an aside, my family was totally against Kennedy because of his religion. The big talk of the day, same as this thread. We don't want a president who answers to the pope. Protestants were aghast - truly, seriously aghast. It was a really really big deal. If the internet had existed then, EVERY thread would have been dovoted to that.\n \n No Social Security. Stinky prescription care and health care. In our old age, we'll be moving in with our daughter in law. How about your mother in law moves in with you? That's the olden days. That's what the religious right and small business owners yearn for? I remember my great grandmother living with my grandmother. Then my grandmother living with my uncle. Luckily, my grandmother did have her Social Security. So, when my uncle transferred out of town, she could get a 3 room apartment a block up from our house. Otherwise, I'd have been sharing my bedroom with her. And my father would have had \"a look\" that lasted for years.\n \n So, if abortion is the stumbling block, fine, outlaw it. Laws and policies go up and down every day based on political trades. That's what the back rooms of Congress are for. That's the process that has such a bad reputation. Although I don't know why. I'll give you abortion if you'll give my 62 year old sister, who's COBRA just ran out, a place to BUY insurance. Deal? I'd do anything to get the voting public's mind where it belongs. We're all gonna be in this thing together. Feel free to disagree with me on the real issues. I can live with that. That's what elections are for.\n \n Another irony. Gotta save Iraq from a religious government. But somebody on here will be yelling that our founding fathers intended us to have one. I so want to see somebody do a hour stand up routine on this stuff. The material is never ending.",

What's a voter to do who thinks our position is the world really is more tenuous than on 9/10 but is all for \"family values\".\n\n I would definitely vote for someone based on religion. If someone is a good Christian then he is likely to be a good civil servant. How one live's one's life should flow from his faith. Political life included. One's politics should be shaped by one's faith not vice-versa.\n \n Furthermore, I think that \"family values\" are the best and most logical foundation for any candidacy and government. Families in good working order means a country in good working order. If there is peace and harmony in the family life of a country then that peace will be extended into the other aspects of those family members lives--including those in government.

He doesn't need to.\n\n And the government has done really well in managing the money we've given them in Social Security? It's a broken system and will have to be fixed somehow. I'm not exactly sure how. But there is something in the idea of letting people keep their own money--money they've worked for to invest in their own retirement as they see fit--instead of a compulsory deduction of one's money to give to the gov. to be squandered. This is America, after all, land of the free. I don't mind taxes for the common good but there is a point when more and more taxes infringe on freedom.

But that's what it's all about. It's the elephant in the room. Everything else is taking second place. War, pestilence, famine. All minor.\n \n At this point, I'll tell you what I think of the big A. I'm pro-choice. But elections and politics is about looking at all the issues and weighing them. Nobody will ever be my perfect candidate. I wish that abortion was still a state issue. I lived in New York when it became legal there. That was pre Roe v. Wade. It was our choice in New York that brought about Roe v. Wade. If it has to be a national decision (and I wish it weren't) I'd be willing to give it up. It's not worth this. I don't think it would make any difference anyway. They'll just sell the morning after pill as a street drug and on the internet. It would become the new drug of choice is high schools. \n\n Actually, I have mentioned the \"big A.\" I mentioned it in my last post comparing it to the violence in Iraq. We should mention it because it is the major issue at hand--when millions are killed each year then I'm not sure what would rank above it. Everything should take second place. War, pestilence, famine are not minor but all of them depend upon the initial and basic right to life. If one does not have the right to life then all of the other issues and rights become meaningless. (Your morning after pill is more fatalist resignation by the way--it's not the hope of Christianity).\n \n I also wish abortion was still a state issue because it would be outlawed in many states. \n \n How do you reconcile your pro-choice position with your Christianity?\n \n \nWe can't vote to clean up drugs. Afghanistan doesn't care. South America doesn't care. Parts of Europe doesn't care. Hell, we can even vote to clean up the internet. Remember that every time you type WWW. WORLD wide web. Smut's always going to be available from other countries. Countries that don't care. There's no going back. We can't vote for 1950. It's not on the ballot. No matter how hard anybody tries they can't legislate morality. Remember how well prohibition worked out? And that was a constitutional amendment. Do we really want them to try again?\n\n I would like to know what one should legislate if he does not legislate morality. I do not want someone in office who is not legislating without moral principles. If one does not legislate morality then he ends up legislating immorality.\n Cleaning up smut begins with \"family values.\"\n \n \nNo Social Security. Stinky prescription care and health care. In our old age, we'll be moving in with our daughter in law. How about your mother in law moves in with you? That's the olden days. That's what the religious right and small business owners yearn for? I remember my great grandmother living with my grandmother. Then my grandmother living with my uncle. Luckily, my grandmother did have her Social Security. So, when my uncle transferred out of town, she could get a 3 room apartment a block up from our house. Otherwise, I'd have been sharing my bedroom with her. And my father would have had \"a look\" that lasted for years.\n\n What's wrong with family supporting family? That's what a family is for. We rely on the government to support us too much. We rely on the government to be our family--to raise our children. \n \n Stinky health care? We have one of the best, if not the best, healthcare in the world.\n \n \nSo, if abortion is the stumbling block, fine, outlaw it. Laws and policies go up and down every day based on political trades. That's what the back rooms of Congress are for. That's the process that has such a bad reputation. Although I don't know why. I'll give you abortion if you'll give my 62 year old sister, who's COBRA just ran out, a place to BUY insurance. Deal? I'd do anything to get the voting public's mind where it belongs. We're all gonna be in this thing together. Feel free to disagree with me on the real issues. I can live with that. That's what elections are for.\n\n I'm not willing to trade on abortion. If someone does not respect the life in the womb then why do you think they would care if your sister has health insurance or even gets healthcare--why do you think they would not exterminate her life if she becomes a burden to society?? Let's kill babies but ensure that all of us have healthcare?? Are we missing one of the puzzle pieces in that one? If we change the mentality and philosophy from the starting point of caring for life and the value of life then the other life issues will come around. \n \n \nAnother irony. Gotta save Iraq from a religious government. But somebody on here will be yelling that our founding fathers intended us to have one. I so want to see somebody do a hour stand up routine on this stuff. The material is never ending.\n\n We are not saving Iraq from a religious government. We saved them from a tyrannical dictator. Saddam was secular. Now we did save Afghanistan from a religious government--an extremist, tyrannical religious government that was promoting terrorism on other countries.",

   "I would definitely vote for someone based on religion. If someone is a good Christian then he is likely to be a good civil servant. How one live's one's life should flow from his faith. Political life included. One's politics should be shaped by one's faith not vice-versa.\n \n Furthermore, I think that \"family values\" are the best and most logical foundation for any candidacy and government. Families in good working order means a country in good working order. If there is peace and harmony in the family life of a country then that peace will be extended into the other aspects of those family members lives--including those in government. The future of civilization rests on the future of families.\nNow. If we could just define \"good Christian\" and \"family values\". Just how does government ensure peace and harmony in the family life?\n \n \nAnd the government has done really well in managing the money we've given them in Social Security?\nYes. It has. I don't have any basic objections to the system.\n \n \nIt's a broken system and will have to be fixed somehow.\nThere's a cash flow problem. That's all it is.\n \n \nThe best thing that can be done for healthcare is to reform frivolous lawsuits.\nCertainly there are frivolous lawsuits. But there are also well justified lawsuits. Eliminate them too? What's the solution to bad doctors? They exist. My father was operated on by a drunk. The surgery didn't have a good outcome. There was a left side/right side mix up. We didn't sue him. We didn't know. We didn't know he was a drunk. We didn't even know he'd screwed up in the operating room. Found out years later at the Ford Clinic. That drunk doctor finally got what he had coming -- but not until years later when he finally had his licence taken away by the state. How many more did he damage while the unsuspecting public waited for the wheels of justice. A couple of well placed lawsuits would have been just the ticket. That was back in the 60's - before lawsuits became popular. Besides, the statute of limitations had probably run out by the time we found out he'd removed the wrong half of the prostate gland. There were those in the medical community who had known how bad he was for years. To the public, his reputation was top notch. He was the department head. The whole 9 yards. He deserved to be sued.\n \n I had an unnecessary C-section. I'm sure of it. I'm sure of it because my OB/GYN told me, straight up. It never occured to me to sue him. I didn't want to. I knew why he made the decision he did. He opted on the side of caution and I agreed with him. He explained the risks. I appreciated knowing the truth. But I'm in that unnecessary c-section statistic. I never had to wonder why. A little honesty and bed side manner goes a long way. Not to mention good care. He was the best doctor I ever had.\n \n What's broken is our ability to track complaints and see patterns among the bad doctors in a timely manner. Law suits is the only method available to drum out the bad ones. Kerry talks about a panel of 3 to sort out one kind from the other kind. Only then is it followed by a judge or a jury. I'd hope that would be the solution. If not, tighten it up further. I'm in favor of cutting the greedy, dishonest patients off at the knees. Just not at the expense of allowing Dr. Hyde to practice. George is prepared to protect the worst of the worst with some sort of blanket immunity. I wouldn't give that to my bank teller. George would let that alcoholic doctor retire in comfort to an island beach with enough money to buy never ending vodka. Not me. Taking that guy's money would have been a public service. The only bad news here is that taking his money isn't an option. The only money that's available comes from his insurance company. That's where the Inc. at the end of their name comes in. I'd have liked to see him on the corner begging for quarters. Even with no license, he may still be on that beach with an umbrella drink. His personal assets would be protected. And his peers are stuck picking up the tab in their premiums. That's the problem.\n \n Oh. Did you think that alcohol and drug addiction is magically nonexistant among doctors? Nope. I've heard suggestions that it's higher -- much higher -- simply because of availability. They're human, too. Just like Rush Limbaugh. GWB didn't give me a suggesion for the real problem -- just another simplistic answer to a complex question. I'd listen. He didn't talk. He doesn't have to.\n \n \nActually, I have mentioned the \"big A.\" I mentioned it in my last post comparing it to the violence in Iraq. We should mention it because it is the major issue at hand--when millions are killed each year then I'm not sure what would rank above it. Everything should take second place.

An easy question. The answer is that I've heard the Good News. It was a story of faith and hope and trust and peace and forgiveness and eternal life. I don't have to figure out when life begins. I don't have to identify the sinner. I don't have to confront him - at least not the way you meant it. I don't have to try to look in another persons heart to determine if they are, whatever you said about consistantly nonrepentant. I don't have to try to see into the future and determine the results of their judgment day. I have to walk as closely as I can in His example. The weight was removed from my shoulders. I can turn the other cheek. I can feel confident that all will be as it should be. The goal is to show others how to voluntarily follow the example. He determines who followed and who didn't. Not me. He will sort it all out in his own good time on a one by one basis. He needn't answer to me. He needn't explain to me. He needn't make his reasons clear to me. It's all in the Lord's Prayer. The ONLY prayer that He taught. The answer to every question you've asked is there. That's also why I don't need governmental family values. I don't fear temptation. I don't fear it for myself, my family, or even for humanity. I don't feel threatened. I don't even feel terrorized.\n \n I am concerned about the false prophets. We were warned of them. Suddenly, they're everywhere -- from OBL to the guys on cable TV who are only seeking their own personal gain. That's the biggest test of my faith. Christianity may well be under assault. But -- all three religions appear to be -- at the same time. Now that's scarey. Each of the three religions have those who are currently teaching a militant version in it in one form or another. And the birth of these militant beliefs has happened in all three cultures in a very short window of time. Coincidence? I think the enemy is unrecognized and from within. How tricky. But we were warned of that, too.\n \n \nI'm not willing to trade on abortion. If someone does not respect the life in the womb then why do you think they would care if your sister has health insurance or even gets healthcare--why do you think they would not exterminate her life if she becomes a burden to society??\nI didn't ask about \"they\". I asked about you. The question is entirely theoretical. I didn't ask you for anything but your blessing. The answer was no. How do you reconcile that with your Christianity?\n \n \nWe are not saving Iraq from a religious government. We saved them from a tyrannical dictator. Saddam was secular. Now we did save Afghanistan from a religious government--an extremist, tyrannical religious government that was promoting terrorism on other countries.\nRight now, today, that's what it's become about. There are those in Iraq that want a religious government. We won't allow it because we can't figure out which set of \"family values\" to use.

I don't have any basic objections to the system.\n\n I think you are one of a handful that thinks so.\n \n \nThere's a cash flow problem. That's all it is.\n\n Is the only solution a baby boom?

He deserved to be sued.\n\n I said frivolous lawsuits. Frivolous is a qualifier. Frivolous lawsuits obviously don't include justified lawsuits. Why would I want to eliminate justified lawsuits? Frivolous lawsuits need to be investigated and limited. All that pain and suffering stuff for a fender bender or spilling hot coffee on yourself knowing from your years as a kid that coffee is hot, etc.--wacko!\n \n \nI had an unnecessary C-section. I'm sure of it. I'm sure of it because my OB/GYN told me, straight up. It never occured to me to sue him. I didn't want to. I knew why he made the decision he did.

He was the best doctor I ever had.\n\n If your doctor was \"opting on the side of caution\" then was it an unnecessary C-section? Anyway, I applaud your not suing. Many jump on the sue train at the slightest opportunity.\n \n \nWhat's broken is our ability to track complaints and see patterns among the bad doctors in a timely manner.

And if you have a doctor put into the tracking system because of a frivolous lawsuit then you are not really tracking a bad doctor are you? You are needlessly tracking a doctor who has been made to look bad. The plaintiffs have the system on their side because many defendants settle to avoid the court expense. Then they look bad and lose money.\n \n \nFinally. An easy question. The answer is that I've heard the Good News. It was a story of faith and hope and trust and peace and forgiveness and eternal life. I don't have to figure out when life begins. I don't have to identify the sinner.

I don't fear it for myself, my family, or even for humanity. I don't feel threatened. I don't even feel terrorized.\n\n I am glad that you have heard the Good News. Do you spread the Good News as Jesus commanded? Do you stand up for the Truth of the Good News?\n \n Unfortunately there are distortions of the Good News. We must speak up to defend truth because Jesus was The Way, The Truth, and The Life. \n \n I am not judging anyone's heart when I speak out on abortion or even when I support legislation against abortion. I am judging actions. Actions that are clearly wrong. Jesus was never afraid to speak up on what was right. That's why he called the Pharisees hippocrites and threw over the tables in the temple. He did not condemn the woman who was about to be stoned. He DID tell her to go and SIN NO MORE. He didn't change the definition of sin, or ignore it, or leave it up to her to decide. We have a duty to speak up as Christians following Jesus' example.(Colossians 3:16) The earliest Christians did speak out against abortion. We must also.\n \n You don't feel threatened, you don't feel terrorized?????? What do you mean? You are not being terrorized. But I think there are about 4000 babies a day that are threatened and terrorized even if you aren't. In the big picture abortion is a philosophy of death and utility instead of life and love. That is not a Christian philosophy or way of life.\n \n \nI am concerned about the false prophets. We were warned of them. Suddenly, they're everywhere -- from OBL to the guys on cable TV who are only seeking their own personal gain. That's the biggest test of my faith. Christianity may well be under assault. But -- all three religions appear to be -- at the same time. Now that's scarey. Each of the three religions have those who are currently teaching a militant version in it in one form or another. And the birth of these militant beliefs has happened in all three cultures in a very short window of time. Coincidence? I think the enemy is unrecognized and from within. How tricky. But we were warned of that, too.\n\n I don't see a militant version in Judaism or Christianity that matches the militancy of Islam. I, like you, are wary of the rich TV prophets though.\n \n \nI didn't ask about \"they\". I asked about you. The question is entirely theoretical. I didn't ask you for anything but your blessing. The answer was no. How do you reconcile that with your Christianity?\n\n You asked me? I said I don't trade on abortion. The answer was no? What do you mean? The answer to giving your sister COBRA in return for abortion? How do I reconcile what with my Christianity--the elimination of COBRA? I don't think COBRA and abortion are a good comparison.\n \n \nRight now, today, that's what it's become about. There are those in Iraq that want a religious government. We won't allow it because we can't figure out which set of \"family values\" to use. And we didn't start out to save them from a tyrannical dictator, either. That's the only excuse that's left.\n\n We can figure out that an extreme, hard-line, militant, theocratic Islamic government would not be conveying good family values can't we? \n \n Did we not save Iraq from a tyrannical dictator? That sounds like a fact not an excuse. If it is an excuse, then it sounds like a pretty good excuse considering all of the people Saddam killed, tortured, and oppressed. \n \n If all of those terrorists weren't in Iraq resisting the Coalition and the new government I wonder if they would be sitting at home planning ways to attack American people and property. What do you think? Possible?\n \n \nToday's news. 380 tons of explosives missing in Iraq. Has been for a while now. GWB was personally warned. He was keeping it's disappearance secret. Goes along with last month's story about the missing buildings -- entire buildings -- walls, roof, everything. Just gone. This is going swimmingly.\n\n We've gone from Kerry's anti-Catholicism to this?\n \n Is this incident Bush's fault or poor military execution? Don't forget Bush is also responsible for messing up millions of flu vaccines in a British company overseas also if you listen to the Democrats. I'm surprised that hasn't come up. Whoever started that one should be fired from the Democrat's team.\n \n I will say that I think more troops should have been in Iraq from the beginning. I think the Bush administration felt pressured (by the slant of Media coverage) to send as few in to harm's way as possible to maintain good PR at home. I think it is a bit of a paradox. By sending more troops into the danger zone less troops would have been in danger. Things would have been more secure and less harmful to the troops. The military has had to answer to the media too often in this. Of course, I'm sure the military is learning a lot--war is not able to be perfectly planned. I hope they learn from their mistakes.",

   "The government ensures peace and harmony in family life by legislating things that help the family.\nI'm still just confused on this. To one person, that means a national registry for child support. To another, it's a cop at every movie theatre to ensure that a 15 year old doesn't get in to an R rated film. To me, it's bleeping a 4 letter word when I was watching a movie on cable. And I don't appreciate that. It totally breaks the concentration. And none of those things have anything to do with peace and harmony in the family. Spouses don't stop arguing because he plays too much golf and suddenly agree on who's coming to Thanksgiving Dinner because of legislation. And the domestic violence calls go on.\n \n \nIs the only solution a baby boom? I'm not sure how that cash flow will be fixed otherwise.\nLike so many topics, if George wants my vote he's going to have to put an idea out there. So far his plan won't hurt the old people and the young ones will love it. I give. What is it.\n \n \nI said frivolous lawsuits. Frivolous is a qualifier. Frivolous lawsuits obviously don't include justified lawsuits. Why would I want to eliminate justified lawsuits? Frivolous lawsuits need to be investigated and limited. All that pain and suffering stuff for a fender bender or spilling hot coffee on yourself knowing from your years as a kid that coffee is hot, etc.--wacko!\nWhat's his plan for this? Any specifics at all here? If I'm incorrect with the blanket immunity, it's GWB's fault. Like most of his \"plans\" they totally lack meat. He's selling a dream.\n \n \nIf your doctor was \"opting on the side of caution\" then was it an unnecessary C-section? Anyway, I applaud your not suing. Many jump on the sue train at the slightest opportunity.\nI'll spare you the details, but had he done a scheduled test earlier, he'd have known I didn't need the C-section. He admitted that. Well, not quite in that way. But he was honest. That's all beside the point. I'm not even upset with him.\n \n My \"fender bender\". That I'm upset about. I was at a dead stop in traffic when I was rear ended by someone who admitted she was going the speed limit (45 mph) and never hit her brakes. My car was 2 weeks old and she said she was deciding if she liked the tail lights on the new model year. Whip lash is real. I suffered for about 10 years. It did eventually heal. My award - $2000 - and the health insurance company took that to recoop my medical expenses. So, I don't trust the system all that much. If litigation has to be curtailed, and just maybe it does, I'm not in favor of some sort of blanket legislation. We at least deserve to tell it to a human being.\n \n \nI am glad that you have heard the Good News. Do you spread the Good News as Jesus commanded? I am not judging anyone's heart when I speak out on abortion or even when I support legislation against abortion.\nWe just complete disagree here. Speaking out and supporting legislation are just entirely different veins. Speaking out and offering choices doesn't upset me. Point blank, if you feel that strongly, and want to support adoption (and I mean with your time and money) -- agencies and orphanages and volunteer to speak with and hand out literature to groups or individuals and buy TV and radio commercials and on and on and on -- I applaude you your convictions. You have every right to do that. So far, anything that I've seen on TV is nothing more than a heart wrenching don't do that. They're selling a dream too. There's a real person with a real problem. That's not being addressed. And there's a difference between spreading the Good News and commanding and demanding that it be followed. He didn't do that. Legislation is just not the way.\n \n A basic difference between us is identifying the victim.\n \n As I said before, I don't have to identify when life begins. He does that. If you're right, that life has begun, it has a soul, it's without sin and there is nothing to fear. If life has not begun, there is nothing to fear.\n \n The mother - it's going on her tally card. He'll decide. This may or may not be a overriding factor in tipping the balance. There's are so many other places to go wrong (and right). Personally, I'm pretty big on Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness. I have no patience for that. And it's gotten me in some trouble. Is honest the best policy? And I've been the victim of others who've done it. Anybody with a sibling learns to break this one. It's expected and not taken nearly seriously enough. Do you have 2 kids? I do. Now this kills peace and harmony. It goes on the tally card, too. What weight do we suppose that has? But I'm not trying out outlaw lying. Just when is a lie acceptable. Does motivation or circumstances alter the line? How about age. 7 years olds are forgiven. 17 year olds are not. Once again, the goal here is to get others to follow VOLUNTARILY. It's the only way in my example. Mom is asked to make that judgment repeatedly - and she's going to be wrong at some point. He isn't.\n \n \nYou don't feel threatened, you don't feel terrorized?????? What do you mean? You are not being terrorized.\nWell, we agree on that. So, the wolves in the commercial aren't influencing you either. As far as threatened, I was referring to religion.\n \n \nI don't see a militant version in Judaism or Christianity that matches the militancy of Islam. I, like you, are wary of the rich TV prophets though.\nYou must have missed the clip of Jerry Falwell screaming \"track them down and kill them IN THE NAME OF THE LORD\". Don't forget to add the intonation. Now there's a sentence that should never be uttered. We came through a period of bombing women's clinics. No regard for who was in there. The mailman was fine. That's terrorism, too.\n \n Judaism - you're just not looking for it.\n \n All three religions are rewriting the rules based on motivation alone. An eye for an eye, you know.\n \n \nYou asked me? I said I don't trade on abortion. The answer was no? What do you mean? The answer to giving your sister COBRA in return for abortion? How do I reconcile what with my Christianity--the elimination of COBRA? I don't think COBRA and abortion are a good comparison.\nRead my question again. I could copy/paste but I'm lazy. I'm not trying to compare. I'm trying to illustrate the political process. Everybody has their pet issue TODAY. It may be something different tomorrow. Today, my top issue (in my example) is a 62 year old woman who's COBRA already ran out and has no choice but to buy insurance at double the rate of much of the population. Why? She doesn't have a group plan. She's on her own - a single purchaser. Why is that okay? Where's the justice. For many, that double premium is the deal killer. These people are effectively being denied not only medical care but what I see as Christian caring. This is a problem that totally within our power to just reach out and solve. In my theoretical Congress, I'm asking you to help me solve that and in return I'll vote for your bill to outlaw abortion. And you know I don't want to give you that. Today, my issue is important enough to me to agree to that trade.\n \n And by the way, we've now made it to the heart of why a Congressman or Senator's record is so easily distorted.\n \n \nWe can figure out that an extreme, hard-line, militant, theocratic Islamic government would not be conveying good family values can't we? \nThe bottom line is that to them, a burka IS family values. We find the concept offensive when it forced on other Moslems who don't agree.\n \n \nDid we not save Iraq from a tyrannical dictator? That sounds like a fact not an excuse. If it is an excuse, then it sounds like a pretty good excuse considering all of the people Saddam killed, tortured, and oppressed. \nSure he was tyrannical. According to Johns Hopkins yesterday, we've killed 100,000 Iraqi innocents. No end in sight. New offensive in Fallujah coming soon. Some saviours we turned out to be. This wasn't our choice. Our choice was WMD's. Let's not forget it.\n \n \nIf all of those terrorists weren't in Iraq resisting the Coalition and the new government I wonder if they would be sitting at home planning ways to attack American people and property. What do you think? Possible?\nMaybe. But then again, maybe the relatives of the 100,000 are turning into insurgents. I probably would. And they never had any intention or desire to plot against us until... They were quite happy in their family room watching tv with their family. Today there is no family. One son is left, but he's in the hospital blind and missing a leg. Think they might be a little pieved?\n \n Before we came, all they had to do was pretend they liked Saddam. Small price to dance at their child's wedding. Did you see the poll out of Iraq on their presidential preference? 54% of the people refused to answer -- said they didn't care. Old habits die hard. The 54% is more telling than the ones that did answer. They don't trust us. They don't feel free.\n \n \nWe've gone from Kerry's anti-Catholicism to this?\nOk. Slight rant.\n \n \nIs this incident Bush's fault or poor military execution? Don't forget Bush is also responsible for messing up millions of flu vaccines in a British company overseas also if you listen to the Democrats. I'm surprised that hasn't come up. Whoever started that one should be fired from the Democrat's team.\nYou're doing it too. But military priorities should be set from the very top.\n \n \nI will say that I think more troops should have been in Iraq from the beginning. I think the Bush administration felt pressured (by the slant of Media coverage) to send as few in to harm's way as possible to maintain good PR at home. I think it is a bit of a paradox. By sending more troops into the danger zone less troops would have been in danger. Things would have been more secure and less harmful to the troops. The military has had to answer to the media too often in this. Of course, I'm sure the military is learning a lot--war is not able to be perfectly planned. I hope they learn from their mistakes.\nJust what percentage of the available military did they deploy? I'd be interested to know that answer. Obviously, 100% never was an option. I think that doing this thing \"right\" was beyond our capability from the get go. We needed a draft LAST year to make it work.",

   "What's his plan for this? Any specifics at all here? If I'm incorrect with the blanket immunity, it's GWB's fault. Like most of his \"plans\" they totally lack meat. He's selling a dream.\n\n \n The following is from this website. You can go there for the entire speech:\n \n http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030116-1.html \n \n Health care costs rise for a lot of reasons. Research is costly. Technologies cost money, and they're expensive. And some of the costs are necessary. But there are some costs that are unnecessary as far as I'm concerned. And the problem of those unnecessary costs don't start in the waiting room, or the operating room, they're in the courtroom. (Applause.) We're a litigious society; everybody is suing, it seems like. There are too many lawsuits in America, and there are too many lawsuits filed against doctors and hospitals without merit. (Applause.) \n \n And one thing the American people must understand is, even though the lawsuits are junk lawsuits and they have no basis, they're still expensive. They're expensive to fight. It costs money to fight off a junk lawsuit. And oftentimes, in order to avoid litigation, and oftentimes, to cut their costs, docs and, therefore, the companies that insure them just settle. See, so even though there's no merit, in order just to get rid of the thing, they just say, okay, let's just pay you. We'll get you out of the way. Instead of maybe suffering the consequences of a lousy jury and a lousy verdict, just pay them off. That is expensive to the system when it happens time and time and time again, like it's happening in America today. (Applause.) \n \n And what's happening is these rates for insurance are going out of sight. And doctors need insurance to practice. Today I met with a lot of great health-givers and healers, decent people, compassionate Americans who love their patients. These are docs -- I met with some patients, as well -- talking about the effects of this litigious society we have. And I heard stories about people not being able to pay their premiums. See, that means that health care is no longer accessible to too many of our citizens. When a doc can't pay the premiums and, therefore, can't practice, somebody is going without health care. It's strains the system. \n \n So what happens is, doctors say, well, gosh, I can't afford it here in Pennsylvania, I'm moving. I'll just take my heart and my skills to another community where I can afford it. But when that happens, somebody hurts. Somebody doesn't have the care. Some mom fixing to have a baby wonders out loud -- when she wonders out loud whether or not the doc is going to be there to deliver the baby, it's a -- we heard a story, by the way, about that -- it's a sad situation. There's a lot of uncertainty in our society. Lawsuits run up the costs for you, the patient. But they also create a sense of uncertainty in America for people who need the stability of good care. \n \n I had a chance to, when I talked to the docs, to talk about people who literally had tears in their eyes when they described their situation. Debra DeAngelo and her husband are leaving Scranton to go to Hershey. They wanted to stay here in Scranton, they were raised in Scranton. I met one of Debra's patients who really needs her to be in Scranton. They chose so because they can get their insurance there and they can't here. \n \n This insurance issue is creating a problem in our communities all across America. People are having to move. People who don't want to move have to move in order to stay in business to be able to do their job. \n \n Jack Brooks is a respected pathologist at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. He was there today. He went to Buffalo. He moved back to his state, but he was turned down by three insurers when he came back to Pennsylvania. The fourth insurer's quote was just too high, he couldn't afford it. Jack Brooks has never had a claim filed against him. He's one of your leading docs here in the state of Pennsylvania. He's one of your best assets. He's never been to the courthouse. And yet, because the system is broken, he couldn't afford to be in Pennsylvania. Fortunately, he got some insurance through a hospital; he couldn't do it on his own. You've got a problem here in this state. (Applause.) \n \n Greg Przybylski was here. He's a brain doctor. He has been moving from Pennsylvania to Illinois to New Jersey because the costs were too high. He can't stay in business. He can't do what he was trained to do and loves to do, which is to treat patients. He talked about when he was living in Chicago, he talked about a patient of his who had incredible complications. The guy couldn't find help in Pennsylvania, so the man drove all the way out to Chicago to be treated by Greg. That says a lot about Greg. It says a lot about his patients. And unfortunately it says something bad about the health care system, when liability costs are such that you can't get the kind of care that you need in Pennsylvania. \n \n You're not alone, though. It's not just your state that's got a problem. We heard from an OB/GYN in the state of Florida about how she couldn't get insured. And in Nevada, pregnant women sometimes have to leave the state to find a doctor. One woman called more than 50 local doctors and couldn't find one to serve her. So she's going to go to Utah to have her baby. \n \n I was down in Mississippi recently to talk about this issue. There's a doc and his wife who's also a doctor, who came from up north down to Mississippi in the Delta region of that state. And the Delta region has got a lot of people who hurt, a lot of people who are needy, a lot of people who need health care. And they went, not to build a giant portfolio of wealth; they went because they got great hearts. They heard a calling. They heard he would have attributed it to the Almighty. Having watched him, I would have attributed it to the Almighty, too. He has got a fantastic heart to him. I could see that he was inspired. He told me he's leaving the Delta because the trial lawyers ran him out. He couldn't practice medicine without getting sued. \n \n Something's wrong with the system. And a broken system like that, first and foremost, hurts the patients and the people of America. (Applause.) \n \n Twenty percent of hospitals nationwide have had to cut down on certain services -- on delivering babies, or neurosurgery, or cardiovascular surgery, or orthopedic surgery. That's a fact. So the problem is not only for Pennsylvania, it's a problem for our country. \n \n And there's another cost driver. And if you're worried about getting sued all the time, then there is the natural tendency to practice what they call defensive medicine. In other words, you order tests that someone may not need, to protect yourself in a court of law. And that's costly, and that's one of the main reasons why costs are going up. These lawsuits have got a lot of effects on our country, and we've just got to understand that. \n \n This is an incredibly important issue for states. I obviously hope the state of Pennsylvania is able to address it. That can happen in the statehouse. When I got to Washington, I said, that's an important issue for the states. And then it didn't take me long to realize, this is an important issue for the federal government, too, and I'll tell you why. (Applause.) The direct cost of malpractice insurance and the indirect cost from defensive medicine raise the federal government's health care cost by at least $28 billion a year. Malpractice, defensive practice of medicine affects Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' health, government employee costs. It affects the federal government. Therefore, it is a federal issue. (Applause.) \n \n It is a national problem that needs a national solution. (Applause.) And here it is -- first, let me just say this as clearly as I can -- we want our judicial system to work. People who have got a claim, a legitimate claim, must have a hearing in our courts. Somebody who has suffered at the hand of a lousy doc must be protected. And they deserve a court that is uncluttered by frivolous and junk lawsuits. If they prove damages, they should be able to recover the cost of their care and recovery and lost wages and economic losses for the rest of their life. That's fair. That is reasonable. And that is necessary for us to have confidence in the medical system and in the judicial system. (Applause.)  \n \n Yet, for the sake of affordable and accessible health care in America, we must have a limit on what they call non-economic damages. (Applause.) And I propose a cap of $250,000.  (Applause.) Otherwise, if not, excessive jury awards, like those in Pennsylvania, and those I was just -- one was just described to me -- today a guy held up a full-page ad in your newspaper paid for by the excessive jury award. (Laughter and applause.) Excessive jury awards will continue to drive up insurance costs, will put good doctors out of business or run them out of your community, and will hurt communities like Scranton, Pennsylvania. That's a fact. (Applause.) And that's why we need a cap on non-economic damages, and that's why we need a cap on punitive damages, as well. (Applause.) \n \n As I mentioned to you -- and it's important for our citizens to understand -- it is the fear of unlimited non-economic damages and punitive damages that cause docs and the insurance carriers to unnecessarily settle these cases. See, you can pretty well blackmail a doctor into settlement if you continue to throw lawsuit after lawsuit, and the system looks like a giant lottery.  (Applause.) Thank you. \n \n There needs to be other reforms, as well. A lot of times, these lawyers will sue everybody in sight in order to try to get something. In cases where more than one person is responsible for a patient's injuries, we need to assign blame fairly. We need joint and several liability reform in our medical liability system. (Applause.) \n \n We need to make sure that doctors can take care of their patients without fear that their advice will be used against them some day. It's hard to believe a system (applause). You hear a lot about the doctor-patient relationship -- it's an incredibly important relationship, in order to make sure we have a health care system that functions well. And yet imagine a system where docs can't share information amongst each other, much less talk to your patient, for fear that what they say will be used them -- in court one day. \n \n The system is not balanced, if that's the case. The system is not fair. The system doesn't need to have a relationship with the doc and the patient for fear of what is said will be used by a lawyer to sue them. That's why we need these reforms, for the good of the country. \n \n We got the bill passed out of the House, thanks to Jim and the members of the delegation here. And I want to thank you for your leadership and your vote. (Applause.) And the Senate didn't act on it, so we've got to start over. And I'm ready to start over. (Applause.) And the time is getting worse. That's what people have got to understand up there in Washington or over there in Washington down there in Washington, whatever. (Laughter.) Thought I was in Crawford for a minute. (Laughter and applause.) \n \n And this is I repeat, this is a national problem and we just cannot allow a bunch of needless partisanship to prevent a good, solid solution from going forward. (Applause.) And let me say one other thing. This problem won't be solved by just throwing money at the problem. This problem will be solved by getting at the source of the problem, which are the frivolous lawsuits. (Applause.) \n \n If you're looking for solutions in Pennsylvania, look at states which have done a good job of helping the patient out. California is one example. More than 25 years ago, they passed a law that caps damages from malpractice suits. And the law has worked. \n \n Let me tell you a startling statistic. Reports from Philadelphia say that juries there have awarded more in malpractice damages than the entire state of California did over the last three years. That says two things. California's law is what people in your statehouse ought to look at, and you've got a problem in Pennsylvania. (Applause.) There was a good news story in Mississippi. I went down there and -- it wasn't because of me, it was because the doctors and the citizens understand the cost of a trial system gone array and they got themselves a law. And they got a medical liability law. They put caps, real caps. Guess what happened? In some counties, the malpractice claims rose dramatically before the law came into effect. (Laughter.) Now, what does that tell you about the system? It tells you the system is less about justice and more about something that looks like the lottery, is what it looks like to me. (Applause.) And with the plaintiffs bar getting as much as 40 percent of any verdict, sometimes there's only one winner in the lottery. (Applause.) \n \n We need reform. You need reform in Pennsylvania, and we need reform all across America, and we need a law coming out of the United States Congress. (Applause.) It's a law that recognizes the centerpiece of good health care is to worry about your patient, the American people. It's a law that will recognize that an affordable and accessible health care system can best be had if we limit the caps -- put caps on non-economic and punitive damages.  That's what I understands. (Applause.) \n \n Congress needs to act on this law. Congress needs to listen to the people and not make excuses as to why they can't get something done. I believe we'll get something out of the House. I believe we'll get us a good law out of the House. And then the Senate must not fail its responsibilities to the American people again. (Applause.)\n \n (bold emphasis mine)\n \n \nMy \"fender bender\". That I'm upset about. I was at a dead stop in traffic when I was rear ended by someone who admitted she was going the speed limit (45 mph) and never hit her brakes. My car was 2 weeks old and she said she was deciding if she liked the tail lights on the new model year. Whip lash is real. I suffered for about 10 years. It did eventually heal. My award - $2000 - and the health insurance company took that to recoop my medical expenses. So, I don't trust the system all that much. If litigation has to be curtailed, and just maybe it does, I'm not in favor of some sort of blanket legislation. We at least deserve to tell it to a human being.\n\n I am making no judgment on your injury and I know that whiplash is real. I treat people who were in fender benders everyday. I would say that 50-70% of them are not injured that severely. They are fully functioning in work, home life, leisure life, and society in general--or often they are off of work but fully functioning in home and leisure life just due to the system. They come to therapy often because they think it will bolster their case looking for a settlement. I guess that their lawyers are often the ones to tell them to go to therapy.",

   "I'm still just confused on this. To one person, that means a national registry for child support. To another, it's a cop at every movie theatre to ensure that a 15 year old doesn't get in to an R rated film. To me, it's bleeping a 4 letter word when I was watching a movie on cable. And I don't appreciate that. It totally breaks the concentration. And none of those things have anything to do with peace and harmony in the family. Spouses don't stop arguing because he plays too much golf and suddenly agree on who's coming to Thanksgiving Dinner because of legislation. And the domestic violence calls go on.\n\n To me it means that legislation helping the family in a hostile capitalist environment would support family values. A national registry for child support would be good but it would be better to keep the family intact in the first place (the Bible says that those who do not provide for their families are worse than an unbeliever). Cops at R rated movies should not be needed--parents should fill that role. \n \n \nLike so many topics, if George wants my vote he's going to have to put an idea out there. So far his plan won't hurt the old people and the young ones will love it. I give. What is it.\n\n http://www.gop.com/GOPAgenda/AgendaPage.aspx?id=7 \n \n \nWe just complete disagree here. Speaking out and supporting legislation are just entirely different veins. Speaking out and offering choices doesn't upset me. Point blank, if you feel that strongly, and want to support adoption (and I mean with your time and money) -- agencies and orphanages and volunteer to speak with and hand out literature to groups or individuals and buy TV and radio commercials and on and on and on -- I applaude you your convictions. You have every right to do that. So far, anything that I've seen on TV is nothing more than a heart wrenching don't do that. They're selling a dream too. There's a real person with a real problem. That's not being addressed. And there's a difference between spreading the Good News and commanding and demanding that it be followed. He didn't do that. Legislation is just not the way.\n\n What do you think about commanding the good news of outlawing murder, incest, rape, etc? Morality is legislated--always has been and always will be.\n \n I don't know what you mean about TV commercials. \n \n Support adoption and orphanages with my time and money? Why not make the parents responsible for supporting their own children? But often it IS the pro-life group who supports women through pregnancies emotionally and financially, counsels them after abortions due to the adverse effects, and helps them place children in pro-life families for adoption. That doesn't sound like blind, cruel judgment to me. It sounds like confronting someone with the truth in order to help them (physically, emotionally, and spiritually), counseling them in love, and supporting them through the bad times. It sounds like Christianity.\n \n What is the real problem of a real person seeking abortion? The father abandoned her? She doesn't have a lot of money? She doesn't want a child at this time? She is a teenager? None of these real problems should be solved by the real killing of a real human life.\n \n \nA basic difference between us is identifying the victim.\n\n Is that a difference between us? Will you resort to the usual pro-choice tactic of denouncing the pro-life group for lack of concern for the mother?\n I suppose you say that the pro-life crowd doesn't recognize the mother as a victim but only the child? Refer back to my words on the other activities of pro-life groups. Also the mother brings \"victimhood\" on herself along with the help of a man often. Personal responsibility is needed. The mother's victimhood does not result in her destruction. Unfortunately the child's victimhood results in death.\n \n \nAs I said before, I don't have to identify when life begins. He does that. If you're right, that life has begun, it has a soul, it's without sin and there is nothing to fear. If life has not begun, there is nothing to fear.\n\n If life has begun, it has a soul, it is without sin so it doesn't matter if it is recklessly killed? Not part of Christian philosophy. Christianity believes all life is special and worthy of a right to life. We don't say, no big deal if babies are killed--they have a soul, are innocent and will go to heaven. \n \n Put aside the emotion, politics, science, and rhetoric of the issue. Get down to the fundamental foundation of your Christianity. Consider that your Christianity should form your politics and social view instead of vice versa. Consider that Christianity should be the foundation of your life and your actions in this world. It should be your compass in dealing with abortion.\n \n Here is the meat of the matter. Consider, pray about, think about the teaching of Father Frank Pavone on the matter. He illustrates a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ. \n \n Abortion supporters say, \"This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me.\"\n \n Whereas, Christ says, \"This is my body, which is given up for you.\" \n \n \"This is my body\"--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope... Jesus gives his body away so that others live. Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die. \n \n There is a profound difference. Christian abortion supporters perhaps miss the most basic and fundamental precept of Christianity.\n \n I do agree with you that the best way to deal with abortion is to speak out to change hearts and minds. I disagree that using legislation to outlaw abortion violates Christian principles.\n \n \nYou must have missed the clip of Jerry Falwell screaming \"track them down and kill them IN THE NAME OF THE LORD\". Don't forget to add the intonation. Now there's a sentence that should never be uttered. We came through a period of bombing women's clinics. No regard for who was in there. The mailman was fine. That's terrorism, too.\n\n How large and widespread was this terrorism in relation to the rest of Christianity? Does it compare to the proportion of terrorism in Islam and the death that terrorism has caused?\n \n \nAll three religions are rewriting the rules based on motivation alone. An eye for an eye, you know.\n\n As I said earlier, I am not sure the war in Iraq had to be fought. I have mixed opinions on it. I'm not sure if we will ever have access to all of the information the president and military had access to in order to know if there was full justification. The media is here and there so there is no solid dependable truth there.\n \n I do believe Christians can justly fight in a war though. There is just violence and there is unjust violence. I believe that Christians are always ready and willing to fight in a war...because Christians believe in a right and wrong. They believe in right and wrong/good and evil so strongly that they are willing to fight for it. (They are willing to take action. Just as Jesus was willing to take action). I would not like to see what would have happened if everyone stood by in World War II, Vietnam, or Korea. \n \n To rely on Chesterton, \"a good war is sometimes better than a bad peace.\" \n \n \nRead my question again. I could copy/paste but I'm lazy. I'm not trying to compare. I'm trying to illustrate the political process. Everybody has their pet issue TODAY. It may be something different tomorrow. Today, my top issue (in my example) is a 62 year old woman who's COBRA already ran out and has no choice but to buy insurance at double the rate of much of the population. Why? She doesn't have a group plan. She's on her own - a single purchaser. Why is that okay? Where's the justice. For many, that double premium is the deal killer. These people are effectively being denied not only medical care but what I see as Christian caring. This is a problem that totally within our power to just reach out and solve. In my theoretical Congress, I'm asking you to help me solve that and in return I'll vote for your bill to outlaw abortion. And you know I don't want to give you that. Today, my issue is important enough to me to agree to that trade.\n\n \"In effect, the acknowledgment of the personal dignity of every human being demands the respect, the defense and the promotion of the rights of the human person. It is a question of inherent, universal and inviolable rights. No one, no individual, no group, no authority, no state, can change -- let alone eliminate -- them because such rights find their source in God himself. \n \n The inviolability of the person which is a reflection of the absolute inviolability of God, finds its primary and fundamental expression in the inviolability of human life. Above all, the common outcry, which is justly made on behalf of human rights -- for example, the right to health, to home, to work, to family, to culture -- is false and illusory if the right to life, the most basic  and fundamental right  and the condition for all other personal rights, is not defended with maximum determination.\" from the Apostolic Exhortation Christifideles Laici  (On the Vocation and Mission of the Lay Faithful in the Church and in the World) issued by Pope John Paul II on December 30, 1988\n \n \n \n \nSure he was tyrannical. \n\n So you admit it is a fact, not an excuse :)\n \n \nAccording to Johns Hopkins yesterday, we've killed 100,000 Iraqi innocents. No end in sight. New offensive in Fallujah coming soon. Some saviours we turned out to be. This wasn't our choice. Our choice was WMD's. Let's not forget it.\n\n Yes, that is a sad statistic. But is there a difference between unintentionally killing innocents versus seeking out innocents to kidnap and decapitate or execute?\n \n \nBefore we came, all they had to do was pretend they liked Saddam. Small price to dance at their child's wedding. Did you see the poll out of Iraq on their presidential preference? 54% of the people refused to answer -- said they didn't care. Old habits die hard. The 54% is more telling than the ones that did answer. They don't trust us. They don't feel free.\n\n Is that all they had to do? Pretend they liked Saddam? Is that what the soccer team that was tortured by Saddam's son had to do? Is that what the Kurds who were gassed had to do? It was that easy?\n \n \nYou're doing it too. But military priorities should be set from the very top.\n\n Yeah, by the generals whose business is military affairs.\n \n \nJust what percentage of the available military did they deploy? I'd be interested to know that answer. Obviously, 100% never was an option. I think that doing this thing \"right\" was beyond our capability from the get go. We needed a draft LAST year to make it work.\n\n No, we didn't need a draft. We've got troops all over the world--Germany, Korea, etc.",

He implies that it's voluntary. Here's my questions because it still lacks meat:\n \n 1. Let's assume that a 25 year old opts to reduce Social Security by 2% and put it in his 401K instead. What happens to the employER matching?\n \n 2. What is the prediction for the age break where people would choose this option? Will a 50 year old? A 40 year old. Certainly not a 60 year old. When does the government see the \"benefit\" from this. The staggering cost is obvious. The government continues to pay while the incoming dollars go down. What year does the scale tip?\n \n 3. What happens to a person to opts out - at least partially. Currently benefits are determined by income/contributions for the last 10 years. (I think it's 10 years). Do we determine retirement benefits on the reduced recent rate and forget all the years they made full contributions? This is going to push that year where the government reduces cost by at least a decade. A 55 year old would be stupid to opt out. But their benefits will go on til they die.\n \n 4. Somewhere down the road, is there going to be the need to reinstitute a program for all the same reasons Social Security was originally instituted. Some poor schnook is going to invest in Enron.\n \n \nWhat do you think about commanding the good news of outlawing murder, incest, rape, etc?

At least not one that involves a home for unwed mothers.\n \n \nSupport adoption and orphanages with my time and money? Why not make the parents responsible for supporting their own children?  But often it IS the pro-life group who supports women through pregnancies emotionally and financially, counsels them after abortions due to the adverse effects, and helps them place children in pro-life families for adoption. That doesn't sound like blind, cruel judgment to me. It sounds like confronting someone with the truth in order to help them (physically, emotionally, and spiritually), counseling them in love, and supporting them through the bad times. It sounds like Christianity.\nBack to the money thing. Well, 10% (the tithe) from each member of pro-lifers ought to solve the problem quite handily.\n \n \nWhat is the real problem of a real person seeking abortion? The father abandoned her? She doesn't have a lot of money? She doesn't want a child at this time? She is a teenager? None of these real problems should be solved by the real killing of a real human life.\nI've already said that the \"real human life\" part is a gray area. One that I'm just not capable of knowing.\n \n \nIs that a difference between us? Will you resort to the usual pro-choice tactic of denouncing the pro-life group for lack of concern for the mother?.\nNo. I will say again, that looking into the future is beyond my capabilities. Why do 2 year olds die in car accidents? Why are they beaten or shaken to death? Why do they die of cancer. We give ourselves solice with the same tools I use concerning abortion. It's beyond my understanding. It's the jump from faith to trust. Back to the Lord's Prayer. Thy will be done. As a Methodist, I do have that extra line at the end, too. Call me innocent and naive. But that's what religion is about. Trust. Has it ever occured to you that maybe, just maybe, His will was done? Has it ever occured to you that the convenience store shooting wasn't a horrible tragedy? By the age of 23, I'd lost virtually my entire family. Some people get angry. I found trust. I said that everything is as He intended it to be.\n \n \nI suppose you say that the pro-life crowd doesn't recognize the mother as a victim but only the child? Refer back to my words on the other activities of pro-life groups. Also the mother brings \"victimhood\" on herself along with the help of a man often. Personal responsibility is needed. The mother's victimhood does not result in her destruction. Unfortunately the child's victimhood results in death.\nSo, the mother sinned? She got what she deserved? Her punishment is to raise a child? Judgments again. That's not in our job description.\n \n \nIf life has begun, it has a soul, it is without sin so it doesn't matter if it is recklessly killed? Not part of Christian philosophy. Christianity believes all life is special and worthy of a right to life. We don't say, no big deal if babies are killed--they have a soul, are innocent and will go to heaven. \nYeah. Basically. You don't think it went to heaven? Where do you think it went? I never made the determination that it's a baby. If it is, that's where it went. Just like the millions that were spontaneously, naturally aborted. Would your \"victim\" deserve less? Nor did I make the determination that it's not a baby. I don't know. I don't have to know. Not part of Christian philosophy? Fear of death is not part of Christian philosophy. The assumption that something terrible has happened is not part of Christian philosophy. The Irish have a party.\n \n \nPut aside the emotion, politics, science, and rhetoric of the issue. Get down to the fundamental foundation of your Christianity. Consider that your Christianity should form your politics and social view instead of vice versa. Consider that Christianity should be the foundation of your life and your actions in this world. It should be your compass in dealing with abortion.\nMy compass lies in that last line. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. He's more powerful than Satan. Period. When the good/evil question perplexes me, I still sleep nights. I don't ponder the tactics or who has the upper hand.\n \n \nHere is the meat of the matter. Consider, pray about, think about the teaching of Father Frank Pavone on the matter. He illustrates a remarkable contrast in thought on abortion between abortion supporters and Christ. \nI'm not an abortion supporter.\n \n \nAbortion supporters say, \"This is my body, I can do with it what I want. I can destroy others to preserve my life. I can destroy others so that I may live as I want. Do not interfere with me.\"\nI didn't say that.\n \n \n\"This is my body\"--same words but much different in intent, in action, in charity, in love, in faith, in hope... Jesus gives his body away so that others live. Abortion proponents cling to their own bodies so that others die. \nOr that, either.\n \n \nI do agree with you that the best way to deal with abortion is to speak out to change hearts and minds. I disagree that using legislation to outlaw abortion violates Christian principles.\nViolates isn't my word.\n \n \nHow large and widespread was this terrorism in relation to the rest of Christianity? Does it compare to the proportion of terrorism in Islam and the death that terrorism has caused?\nIt's not a matter of proportions. It exists and it goes to the basic philosophy of forcing rather than VOLUNTARILY following.\n \n \nAs I said earlier, I am not sure the war in Iraq had to be fought. I have mixed opinions on it. I'm not sure if we will ever have access to all of the information the president and military had access to in order to know if there was full justification. The media is here and there so there is no solid dependable truth there.\nThere's hope for you. :) This is exactly what I'm saying. We thought we could see into the future. The idea that we're saving others from tyrrany seems so clear and Christian. It was going to nearly bloodless and wonderful. Only the evil would pay. The outcome has yet to be determined. And I have no idea whose side God is on.\n \n \nI do believe Christians can justly fight in a war though. There is just violence and there is unjust violence. I believe that Christians are always ready and willing to fight in a war...because Christians believe in a right and wrong. They believe in right and wrong/good and evil so strongly that they are willing to fight for it. (They are willing to take action. Just as Jesus was willing to take action). I would not like to see what would have happened if everyone stood by in World War II, Vietnam, or Korea. \nVietnam is the only one that appears to be over. APPEARS. Korea? How's that one going to turn out. We thought we won. WWII we definitely won. But Israel is at the center of the ME problem. There are levels of winning. We declare 100% victory only to find out later it wasn't quite that high. Because we're on Earth for such a sort time, I question our yardstick. Let me head you off at the pass. I don't wish Hitler ruled the world. I don't think Hitler was open to voluntary change. We did our best and I have no regrets. I'm just saying that wars can come back to haunt decades or more later. 10, 20 even 50 years still isn't a safe time to pat ourselves on the back. Iraq is the most dangerous on that level. We set dominos in motion with no idea where they'll end. I can promise you that it won't be over when we think it's over.\n \n \nTo rely on Chesterton, \"a good war is sometimes better than a bad peace.\" \nWWII. As for Iraq, it was a \"good war\" when it was about WMD's. I don't believe Saddam had any real connection with terrorism. He was too self centered. Now we're just off to change the world. Those dominos are falling.\n \n \n\"In effect, the acknowledgment of the personal dignity of every human being demands the respect, the defense and the promotion of the rights of the human person. It is a question of inherent, universal and inviolable rights. No one, no individual, no group, no authority, no state, can change -- let alone eliminate -- them because such rights find their source in God himself. \nSo if she gets sick, pray.\n \n \nThe inviolability of the person which is a reflection of the absolute inviolability of God, finds its primary and fundamental expression in the inviolability of human life. Above all, the common outcry, which is justly made on behalf of human rights -- for example, the right to health, to home, to work, to family, to culture -- is false and illusory if the right to life, the most basic  and fundamental right  and the condition for all other personal rights, is not defended with maximum determination.\" from the Apostolic Exhortation Christifideles Laici  (On the Vocation and Mission of the Lay Faithful in the Church and in the World) issued by Pope John Paul II on December 30, 1988\nAnd that the best advice, straight from the pope. \"for example, the right to health, to home, to work, to family, to culture -- is false and illusory.\" Ignore human suffering because somebody, somewhere had an abortion. Catholic charities is still operating. Right? Why give away a coat? They're not cold. It's an illusion.\n \n \nSo you admit it is a fact, not an excuse :)\nIt's a fact that he was a tyrant. It's an excuse for the war. How about a quote from the Pope on the subject of Iraq? Do I remember the Pope and GWB having a face to face. If I remember correctly.......\n \n \nYes, that is a sad statistic. But is there a difference between unintentionally killing innocents versus seeking out innocents to kidnap and decapitate or execute?\nBack to American law. Two guys rob a convenience store. The one without the gun is just as guilty of murder. Sure, the one without the gun is breaking an underlying law by stealing, but the excuse for charging him with murder instead of robbery is that he put himself in that position. We put ourselves in this position.\n \n \nIs that all they had to do? Pretend they liked Saddam? Is that what the soccer team that was tortured by Saddam's son had to do? Is that what the Kurds who were gassed had to do? It was that easy?\nThe Kurds knew the chance they were taking when they fought for their own civil rights. Loosing is a possibility. It's a possibility for us too. Besides, another excuse. How long ago was that. We didn't care when it was happening.\n \n \nYeah, by the generals whose business is military affairs. No, we didn't need a draft. We've got troops all over the world--Germany, Korea, etc.\nSo, 100% was the answer?\n \n -------------------------------------------------------\n \n I'm having a hard time putting the pieces together.\n \n 1. the Bible says that those who do not provide for their families are worse than an unbeliever\n \n 2.

   "Does this come down to family peace and harmony is ensured through money? Families are in crisis because the government took too much money? Where does the \"values\" part come in?

Has it ever occured to you that the convenience store shooting wasn't a horrible tragedy? By the age of 23, I'd lost virtually my entire family. Some people get angry. I found trust. I said that everything is as He intended it to be.\n\n Yes, let God's will be done in all things. But two things that I can think of mean that God's will is not fatalism or destiny: free will and sin. We must act.\n \n \nSo, the mother sinned? She got what she deserved? Her punishment is to raise a child? Judgments again. That's not in our job description.\n\n Did I say that? I never think a child should be viewed as a punishment. That's the problem that brings on a lot of abortions. Mothers think of children as punishments instead of blessings. And they are blessings no matter the circumstances in which they came into the world--innocent, helpless, pure, blessings.\n \n \nYeah. Basically. You don't think it went to heaven? Where do you think it went? I never made the determination that it's a baby. If it is, that's where it went. Just like the millions that were spontaneously, naturally aborted.

   "If these laws are only about morality, I'd better rethink my stance on lying. I want it outlawed. Put my mother-in-law in jail. (haha)\n\n Well, lying is against the law--perjury. Would you compare a lie to the killing of a child? Do you believe in different degrees of wrong-doing or evil?\n \n More on this one:\n \nI've already said that the \"real human life\" part is a gray area. One that I'm just not capable of knowing.\n\n For Christians \"real human life\" has never been a gray area. It has been an area that has been enlightened by science but the newborn child has always been worthy of protection in the Christian view. You don't make a determination of what is a baby but Christians have always done so from the beginning. The pro-choice Christian is a 20th century phenomenon. See this link for the earliest of Christian prohibitions against abortion:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp \n \n Notice that women's children who were injured or killed before birth were treated as children.\n \n Other scripture indicates how the being in the womb was thought of:\n \n \"The babies jostled each other within her.\" Genesis 25:22\n \n \"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\" Jeremiah 1:5\n \n \"But the angel said to Mary 'you will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus...\" Luke 1:30\n \n More on this one:\n \nNo. I will say again, that looking into the future is beyond my capabilities.

And there is nothing that is bigger than the mercy of God. I am not condemning these women. Often they are led to the decision of abortion due to lack of information, support, or a societal acceptance. But we must voice what's right and take action to support it as Christians.\n \n \nI didn't say that.\n \n Or that, either.\n\n The words of Father Pavone that I posted were not a direct response to any of your posts. It was simply a challenge for a new way of thinking.\n \n \nViolates isn't my word.\n\n Please clarify.\n \n \nSo if she gets sick, pray.\n\n ?????\n \n \nVietnam is the only one that appears to be over.

What do you mean a fetus in a TV commercial?\nYou've never seen a pro-life TV commercial. I doubt they've ever swayed anyone's opinion except possibly causing the pro-choice people to dig their heels in. They're quite the in-your-face reminder of the controversy. Okay. Maybe they only show these in the blue states - but - Are you American?\n \n \nAre you advocating that the pro-life crowd bear the financial burden for all of the children that would not be aborted? Are you advocating that they bear the financial burden for the entire cause? Dumb argument. When will you begin to tell the environmentalists to buy up all of the rain forests and pay for cleaning up all of the environmental mishaps? When will you tell the COBRA and healthcare advocates that they should provide the money for all of their ideas to be implemented?\nFeel free to ask for everyone's help. You'll probably get it. Actually, you don't have to ask. Everything already is in place. In America, we tackle social issues as a group with our tax dollars. You're suggesting that we can do this for free if we would, as a group, turn our backs on hungry children. It will never happen, thank goodness. Children WILL continue to get food stamps. America has more heart than that. Why would it be a problem for the pro-lifers to get on board. As I said, if there's any of them out there that aren't tithing, they've got spare money. Just shut up and pitch it in. Those kids need to be fed. Pro-life has a financial cost. You can't have one without the other. If the pro-lifers ever win, my tax dollars will go to feed those babies. The difference between us, I won't complain. I'll feed those kids. Everyone will. We whine, but truth be told, we wouldn't actually have it any other way. We won't watch children starve in our streets.\n \n And we've paid for plenty of environmental mishaps.\n \n As for COBRA, do you know what it is? It doesn't have any advocates. Nobody wants to eliminate it. It already exists. It has nothing to do with the government - except for the enforcement - and that's seldom if ever necessary. It's not a government program. It's a law. The ENTIRE cost of health care is born by the insured - and an extra percent besides to pay for bookkeeping. The portion of Kerry's healthcare that I keep talking about, same thing -- COST FREE to everyone EXCEPT THE INSURED. If you don't know what COBRA is, well, once again, I should have asked before. Are you American?\n \n \nDon't you think we should err on the side of caution when dealing with human life?\nI don't think we should err at all.\n \n \nYes, let God's will be done in all things. But two things that I can think of mean that God's will is not fatalism or destiny: free will and sin. We must act.\nWe must act. There's the words. Some of us find those words scarey. And we have good reason to. It's possible that someone will ACT tomorrow as I assist people in line at the polls. And the odds are much higher than OBL getting me.\n \n \nWe can never set a timeframe, exact exit strategy or budget for war. We can never think that no one will be killed. That's impossible. It's war.\nIt's not about an exit strategy. Exiting doesn't mean it's over. A peace treaty doesn't mean it's over. The hatred remains IN THE LOSER. Then the looser comes decades later and starts it all over again. Here in Iraq, the remnants of WWII can't be missed. Israel. We could all go to our graves thinking we won. We'll never know. Our great-grandchildren will know.\n \n \nWho said anything about ignoring human suffering? Pro-lifers, as I said, address all aspects of human welfare and so does the Church. But pro-choicers neglect the most basic right. So when a pro-choicer advocates for other rights it is a bit backwards.\nRead a few more boards. Just sample the pro-lifers right here. One after the other, they have two passions. The other, money. Money, money, money, money, money. It appears that children starving in the streets isn't such a bad idea after all. Then for the last straw, they're pro-death penalty. With the Texas body count, GWB has put the wrong person/s to death. He's not terribly concerned about erring on the side of caution. That's where the eye for an eye comes in again. Make sense of the that, either.\n \n \nBack to American law. Two guys rob a convenience store. The one without the gun is just as guilty of murder.

Prison time - take that up with the juudge or jury. But the state is can and does charge them with the same crime. They're eligible for the same punishment.\n \n \nNot 100%.

Enough to provide better security and root out insurgents.\nSo my nephew wasted his time sitting on the Korean border for a year?\n \n \nI think I was speaking to the father that abandons a mother and child.

Thus the father and mother work two jobs leaving the government or daycare to raise their kids. Or the father/mother (one or the other) works obscene hours and spends no time with their kids. The family seeks material things instead of family things. I just meant that there were a lot of pressures on a family in a capitalist environment. Tax issues are relevant in this.\n \n Do you think that religion is not relevant in family values?\n \n \nYou've never seen a pro-life TV commercial. I doubt they've ever swayed anyone's opinion except possibly causing the pro-choice people to dig their heels in. They're quite the in-your-face reminder of the controversy. Okay. Maybe they only show these in the blue states - but - Are you American?\n\n I've only seen them on the Catholic channel. They're very nice there. What type of in-your-face reminder do you mean?\n \n \nFeel free to ask for everyone's help. You'll probably get it. Actually, you don't have to ask. Everything already is in place. In America, we tackle social issues as a group with our tax dollars. You're suggesting that we can do this for free if we would, as a group, turn our backs on hungry children. It will never happen, thank goodness. Children WILL continue to get food stamps. America has more heart than that. Why would it be a problem for the pro-lifers to get on board. As I said, if there's any of them out there that aren't tithing, they've got spare money. Just shut up and pitch it in. Those kids need to be fed. Pro-life has a financial cost. You can't have one without the other. If the pro-lifers ever win, my tax dollars will go to feed those babies. The difference between us, I won't complain. I'll feed those kids. Everyone will. We whine, but truth be told, we wouldn't actually have it any other way. We won't watch children starve in our streets.\n\n What in the heck are you talking about? Where did I suggest that we turn our backs on hungry children? I don't know any pro-lifers who are not on board for feeding the hungry. Perhaps you could clarify.\n \n \nAnd we've paid for plenty of environmental mishaps.\n\n Who is we? Do you, as an environmentalist, support your entire cause with your own money?\n \n \nAs for COBRA, do you know what it is? It doesn't have any advocates. Nobody wants to eliminate it. It already exists. It has nothing to do with the government - except for the enforcement - and that's seldom if ever necessary. It's not a government program. It's a law. The ENTIRE cost of health care is born by the insured - and an extra percent besides to pay for bookkeeping. The portion of Kerry's healthcare that I keep talking about, same thing -- COST FREE to everyone EXCEPT THE INSURED. If you don't know what COBRA is, well, once again, I should have asked before. Are you American?\n\n I am American. I do know what COBRA is. My mom was on it for awhile. COBRA will be free to everyone under Kerry's plan?\n \n \nI don't think we should err at all.\n\n You don't think it a possibility that abortion might be an error killing innocent human life?\n \n \nWe must act. There's the words. Some of us find those words scarey. And we have good reason to. It's possible that someone will ACT tomorrow as I assist people in line at the polls. And the odds are much higher than OBL getting me.\n\n Do you get out of bed every morning? Do you breathe? Do you eat? Then you ACT. We all act. Choose whether you will act for good or bad. But don't be apathetic. It is not an issue to surrender to the philosophy of live and let live.\n \n \nRead a few more boards. Just sample the pro-lifers right here. One after the other, they have two passions. The other, money. Money, money, money, money, money. It appears that children starving in the streets isn't such a bad idea after all. Then for the last straw, they're pro-death penalty. With the Texas body count, GWB has put the wrong person/s to death. He's not terribly concerned about erring on the side of caution. That's where the eye for an eye comes in again. Make sense of the that, either.\n\n Money, money, money? I have no idea what you are talking about. I'm missing your message completely. Do you see what the Pope's words meant? The pro-life crowd addresses all of the human rights issues. The pro-choice crowd often attempts to address feeding the hungry, clothing the poor, providing medical care. But they start on a faulty premise. They say that it is okay to kill a child but we must clothe and feed children. They say they fight for human rights but they don't want to guarantee the most basic human right. If a baby does not have life then he does not need clothing or food or medical care. But the pro-lifers say all are important and they base it on the premise of an inviolable right to life. Just as our founders declared, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: \n \n That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\" \n \n I'm not pro-death penalty.\n \n \nI suppose it could change from state to state, but that's how it works here. Prison time - take that up with the juudge or jury. But the state is can and does charge them with the same crime. They're eligible for the same punishment.\n\n I'd like to know where that occurs.\n \n \nSo my nephew wasted his time sitting on the Korean border for a year?\n\n Hunh? I think what we did and still do in Korea is a good thing.\n \n \nYou probably were. You weren't specific. But in the real world, it's the child and pays the price. That's why we feed them.\n\n Yes, but it's no reason to kill them.\n \n To clarify, I think that both the Republican platform and Democrat platform are extremes. I would like a middle ground balancing life/social/economic issues. But the life issue IS the most important issue of all. All else flows from that. \n \n You mentioned that 100,000 Iraqis have been killed in the war. Do you know that it is estimated that 4,000 a day die from abortion? Since 1973 it is estimated that 45, 366, 554 babies have been killed. I do not say this to belittle the importance of those Iraqis who have died. I do it to show that the terrorism and death happening in Iraq pales in comparison to the terrorism that we commit on our own people each day in this country.\n \n My words against abortion are strong--I always debate that way. Abortion must be opposed but on a personal level I would never condemn or berate a woman going through (or one who has been through) an abortion. I believe that one must act as Jesus did with mercy, love, and understanding. But we must also speak the truth as he did--because that is part of love. As I said previously, Jesus did not shy away from exposing sin and calling sinners to repentance. Jesus did not let someone decide if something was a sin. He taught boldly. The Church continues to do so in his stead. The Church has always done so in the case of abortion. What did you think about what the early Church and Scripture had to say about abortion?",

   "Well, the rush is over. Congratulations.\n \n I'm going to try swearing off the news. I put a great deal of time into fully understanding the issues, the events, and the commercials. I did everything I could and it's over. Going to try to tune it out for the next 4 years.\n \n Having read your current posting, I doubt either of us will get what we're hoping for.\n \n \nI knew that we didn't have time to finish that issue prior to Tuesday. I don't have a position on the best solution. I don't think anyone has come up with a good solution yet. I just know that something needs to be done.\nBack to it later.\n \n \nI mentioned a capitalist environment. This environment makes one think that money is the final goal of success. Thus the father and mother work two jobs leaving the government or daycare to raise their kids. Or the father/mother (one or the other) works obscene hours and spends no time with their kids. The family seeks material things instead of family things. I just meant that there were a lot of pressures on a family in a capitalist environment. Tax issues are relevant in this.\nIf that's the society you wish we could go back to, I understand. I suspect you're younger than I am. That's the society I grew up in. Frankly, the idea that lower taxes can somehow accomplish this goal, is superficial. The much larger problem is that families are under financial pressure. However, much of the financial pressure is of their own making. Having grown up in that dream world, I feel well qualified to speak on the subject. Expectations and standard of living have changed dramatically. We didn't keep up with the Jones's. There weren't that many Jones's to keep up with. There wwere no malls. There was no need of malls. There was a department store about 3 miles away. That was a Saturday trip, because there was only 1 car and dad had it at work during the week. That Saturday trip happened a couple times a year - but only when there was a sale. I had 3 school outfits in my closet (bought in September). We wore boots in the rain. There was absolutely no getting the school shoes wet. That would ruin them and there wasn't another pair in the closet or coming until this pair was worn out. Then the worn out ones were the play shoes. Heaven help me if I walked out the door in the wrong shoes. I remember when color TV's came on the market. We didn't get one. Had no plans to get one. Not many people did. When the black and white broke, my dad took the tube testers to the drug store and replaced the correct one. Whatever broke, it got fixed - not replaced. The laundry got hung - we had no dryer. The milk man delivered. It cost 2 extra cents per quart, but that was a good deal because of the 1 car issue. Dinner went on the table at 5:20. Everything was from scratch. Of course, no microwave. Kids didn't play sports starting at the age of 5 and have lessons in everything under the rainbow. They played in their yard with the neighbors. There was no wall-to-wall carpeting. There was no redecorating. Threadbare furniture was kept. A vacation took place in a car to a destination that had a kitchen and a grocery store. No airplanes and package deals. And NOBODY owned stock unless it was an employee plan. Certainly not a portfolio.\n \n In general, I'm describing a time when expectations were lower - MUCH lower. Life was generally simpler. I present this fact to you. That time can and still does exist, right now, if you want it. Well, maybe not the milk man. But the rest is available. I ask you, do you want it? Does your family want it? What I think I'm hearing is, \"If we had a tax cut, we could have our cake and eat it too.\" Well, you couldn't. There isn't enough tax cut possible to allow moms to stay home, have a 2nd car, do outtings at the mall at will, take Annie to tap lessons, and buy her designer jeans and $100 sneakers so the other kids don't laugh at her. Today kids play in $100 sneakers. This genie is out of the bottle. Everybody simply wants more than they wanted then. That ship sailed for it's final voyage in the 80's with the \"me\" generation and the concept of conspicuous consumption.\n \n There's a second situation. That's the ones who, even if they cut their life style back to what it was then, still can't pay the bills. That problem, I lay at the feet of greedy business - not taxes. Back then, companies expected to pay the man of the house enough money to survive on. And we survived on it. Not so, these days. These days, businesses will pay a grown man with children, not enough money for the groceries and communicate that he should be grateful to have a job at all. Just how did they turn the tables 180? That's why I can't get on board with the Republican theory. I actually do remember the olden days. It was a time when the bread winner didn't loose his job and company retirement was for real. There was no slick accounting and dipping in to the till. People and businesses both are just spoiled and greedy. Consider for a moment that I'm not the one looking for the government to save me. You are. Finances are tough when everything falls in to the NEED category and the employer just isn't coming through -- so the paycheck would be bigger if not for all those deductions. And the businesses say that expenses would be less if we didn't pay all those people too much. There is a financial fear that grips everyone today.\n \n I agree totally that putting children in day care is just wrong. I never did it. But it's nearly impossible to get the next generation to agree. Is it because they can't or won't make sacrafices. Or is it because they're terrified of the future. Mom's gotta work. Gotta make those 401K contributions. Gotta have a SECOND source of health insurance. 'Cause you never know what's around the corner. How much money is enough? How much does it take to feel secure?\n \n I suggest to you that family values is the tip of the iceberg. A return to the old way of thinking won't solve the real problem. A couple more dollars won't solve it either. The problem you described comes from an unsustainable standard of living. But we want it so badly that we're at each other's throats for every possible dollar.\n \n \nDo you think that religion is not relevant in family values?\nSadly, I truly think that the uptick in religion is a result of fear. Financial fear and world order (foreign policy) fear. Hope is fading. Enter prayer.\n \n \nI've only seen them on the Catholic channel. They're very nice there. What type of in-your-face reminder do you mean?\nMaybe I see the same commercials you do. Just not on the Catholic channel. I live in one of those evil blue areas. And I don't think they're nice at all.\n \n \nWhat in the heck are you talking about? Where did I suggest that we turn our backs on hungry children? I don't know any pro-lifers who are not on board for feeding the hungry. Perhaps you could clarify.\nThat was in response to my suggestion that pro-lifers will have to pay the bill, too. You asked if I was suggesting that pro-lifers should foot the entire bill. No. Of course not. We'll all pay it. Just realize that the elimination of abortion will be VERY expensive. Be prepared. I don't really trust your numbers (4,000 a day and 45,366,554 total). But whatever the number is, there just aren't that many adoptive parents available. It's going to mean orphanages and foster homes and lots and lots of kids in \"the system\". Drug babies may never leave it - for a life time. My nephew's girlfriend is a home care RN. She spends her days doing in-home child care for a drug deformed baby. The mother left, the father is raising the baby in a double wide. The government has already invested $500,000 in this one child. That's the facts. If the father wasn't doing what he can, the child would be in an institution for it's life. That's just 1 child. Consider that your 45,366,554 is about the same number of people who voted for George - just to point out how many we're talking about here.\n \n I see the current Republican party (by that I mean the population segment that voted for Bush) as politically strange bed-fellows. It's a weird combination of the religious right and the greedy business men. Both halves are using each other. They each need a group larger than themselves to forward their agenda. What I find the most ironic is that, long term, it's a marriage that can't last. If you win pro-life, it will be outrageously expensive - and it will be the second half of your own party, the greedy business half, that will turn on you. The climate of financial giving and sharing that will be necessary doesn't exist in the Republican Party. It never did. That's the day the Democrats will have to jump in.\n \n \nI am American. I do know what COBRA is. My mom was on it for awhile. COBRA will be free to everyone under Kerry's plan?\nNo. He never suggested that. The problem is that there's no place to go when the 18 months runs out. That's the day that your current insurance will keep you - but they double the price. May I point out that there is no price break on COBRA. The ex-employee pays the full shot. But they pay at group rates. At the end of the 18 months, they pay at non-group rates.\n \n \nYou don't think it a possibility that abortion might be an error killing innocent human life?\nI wish I had an answer. I just don't. The financial burden of eliminating abortion is real. It will be staggering. The result - up go the taxes - and then where will your capitalist environment that's killing family values be? It's a vicious circle.\n \n I know. If you can turn back the clock far enough with morals, girls won't get pregnant in the first place. Do you really think that can happen? As I said early on, the 1950's isn't on the ballot. Could we at least do sex education and birth control. Abstinence isn't working.\n \n I once told a story to somebody on here. Probably wasn't you. Background info: my husband had a vasectomy years ago. The boys didn't know it. I told my sons 100 good reasons why they shouldn't have sex - pregnancy, emotional entanglements, disease, etc., etc, etc. I told them repeatedly. However, being a pragmatist, we always kept condoms in our nightstand. Boys have been known to steal them. Yes. They disappeared. It wasn't long ago that they found out about the vasectomy. Their immediate answer, \"That's not true. There's condoms in your nightstand.\" We laughed. They turned red and quickly exited the room. We laughed harder.\n \n ---------------------------------\n \n On a totally different subject.\n \n I've never been afraid of terrorism - not even on 9/12 - until today. Worst of all, here I sit in Cuyahoga County. One nuclear power plant to the East of me. One to the West of me. And lots of media attention for Osama Bin Laden to watch. Personally, I think he'll target the red states. I could be at the top of his list.\n \n ___________________________________\n \n The Daily Show 11/3/2004\n \n Why would NY City, which has the most significant gay population in the country and has had the most significant terror attack, vote overwhelmingly for Kerry?\n \n We in NY are too close to the terrorism and the gay people. Only the red states, with the advantage of a safe distance, can take in the whole picture and clearly see what we should do about those issues. And so on behalf of everyone in the blue states, I'd like to thank the red states for saving us from ourselves.",

   "My dad lived a similar life--in a rural area--so not exactly the same.\nThe 1950's lifestyle that I described was the norm. My family income was probably a bit above average. My dad was a salaried employee in a GM plant. That was middle class America. My mother had a saying, \"you can't spend a dollar twice\". Credit was a mortgage - not a closet full of clothes. It was basically a cash only society. She had a charge-a-plate (metal embossed with name and number). She used it. But she never ran a balance. Stores didn't take checks. Charging was a convenience over carrying cash but only in a store where you had an account. Master card didn't exist. You knew for sure that you were a valued member of society if you could get a Sears card. That one was the hardest to get. Groceries were cash only. I'm describing an entire lifestyle and attitude of an entire society.\n \n \nNo, I'm not. I thought Democrats were the ones that touted the no-frills welfare system. I just don't think that taxes should be hostile to families. \nYou'd like to find a way back to a time when financial security was ensured through a good work ethic. The government can't give that to you. Fewer deduction in your paycheck can't give that to you. Only a reliable employer can give that to everyone. It's the current pro-business attitude that stands in your way. I understand your thinking. I was on that train 30 years ago. I was a Republican. That was when I was naive enough to think that business profits equated to larger paychecks. It always seemed to work for GM and my dad. For 10 years it worked for my husband. Life was grand. His boss watched our life and always gave the best raises when we needed it. I got pregnant, along came enough money provide. The pattern was unmistakeable. Those days are gone and they're not coming back.\n \n \nMost people want daycare or the government in the form of headstart to raise their children as early as possible. I want more influence and time with my children. Plus the kids don't get the time and care they need there at that age. It's not the providers fault. It's just impossible to do. I know sometimes there's no way around daycare or headstart but I think the people's mindset has changed so drastically that they think of those places as being the natural and most appropriate places for their child to grow--more so than the home. \nChildren can't ever get what they need in daycare. The care giver doesn't love them. The care giver can only fit children in to a behavioral mold based on the most recent \"How to Raise the Perfect Child\" book -- every one of which I think should be burned.\n \n It's the nature-nurture question. Paid care givers work totally on the nurture theory. I, for one, rely on the nature theory. I can interpret one son's behaviors because he has my brain wave patterns. The other son has my husband's. Personality is inherited. Parents alone are equipped to deal with that. Parents are terrified of making a mistake. They're taking advice from all angles. They don't need advice. They know the answers. All they have to do is listen to themselves.\n \n There you have it. Child rearing according to ME. Are you impressed?!?! That by the way is another reason why I'm not a huge supporter of mass adoption. I see adoption as a path of last resort. Parenting is actually a long term manipulation of the child. What can I, as the parent, do or say to elicit the desired response? Parents can instinctively know the answer. Adoptive parents are guessing and using trial and error. Not that it can't work out well. But adoptive parents have a much tougher row to hoe.\n \n \nYou may be right. We have too many wants. I am guilty of falling into that trap often as well.\nYou're in good company. I'm in that group with you.\n \n \nYes, as I said. The Democratic Party and GOP are both extremes. Some good, some bad. Do a web search of distributism and read a few of the pages if you have time. Let me know what you think of it. One of my favorite authors, Chesterton, believed in it.\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the contrary. Abstinence did work when the society emphasized and valued it in that 1950s culture. Post sexual revolution--it has really only begun to be implemented and touted as a means to achieve good results (a revival of sorts)--perhaps because it has been feared by secularists as religiosity?? or perhaps people are beginning to see the failings of \"safe sex\"?? Isn't it weird that the surge of premarital sex, divorce, teenage pregnancy, abortion, and STDs coincides with the introduction of the pill as a contraceptive? It was thought to be a panacea. Sexual revolution then safe sex--isn't it the safe sex that isn't working??\nWell, the sexual revolution was only a small part of a much larger societal revolution. If the pill was responsible, why didn't penecillin trigger the sexual revolution? Penecillin was the cure for syphillis. Other birth control existed by then (condoms). Why? Because the sexual revolution wasn't a stand alone event. It was part of a much larger picture.\n \n The larger question is what made an entire generation simultaneously take leave of their senses? What made them reject that perfect world and wish to run off to San Francisco to become flower children. Evidently, mine is still the only generation that knows the answer to that question.

It drove that revolution - just as it's driving this one.\n \n The pill didn't take away our punishment (pregnancy). Society/conditions took away our reward. For the generation before mine, their future as assured. They didn't know the details. But they knew that if they walked the straight and narrow, and then showed up at the nearest manufacturing facility, they'd get a job that probably lasted a lifetime and everything would be pretty much as they expected. The rules were clear. The reward was clear.\n \n Suddenly, it wasn't that simple. Mine was the first generation to live with nagging uncertainty.\n \n 1. Flashback from my childhood. I was about 6-7.

Uncle Sam cordially invited about 40% of all 18 year old males to a year in the jungle.\n \n Our messages were very mixed. One one hand, be proud, we're American. We're the lucky ones to be born here. On the other hand, we were smart. We were ahead of our own time. We could see the beginnings of life, as we knew it, crumbling. We could see that we were getting our butts kicked on multiple fronts. Much of our own American pride was tied up in our manufacturing and defensive capability. We could invent our way out of anything. Nobody could beat us. We walked on the moon. So why do we have to practice duck and cover? So why are there so many VWs and Toyotas and Datsuns on the road. Why is it \"common knowledge\" that Japanese cars are better than American cars? Why do we have to stop Communism in Southeast Asia? And the granddaddy - why isn't it going better in Southeast Asia? We were the kids that lost faith in the future - both the immediate future and the distant future - because we watched America fail in everything it tried. We were the the first group of kids for whom the rewards of proper behavior weren't guaranteed.\n \n And nobody understood why so many kids went off in search of peace and love. Or why escapism into LSD didn't seem like such a bad idea. Or why living for today was the way to go. Simple. We weren't sure tomorrow was worth it. Some don't even, to this day, understand the riots on college campuses.\n \n Why do the same problems persist? Because the same conditions exist. Read my 1, 2, 3 again. The concepts are the same. Nothing has changed but for a few words. The rewards of proper behavior aren't there for today's kids either. Nothing assures employment after graduation no matter how hard the crack the books. It's worse now than it was then. We shake in our boots for a C student in grammar school. What's going to become of them? Kids don't need self-esteem. They need reassurance. They're not getting it. Parents today are more guilty than mine were about drumming fear into their children. Can you think of a better way to communicate fear to children than home schooling? Think about what those parents are actually saying to their kids - a daily reminder that the world is so vicious, better you don't go out into it at all. Fear. It's all about fear. The parents are so scared they can't help drowning their poor little children in it. And trust me. The newest generation is absorbing it all.\n \n What's the reaction to fear? Fight or flight. Lots of kids are still choosing flight. They don't think they can achieve the American dream so they do what we did. Drop out. Don't try. Don't risk failure. Take what happiness you can get today. One of those happinesses happens to be sex. But it's only one of them. There are others. It's not a lack of morals. It's a lack of caring and having confidence in the future. They need a reward. That's what's missing. The reward.\n \n \nI think giving your kids condoms in whatever way institutes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Boys should be held to the same standard as girls in abstinence.\nRead the story again. I didn't give them to them. I preached abstinence.\n \n \nMy condolences on being in a blue state. :)\nIt's only a blue county.

   "The 1950's lifestyle that I described was the norm. My family income was probably a bit above average. My dad was a salaried employee in a GM plant. That was middle class America. My mother had a saying, \"you can't spend a dollar twice\". Credit was a mortgage - not a closet full of clothes. It was basically a cash only society. She had a charge-a-plate (metal embossed with name and number). She used it. But she never ran a balance. Stores didn't take checks. Charging was a convenience over carrying cash but only in a store where you had an account. Master card didn't exist. You knew for sure that you were a valued member of society if you could get a Sears card. That one was the hardest to get. Groceries were cash only. I'm describing an entire lifestyle and attitude of an entire society.\n\n I appreciate the near self-sufficiency of most of the rural families of the time. I think it's good to be in touch with the land and to be knowledgeable of it (although I am not that much but I hope to get there). I am not wimpering in the corner fearing the apocalypse but I do think there is a certain danger of not having some of this self-sufficiency. Plus when people owned their own land, worked it, and saw the fruitfulness of it, I think there might have been a greater contentment and appreciation--rather than working a \"dead end\" job with no ownership or stake. \n \n \nYou'd like to find a way back to a time when financial security was ensured through a good work ethic. The government can't give that to you. Fewer deduction in your paycheck can't give that to you. Only a reliable employer can give that to everyone. It's the current pro-business attitude that stands in your way. I understand your thinking. I was on that train 30 years ago. I was a Republican. That was when I was naive enough to think that business profits equated to larger paychecks. It always seemed to work for GM and my dad. For 10 years it worked for my husband. Life was grand. His boss watched our life and always gave the best raises when we needed it. I got pregnant, along came enough money provide. The pattern was unmistakeable. Those days are gone and they're not coming back.\n \n Yes, I think a good work ethic goes a long way.\n \n \nChildren can't ever get what they need in daycare. The care giver doesn't love them. The care giver can only fit children in to a behavioral mold based on the most recent \"How to Raise the Perfect Child\" book -- every one of which I think should be burned.\n \n It's the nature-nurture question. Paid care givers work totally on the nurture theory. I, for one, rely on the nature theory. I can interpret one son's behaviors because he has my brain wave patterns. The other son has my husband's. Personality is inherited. Parents alone are equipped to deal with that. Parents are terrified of making a mistake. They're taking advice from all angles. They don't need advice. They know the answers. All they have to do is listen to themselves.\n\n We DO agree on some things!\n \n Listen to the insight Chesterton gave to the subject in The Thing. It sounds like what you are saying:\n \n \"Some social reformers try to evade this difficulty, I know, by some vague notions about the State or an abstraction called Education eliminating the parental function...It is based on that strange new superstition, the idea of infinite resources of organization. It is as if officials grew like grass or bred like rabbits. There is supposed to be an endless supply of salaried persons, and of salaries for them; and they are to undertake all that human beings naturally do for themselves, including the care of children...The actual effect of this theory is that one harassed person has to look after a hundred children, instead of one normal person looking after a normal number of them. Normally that normal person is urged by a natural force, which costs nothing and does not require a salary; the force of natural affection for his young which exists even among the animals. If you cut off that natural force, and substitute a paid bureaucracy, you are like a...lunatic who should carefully water his garden with a watering-can, while holding up an umbrella to keep off the rain.\"\n \n He wrote in The Well and the Shallows:\n \"The State did not own men so entirely, even when it could send them to the stake, as it sometimes does now where it can send them to the elementary school.\"\n \n \nThere you have it. Child rearing according to ME. Are you impressed?!?! That by the way is another reason why I'm not a huge supporter of mass adoption. I see adoption as a path of last resort. Parenting is actually a long term manipulation of the child. What can I, as the parent, do or say to elicit the desired response? Parents can instinctively know the answer. Adoptive parents are guessing and using trial and error. Not that it can't work out well. But adoptive parents have a much tougher row to hoe.\n\n Yes, I would say adoption should be a last resort as well. I'm not agreeing with you again am I?\n \n \nWell, the sexual revolution was only a small part of a much larger societal revolution. If the pill was responsible, why didn't penecillin trigger the sexual revolution? Penecillin was the cure for syphillis. Other birth control existed by then (condoms). Why? Because the sexual revolution wasn't a stand alone event. It was part of a much larger picture.\n \n The larger question is what made an entire generation simultaneously take leave of their senses? What made them reject that perfect world and wish to run off to San Francisco to become flower children. Evidently, mine is still the only generation that knows the answer to that question. It's still a mystery to those before and after. The answer is fear. Pure fear. Fear of the future. Fear of the unknown. The strongest human emotion. It drove that revolution - just as it's driving this one.\n \n The pill didn't take away our punishment (pregnancy). Society/conditions took away our reward. For the generation before mine, their future as assured. They didn't know the details. But they knew that if they walked the straight and narrow, and then showed up at the nearest manufacturing facility, they'd get a job that probably lasted a lifetime and everything would be pretty much as they expected.

That's what's missing. The reward.\n\n I think I have the answer:\n \n \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you.\" The Gospel of Matthew  \n \n \"Fear is useless, what is needed is trust\" The Gospel of Mark\n \n \nRead the story again. I didn't give them to them. I preached abstinence.\n\n \n \nI once told a story to somebody on here. Probably wasn't you. Background info: my husband had a vasectomy years ago. The boys didn't know it. I told my sons 100 good reasons why they shouldn't have sex - pregnancy, emotional entanglements, disease, etc., etc, etc. I told them repeatedly. However, being a pragmatist, we always kept condoms in our nightstand. Boys have been known to steal them. Yes. They disappeared. It wasn't long ago that they found out about the vasectomy. Their immediate answer, \"That's not true. There's condoms in your nightstand.\" We laughed. They turned red and quickly exited the room. We laughed harder.\n\n You made them readily available. You said that you and your husband didn't need them but you left them there suspecting your kids might seek them. Then you had a good laugh about it. I'm not making any judgments but I think it would have been better to be pro-active and talk to them (perhaps the culture of the time didn't encourage that??). No double standard for men. They should treat dates how they would want their mother or sisters treated. I would prefer to talk to them about the sanctity of marriage and the sanctity of the marital act--along with the practical risks of sex before marriage.\n \n \nI've already said that the \"real human life\" part is a gray area. One that I'm just not capable of knowing.\n\n When you wrote this earlier, did you mean that you don't know when human life begins or that you don't know when God infuses that life with a soul?\n \n \nYou've never seen a pro-life TV commercial. I doubt they've ever swayed anyone's opinion except possibly causing the pro-choice people to dig their heels in. They're quite the in-your-face reminder of the controversy. Okay. Maybe they only show these in the blue states - but - Are you American?\n \n Maybe I see the same commercials you do. Just not on the Catholic channel. I live in one of those evil blue areas. And I don't think they're nice at all.\n\n What disturbed you about these commercials?",

I described life in an urban environment. Amazing how it corresponds with rural, isn't it.\n \n We never saw a job though as a \"dead end\". It wasn't a discouraging daily requirement. We didn't think in those terms at all. Because - the drive to \"get ahead\" of the Jones's wasn't there. It was simply a fair days work for a fair days pay. Then go home to a nice peaceful family life. I think part of the reason for lack of work ethic today is that the reward no longer exists. Every employee is waiting for the other shoe to drop. A fair days work isn't good enough. You can lose out to somebody younger who will work for less or somebody foreign who will work for less than that. Add to that the necessity to beat the Jones's.

Eliminating it is the easy part. It's the other half - the tough half - that isn't being addressed by the religious right. What do you predict the social results of eliminating it will be? The hope that people/kids will stop having sex doesn't seem realistic\n\n The hope that kids will stop having sex is not realistic because people do not believe in it. They don't speak up or act against societal norms that saturate our culture with sex. The social results of eliminating abortion might be great. It might teach some narcissist about sacrifice--it might teach some of the Christians about it--living for someone other than yourself. It might give them a totally different outlook on life when that baby is born and grows and they have a relationship. It might drive them to do better for themselves and for their baby. To reduce it to our political/economical discussion (as I don't like to do) it would give us a great boost in our work force--would that eliminate our social security and medicare woes? Would that offset the abortion and other social costs that you mention? Not all of those babies would be given up for abortion. Many would be kept once they were experienced by their parent/parents.\n \n \nI can point to all the unwanted pregnancies that are carried to term. The pro-life message is getting through. What's that statistic that my sister quoted to me (she's in N.C. - heart of the bible belt) 40% of all babies in that state are born to unwed mothers.

Her parents didn't do that. They just stayed on message - which was - don't do that.\n\n Are you equating unwanted pregnancies with pregnancies out of wedlock?\n \n Are you certain the parents did anything more than say \"don't do that?\" Were they a Christian family that simply assumed their \"good Christian girl\" would engage in that type of behavior? (I know many Christian families who have made this assumption and have had trouble with their children as a result) Or was there a more elaborate explanation of the theology/faith, health behind it? \n \n If you give them the pill, you not only give them a self-fulfilling prophecy as I stated earlier, but you also initiate a degradation of marriage in their thinking as well.\n \n \nPeople like me aren't Anti-Life. We're not Pro-Abortion. We just want a thorough suggestion. We want to actually improve the problem - not just feel better while actually creating more like the story above.\n\n You are not Anti-Life but are you Pro-life?\n \n What would your proposal to improve the problem in the pro-choice arena be? Many pro-choicers use the position that they are not Anti-Life or Pro-Abortion. They use the slogan that they want abortion \"safe and rare.\" I wonder if most act and speak to make abortion safe and readily availabe but neglect to act and speak to make it rare.\n \n Are you reducing the pro-life actions on abstinence education, pregnant women support, and post abortion counseling to a simple need to feel better without improving the problem?\n \n \nThey were in the place that 99% of married people keep them - a place that the kids had no business being unless they were already looking for them. And when we laughed about it, those kids were both over 21. We laughed at their reaction to finding out we weren't fooled. The fact that they took them, at the time, wasn't the least bit funny.\n\n They were \"in a place that kids had no business being unless they were already looking for them?\" So they had business being there if they were already looking for condoms, that is if they needed condoms? So you knew that they knew where to look for them?\n \n I wasn't aware that many married couples used condoms. Do you know that the founder of your religion, Wesley, likely wouldn't have looked on that very nicely?\n \n \nYou'd have to go some to find a parent that was more open in discussing all the reasons why they shouldn't have sex - repeatedly. Didn't work for me either.\n\n So you taught them not to have sex? I thought you left condoms available with the intention that they would be there for your kids if needed.\n \n Do you have any clues from your children as to why your message failed?\n \n \nEither or both.\n\n You do not think that science gives us a clear answer as to when life begins?\n \n You do not think that the early Christian writings and scripture I cited give us an indication on Christian thought about when the soul is present?\n \n \nI don't think disturbed is the right word. As I said before, I don't think they have the impact of changing any minds. They just pour salt in the wound of controversy. That's the normal response to unwanted advice. That's how the commercials are received - as unwanted judgmental advice\n\n So you do not dispute the violent and horrible pictures of fetuses who were aborted as a truthful representation of the violence and horror that they go through...you simply feel that the presentation of this true depiction of violence is not an effective way to change hearts and minds?

Trees won't last long when the blacksmiths are trying to provide for millions. The writing chose the example that suited it's purpose - the example of the guild. That still exists today. Ever tried to become an apprentice in the plumber's union? Do you see a similarity between distributism and the Amish.

They don't speak up or act against societal norms that saturate our culture with sex. The social results of eliminating abortion might be great. It might teach some narcissist about sacrifice--it might teach some of the Christians about it--living for someone other than yourself. It might give them a totally different outlook on life when that baby is born and grows and they have a relationship. It might drive them to do better for themselves and for their baby. To reduce it to our political/economical discussion (as I don't like to do) it would give us a great boost in our work force--would that eliminate our social security and medicare woes? Would that offset the abortion and other social costs that you mention? Not all of those babies would be given up for abortion. Many would be kept once they were experienced by their parent/parents.\nsaturate our culture with sex. This question is as difficult as nature/nurture. Is art reflected in the culture or is the culture reflected in the art?\n \n boost in our work force We don't have a shortage of workers. Are you saying that another baby boom would solve our problems? I'm not following you with that one. Remember way back when I talked about the issues in the 60's and 70's. We were the first generation for whom the rewards of proper behavior weren't guaranteed?\n \n Did you happen to see the CNN special last week called Saudi Arabia-Kingdom on the Brink. It was an hour about the social issues inside Saudi Arabia. Interesting fact. 75% of the population is under the age of 26. Unemployment is massive. The young unemployed are very vulnerable to the teachings of Al Queda. Not surprising. We went off to be flower children. The Saudi kids are off joining Al Queda. That's what happens when their life path is a big question mark. But the religious police are keeping sex under control. Just talking to a strange girl can land a boy in jail for 6 months.\n \n \nAre you equating unwanted pregnancies with pregnancies out of wedlock?\nI feel I must be missing something in this question. But as a rule of thumb I'd say that out of wedlock pregnancies generally create less reason for celebration.\n \n \nAre you certain the parents did anything more than say \"don't do that?\" Were they a Christian family that simply assumed their \"good Christian girl\" would engage in that type of behavior? (I know many Christian families who have made this assumption and have had trouble with their children as a result) Or was there a more elaborate explanation of the theology/faith, health behind it? \nAs I said, they're shirt-tail relatives and I have no real knowledge of the inner workings of their family.\n \n Do you have children? If so, are they old enough for you to have yet said WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? My grown son asked me not long ago why I was so hard on him as a teenager (curfews and the like). He was such a good kid and looking back he thought his mom was just too ..... everything. After explaining that I was sure he was in the 99th percentile for everything a kid could be -- my answer was -- because kids are what they are. Kids. By definition not totally matured and not yet able to make good decisions all the time. Even good kids aren't 99% smart 100% of the time. They're 100% smart 99% of the time. 1% of the time they're just plain dumb. It's that 1% that will get 'ya. As an example I reminded him that he came home with pennies they'd been putting on the railroad tracks. He was at least 16 at the time. \"You were playing on the railroad tracks you little idiot,\" I said. He laughed. This is a kid that scored a 5 on his AP Physics test - first ever in his high school. Sometimes that 1% gets 'ya in the form of railroad tracks. Sometimes it gets 'ya in the form of pregnant girlfriends. They're kids. They have mental/intelligence/emotional/self-restraint lapses. It's our job as parents to recognize the nature of the beast.\n \n \nIf you give them the pill, you not only give them a self-fulfilling prophecy as I stated earlier, but you also initiate a degradation of marriage in their thinking as well.\nThere are two separate issues here. Children and adults. Is there a difference between pro-life and anti-sex out of wedlock?\n \n First, the girl is 20. She's way too old to influence her point of view on anything. Second, are you saying that a marriage, a life-long commitment and union is somehow degraded by anything -- including pre-marital sex? That's giving sex more weight in the realatinship than it should have. Ever hear the saying: When sex is good is 10% of a relationship. When it's bad it's 90%.\n \n Which brings me to my next point. Abstinence totally fails to look at the root causes for the societal changes. It neglects to address the reasons why girls of yesteryear said no but now they say yes. Women of the 50's and before were completely economically dependent on men. The family unit typically consisted of one bread winner. The goal of every daughter was the catch a man that would feed, clothe, and shelter her for her life time. For her, sex was a distant second to those issues. Sex was the carrot. Her expectations in the bedroom were nonexistant - out of necessity. She was looking for somebody that she could provide for her and she could willingly fawn over at the breakfast table.\n \n That's no longer true. Women know that love and romance isn't everything. They want fireworks, too. They know it exists. They're definitely using the try it before you buy it method. Women are NOT willing to come to the end of their days and describe their sexual experience as the worst 30 seconds of the week. That's what you're asking them to risk. Bluntly, that's the real problem.\n \n The women don't truly believe in their own hearts that they're doing anything wrong. There is no guilt for the abstinence message to build on. That makes the message rejectable.\n \n So in order to have women behave as they did then, the answer is probably to treat them as they were treated then. Stop telling them they can be anything they want to be. Stop educating them so well -- more home-ec, less math. Stop sending them to college. Stop offering them employment and career opportunities. In short, re-oppress them. Reteach them that sex is just one more wifely responsibility -- keep the lights turned off. Sex will follow economic necessity. All that requires an economy where men can once again be the sole provider.\n \n \nYou are not Anti-Life but are you Pro-life?\n \n What would your proposal to improve the problem in the pro-choice arena be? Many pro-choicers use the position that they are not Anti-Life or Pro-Abortion. They use the slogan that they want abortion \"safe and rare.\" I wonder if most act and speak to make abortion safe and readily availabe but neglect to act and speak to make it rare.\n \n Are you reducing the pro-life actions on abstinence education, pregnant women support, and post abortion counseling to a simple need to feel better without improving the problem?\nI don't mean to, but that would be the result. I understand that that's not the intention. There are two paths to making it non-existent or rare. One is outlawing it. The other is drastically cutting the number of pregnancies. You believe that one will result in the other. I don't.\n \n Abstinence and education are not two words that I'm willing to string together. Abstinance is imparting a single belief. It's a short \"lesson\". Reinforcing it repeatedly doesn't make it a longer lesson. Making it a longer conversation with multiple reasons, no matter where they're quoted from, as I did, doesn't make it a longer lesson. It will always be one focus and that's not education. At least not education the way I define it.\n \n If I had my druthers, I'd offer true sex education. Old wives tales that were passed on in locker rooms would come to an end. Why do kids still think they can't get pregnant the first time? Can they quote the STD rate in their state or city? Do they know which ones just aren't cureable? I'd educate kids on the realities of raising children. Remember that teenagers seldom have little one's at home. See the world through their eyes. They're amazingly innocent and sheltered. They subscribe to the theory that nothing bad will happen to them - hence many kinds of risky behavior like seeing if the car can hit 100 m.p.h. They haven't truly thought about the day in and day out grind of diapers, midnight feedings, the fact that you won't sleep past 7 a.m. for years. At best, the girls think that babysitting is 4 hours long and you get paid at the end of it. 2 of those 4 hours, the kid slept. That's not so bad. They have no concept of money. Ask 100 and I'll bet not one knows how much a crib costs. Assign them the task of internet shopping for necessities. Here's my idea of a good school lesson. Give the kids the average cost of living based on government statistics, rent, food, utilities, transportation/car, minimum car insurance in your area. Give them the tax tables. Let them figure out what their gross income needs to be. Don't forget to break it down to an hourly wage. They're playing with fire and don't know it. That's sex education. It's more than the how to mechanics. And since they'd come out knowing way more than when they started, it qualifies as education. Hit it from every angle until something clicks with THEM that it's not worth it.\n \n These are the methods we use with drugs and alcohol and cigarettes. When they put a wrecked car in front of the school before prom, everybody thinks it's a wonderful idea. What makes it a bad idea when the subject is S-E-X?\n \n \nThey were \"in a place that kids had no business being unless they were already looking for them?\" So they had business being there if they were already looking for condoms, that is if they needed condoms? So you knew that they knew where to look for them?\nNo. Just common sense. I had alcohol in the house too. Didn't mean they were welcome to drink it. Now there IS something Wesley would frown on -- alcohol.\n \n \nI wasn't aware that many married couples used condoms. Do you know that the founder of your religion, Wesley, likely wouldn't have looked on that very nicely?\nMy jaw is open. Married people use all forms for birth control. Condoms are the only ones that have no long term health ramifications. So, without taking a survey, I'd assume they're still pretty popular. I personally know that most of the people I'd be willing to ask have already said that that's their method of choice. And again, you're making inaccurate assumptions about the UMC.\n \n \nSo you taught them not to have sex? I thought you left condoms available with the intention that they would be there for your kids if needed. Do you have any clues from your children as to why your message failed?\nOne thing - among many - that we talked about at length was the emotional damage it can do to young girls. Young girls can take it much more seriously than boys. That argument doesn't work well if the girls are asking for it.\n \n \nYou do not think that science gives us a clear answer as to when life begins?\nNo.\n \n \nYou do not think that the early Christian writings and scripture I cited give us an indication on Christian thought about when the soul is present?\nI've tried to find the early Christian writings you're referring to and couldn't pick from the text of our conversation exactly what you're referencing here. If you'd quote it again.....\n \n As far as scripture, I still hold to the idea that interpretation and voluntary submission to what an individual believes is the word is the key.\n \n \nSo you do not dispute the violent and horrible pictures of fetuses who were aborted as a truthful representation of the violence and horror that they go through...you simply feel that the presentation of this true depiction of violence is not an effective way to change hearts and minds? Is that correct?\nI've never seen violent and horrible pictures as you describe them. Only sonogram type pictures. What you're describing would not be suitable for general viewing. There's a commercial I wouldn't want to explain to a 3 year old. That would cause me to call the FCC just as a commercial depicting an appendectomy would. Neither type of commercial is effective way to change hearts and minds. So, yes.",

That's what happens when their life path is a big question mark. But the religious police are keeping sex under control.

My grown son asked me not long ago why I was so hard on him as a teenager (curfews and the like). He was such a good kid and looking back he thought his mom was just too ..... everything. After explaining that I was sure he was in the 99th percentile for everything a kid could be -- my answer was -- because kids are what they are. Kids. By definition not totally matured and not yet able to make good decisions all the time. Even good kids aren't 99% smart 100% of the time.

Sometimes that 1% gets 'ya in the form of railroad tracks. Sometimes it gets 'ya in the form of pregnant girlfriends. They're kids. They have mental/intelligence/emotional/self-restraint lapses. It's our job as parents to recognize the nature of the beast.\n\n I have a 3 month old and I was thinking/planning about how to address premarital sex and other issues with her before she was conceived.\n \n If you \"educate\" your child then his percentage of time \"being dumb\" is lessened--but it must be more than sex education. You make it a priority issue--something of importance that cannot be compromised on--warning them about the emotional rushes, \"hormones,\" love--the dumb parts of being an adolescent, so to speak. We don't simply have to recognize the beast but to give our kids all of the tools available to reign it in and control it. We don't simply recognize it and live and let live.\n \n \nThere are two separate issues here. Children and adults. Is there a difference between pro-life and anti-sex out of wedlock?\n\n Not that I know of. I think that having sex out of wedlock affects abortion numbers.\n \n \nFirst, the girl is 20. She's way too old to influence her point of view on anything. Second, are you saying that a marriage, a life-long commitment and union is somehow degraded by anything -- including pre-marital sex? That's giving sex more weight in the realatinship than it should have. Ever hear the saying: When sex is good is 10% of a relationship. When it's bad it's 90%.\n\n Are you telling me that all of your opinions, values, morals were set prior to the age of 20 and no one could mentor you or influence you after that point?\n \n I did not say that marriage was degraded but that a degradation of marriage in their thinking  was initiated. (But I will say that a marriage that has no baggage of previous partners would be much easier and pure. Most anything can be overcome by love but it is easier not to have to overcome those types of things). \n \n To further elaborate on why one's view of marriage is degraded when allowing the possibility of premarital sex in educating your children we should look to Ephesians 5 and think on Paul's word's concerning the union of husband and wife and its parallel in Christ's union with the Church. This is a holy, pure, sacred, union. Sex is a holy, pure, sacred thing--the marital act that renews ones vows--a marital act.\n \n \nWhich brings me to my next point. Abstinence totally fails to look at the root causes for the societal changes. It neglects to address the reasons why girls of yesteryear said no but now they say yes. Women of the 50's and before were completely economically dependent on men. The family unit typically consisted of one bread winner. The goal of every daughter was the catch a man that would feed, clothe, and shelter her for her life time. For her, sex was a distant second to those issues. Sex was the carrot. Her expectations in the bedroom were nonexistant - out of necessity. She was looking for somebody that she could provide for her and she could willingly fawn over at the breakfast table.\n \n That's no longer true. Women know that love and romance isn't everything. They want fireworks, too. They know it exists. They're definitely using the try it before you buy it method. Women are NOT willing to come to the end of their days and describe their sexual experience as the worst 30 seconds of the week. That's what you're asking them to risk. Bluntly, that's the real problem.\n\n Abstinence does not look at the root cause of anything, you're right. The reasons for abstinence today are as good as they were in the past although the reasons may be different for some. \n \n Is eliminating the risk of a not so explosive sex life more important than a Christian view of sex and marriage in your opinion? Mystery and waiting makes it all the better-divorce statistics might also indicate that premarital sex may be a factor when compared to those who are chaste but this is a can of worms. I believe in chivalry and love-waiting for the one and only before you know them, loving them that much that you love them before you know them.\n \n \nThe women don't truly believe in their own hearts that they're doing anything wrong. There is no guilt for the abstinence message to build on. That makes the message rejectable.\n\n Guilt is not needed for an abstinence message and I don't know many who would approach it in that way (although nothing is wrong with guilt, even though it gets bad press in this modern world-it is a compass, an alarm). The abstinence message I promote does not rely on guilt but rather a sacred view of sex and marriage. It is a message with an awareness of self-esteem and value of one's body and soul. \n \n \nSo in order to have women behave as they did then, the answer is probably to treat them as they were treated then. Stop telling them they can be anything they want to be. Stop educating them so well -- more home-ec, less math. Stop sending them to college. Stop offering them employment and career opportunities. In short, re-oppress them. Reteach them that sex is just one more wifely responsibility -- keep the lights turned off. Sex will follow economic necessity. All that requires an economy where men can once again be the sole provider.\n\n Lift the oppression? The oppression has gone too far in reverse. I agree with you that there was some abuse, condescension, and neglect of women in the past. But to associate oppression with abstinence and with a life in the home is wrong. Abstinence equals freedom. Stop telling women that they will gain their freedom as a woman by being less like a woman (and more like a man). Stop telling them they have to sleep with people to have value. Stop telling them that they are sex objects, good only for their outer physical beauty and not for their intellect and spirituality.\n \n Would you find that the more educated woman is more likely to be abstinent or less likely ? Education may be the best birth control around. Keep telling them that they can be anything they want to be but don't exclude chastity or motherhood from this. Don't stop offering them employment and career opportunities but do stop telling them life as a mother is inferior to that (weren't we agreeing on the parents' essential role in raising the children instead of paid nursery workers and government)? Yes, teach them that sex is a wifely responsibility because it is-Ephesians 5-but it is not a unmarried person's responsibility.\n \n Chesterton says somewhere, I can't locate it at the moment that women in the home are the most powerful people on earth--because they are shaping the minds and hearts of the future.\n \n \nI don't mean to, but that would be the result. I understand that that's not the intention. There are two paths to making it non-existent or rare. One is outlawing it. The other is drastically cutting the number of pregnancies. You believe that one will result in the other. I don't.\n\n No, I don't believe that allowing abortion will result in fewer number of pregnancies. I DO believe it will result in a fewer number of homicides, that is fewer abortions. It will be a dissuading influence. It will be an influence that will have an effect on the mindset of the country with time. \n \n There once was a disagreement on another moral issue in this country, slavery and a war was fought over it. Do you think the subsequent outlawing of slavery resulted in less slavery in the country? More importantly did it change the view of slavery in a large number of people's minds over time?\n \n \nAbstinence and education are not two words that I'm willing to string together. Abstinance is imparting a single belief. It's a short \"lesson\". Reinforcing it repeatedly doesn't make it a longer lesson. Making it a longer conversation with multiple reasons, no matter where they're quoted from, as I did, doesn't make it a longer lesson. It will always be one focus and that's not education. At least not education the way I define it.\n\n I'm not sure why abstinence is not education. I'm not sure why safe sex is any more broad or deep a message. In fact, I see it as less so in the Christian framework or in the general framework of a higher meaning to human life and the human body. There is a very deep meaning in abstinence. Abstinence can include STD education, religious education, financial education-child and mother poverty, education education (mothers getting one if pregnant), commitment education (commitment/loyalty to spouse, kids, family, friends, work, schooling, etc overflowing into almost all aspects of one's life (dad's need this especially)), value of human life education, etc.\n \n \nIf I had my druthers, I'd offer true sex education. Old wives tales that were passed on in locker rooms would come to an end. Why do kids still think they can't get pregnant the first time? Can they quote the STD rate in their state or city? Do they know which ones just aren't cureable? I'd educate kids on the realities of raising children. Remember that teenagers seldom have little one's at home. See the world through their eyes. They're amazingly innocent and sheltered. They subscribe to the theory that nothing bad will happen to them - hence many kinds of risky behavior like seeing if the car can hit 100 m.p.h.

It's more than the how to mechanics. And since they'd come out knowing way more than when they started, it qualifies as education. Hit it from every angle until something clicks with THEM that it's not worth it.\n\n Amen on this type of education-good points. This does not conflict with abstinence ed.\n \n \nThese are the methods we use with drugs and alcohol and cigarettes. When they put a wrecked car in front of the school before prom, everybody thinks it's a wonderful idea. What makes it a bad idea when the subject is S-E-X?\n\n Wouldn't this extended to the sex world be a fetus (abortion) commercial? If the car works why wouldn't you use the more calm ultrasound pictures?\n \n \nNo. Just common sense. I had alcohol in the house too. Didn't mean they were welcome to drink it. Now there IS something Wesley would frown on -- alcohol.\n\n You have a use for the alcohol and don't leave it out with the specific purpose of the kids finding it and using it in \"time of need\" do you? You in fact, actively prohibit its use I would think.\n \n Sorry, it sounded to me like you knew they would eventually seek the condoms out and use them. It seemed like you were saying that you were leaving them there for a safety net in case they wouldn't follow your other teaching. It seemed like you were saying you left them there specifically for the purpose of your kids finding and using them since you and your husband didn't need them anymore. But maybe I misunderstood you.\n \n Wesley, it seems would frown on contraception and abortion as well. He makes some very strong statements about the contraceptive act of Onan in Genesis.\n \n \nMy jaw is open. Married people use all forms for birth control. Condoms are the only ones that have no long term health ramifications. So, without taking a survey, I'd assume they're still pretty popular. I personally know that most of the people I'd be willing to ask have already said that that's their method of choice. And again, you're making inaccurate assumptions about the UMC.\n\n What do condoms do to the total self-giving of one spouse to another that should be present in a marriage?\n \n What assumptions am I making about the UMC??? Did you know that ALL CHRISTIAN churches opposed contraception until 1930--not just the Catholic Church. And if they opposed contraception then they surely opposed abortion. It was not until the Lambeth Conference of 1930 that contraception was approved of by a Protestant congregation, the Anglicans, and other Protestants changed thereafter.\n \n \nOne thing - among many - that we talked about at length was the emotional damage it can do to young girls. Young girls can take it much more seriously than boys. That argument doesn't work well if the girls are asking for it.\n\n That tells me that there was a problem with the girls upbringing and does not excuse the boys' behavior.\n \n \nNo.\n\n Science does give a clear answer on when life begins--conception. At that point there is a new distinct, living, growing being. I can find some quotes from textbooks etc. if you would like.\n \n If that does not suffice then do you think that the remains of an aborted fetus are not evidence that human life had begun and was indeed killed?\n \n \nI've tried to find the early Christian writings you're referring to and couldn't pick from the text of our conversation exactly what you're referencing here. If you'd quote it again.....\n\n From post #41:\n For Christians \"real human life\" has never been a gray area. It has been an area that has been enlightened by science but the newborn child has always been worthy of protection in the Christian view. You don't make a determination of what is a baby but Christians have always done so from the beginning. The pro-choice Christian is a 20th century phenomenon. See this link for the earliest of Christian prohibitions against abortion:\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp  \n \n Notice that women's children who were injured or killed before birth were treated as children.\n \n Other scripture indicates how the being in the womb was thought of:\n \n \"The babies jostled each other within her.\" Genesis 25:22\n \n \"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\" Jeremiah 1:5\n \n \"But the angel said to Mary 'you will be with child  and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus...\" Luke 1:30\n \n Randy Alcorn, a Protestant minister, discusses historical Christian view on abortion here:\n \n http://www.epm.org/articles/aborhistory.html \n \n \nAs far as scripture, I still hold to the idea that interpretation and voluntary submission to what an individual believes is the word is the key.\n\n You think that everyone is free to determine his own truth? I did not think Christianity was founded on that principle. I don't think Christ (or the apostles) allowed that. I don't think scripture attests to that, 2 Peter 1:20  \"First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.\"\n \n \nI've never seen violent and horrible pictures as you describe them. Only sonogram type pictures. What you're describing would not be suitable for general viewing. There's a commercial I wouldn't want to explain to a 3 year old. That would cause me to call the FCC just as a commercial depicting an appendectomy would. Neither type of commercial is effective way to change hearts and minds. So, yes.\n\n You don't think that using ultrasound to show a mother the reality that what is inside of her is a living, human being, part of her own creation, part of her own flesh and blood is an effective way to change minds and hearts on abortion?",

I'm just saying that there has always been, and there always will be, temptation. It's supposed to be there. Look who put it there first.\n \n \nI was speaking on providing a base for social security and medicare.\nNot to get in to politics - but quickly - unemployed people don't pay social security or medicare. A huge baby boom would very likely create massive unemployment - as it did last time - and as it is currently doing in Saudi Arabia.\n \n \nI have a 3 month old and I was thinking/planning about how to address premarital sex and other issues with her before she was conceived.\n \n If you \"educate\" your child then his percentage of time \"being dumb\" is lessened--but it must be more than sex education. You make it a priority issue--something of importance that cannot be compromised on--warning them about the emotional rushes, \"hormones,\" love--the dumb parts of being an adolescent, so to speak. We don't simply have to recognize the beast but to give our kids all of the tools available to reign it in and control it. We don't simply recognize it and live and let live.\nI wish you the best of luck with your new baby.\n \n From someone who said that all child rearing books should be burned, here's the quick version of what I learned. Take it for what it's worth. All children have a natural inborn desire to please their parents. Use that power you have carefully and wisely. Don't ever let her think she can't successfully please you - because on that day, all will be lost.\n \n Wise advice I got from a 50 year old when mine was a few months old - speaking of her own children she said: I used to worry about everything. Now I realize that they didn't grow up because of me. They grew up in spite of me.\n \n Her words stuck with me, as you can see, and with each passing year I saw more and more of exactly what she meant.\n \n \nThere are two separate issues here. Children and adults. Is there a difference between pro-life and anti-sex out of wedlock? \n\n \n \nNot that I know of. I think that having sex out of wedlock affects abortion numbers.\nWhile I certainly DO NOT condone promiscuous sex or sex between those who are not prepared to handle the consequences such as kids, or those who just don't like what's playing at the theatre, I can't say that I have an issue with the adult crowd who are in a serious relationship - IF it's a mutual decision.\n \n \nAre you telling me that all of your opinions, values, morals were set prior to the age of 20 and no one could mentor you or influence you after that point?\nPretty much. Probably well before that. I was married at 19. I have very seldom seen anyone, at any age, influenced at much of any age. Have you? Were you open to suggestions about your sex life at the age of 20? I think not.\n \n Don't you think that people basically do what is in their own best self-interest at any given point. We can point out to them where WE think their judgment is flawed and whether or not it's truly in their best interest, but in the end, everybody lives their own lives and make their own decisions.\n \n \nI did not say that marriage was degraded but that a degradation of marriage in their thinking  was initiated. (But I will say that a marriage that has no baggage of previous partners would be much easier and pure. Most anything can be overcome by love but it is easier not to have to overcome those types of things). \nNot everyone sees it as baggage. The past doesn't create jealousy in everyone - and certainly not in the sexually active who, by the way, gravitate to each other. We are all a product of our experiences. Our past makes us who we are.\n \n \nTo further elaborate on why one's view of marriage is degraded when allowing the possibility of premarital sex in educating your children we should look to Ephesians 5 and think on Paul's word's concerning the union of husband and wife and its parallel in Christ's union with the Church. This is a holy, pure, sacred, union. Sex is a holy, pure, sacred thing--the marital act that renews ones vows--a marital act.\nAll these years and I truly never thought of it that way.\n \n \nAbstinence does not look at the root cause of anything, you're right. The reasons for abstinence today are as good as they were in the past although the reasons may be different for some. \nI don't think that abstinence was practiced in the past as much as you do. I truly believe that the world (from a sexual point of view) hasn't gone haywire. We're just seeing it clearly for the first time.\n \n If you can catch it, the History Channel recently ran a 4 hour piece called The History of Sex. It starts in the Greek and Roman cultures and runs through the centuries to the present. It looks at practices around the world: China, India, Middle East, and Mexico, as well as Christian philosophy and HOW and WHEN that philosophy was formed as well as how closely it has been adhered to. I saw it once last year and again this month. So I have no idea when it will be shown again, but it is definitely an eye opener.\n \n \nIs eliminating the risk of a not so explosive sex life more important than a Christian view of sex and marriage in your opinion? Mystery and waiting makes it all the better.\nI'm guessing you're not quite grasping just how \"not so explosive\" it can be. I know it's hard for a man to understand but can you imagine an entire lifetime where none would be better than THAT. Possibly a lifetime where you close your eyes and pretend you're elsewhere. It can be that bad. You're thinking in terms of - it could be better. I'm thinking in terms of - it couldn't be worse.\n \n \n-divorce statistics might also indicate that premarital sex may be a factor when compared to those who are chaste but this is a can of worms. I believe in chivalry and love-waiting for the one and only before you know them, loving them that much that you love them before you know them.\nI'm 100% in favor of the love part first. I will agree with you that those who truly believe - going in - that marriage is forever and those who are chaste are both less likely to get divorced. I will even agree that those who are chaste do so because they're saving themselves for marriage and therefore obviously believe that marriage is forever. That third link of the triangle is a little harder for me to complete - that being the one where those who have engaged in pre-marital sex don't necessarily believe that marriage is forever and therefore have a higher divorce rate.\n \n This brings me back to what I said earlier. Good sex is 10% of a relationship. If you believe, as I do, that the largest percentage of people have had pre-marital sex, and they knew what they were getting in that regard, then evidently the sex wasn't enough to hold them together. The other 90% of the relationship was bad. So I see the question as why people who haven't ironed out the other 90% are getting married - rather than how to make the 10% more important than 10%.\n \n Actually, this is a topic I talked to my youngest (and his girlfriend) about. Come to think of it, they broke up after that!!! I call it the next available theory. I see the kids, by that I mean the 20's group, and most especially the girls, making the marriage decision - then finding the guy. Sound crazy? I swear. They talk openly about it. I've heard it. Girls with no prospects who say they've decided it's time to find a husband. They must find a husband because they're coming up on some magical birthday and they decided years ago that this was the year they'd get married. And they do. They take the next available.\n \n \nGuilt is not needed for an abstinence message and I don't know many who would approach it in that way (although nothing is wrong with guilt, even though it gets bad press in this modern world-it is a compass, an alarm). The abstinence message I promote does not rely on guilt but rather a sacred view of sex and marriage. It is a message with an awareness of self-esteem and value of one's body and soul.\nYou're saying that abstinence is based on a positive message. I'm saying it only works when it elicits a negative one: guilt or what will somebody think of me. Mine is a positive message, but from the opposite point of view. The message from those famous 50's was: he won't buy the cow if he can get the milk for free. My answer is: I never wanted to be bought for my milk. While you're trying to send the message of self-esteem, the other side of that coin is, if that's a girl's most valuable asset, she's not worth very much. \"Self-esteem\" based on what's below the waist isn't self-esteem at all. Girls -- find true self-esteem in something that makes you you. Everybody has the same body parts. What makes you special. When you find real self-esteem, you'll make the choices that are right for you.\n \n \nLift the oppression? The oppression has gone too far in reverse. I agree with you that there was some abuse, condescension, and neglect of women in the past. But to associate oppression with abstinence and with a life in the home is wrong. Abstinence equals freedom. Stop telling women that they will gain their freedom as a woman by being less like a woman (and more like a man). Stop telling them they have to sleep with people to have value. Stop telling them that they are sex objects, good only for their outer physical beauty and not for their intellect and spirituality.\nBack to my last statement.\n \n \nWould you find that the more educated woman is more likely to be abstinent or less likely ? Education may be the best birth control around. Keep telling them that they can be anything they want to be but don't exclude chastity or motherhood from this. Don't stop offering them employment and career opportunities but do stop telling them life as a mother is inferior to that (weren't we agreeing on the parents' essential role in raising the children instead of paid nursery workers and government)? Yes, teach them that sex is a wifely responsibility because it is-Ephesians 5-but it is not a unmarried person's responsibility.\nI have no argument with stay at home wives and mothers who take their child rearing seriously. I was one of them. But we part company on the responsibility portion of your statement. A girl with self-esteem doesn't do it because it's her responsibility - regardless of marital status. That's where the self-esteem message falls down. First, she must choose abstinence based on self-esteem. Then, rip away that self-esteem by telling her that choice takes second place to responsibility. \n \n \nChesterton says somewhere, I can't locate it at the moment that women in the home are the most powerful people on earth--because they are shaping the minds and hearts of the future.\nYes they are.\n \n \nNo, I don't believe that allowing abortion will result in fewer number of pregnancies. I DO believe it will result in a fewer number of homicides, that is fewer abortions. It will be a dissuading influence. It will be an influence that will have an effect on the mindset of the country with time.\nIf that were true, why are there so many single mothers?\n \n \nThere once was a disagreement on another moral issue in this country, slavery and a war was fought over it. Do you think the subsequent outlawing of slavery resulted in less slavery in the country? More importantly did it change the view of slavery in a large number of people's minds over time?\nSlavery was outlawed. Discrimination still exists. Outlaw abortion and sex will still exist.\n \n \nI'm not sure why abstinence is not education. I'm not sure why safe sex is any more broad or deep a message. In fact, I see it as less so in the Christian framework or in the general framework of a higher meaning to human life and the human body. There is a very deep meaning in abstinence. Abstinence can include STD education, religious education, financial education-child and mother poverty, education education (mothers getting one if pregnant), commitment education (commitment/loyalty to spouse, kids, family, friends, work, schooling, etc overflowing into almost all aspects of one's life (dad's need this especially)), value of human life education, etc.\nWe agree until we get to the higher meaning of life part. As I said before, girls with true self-esteem will make the choice that is best for them for sound logical reasons. Any message that puts their body and physical being on a higher plane of human existance isn't my message. I don't think that's in the best interest of their long term self-esteem.\n \n \nAmen on this type of education-good points. This does not conflict with abstinence ed.\nAbstinence education isn't sex education at all. Abstinence comes from a place of accepting one's self as a worthy person with something to contribute -- something more important than a the ability to be an incubator. I'm not referring to the ability to have a career. I'm referring to a person who sees herself with a positive self image. That could be sense of humor, ability to organize, even head-cheerleader. It takes an all around LACK of neediness.\n \n \nWouldn't this extended to the sex world be a fetus (abortion) commercial? If the car works why wouldn't you use the more calm ultrasound pictures?\nThere is no argument for abstinence that will work with a needy person. Many girls who lack true self-esteem are looking for acceptance - and using the wrong tools to get it. Is it a surprise that if they get the message that their sexuality is their most valuable asset, that's exactly what they use to gain attention?\n \n \nYou have a use for the alcohol and don't leave it out with the specific purpose of the kids finding it and using it in \"time of need\" do you? You in fact, actively prohibit its use I would think.\nThe alcohol isn't hidden. It's visible behind a glass door.\n \n \nSorry, it sounded to me like you knew they would eventually seek the condoms out and use them. It seemed like you were saying that you were leaving them there for a safety net in case they wouldn't follow your other teaching. It seemed like you were saying you left them there specifically for the purpose of your kids finding and using them since you and your husband didn't need them anymore. But maybe I misunderstood you.\nJust as with the alcohol, my expectations are high and clear. When I say that it's their job to resist temptation, not mine to remove it, I mean it.\n \n \nWesley, it seems would frown on contraception and abortion as well. He makes some very strong statements about the contraceptive act of Onan in Genesis.\nWesley believed very strongly in the family unit. He believed that especially strongly where priests and their inability to marry was concerned.\n \n \nWhat do condoms do to the total self-giving of one spouse to another that should be present in a marriage?\nWhat does the fear of pregnancy do for it? We'll talk when you're 50 - like me. You're at a point in your life where another child can be seen as a gift. That point of view won't last forever - unless you're planning on a baker's dozen.\n \n \nWhat assumptions am I making about the UMC??? Did you know that ALL CHRISTIAN churches opposed contraception until 1930--not just the Catholic Church. And if they opposed contraception then they surely opposed abortion. It was not until the Lambeth Conference of 1930 that contraception was approved of by a Protestant congregation, the Anglicans, and other Protestants changed thereafter.\nBirth control is birth control is birth control. Holding back on urges until the rhythm method says it's a safe day is still birth control. It's a conscious decision to defeat the natural order. Even the Catholic Church realizes that some method must be condoned.\n \n Why do you think the pregnancy rate among 50 year olds is so low? They're not just lucky.\n \n \nThat tells me that there was a problem with the girls upbringing and does not excuse the boys' behavior.\nUpbringing or self-esteem? Did she make her decision based on her lack of morals or her need for acceptance/attention/human interaction?\n \n \nScience does give a clear answer on when life begins--conception. At that point there is a new distinct, living, growing being. I can find some quotes from textbooks etc. if you would like. If that does not suffice then do you think that the remains of an aborted fetus are not evidence that human life had begun and was indeed killed?\nI have complete faith in God's ability to deal with human choices.\n \n \n\"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\" Jeremiah 1:5\nThis is the most applicable/important quote. It says that He knew, BEFORE hand, what the fate would be. Can you not give him that same credit where all are concerned?\n \n \nYou think that everyone is free to determine his own truth? I did not think Christianity was founded on that principle. I don't think Christ (or the apostles) allowed that. I don't think scripture attests to that, 2 Peter 1:20  \"First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.\"\nI think that everyone is free to ponder and understand the truth. Theologians make it their life's work. Now we're back to following that truth VOLUNTARILY. Are you seeking a method by which you can force someone else to be worthy of heaven? It can't be done. They must do it for themselves. Clearing temptation from their path is a guarantee of nothing.\n \n \nYou don't think that using ultrasound to show a mother the reality that what is inside of her is a living, human being, part of her own creation, part of her own flesh and blood is an effective way to change minds and hearts on abortion?\nI don't think it's an effective method with girls any more than it is with boys.\n \n Truthfully, I don't see a big difference between boys and girls at all. Boys have simply chosen the low road as an excuse for THEIR \"inability\" to control themselves. This is constantly reinforced in male circles. The only way this can be laid at the feet of the females is to subscribe to the idea that their urges are somehow more controlable. What bunk!\n \n Really! Watch for that History Channel show. I nearly laughed myself sick when, during the Victorian Era, they invented table skirts because Queen Victoria thought men are so attracted to legs that the men could be drawn to unnatural acts with furniture. Best to cover table legs, just as they did women's legs -- with long skirts. That's an example of making excuses for men while women bear the responsibility.",

What you describe--\"adults in a serious relationship\" with mutual consent--That's not Christianity. Christianity emphasizes marriage.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n Are you telling me that all of your opinions, values, morals were set prior to the age of 20 and no one could mentor you or influence you after that point?\n\n \nPretty much. Probably well before that. I was married at 19. I have very seldom seen anyone, at any age, influenced at much of any age. Have you? Were you open to suggestions about your sex life at the age of 20? I think not.\n \n Don't you think that people basically do what is in their own best self-interest at any given point. We can point out to them where WE think their judgment is flawed and whether or not it's truly in their best interest, but in the end, everybody lives their own lives and make their own decisions.\n\n The difficult thing and the thing that Christianity emphasizes is to get people to act on more than simply self  interest. It is an effort to get them to consider truth, morality, and their fellow men. We must teach our children to go beyond self-interest.\n \n You are right in saying that the foundation learned in childhood and the early years is important and difficult to alter. But you are wrong in saying that most people stall at a certain age or are resistant to any influence at all ages.\n \n Famous people that we see, mentors in our own lives, athletes, religious and political figures, etc. can all be very strong influences that affect behavior and ideals, in my opinion. We as parents have to expose our children to the right role models because of this. Also, you neglect the possibility of an authentic conversion experience and embrace of faith that happens to so many at many different ages throughout life in which a profound change in ideals and behavior can come about. Yes, teenagers, twenty-year olds, and younger and older can all be influenced to change behavior.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n I did not say that marriage was degraded but that a degradation of marriage in their thinking was initiated.

But knowing what we know about our past--why not pass that knowledge to our children so they do not have to go through the same bumps.

Why risk yourself in premarital sex with STD, pre-marital pregnancy, etc. for only 10% of the relationship. As you said, work on the other 90% to make the relationship truly strong. Then work on the 10% of sex once you're married where there's no risk of the other stuff.\n \nActually, this is a topic I talked to my youngest (and his girlfriend) about.

The self-esteem of an abstinence message says exactly what you are saying. I am a person. The man must love me holistically-not due simply to physical attraction and sexual acts. The self-esteem message of abstinence tells girls (and guys) that they are worth more than just sex. They are worth waiting for...(Guilt is okay too though.) This message states that there is more than just a value to the physical-there is a higher, spiritual value in all of us. \n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n Would you find that the more educated woman is more likely to be abstinent or less likely ?

I'm not saying a wife has an obligation to have sex with her husband every time he requests it. I am saying that she should be willing to give herself to him sometimes when she may not necessarily be in the best mood for it. It is a responsibility as are many other acts of love in marriage becaue it fosters love and unites the spouses. It enhances the marriage and it keeps the male, who often has a stronger sex drive, from going astray and looking elsewhere. (I am not saying that is ever justified no matter the amount of sex. I'm just saying that it helps). She chooses abstinence out of love of self and her future mate. She also chooses to give herself to her husband out of love for him. It is still a choice and there is no negation of self-esteem in that.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n There once was a disagreement on another moral issue in this country, slavery and a war was fought over it. Do you think the subsequent outlawing of slavery resulted in less slavery in the country? More importantly did it change the view of slavery in a large number of people's minds over time?\n\n \nSlavery was outlawed. Discrimination still exists. Outlaw abortion and sex will still exist.\n\n Slavery was outlawed and slavery no longer exists in this country. It succeeded in that right??? Discrimination is bad but not as bad as slavery. You cannot deny that there has been progress in this. Also, discrimation of the 1960s was worse than it is currently. So we see even more progress. It is a slow gradual changing of hearts and minds brought about by a few that fought to change laws. The laws eventually helped as one factor in changing other minds and hearts. I readily agree that changing hearts is better. But I believe that changing laws in the face of the death of so many is valid and also a pathway to change hearts.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n I'm not sure why abstinence is not education.

Any message that puts their body and physical being on a higher plane of human existance isn't my message. I don't think that's in the best interest of their long term self-esteem.\n\n I again, thought we were discussing things in the context of Christianity. Christianity says that there is a higher meaning of life and a greater respect for the human body than our secular, material world offers. Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit and should be used to glorify God as scripture says. Logic is a part of the Christian life and one's actions but it is not the sole determinant.Sometimes logic may lead one down the wrong path-it may be logical for a girl in high school to ensure the love of the greatest looking, most athletic, rich, considerate man in high school with the bond of sex-it may be logical for her to think that if she has a baby, all the better, she will be taken care of and have the best man around-but there are varying degrees of logic. How is viewing one's body on a higher plane detrimental?\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n Amen on this type of education-good points. This does not conflict with abstinence ed.\n\n \nAbstinence education isn't sex education at all. Abstinence comes from a place of accepting one's self as a worthy person with something to contribute -- something more important than the ability to be an incubator. I'm not referring to the ability to have a career. I'm referring to a person who sees herself with a positive self image. That could be sense of humor, ability to organize, even head-cheerleader. It takes an all around LACK of neediness.\n\n I'm not sure what your point is here. It seems that you are endorsing abstinence as a positive message here but earlier you seem to say that it goes against a woman developing proper self-esteem.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n Wouldn't this extended to the sex world be a fetus (abortion) commercial? If the car works why wouldn't you use the more calm ultrasound pictures?\n\n \nThere is no argument for abstinence that will work with a needy person. Many girls who lack true self-esteem are looking for acceptance - and using the wrong tools to get it. Is it a surprise that if they get the message that their sexuality is their most valuable asset, that's exactly what they use to gain attention?\n\n I'm not sure how this answers my question on using fetus commercials are similar to using crashed up cars to persuade people not to drink and drive. Perhaps you could refer back to my original post on this.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n You have a use for the alcohol and don't leave it out with the specific purpose of the kids finding it and using it in \"time of need\" do you? You in fact, actively prohibit its use I would think.\n\n \nThe alcohol isn't hidden. It's visible behind a glass door.\n\n Originally Posted by maximus\n \nSorry, it sounded to me like you knew they would eventually seek the condoms out and use them. It seemed like you were saying that you were leaving them there for a safety net in case they wouldn't follow your other teaching. It seemed like you were saying you left them there specifically for the purpose of your kids finding and using them since you and your husband didn't need them anymore. But maybe I misunderstood you.\n\n \nJust as with the alcohol, my expectations are high and clear. When I say that it's their job to resist temptation, not mine to remove it, I mean it.\n\n I agree with that to a certain extent but what is the point of keeping the condoms when they are not being used? Why put your children to the test? There is a use for the alcohol, your kids are educated on not using it. There is no longer a use for the condoms, your kids were educated on not using them??? (that is not having sex in order to have a need for them). Or were things left unsaid intentionally and the condoms left there intentionally as a safety net for sin? But what was the purpose for keeping them around? They had no use according to your admission that you and your husband didn't use them.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n Wesley, it seems would frown on contraception and abortion as well. He makes some very strong statements about the contraceptive act of Onan in Genesis.\n\n \nWesley believed very strongly in the family unit. He believed that especially strongly where priests and their inability to marry was concerned.\n\n Yes and he believed in not marring the family unit by obstructing the will of God in bringing about children. I think he would very strongly condemn abortion and contraception due to his strong beliefs in the family unit. But so many Protestant churches have gone astray from their founders. Are you attempting to make a point about priestly celibacy? Actions have an effect, they can be good and moral or bad and immoral.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n What do condoms do to the total self-giving of one spouse to another that should be present in a marriage?\n\n \nWhat does the fear of pregnancy do for it? We'll talk when you're 50 - like me. You're at a point in your life where another child can be seen as a gift. That point of view won't last forever - unless you're planning on a baker's dozen.\n\n When you embrace a philosophy of life-that children are a blessing from the Lord and the family will persevere in providing for them then there is no fear. That point of view will last forever. \n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n What assumptions am I making about the UMC??? Did you know that ALL CHRISTIAN churches opposed contraception until 1930--not just the Catholic Church. And if they opposed contraception then they surely opposed abortion. It was not until the Lambeth Conference of 1930 that contraception was approved of by a Protestant congregation, the Anglicans, and other Protestants changed thereafter.\n\n \nBirth control is birth control is birth control. Holding back on urges until the rhythm method says it's a safe day is still birth control. It's a conscious decision to defeat the natural order. Even the Catholic Church realizes that some method must be condoned.\n \n Why do you think the pregnancy rate among 50 year olds is so low? They're not just lucky.\n\n There is a difference in birth control and contraception. Means do not justify the ends. The rhythm method is no longer used. I believe its called the sympto-thermal method now. And it is as effective as artificial birth control in \"avoiding\" pregnancy. But using it to avoid pregnancy is not the same as contraception because one wouldn't have had a baby on those days even if they tried. There are times of natural infertility built into a woman's cycle.\n \n Furthermore, contraception is an important issue because it often leads to abortion.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n Science does give a clear answer on when life begins--conception. At that point there is a new distinct, living, growing being. I can find some quotes from textbooks etc. if you would like. If that does not suffice then do you think that the remains of an aborted fetus are not evidence that human life had begun and was indeed killed?\n\n So do I. But that does not mean that I sit back and allow everything to happen as it will. I take action. We must all participate in God's redeeming work.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n \"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.\" Jeremiah 1:5\n\n \nThis is the most applicable/important quote. It says that He knew, BEFORE hand, what the fate would be. Can you not give him that same credit where all are concerned?\n\n Omniscience does not negate free will. He knew what would happen but that does mean we are predestined in the sense that we have no choice. We have free will. When we say that \"God's will be done\" or \"the Lord willing\" we know that he can influence this life but he does not control us to the point of slavery. When we say those things it is a request for guidance \"let me know your will and help me to have the strength to do it,\" as much as it is a request for his direct intervention.\n \n Christianity is not fatalism or predestination. That was a tenet of Calvinism and I believe that Methodism was formed in part to respond to the errors of Calvinism. Whatever you did for or did not do for the least of these, James faith without works.\n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n You don't think that using ultrasound to show a mother the reality that what is inside of her is a living, human being, part of her own creation, part of her own flesh and blood is an effective way to change minds and hearts on abortion?\n\n \nI don't think it's an effective method with girls any more than it is with boys.\n \n Truthfully, I don't see a big difference between boys and girls at all. Boys have simply chosen the low road as an excuse for THEIR \"inability\" to control themselves. This is constantly reinforced in male circles. The only way this can be laid at the feet of the females is to subscribe to the idea that their urges are somehow more controlable. What bunk!\n\n The only way to address it is to let them both know that their urges are controllable. You are definitely right in saying that the double standard in teaching the males of our society must be addressed. Males must be taught to revere women and sex as more than conquest, fun, and a right of passage.\n \n Peace.",
