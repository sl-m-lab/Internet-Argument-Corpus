To provide entertainment.\n\n \n \n In light of recent events in the Debate Challenges forum (not to mention elsewhere), I would like to entertain a suggestion for the Debate section.\n \n What is the reason for this entertainment? Because it seems that we have been going about certain things all wrong. Using the example I have in mind, one party refuses to agree to a definition for an ambiguous word in the resolution. There may be legitimate reasons for this. For example, note that none of the given definitions above seems to fit the Parliamentarian sense of \"'entertaining' a motion.\" A standard dictionary may not have definitions appropriate for certain applications, especially when those applications are technical or uncommon. So while I certainly understand the desire to not be constrained by a definition, we must concede that a debate clearly cannot happen when the two sides cannot even agree on what is being debated.\n \n Let's take a look at the ten parameters that IIDB uses for debate:\n \n1) The topic of the debate.\n 2) The participants of the debate, and what positions they will argue.\n 3) The scope of the debate.\n 4) The length of the debate, in number of rounds.\n 5) Whether statements will be made concurrently or in turns, and if the latter, who goes first.\n 6) The maximum length of each statement.\n 7) The time limit between statements.\n 8) The extent to which quotes and references from outside sources will be allowed.\n 9) The starting date of the debate.\n 10) Any additional rules or a debate format that debate participants must observe.\n\n \n Please direct your attention to parameter number three. Although the resolution is supposed to succintly state the basic standpoints of the participants, requiring the scope of the debate to be not only decided upon but also -- and more importantly -- clarified beforehand makes the debate very clear.\n \n If a debate proposal contained the phrase \"suggestion entertainment,\" and one participant started talking about contemplation of potentially positive ideas while the other talked about telling jokes to the completed feedback cards at your local restaurant, we'd have a pretty dull debate. \n \n Likewise, for no less than one hot topic in the Debate Proposals forum, because one party wants to avoid defining any ambiguous words, any opponent would be agreeing to a debate that could be entirely antithetical to the position he or she wanted to debate.\n \n Quite frankly, this should never happen. The scope of the debate should be clearly defined and agreed upon by each participant before the debate starts. Any points that both participants feel should be a part of the debate should be included in the scope as up for discussion during the debate. If any word is ambiguous or being used in a non-standard way, this can be explained in the scope.\n \n I therefore propose that it become a general requirement for debates on 4forums to have a clearly defined scope before moderators agree to host and administrate those debates.",

   "Not having a clue what you could possibly be talking about :) \n \n I have to agree that it seems illogical to start a debate where the actual subject under discussion is either not agreed, or not fully understood. Both of these points would be countered by having an agreed upon definition of the debate to begin with, including (if the case demands it) definitions of relevant important terms. It kinda makes a mockery of a debate if someone can just move the goalposts, or claim that that's not what the word means. \n \n Not getting at anyone, just chipping in my 2p",

   "If both parties agree to debate a resolution with undefined terms, then part of the debate becomes the definition of the terms themselves.\n\n I respectfully object, and I'll present an illustration of why.\n \n In an earlier thread, I made what I have repeatedly referred to as \"the zipnats post.\" Here is the relevant passage:When the disagreement on even this matter is painfully clear from the get-go, we end up with two separate halves of a debate, which isn't a debate at all. You'll spend every post using your definitions, and he'll spend each of his using his own definitions, and no actual conflicts will be discussed. (How about I challenge you to a debate with the resolution, \"Glognarks are the most effective means of creating zipnats,\" with \"glognark\" and \"zipnats\" to be defined during the debate?)\n\n Suppose Person A agrees to the debate resolution above, because Person A feels that she can made a very good case that glognarks are indeed the most effective means of creating zipnats. Let us say further that she feels this way because she thinks that glognarks are wood fires and zipnats are wood coals.\n Now suppose Person B agrees to the debate resolution above. Person B will oppose because she feels that glognarks are not the most effective means of creating zipnats. This might be because she understands that glognarks are vats of water and that zipnats are stars.\n \n Realize that -- given this discrepancy -- it is quite possible that the debate will consist of two not opposing but completely disjointed viewpoints. In reality, there will likely be at least some common ground between disagreeing participants, but -- especially for the case that spurred my suggestion -- there is a high likelihood that the two arguments will hardly address each other in a manner that is generally expected in formal debates.\n Realize that -- should the above debate take place in two phases (one for definitions and the other for applicable argumentation) -- no fewer than one opponent will be arguing something other than what she expected to debate.\n \n If anybody thinks that the above debate would be fruitful, I'd be shocked.",

   "First, I would like to thank both Marc9000 and Peeling for this interesting, albeit, extensive debate. (I printed out the entire debate and it took 114 pages of paper.)\n \n ...\n \n As a judge, I found the length of the responses to be somewhat excessive. I would, for the future, try to establish word limits for posts and encourage the participants to debate shorter, more concise points. At times, the debate meandered off into unfocused areas that were tangent to the resolution at best. This had a tendency to dilute the salient points that were made. Sometimes, the trees got lost for the forest.\n\n I would like to reintroduce my suggestion for a defined \"scope of the debate\" precisely to prevent this sort of thing. It's bad enough that we didn't actually know what the debate resolution meant, but when spectators (myself included) think that the debate \"meandered\" \"tangent[ially],\" we end up with a lower quality debate than would otherwise be had.\n \n [cross-posted from \"Evolution is Atheistic\" Ringside thread]",
