(or any other offense).\n \n Regardless of the offense, your obligation as a juror is to return a judgement of \"Innocent\", NOT he might be innocent, so let's just lock him up for the rest of his life!\n \n Of course, you could disregard the law, as many jurors do, but you have no definitive say, as a juror, as to the judge's determination for the sentence that will be passed when yuo find someone guilty. The judge may or may not feel the death penaly is warranted.\n \n (It's fascinating how on a site with so many deeply religious Christians, that the death penaly appears to be accepted to exact revenge.)\n \n Personally, I've a big problem with the death penalty, namely that it has been applied to entirely innocent people. I've got a real problem supporting the death penalty as it is permitted to be applied in the U.S., when innocent people have been killed, because 1 innocent person killed by the State, is justification for either abolishing the D.P., or using it, only for cases in which the facts involve mass murder, and their is no question in any rational person's mind (before the trial), that the person chaged was responsible for mass murder. For example, a Hitler, or a Saddam, or an Idi Amin, or a Pal Pot, etc. etc.",

Let me get this straight.. we need less harsh punishments so that they don't shoot-up everybody because they're 'facing 50 years' in prison? LOL! What's your solution? Less time in prison for serious crimes? Or do you mean that we should keep secret potential sentences so that the 'reasonable' criminal doesn't run amok because the mean ol' justice system has a lengthy sentence waiting for him at the conclusion of his crime? \n \n I again point out the simple fact that the majority of those in prison are REPEAT OFFENDERS! So, your solution of 'coddling' criminals simply doesn't work. What we need are harsher sentences including the death penalty. I'm reminded of the Sheriff in AZ that made national headlines when he added Army tents to his prison so that NO ONE would be released early due to over-crowding. I remember a news segment where they interviewed some of the prisoners.. the conclusion? They did not want to come back to his prison! So, at least in this case, prison is a deterrent! In spite of the objections by liberals, like yourself, and the media.. that Sheriff has been re-elected a couple of times since.\n \n Punishment leads to greater crime? :xbanghead LOL!",

I know a guy who is doing 10 yrs for TAX XXXX.\n \n 2 weeks ago, A local guy was sent to jail for a year for violating municipal ordinances. It was his second offense. The first offense involved keeping a non-running vehicle in fornt of his house (it was an AWESOME old vette he was restoring). His second offense, he had the audacity to build a deck behind his house without first getting a permit. \n \n It's a good thing that ANIMAL is off the street!\n \n At one time, people actually could commit a crime, do their time, and then move somewhere else and start over where nobody knew them.

You folks can sleep well tonight knowing that these particualr individuals will not be drving, evading taxes, or building decks tonight! Thanks to your efforts, after they serve their time they will have that black mark with them for the rest of their lives, so they can continue being punished right up until the day they die.\n \n If softies like me ran things, None of those folks would go to jail, as jail would be reserved for actual bad guys. While we had the actual bad guys behind bars, we would try to teach them some skills to make them employable when they get out. Prison records would be sealed upon release, so once they serve their time they can become productive members of society again. \n \n Justice is not the same as punishing the hell out of somebody. I remember several years ago there was a big deal about some American kids who had vandalised a bunch of vehicles in Thailand. They were sentenced to be caned.

If they had been in the united states, they would have been treated MUCH more humanely. They would have had to pay the damages and spend 5 yrs in jail.

   "Agreed, the death penalty should only be introduced when there is either confession or irrefutable evidence.\n \n\n \n The point is, when a crime is committed that warrants the death penalty and there is irrefutable evidence to suggest that the personal being held responsible is guilty, than they should be sentenced to death.\n \n I do not agree with the idea that the death penalty should be effected in a case where there is contention. However, the fundamental flaw in the legal system is that a law is never interpreted how the writer intended. It is only interpreted how the first judge interprets it. I think this is the problem with a legal system based on precendent. Often times, appeals are an attempt to escape punishment through legal loopholes, not questions of guilt. This is what I wish to see done away with.\n \n I am a firm believer in the idea that a human being gives up there right to live if the commit murder (by murder, I mean malicious intent).",

   "@ World traveller\n \n About costs\n \n The cost in executing someone does not lie in the execution process, it lies in the legal process. I might be way off track, but I recall prisoners on death row are allowed many appeals (to minimize the risk of executing innocents) and this is where a death sentance starts to cost money. Alot of money...\n\n \n No, no, no, my friend. You have this all wrong. Yes, the appeal price does add to the total cost of things. But, on average, the original case costs $2.2 more for capital punishments as opposed to life sentences. This, in itself, is enough to already make the death sentence cost more than a life case. Oh, and appeals are payed by the suspect, thus those aren't even included. But, the case itself is payed for the government, thus you are getting ripped off if they are killed. \n \n ~After Death~",

   "Is it worth executing a few innocents to keep capital punishment? How many? 1 in 10, 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000?\n \n Personally, I am in favor of executing kidnappers (or rapists) that kill. There is a point when a person kidnaps (I assume) that they must decide to kill or not. If they don't kill they risk being identified by the victim. \n \n Personally I am more interested in the deterrent effect of capital punishment over the punishment aspect.\n \n Any thoughts?\n\n \n I am in favor of executing anyone that kills another human being...they are like dogs, once they get the taste of blood, you can't trust them anymore. It is just too bad that we are as humane as we are...I say, bring back the \"Old Sparkey\" so they have something to think about during their endless appeals...I don't know, if it was me having to contemplate facing \"Old Sparkey\" - I would want it over with. It is kind of waiting for you Dad to come spank you...the waiting is the worst part. Maybe then we could save some money and shorten the appeals time?",
