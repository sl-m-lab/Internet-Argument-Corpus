   "Aw shucks! He was just a cute little conservative pulling a prank:\n \nJanuary 29, 2010\n Tampering at Landrieu Office Called a 'Stunt'\n .... NEW ORLEANS - The lawyer for one of the four men arrested Monday on charges of interfering with the phones in Senator Mary L. Landrieu's office in New Orleans said the episode was a prank based on what conservative activists have said was a problem getting through to the senator's office during the health care debates.\n \n \"I think it was an allegation or a rumor about Ms. Landrieu's office not dealing with phone calls about health reform,\" said J. Garrison Jordan, the lawyer for Robert Flanagan, the only one of the four men from Louisiana. \n \n .... \"Mr. O'Keefe has a history of trying to embarrass agencies or political entities on camera,\" Mr. Jordan added. \"I think it was just an ill-designed stunt with no intent to commit a crime.\"\n \n The four men were charged by federal authorities with fraudulently entering a federal building for the purpose of \"interfering\" with Ms. Landrieu's phone system, a felony that carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.\n\n Lawyer Calls Phone Tampering at Senator Landrieu's Office a 'Stunt' - NYTimes.com",
