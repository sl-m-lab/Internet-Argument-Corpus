   "  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, just pass more gun laws \n ....\n \n Dave wrote an article yesterday containing the usual slams against those who oppose gun control, including the powerful gun lobby. He complains about the \"scare tactics,\" \"fear,\" \"lies,\" and \"rumors\" used by the NRA. He warns that \"racists across the country are loading up on guns and ammunition like Armageddon is around the corner. Hate groups are gaining record memberships because Obama is black. That should raise some alarm. These nuts are arming themselves in record numbers,\" yet fails to provide any proof this is actually occurring. Then again, he doesn't bother to report the actual evidence that President Obama and his administration really would like to pass more gun control laws, but that pesky Will of the People keeps getting in the way.\n \n After all of that, Dave then goes on to completely discredit himself by believing and regurgitating the lies he's been fed.\n \"I do ask for laws that would restrict sales of M-16s, AK 47s, or Uzi's.\"\n You've had them since 1934.\n \"I don't care what anyone says, hunting with machine guns makes no sense.\"\n The Second Amendment isn't about hunting.\n \"The only use for them, the use for which they were intended, is to kill people. Lots of people, real fast.\"\n Which is why many police SWAT teams have such firearms... so they can go out and kill lots of people, right?\n \"It's no secret that automatic weapons are so easy to buy that American gun dealers supply the Mexican cartels with 90 percent of the weapons they use to terrorize people on both sides of the border.\"\n What's really not a secret is that this particular anti-gun lie has been repeatedly debunked as fiction.\n \n Speaking of fiction, the editors of the Cleveland Plain Dealer have their own brand to sell you.\n \n They have the unmitigated gall to try to claim that statewide preemption of gun laws (meaning most gun laws must be passed by the State legislature not local municipalities) has \"[put] the bang back in gang\".\n \n At the time, Cleveland had enacted laws that required, among other things, that handguns be registered; that prohibited the possession of firearms by minors; and that forbade the sale and possession of assault weapons.\n \n Does anyone really believe that gang members registered their guns? Plus, possession of firearms by minors is already prohibited, and the sale and possession of real assault rifles is illegal except under special circumstances no gang banger could hope to come close to meeting.\n \n To support their argument, they then go on to show that the violent crime rate is down slightly this year as opposed to the year before. That'll show us?\n \n Their next example to support their argument is a thug who committed murder after being released on bond on a prior weapons charge. So, it was the state's gun laws that put this guy away, but he was released by a failing criminal justice system to commit more crimes but it is the state's fault for passing preemption? \n \n The PD's editors make the claim that it is statewide preemption that allowed a convicted felon to buy the gun he used, which is a violation of numerous state and federal laws.. Truly, these editors must possess a dizzying intellect to make that leap.\n \n The fact is, all of these anti-gun arguments don't hold water, and those who support them rely on lies, misinformation, and scare tactics to further their agenda all the while projecting their insecurities upon the opposition and accusing them of using those same tactics. However once you add a little light, the truth can be seen.\n",

   "[Anti-Gun Radical Cass Sunstein Could Ban Hunting\n \n By Gun Owners of America , A No-Compromise Gun Rights Organization - September 08, 2009\n Icoemail3\n Comments(66) | (0)\n Cass-sunstein-250x200_300wide_240high\n Related Articles\n \n * Anti-Gun Cass Sunstein Confirmed - Expect Problems\n * \"Radical\" Cass Sunstein Will Try to Get U.S. to Give Up Meat\n * Keep Anti-Hunting Cass Sunstein Out of the White House\n * Gun Owners Join Opponents of Health Care Reform Bill\n \n Just when you thought the news about the Obama administration couldn't get any worse, gun owners find themselves needing to rally the troops once again.\n \n This time it's the proposed \"Regulatory Czar\" who will be coming to a vote this week in the U.S. Senate.\n \n His name is Cass Sunstein, and he holds some of the kookiest views you will ever hear.\n \n For starters, Sunstein believes in regulating hunting out of existence. He told a Harvard audience in 2007 that \"we ought to ban hunting.\" And in The Rights of Animals: A Very Short Primer (2002), he said:\n \n I think we should go further ... the law should impose further regulation on hunting, scientific experiments, entertainment, and (above all) farming to ensure against unnecessary animal suffering. It is easy to imagine a set of initiatives that would do a great deal here, and indeed European nations have moved in just this direction. There are many possibilities.\n \n If that's all Sunstein believed, he would be dangerous and extreme, but not necessarily kooky. Unfortunately, when you look at WHY he wants to restrict hunting, this is where he goes beyond extreme.\n \n In Sunstein's world, animals should have just as many rights as people ... and they should be able to sue humans in court!\n \n \"We could even grant animals a right to bring suit without insisting that animals are persons, or that they are not property,\" Sunstein said on page 11 of Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions (2004).\n \n Well, that's a relief ... he is at least willing to concede that animals are not persons! But he would still have animals suing humans, apparently, with more enlightened humans representing the cuddly critters.\n \n Imagine returning from a successful hunting trip ... only to find out that you've been subpoenaed for killing your prize. Who knows, maybe Sunstein would have the family of the dead animal serving as witnesses in court!\n \n By the way, if you're wondering what he thinks about the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, you won't be surprised to know that Sunstein is a huge supporter of gun control.\n \n In Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts are Wrong for America (2005), Sunstein says:\n \n Almost all gun control legislation is constitutionally fine.... [O]n the Constitution's text, fundamentalists [that is, gun rights supporters] should not be so confident in their enthusiasm for invalidating gun control legislation.\n \n Hmm, what part of \"shall not be infringed\" does Sunstein not understand?\n \n Imagine the power that Sunstein could have as the Regulatory Czar -- the nickname for the person heading the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the White House.\n \n As the Regulatory Czar, he could bring about changes in the regulations that affect hunting, gun control and farming. In short, he could make your life hell.\n \n Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) objected to his nomination several weeks ago, preventing him from being unanimously confirmed.\n \n That means that the Senate will now need to garner 60 votes to confirm this radical, kooky choice to the OIRA.\n \n No doubt, many of the people our President wants to associate with are radical kooks. First, there was the Rev. Jeremiah Wright ... then there was the self-avowed communist (Van Jones) who was nominated for the Green Jobs Czar ... now, there's an extreme animal rights activist who wants to take away our guns and get Bambi to sue us in court.\n \n It's time to take a STRONG STAND against this radical administration.] \n\n \n And to think:We actually got nut jobs like this in government postions.",
