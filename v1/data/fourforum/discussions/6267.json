   "Women's Equality Day!\n \n On August 26, we celebrate Women's Equality Day in honor of the 85th anniversary of women's suffrage. From 1776 to 1920, it took nearly 150 years for the women of the United States to win the right to vote - a right that was originally denied to us by the \"founding fathers\" of our nation. And women's equality still is not guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. \n \n An even greater injustice is about to be imposed on our sisters in Iraq, and with the support of the Bush administration. The current draft of the new Iraqi constitution states that \"Islam is the official religion of the state and is a basic source of legislation\" and that \"No law can be passed that contradicts the undisputed rules of Islam.\" This is likely to result in religious rule over women's rights in areas of marriage, divorce, custody and inheritance rights. If that is the case, the women of Iraq will be taking a giant step backward. \n \n The Bush administration, in a shameful move, has endorsed this draft constitution. Their earlier commitment to pressing for women's guaranteed constitutional rights appears to be forgotten, or worse, purposely set aside. \n \n Perhaps American Enterprise Institute's Reuel Marc Gerecht let the cat out of the bag when he said on Meet the Press last Sunday: \"I think it's important to remember that in the year 1900, for example, in the United States, it was a democracy then. In 1900, women did not have the right to vote. If Iraqis could develop a democracy that resembled America in the 1900s, I think we'd all be thrilled. I mean, women's social rights are not critical to the evolution of democracy.\"\n \n Contrary to Gerecht's assertions, a guarantee of women's rights is absolutely essential to democracy in Iraq. The women of Iraq must explicitly be guaranteed equality in the new constitution - not as afterthoughts in a bill of rights that may or may not be written at some point in the future. Without a clear statement in this document now, women's human rights will continue to be bargained away. \n \n Eighty-five years ago, the decades of blood, sweat and tears of our feminist foremothers finally came to fruition when they won the vote for all women in this country. As we honor this victory, we call on the Bush administration to support Constitutional equality for U.S. women and to withdraw its support from any Iraq constitution that erodes rather than expands Iraqi women's rights and freedoms. \n \n The National Organization FOR Women",

   "http://www.vday.org/contents/vcampaigns/spotlight/iraq\n \n Since the US occupation and regime change in Iraq, women have lost more freedom than they've gained.\n \n Incidents of rape and abduction by organized gangs has increased fear of sexual violence in Baghdad, deterring women from returning to work or seeking employment and families from permitting their daughters to go to school. Victims refrain from contacting the police or hospitals, for fear of being killed for bringing shame on family honor. Armed conservative religious groups are pressuring schools and workplaces to require women and girls to wear the veil under threat of acid attack or abduction. Girls enrollment and attendance is on a steep dive across the country.\n \n Of the only four women members of Iraq's former Governing Council and interim Cabinet, two faced assassination attempts - Aquila al Hashimi was killed, while Nasreen Mustafa al-Burwari survived though her three bodyguards died. Upon helping the fight against the introduction of Sharia law to replace existing secular family law that protects women's rights, a Kurdish leader of a women's organization in Arbil was attacked by her own brothers. Heeding conservative religious protests, US military indefinitely postponed the swearing-in of the first woman in Najaf to be appointed a judge. Lack of jobs and security for women in general has forced some to resort to prostitution, at grave risk of an honor killing.\n \n Even under these conditions there are a few beacons of change and hope. Several Iraqi women's organizations are braving the hostile climate and death threats to demand women's representation in public bodies and are working to protect women's lives in private, helping shield them from honor killings.\n \n With your help, we anticipate that our 2005 Spotlight: Women of Iraq, Under Siege will help effect real change in the violent conditions for women and girls in that city.\n \n For additional information on the current status of women in Iraq, visit:\n \n Background on The Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI)\n \n http://www.vday.org/contents/vcampaigns/spotlight/iraq/owfi",

   "http://www.actionla.org/Iraq/IraqReport/women.html\n \n Another negative impact of the US-UK invasion has been to put women's rights in danger in the \"new\" Iraq.\n On May 22 around 4:00 P.M. at Baghdad, nine-year-old girl \"saba\", was adducted from the stairs of the building where she lives, taken to an abandoned building nearby, and raped...\" \n (Human Rights Watch Report: Climate of Fear, July 2003)\n \n According to a Human Rights Watch report Climate of Fear published in July 2003, as a result of the invasion, women and girls face increased sexual violence and abduction, which was almost unheard of during Saddam Hussein's regime. \n \n Elizabeth Hodgkin is Research Coordinator for Amnesty International in Baghdad. She says the violence against women and girls has created a state of fear, preventing them from being more active in the society. \"It's certain women feel that now [after April], it is less safe for them on the street. There's been more killing; women feel more danger going back and forth from work and school, and participating in activities. Some girls have been withdrawn from school because their parents think it's unsafe in the streets,\" Hodgkin explains.\n \n An accurate count of women and girls victimized by sexual violence is very difficult to ascertain since many do not report such cases or even seek medical attention, according to Human Rights Watch. While the U.S. troika - its occupying forces, the Coalition Provisional Authorities (CPA) it runs, and its de facto government in Iraq - is busy securing Iraq's natural resources and hunting Saddam Hussein, the public security vacuum in Baghdad has heightened the vulnerability of women and girls to sexual violence and abduction.\n \n According to Hodgkin, there has been an acute rise in \"honor killings\" and domestic violence, once suppressed during the past regime, since the U.S. occupied Iraq last April. A woman becomes the victim of an \"honor killing\" when her family feels she has damaged their reputation by having sex with a man, or even just by going out with him. This dishonor \"entitles\" a male member of her family to \"justifiably\" murder her. \"These crimes often go unreported, and even when they are reported, police rarely take any action. So a woman's life is expendable,\" Hodgkin explains.\n \n According to an Amnesty International investigation, there have been many \"honor killings\" in Iraq, the vast majority of which are unreported. There have been no investigations of the people alleged to have carried out these murders. Police have made no arrests. Hodgkin explains further, \"If you do find a situation where a woman may have been raped, no matter what the circumstances, she runs the risk of being murdered by a male relative if she admits the incident to a family member. So if you think there's a possibility that a woman has been raped, you'd never go to her family to investigate the crime for fear of putting her in more danger.\"\n \n However, Hodgkin still remains optimistic about the role of women in the post-Saddam era. She says since April, there's been great boost of activity from all sectors in Iraqi society, including the formation of many civic and human rights organizations. Although women are underrepresented in these groups, Hodgkin reports there are organizations surfacing that have been formed by women and are run by women. \"I think there is great hope for women's activism in the future. I think this is a period of transition, this is a period of change; [but] women are still unable to take their rightful position in the society.\"\n \n It's not very difficult to see male-domination in Iraq, even though it's considered one of the most socially open secular countries in the region. When I interviewed people on the street, males always dominated the speech, and women always stood aside.\n \n The rise of the Shi'ites in southern Iraq is affecting women's rights in the post-invasion period. Many worry that replacing Saddam's secular government with a fundamentalist Islamic government will undermine women's rights in the future Iraq. Hodgkin believes there must be positive efforts in every area to ensure that women do have positive positions. She says, for instance, in the Iraqi Interim Governing Council that was established in July, of the 25 members on the Council, only three are woman. Hodgkin believes there must be stronger efforts made to ensure the rights and the equality of women in the future constitution and governing body of Iraq.",
