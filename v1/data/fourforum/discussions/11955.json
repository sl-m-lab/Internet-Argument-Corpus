Supporters had raised at least $28.2 million; opponents had taken in $32.3 million, closing a fundraising gap that had them $8 million behind a month ago.\n \n The figures for each side are actually higher because small cash donations made since Sept. 30 had not yet been reported. $60M Spent For, Against Calif. Gay Marriage Ban - TIME\n \n So as you sob like a victim of christian tyranny as you accuse them of throwing their personal wealth at this issue, remember that your side spent even more. Didn't Brad Pitt just donate a hundred thousand dollars 1 or 2 weeks before the election? And I heard about other hollywood elites donating to their pet cause. So don't cry about being outspent because your side spent more than the opposition did.\n \n And talk about lies and propaganda. The homosexual activist community is expert at demonizing people.And they don't mind how evil they make them look doing it, as this video clearly shows. And I dare you to tell me this is a cheaply made ad created in someones basement with i-movie software like I have on my macbook.

The reason for this is because no parishioner is obligated to give or support any particular cause being collected for so only those who agree with and support a cause are giving to it. Get it?\n \n What churches CAN'T DO is tell its parishioners how to vote on issues, or which candidates they must vote for as the so called Godly choice. Nor can they tell them they must donate money to a certain issue in order to remain in Gods will as that is coercion. But allowing people in a church to donate money to a particular social cause which affects them directly is perfectly legal. And the evidence of that is that none of the churches which raised money and donated it to fight Prop 8 have lost their tax exemption in spite of the many lawsuits and accusations of foul play by the homosexual groups who have gone after them.",
