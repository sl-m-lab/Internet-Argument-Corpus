   "Yet another example of this administration's cronyism and disregard for other branches of government.\n \n Bush also says he won't rule out eventually giving him a full pardon.\n \n And yes Steeeeve, I know he was within his power. This isn't a discussion of constitutionality.\n \n THis is just the first page, there is more if you want to read it.\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/03/AR2007070300981.html?hpid=topnews\nBush Commutes Libby Sentence, but Conviction Stands\n \n By Amy Goldstein\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Tuesday, July 3, 2007; 11:58 AM\n \n President Bush commuted the sentence of I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby yesterday, sparing Vice President Cheney's former chief of staff 2 1/2 years in prison after a federal appeals court had refused to let Libby remain free while he appeals his conviction for lying to federal investigators.\n \n Bush, who for months had sidestepped calls from conservatives to come to Libby's aid, broke his silence early yesterday evening, touching off an immediate uproar from Democrats who accused the White House of circumventing the rule of law to protect one of its own.\n \n The president announced his decision in a written statement that laid out the factors he had weighed. Bush said he decided to \"respect\" the jury's verdict that Libby was guilty of four felonies for lying about his role in the leak of a covert CIA officer's identity. But the president said Libby's \"exceptional public service\" and prior lack of a criminal record led him to conclude that the 30-month sentence handed down by a judge last month was \"excessive.\"\n \n \"He did not see fit to have Scooter Libby taken to jail,\" White House press secretary Tony Snow said this morning in a news briefing.\n \n Bush noted in his statement that he had originally promised not to intervene until Libby had exhausted his appeals. But he stepped in short of that point. \"With the denial of bail being upheld and incarceration imminent,\" Bush said, \"I believe it is now important to react to that decision.\"\n \n Although he eliminated Libby's prison term, Bush did not grant him a full pardon, which was sought by some conservatives and would have erased his conviction. As a consequence, Libby will still have to pay a $250,000 fine and will remain on probation for two years. The president said Libby's punishment remained \"harsh,\" in part because his professional reputation \"is forever damaged.\"\n \n \"This is hardly a slap on the wrist,\" Snow said. \" . . . To think of this as the bestowal of a favor is to utterly misconstrue the nature of the deliberations.\"\n \n Bush commuted the sentence hours after a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected Libby's request to postpone his prison term while he pursued appeals. The panel concluded that his grounds for appeal were unlikely to be strong enough to prevail in higher courts.\n \n The appellate judges' unanimous opinion upheld an identical ruling slightly more than two weeks ago by U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton, the trial judge in Libby's case. After a month-long trial that forced presidential aides and prominent journalists onto the witness stand, Libby was found guilty of two counts of perjury and one count each of lying to FBI agents and obstructing a federal investigation into whether administration officials illegally disclosed the name of CIA officer Valerie Plame.\n \n Bush has granted far fewer pardons and commutations than any of his predecessors, dating to John F. Kennedy. He commuted three previous prison terms during his 6 1/2 years in office.\n \n At a time when his popularity is as low as any president's in modern history, Bush's action also defied public opinion. Shortly after Libby was convicted in March, three national public opinion polls found that seven in 10 Americans said they would oppose a pardon of Libby.\n \n Still, the president appeared to calculate that he would antagonize his conservative base too severely if he did not provide Libby some form of reprieve, according to people close to the White House.\n",

And by neutered I mean castrated.\n\n \n Exactly, it wasn't a Pardon but a commutation of the sentence, and their is a big difference. Maybe this will add some balance to the criticism Bush is receiving. An excerpt of the article. \n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=21489\n \n Clinton's unpardonable final act\n Posted: January 26, 2001\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n One of Bill Clinton's most reprehensible acts occurred just hours before he vacated the White House. Under the cover of darkness, Bill cut a deal with a special prosecutor to keep from going to prison. Then he gave pardons to really bad people.\n \n The press is starting to look into the 140 pardons that Clinton issued. They don't like what they are finding. However, because Clinton was still the president when he again violated his oath of office, we can do nothing except expose him for the venal man that he is.\n \n The best explanation of how bad Clinton's pardon's are appeared in Wednesday's Austin American-Statesman. This is a left-of-center newspaper, but what Clinton did sickened them. Here are excerpts from its editorial entitled \"Clinton's parting shots at criminal justice system.\" The \"editorial\" comments about their editorial are mine.\n \n Shortly after negotiating his own plea bargain for lying under oath, Bill Clinton again thumbed his nose at the criminal justice system by issuing pardons on inaugural morning for 140 charged with or convicted of crimes.\n In his last major act in office, Clinton handed out pardons like party favors. His first housing secretary, Henry Cisneros, got one, as did Cisneros' one-time paramour, Linda Medlar Jones.\n \n Cisneros and Jones had an affair when both of them were married to other people. Cisneros was San Antonio's Mayor and Jones was one of his campaign workers. They convicted Cisneros of lying to the FBI and the U.S. Senate during his confirmation hearings. They convicted Jones of participating in a cover-up with Cisneros. For Bill Clinton, lying to the U.S. Senate is a \"pardonable\" offense. Now, Henry Cisneros, no longer a convicted criminal, is plotting his return to politics.\n \n Susan McDougal, who spent months in jail for refusing to tattle on Clinton in the Whitewater investigation, got one. So did half-brother Roger Clinton, convicted of a cocaine charge in 1985.\n This deal gives us a sense of Bill Clinton's third-world despot morals. You don't squeal on me, and I'll beat the system. You get convicted of a drug offense, and I'll let you off the hook, little brother. But wait, it gets worse:\n \n Also pardoned were Austinite Ruben Johnson, convicted of bank fraud and former Austin radical Linda Sue Evans. Johnson was convicted of taking kickbacks from contractors working on a downtown bank building. He has not paid the $4,600,000 in restitution ordered by the court and owes $1,000,000 more in a civil suit settlement.\n Johnson extorted money and got caught. They convicted him, sent him to prison and told him to pay restitution. They sued him in civil court, and he lost, but Johnson hasn't paid a dime. In fact, he has used a homestead exemption to live in a mansion worth more than a million dollars while paying senior citizen taxes. According to Bill Clinton, this is a man who has \"earned\" a presidential pardon.\n \n But the pardon that truly reeks is the one granted fugitive financier Marc Rich. Charged in what was at the time the largest tax-evasion scheme in U.S. history, Rich fled to Switzerland. Rich was indicted on 51 counts of wire fraud, racketeering and evading $48,000,000 in taxes. He was also accused of trading with the enemy by illegally dealing Iranian oil when that country still held American Embassy hostages.\n Rich's pardon came with an odor. His ex-wife, Denise Rich, was a major contributor to Hillary Rodham Clinton's senate campaign and donated more than $200,000 to the Democratic National Committee. News reports say that Denise Rich and Marc Rich's Washington attorney, Jack Quinn, sought the pardon. Quinn had served as Clinton's White House counsel.\n \n Marc Rich is a tax-evading multi-billionaire fugitive who fled America in 1983. When you add interest and penalties, he owes the U.S. over $600,000,000 in taxes, penalties and fines. His Swiss companies generate more than $30,000,000,000 in revenue each year.\n \n Like Ruben Johnson, Marc Rich has never paid what he owes America. Now he can return to the U.S. and thumb his nose at those of us who struggle to pay our bills, feed our children and pay our taxes. Because according to Bill's rules, if you give Bill's wife and the DNC $867,000 and use Al Gore's chief of staff as your attorney, you can buy a pardon.",

   "Then get mad about the action you claim Libby did and not mad at the \"perjury\" charge. The two issues are different and as far as I know Libby was not convicted with anything else just like Clinton. \n \n I'm not sure Libby's punishment was too harsh but certainly did seem like a witch hunt like it did when Clinton had his issues. \n \n Those two issues seem fairly insignificant when we have so many other important issues yet they both sucked up the entire government for such a long time. Perhaps Bush should have just pardoned him at the beginning and that would have ended that. Clinton didn't have that luxury.\n\n I wouldn't place so little significance on the whole issue of Valerie Plame's identity being leaked. It is quite significant since it shows that people who stand up to the administration to try to tell the truth (Wilson) can be punished (his wife's identity being leaked). The claims about Iraq's search for nuclear material that Wilson blew the whistle on were one of the main pieces of \"evidence\" used to convince the public to go to war with Iraq. That is significant.\n \n Are you claiming that the adminstration did not disclose Valerie Plame's CIA identity on purpose and that Libby is innocent of any wrongdoing on that point? I would agree with most that Libby is more of a \"fall guy\" and that the obstruction of justice and perjury charges are a way to pin something on him when the main charge is too hard to prove. However, he is certainly not innocent. I would certainly prefer to see Carl Rove in this scenario instead of Libby, but we will take whatever justice we can have.\n \n The reason that people are upset with this is that, once again, the adminstration is trying to escape accountability for its actions. It is sending a message to those loyal to its purposes that they can go ahead and use underhanded tactics to silence opposition and, even if they are caught and indicted, they will be pardoned so they don't need to worry about justice.",

   "The thing that they were lying about is what makes the biggest difference in how it is perceived. Libby was lying about an illegal action that directly affects the objective functioning of our government. He may have been the \"fall guy\" for the administration and, from that point of view and only from that point of view, I have some sympathy for the guy. However, he was trying to wiggle his way ou to an illegal act. \n \n What Clinton lied about was not illegal. He had every legal right to have a relationship with Monica Lewinsky, who was very openly having this relationship - it was not sexual harrassment. His actions were immoral, but NOT illegal. Also, they had no direct effect on the functioning of the government. The only reason we, the people, could even consider it our business is because politicians win votes by portraying themselves as upstanding moral citizens. If that portrayal is a false one, we have the right to know. So, though I also criticize Clinton for his lack of judgement in the Monica situation, comparing Clinton to Libby is comparing apples to oranges - an ill advised immoral but legal act that has no affect on government, to one (Libby) which was illegal and affects all of us by the fear it instills in opponents of government practice.\n\n \n \n YES, in many, MANY cases, having a sexual relationship with someone who has 'authority' over you is illegal. \n Consent has little to do with it.",

Should he have been \"let off the hook\" on the tax evasion charge because tax evasion itself wasn't so bad?\n \n Libby was indicted for perjury and obstruction of justice since those were the lesser crimes that were provable. He should serve his sentence for those crimes. There is no reason to withdraw his punishment other than Bush wanting to protect his loyalists so that they do not have to fear or face justice.

In fact, he knew that no one in the White House was the source of the leak.\n\n \n Unfortunatly, we do not know these things. We know that Armitage leaked Plames name to Novak. We also know that several journalists had already been given the name (and NOT by armitage) prior to Armitage giving it to Novak. \n \n We also don't know how Armitage ended up with the information. Armitage was not even sure where he heard it, only that it was something that was \"going around\". When asked, he could not name even a single analyst at the CIA, which woudl tend to indicate that it was not information that he generally possesed. It was fairly clear that what had happened at the white hosue was that somebody (probably Cheney) DID decide to leak Plames identity in an effort to paint Wilsons fact finding trip as tainted. It is fairly clear that he had Plames identity passed around in hopes that the media would pick it up. When it wasn't picked up by the media, Libby leaked it directly.\n \n What the prosecutor was trying to establish was WHO in the white house made the decision to start circulating their identity and WHO had Libby leak it directly (he DID admit that he was directed to discuss it with reporters). \n \n While Bushs militant ultra liberal base has been trying desperatly to convince people that the case started and ended with Armitage, that shows a complete disconnect from reality and frankly to have any hope of working counts on the public having a grasp on the facts that is so slim that the fact that they believed they could pull this off is frankly insulting. Fortunatly (for the militant ultra liberals) the American public has shown their usual inability to grasp facts or draw logical conclusions, or ask resonable questions (like...if there was nothing to hide, why would Libby have lied, when he was FULLY aware of the consequences). \n \n \nBut I guess we need not let facts get in the way when we want to bash George W. I suppose we need not be consistent in our reasoning.\n\n \n While it may be questionable whether anybody is ever actually consistent in their reasoning, we shoudl not ignore the facts, and we should apply SOME reasoning. Libby is a smart man...he knew what the score was. Even when it came down to the wire and he knew he was going to jail, he had the option of telling the truth and making it all go away. He refused even then. And the apologists would have us believe he had nothing to hide. You would have to be an idiot to buy that. Luckily there seem to be plenty of XXXXXX in the American public.",
