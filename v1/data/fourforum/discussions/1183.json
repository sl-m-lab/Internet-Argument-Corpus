If so, which one?\n\n \n \n SirGladius\n The reason for so many different versions of scripture, is due to private interpretation with no one athority but there own personal beliefs not hearing the one pillar of truth has scripture states.\n \n Also many claim that there is not one Church on athority on truth but the bible alone,so who did Christ leave to interpret the truth, the Church , for 1050 years the people heard the church before the first division came along.\n The people heard the Church because they had no bible but the church alone, so now everyone can get one and spread there own beliefs not hearing the mainstream of truth who keep watch over are souls has scripture claims also.\n \n Has for the bible, the Catholic church bible is the one, for the k.J bible has many mistakes and alot of Protestant people are finding it this out do to word change in verses that creates different interpretations also.\n \n Peace Drac",
