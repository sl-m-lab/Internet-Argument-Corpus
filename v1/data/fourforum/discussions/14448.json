   "\n Pelosi: Unemployment Benefits Biggest Stimulus for Economy | The Foundry: Conservative Policy News.\n \n Let me say that unemployment insurance&#8230; is one of the biggest stimuluses (sic) to our economy. Economists will tell you, this money is spent quickly. It injects demand into the economy, and it&#8217;s job creating. It creates jobs faster than almost any other initiative you can name.\n \n\n \n Huh? What is this woman smoking? What's next? Will she be saying we should lower the cost of alcohol to discourage drinking? Maybe we should get rid of sex education to encourage use of condoms?\n \n I'm still wondering who these \"economists\" are. And I can't help but wonder if these \"economists\" got their degree from a cracker jack box or something.",

Then the train buffs get mad because they think we need a train to go from DC to LA because it is historical. Then you have liberals who think Amtrak is the best run organization. Wouldn't you know it, all three are mor0ns. Just get some intelligent people together and figure out what tracks are needed for commercial traffic and what is needed for passenger. Then build tracks for each. You'll end up not building a maglev train between Orlando and Tampa but probably would build one between DC and New York. You also will find that building a train track for Norfolk Southern might actually encourage a business to stay instead of shipping operations to China and paying to ship it here via boat which takes upwards of 2-4 weeks (at a really high cost). \n \n I could go on but basically our government should be doing exactly what it says in the constitution \"promote the general welfare\". GENERAL as in not try to manipulate everything which is what they end up doing with extending unemployment benefits or making crazy tax rules to benefit some and not others.\n \n Ok...this post is all over the place, oh well, I'm on vacation emoticon_cool",

We have been neglecting the hell out of it and hoping blindly that the free market will take care of it, despite the fact that the free markets record when it comes to infrastructure is pretty much non existent.\n \n While a big infrastructure program may take years to complete, an immediate economic impact could be produced simply by pre-bidding portions of the contract. Going to fix the rail system? Take and award bids on a couple hundred thousand miles of track. The bidders will be able to use their awards to obtain funding to ramp up the facilities they need. This would also help small business/startups because one of the major hurdles to small businesses/startups bidding on government acquisition contracts is that they can not ramp up production fast enough to meet the contract deadlines.

Phone companies are a good example. The installation of our phone network was heavily subsidized (90+%). Phone companies were given outrageous powers (right of way, right to condemn land, imminent domain rubber stamp) and were essentially organized as monopolies by the government to insure their survival.

Yes, there is some stimulous from putting money in people's pockets, but you get a much greater multiplier effect from e.g. house building.

In fact, according to Mark Zandi, the only thing with a better multiplier than welfare checks is welfare food stamps.\n \n The size of the multiplier, fundamentally, depends on what proportion of and how quickly the recipient spends the money, and so on for the second recipient down the line. And frankly, the destitute are more likely to spend every last penny as quick as they can than construction managers.\n \n So I'm not sure where, even if you believe in the voodoo of multipliers, you get the idea that infrastructure, or \"social housing\" rates \"vastly higher\" than handouts.

   "Well it's stimulus by the definition of e.g. Ben Bernanke, and most of the people running the circus. And it's stimulus by the classic Keynesian definition, where whenever government expenditure exceeds revenue, fiscal policy is considered expansionary. The key thing in Keynesian macroeconomics is the \"aggregate\", not the particular direction the money is spent in. Shovelling horse manure onto works of art or bombing Pakistan is just as suitable as constructing a railway in this view.\n\n \n No, its not. Bernanke repeatedly referenced infrastructure projects when they originally started talking stimulus. Pelosi repeatedly talked about \"shovel ready\" interstate projects that would provide stimulus. To give her credit, she also talked about the government getting more involved in internet infrastructure and job creation there.\n \n These people KNOW the difference between actual stimulus and throwing money around like XXXXXX. They also know vote buying, which is what they ended up doing with the \"stimulus\" money.\n \n The american taxpayer, sadly, is not smart enough to tell the difference. \n \n \n \n \nI'm in favour of a strategic default by the American taxpayer. There is a point where you have amassed so much debt that you are better off that way, even if it means squatting in your ill-gotten mcmansion until the law kicks you out. And America is way past that point.\n\n \n I dont necessarily disagree, but you must be using some definition of the term \"strategic\" that I am not familiar with. Part of a \"strategic\" default is ensuring that AFTER the default you have the resources in place to start rebuilding. That means doing infrastructure BEFORE you turn your back on your creditors.",

   "I agree with you & wonder why there aren't more people who recognize? A dose of reality might help what ails.\n \n & we've already seen these tactics used in other countries in recent history, where public money was used to fund private profit machines for the select (& few). The economic 'strategists' have become a bit more brazen, tactics 'tolerated' in other countries - however now they're bringing it all back home to these precariously United States (divide & conquer y'remember?). \n \n These shock & awe tactics, along with the sleazy privatization schemes resulted in the 'outsourcing' of government services to a select group of investors & corporations. Look at what happened in Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, China, South Africa, Poland, Russia, UK (Falklands War) & so on & continues to the present day much like some sortof surreal game of musical chairs or a 'White Sale' for private investors only.\n \n Who benefits?\n \n The people can eat cake!\n\n \n I think it is one part marketing and one part laziness on the part of the voters.

You see it all the time. Throw some empty rhetoric at most Americans and they are just thrilled to death.\n\n \n Yup - agree.\n \n I think it's also about the recent times. The United States is a relatively young country. When I was a young kid in school I was taught the United States was the 'great experiment.' I found that concept to be very exciting. I still do. \n \n The whole world has changed since the United States' inception. When one considers the context of the problems the United States currently faces, one would necessarily have to consider the facts & circumstances of the whole world & all the people in it. We are all interconnected & not just from an economic point of view. Even so, just to consider the economic part is difficult. However, I believe it can be approached. & that's NOT to say, there is a perfect solution. It's a mistake to assume we have the choice between a perfect solution to a particular problem & one that is, however imperfect, based in reality (also known as the Nirvana fallacy). \n \n \nThe Nirvana fallacy is the logical error of comparing actual things with unrealistic, idealized alternatives. It can also refer to the tendency to assume that there is a perfect solution to a particular problem.\n \n By creating a false dichotomy that presents one choice which is obviously advantageous-while at the same time being completely implausible-a person using the nirvana fallacy can attack any opposing idea because it is imperfect. The choice is not between real world solutions and utopia; it is, rather, a choice between one realistic possibility and another which is merely better. \n\n \n When the 'empty rhetoric is thrown' (I like your wording on that!) there are people who seemed to be convinced (conned into believing) that there IS some sortof Nirvanic solution. & that creates false dichotomies galore. \n \n Leading to inertia.",

   "Yup! I agree emoticon_xagreeemoticon_xagreeemoticon_xagree\n \n False dichotomies when faced with shifts in the present paradigm split in two-- although not necessarily in a symmetrical fashion. Asymmetrical splits of the prevalent dichotomy are one of the many pluralistic causes of the well documented failures of Nirvana kind of solution to existential conundrums such as those proposed by Jean Paul Sartre and discarded by Albert Camus who found the Christian-Humanistic credo more relevant to life than the nihilistic Marxism of his fellow postmodern French intellectuals.\n \n The application of deconstructive techniques not only to literature but also to the socio-economic problems facing the USA is something that we ought to consider after the constant failure of macro-capitalism as demonstrated by the great depression (what was so great about it?) and recently the crash of the housing bubble.\n \n A holistic approach to the above mentioned socio-economic problems encompassing dichotomies and trade dialectics must be considered in Toto and not in isolation for no country is an island, and not even our young experimental country is immune to the laws of inertia.\n \n emoticon_xclownemoticon_xclownemoticon_xclown\n\n \n Nice try Winston! Were you perhaps making a (lame-XXX) attempt at being included as a 6th passage in Politics and the English Language?\n \n \nGeorge Orwell, \"Politics and the English Language,\" 1946 \n \n Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language -- so the argument runs -- must inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes. \n \n Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence of this or that individual writer. But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible. Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration: so that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional writers. I will come back to this presently, and I hope that by that time the meaning of what I have said here will have become clearer. Meanwhile, here are five specimens of the English language as it is now habitually written. \n \n These five passages have not been picked out because they are especially bad -- I could have quoted far worse if I had chosen -- but because they illustrate various of the mental vices from which we now suffer. They are a little below the average, but are fairly representative examples. I number them so that i can refer back to them when necessary: \n \n 1. I am not, indeed, sure whether it is not true to say that the Milton who once seemed not unlike a seventeenth-century Shelley had not become, out of an experience ever more bitter in each year, more alien [sic] to the founder of that Jesuit sect which nothing could induce him to tolerate. \n \n Professor Harold Laski (Essay in Freedom of Expression)\n \n 2. Above all, we cannot play ducks and drakes with a native battery of idioms which prescribes egregious collocations of vocables as the Basic put up with for tolerate, or put at a loss for bewilder . \n \n Professor Lancelot Hogben (Interglossa)\n \n 3. On the one side we have the free personality: by definition it is not neurotic, for it has neither conflict nor dream. Its desires, such as they are, are transparent, for they are just what institutional approval keeps in the forefront of consciousness; another institutional pattern would alter their number and intensity; there is little in them that is natural, irreducible, or culturally dangerous. But on the other side, the social bond itself is nothing but the mutual reflection of these self-secure integrities. Recall the definition of love. Is not this the very picture of a small academic? Where is there a place in this hall of mirrors for either personality or fraternity? \n \n Essay on psychology in Politics (New York)\n \n 4. All the \"best people\" from the gentlemen's clubs, and all the frantic fascist captains, united in common hatred of Socialism and bestial horror at the rising tide of the mass revolutionary movement, have turned to acts of provocation, to foul incendiarism, to medieval legends of poisoned wells, to legalize their own destruction of proletarian organizations, and rouse the agitated petty-bourgeoise to chauvinistic fervor on behalf of the fight against the revolutionary way out of the crisis. \n \n Communist pamphlet\n \n 5. If a new spirit is to be infused into this old country, there is one thorny and contentious reform which must be tackled, and that is the humanization and galvanization of the B.B.C. Timidity here will bespeak canker and atrophy of the soul. The heart of Britain may be sound and of strong beat, for instance, but the British lion's roar at present is like that of Bottom in Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream -- as gentle as any sucking dove. A virile new Britain cannot continue indefinitely to be traduced in the eyes or rather ears, of the world by the effete languors of Langham Place, brazenly masquerading as \"standard English.\" When the Voice of Britain is heard at nine o'clock, better far and infinitely less ludicrous to hear aitches honestly dropped than the present priggish, inflated, inhibited, school-ma'amish arch braying of blameless bashful mewing maidens! \n \n Letter in Tribune\n \n Each of these passages has faults of its own, but, quite apart from avoidable ugliness, two qualities are common to all of them. The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not. This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated henhouse. I list below, with notes and examples, various of the tricks by means of which the work of prose construction is habitually dodged:\n ... \n George Orwell, \"Politics and the English Language,\" 1946\n\n \n oh & bitheway Winston? Do you actually need to be goaded into doing creative original thinking by being spanked? (as demonstrated by the above)\n \n Are you that much of an attention whore?\n \n I don't like to play that way - it's not fun for me, it's like pulling teeth.\n emoticon_xbye",

   "I agree that we should be constantly improving infrastructure. Mark my words, the day will come that the baby boomers are known as the \"rape pillage and burn generation\". They got theirs, screw their descendants. \nAt least they admit it. I'm not a part of that generation so I don't take any blame. \n \n \nHowever, we have NOT been constantly improving it. We have been neglecting the hell out of it and hoping blindly that the free market will take care of it, despite the fact that the free markets record when it comes to infrastructure is pretty much non existent.\nAnd rightfully so. It is expensive and really not part of the mission for any company. If companies built roads we'd have very few road systems and they would be barely drivable. Infrastructure is just not a profitable business which is why it has always been a government function. \n \n \n \nWhile a big infrastructure program may take years to complete, an immediate economic impact could be produced simply by pre-bidding portions of the contract. Going to fix the rail system? Take and award bids on a couple hundred thousand miles of track. The bidders will be able to use their awards to obtain funding to ramp up the facilities they need. This would also help small business/startups because one of the major hurdles to small businesses/startups bidding on government acquisition contracts is that they can not ramp up production fast enough to meet the contract deadlines. Bid 2000 miles of track 2 years out and you have time to build a factory if you have to, and the bank would be happy to finance it as long as you are holding that award in your hand.\n Well, we have no money to do this anyway. I still don't think it would stimulate the economy in a big way on an immediate basis. The impact of infrastructure is really the business that comes in once it is there. A Dell call center in India is hard to build when you have to pipe in the water yourself, teach everyone English, build a road to the building, etc. Granted it is cheaper there but with it already here that makes some people come or stay here. The salary problem is another issue though.\n \n \nHere is an idea. Do away with Amtrak, point out to the major carriers (basically UP and BNSF now) that the land grants that made their railroads possible included a requirement that they carry passenger traffic, and make them do it.\nAnother idea I've considered (but don't know if it is possible) is to have the tracks publicly owned like every other transportation system. Public builds the roads but doesn't own the cars. Public builds the airport but doesn't own the plane. Most of Amtrak is the public owning the train and does not own the track (CSX, for example, owns most of the track where I am). Again, this might not really work...I haven't studied it much but it's an idea.\n \n \nWe have a real problem in this country with creating major infrastructure using tax dollars and then turning it over to private companies, then everybody promptly forgets where they came from. Phone companies are a good example. The installation of our phone network was heavily subsidized (90+%). Phone companies were given outrageous powers (right of way, right to condemn land, imminent domain rubber stamp) and were essentially organized as monopolies by the government to insure their survival. Then you tell these companies, which only exist because uncle sam bankrolled them and took legislative steps to assure their survival and tell them that the government expects them to keep us on the cutting edge of connectivity, then they start screaming \"FREE MARKET\".\nYeah, this is harder than it sounds though. Public/Private doesn't work out great. Most of the time you end up with the private ripping off the public and providing a terrible service. It's a tough thing to figure out.",
