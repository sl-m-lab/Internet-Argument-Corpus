   "1. First question, Is a clone human...in other words does a clone have feelings?...does \"it\" have a WILL of its own?...most importantly does \"it\" have soul...or even a spirit.\n \n Now before you answer, don't go off on me saying, \"How can we tell? We have never cloned a human.\"\n \n 2nd. Why do some of us wish to allow cloning? For wars in Iraq...for medical purposes...or human reproduction?\n \n 3rd. What is a Biblical stand point from your knowledge? Or better yet what is you Opinion?\n \n I believe that Cloning is fine for movies, but NOT for everyday. To \"make\"/clone a human is to play God. In the movie Jurassic Park 3 the mother of the lost son asks the guide, is this where you make dinosaurs?\n \"No\",he says,\"this is where you play God.\"\n That is what I believe, that if we clone humans we are playing God.",

   "Clones are just younger identical twins. They would not have the same personality. They aren't zombies, they are real people that are genetically identical to someone else. \n \n Most people have this idea that clones are produced in machines, which we all know is silly, but the majority of the public is uninformed. \n \n You could not make clones just for organs or for a life of manual labor. It's like cutting up your children for organs.\n \n Why do people even want to have clones? Many clones have very, very bad health. It is expensive, too. All cloning is is taking an egg, injecting a person's genetic code into it, and then placing it back into a woman to grow. I see no advantages in that. \n \n Cloning isn't playing God, genetic enginerring is playing God. What horrible things we come of that? Things so smart and strong that we will not be able to control them. Human life should not be a science experiment.",
