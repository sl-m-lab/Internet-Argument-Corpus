   "What a pleasure to see a bright, articulate, organized and forward-thinking man as the leader of our country, but President Obama has inherited a daunting set of problems from the Bush administration and his Republican-dominated Congress.\n \n The threat of Al-Qa-da in Afghanistan was never eliminated and has now spread to neighboring nuclear armed Pakistan.\n \n The ill-begotten Iraq war has resulted in 4,200 U.S. causalities, trillions of dollars added to our national debt and the ascension of Iran into a major Middle-Eastern power.\n \n Failure to regulate the housing and banking industries has placed all of the major world economies in a recessionary spiral.\n \n Failure to account for the cost of the wars and tax cuts for the wealthy has resulted in a doubling of the national debt to $10 trillion.\n \n Faced with all of this, Obama entered the office running. During lesser recessions, stimulation for the economy could be obtained by lowering interest rates - but that already had been taken to essentially zero by Bush before he left office. Thus the options that remain are to do nothing or to invoke government spending to make up for private spending, which has essentially dried up. The do-nothing policy seems to be the strategy of the Republicans, to the extent that they have a strategy. Its only likely positive outcome would be to return the troops from Iraq so that they can control the anarchy that would ensue if half the nation were unemployed.\n \n The option that the president has taken is to introduce heavy government spending, similar to some of the Keynesian economic policies that FDR did to address the Great Depression.\n \n The spending option has the added positive effect of fixing the deteriorating infrastructure of our nation and moving toward a greener, more progressive economy.\n \n Unfortunately, the Democrats, even with a significant legislative majority, do not have enough members in the Senate to override the Republicans' opportunity to filibuster and kill his plans.\n \n With no plans of their own, the Republican Congressional members continue to espouse the worn out Reagan mantra of lowering taxes and deregulation - which of course is the genesis for the problems that we face today. It is time for the Republican Party to place the needs of our country ahead of their own political aspirations and support the Obama plans for healing our nation.",

I hope you will enjoy living in a third world country.\nWell, to be fair, Bush turned us into a third world country. Secondly, you've been listening to too many right-wingers. Check the true financial definition of socialism. It ain't what you think! \n \n What is your logic in stating something ignorant . . . . Obama will \"plan to create a rapidly increasing group of lazy entitlement recipients\".? So, as always, if it isn't the Hannity. Limbaugh, Laura et. al. way, it has to be wrong! WOW, sounds like religion to me.\n \n However you are correct in stating that those who rely on facts instead of raw non-factual emotional responses will elect him again. \n \n I'm glad I'm not one of the party who want to see Obama fail, consequently the country go further down to the point of desperation. Party first, country 2nd.\n \n Look, Limbaugh and his ilk have had 8 years to prove their points. How many more years do they want to continue their crazy ways of handling this country? They failed miserably. (Limbaugh failed out of college AND a drug addict - what a wizzzzzard!) He does have the ability to deliver spine-tingling gab to those who want to be spoon-fed illiterate non-facts and call it infallible and earn 100's of millions of dollars living off of foolishness. Your thought had 8 years to spew misinformation and where has it led us? You must be one of the 2 or 3 left in this country who think Bush is smart.\n \n BTW, there are times when it is necessary for a country to survive to turn to the government for help. (That's why it exists.) This is one of those times. And as I wrote, your suggestions for the solutions are. . . . . . . . .?",
