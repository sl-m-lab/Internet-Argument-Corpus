   "Now we've come full circle, methinks.\n \n http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7374-1683578,00.html\n \n West turns blind eye as police put Saddam's torturers back to work\n From James Hider in Baghdad\n \n IRAQI security forces, set up by American and British troops, torture detainees by pulling out their fingernails, burning them with hot irons or giving them electric shocks, Iraqi officials say. Cases have also been recorded of bound prisoners being beaten to death by police.\n \n In their haste to put police on the streets to counter the brutal insurgency, Iraqi and US authorities have enlisted men trained under Saddam Hussein's regime and versed in torture and abuse, the officials told The Times. They said that recruits were also being drawn from the ranks of outlawed Shia militias.\n \n Counter-insurgencies are rarely clean fights, but Iraq's dirty war is being waged under the noses of US and British troops whose mission is to end the abuses of the former dictatorship. Instead, they appear to have turned a blind eye to the constant reports of torture from Iraq's prisons.\n \n Among the worst offenders cited are the Interior Ministry police commandos, a force made up largely of former army officers and special forces soldiers drawn from the ranks of Saddam's dissolved army. They are seen as the most effective tool the coalition has in fighting the insurgency.\n \n \"It's a gruesome situation we are in,\" a senior Iraqi official said. \"You have to understand the situation when the special commandos were formed last August. They were taking on an awful lot of people in a great hurry. Many of them were people who served in Saddam's forces . . . The choice of taking them on was a difficult one. There was no supervision. There still really isn 't any, and that applies to all the security forces. They're all doing this.\"\n \n \"This\", said Saad Sultan, the Human Rights Ministry official in charge of monitoring Iraq's prisons, includes random arrests, sometimes without a warrant, hanging people from ceilings and beating them, attaching electrodes to ears, hands, feet and genitals, and holding hot irons to flesh.\n \n Four of his 22 monitors have already quit their jobs, leaving a handful of lawyers to inspect scores of prisons.\n \n \"Two months ago I could go into a prison and more than 50 per cent of the people had been ill-treated,\" Mr Sultan said. Six months ago the situation had been even worse.\n \n Reports of torture and abuse are commonplace. Omar, a 22-year-old student, said that he was picked up in a night raid on his home in Baghdad by police commandos, who dragged him away from his family to a detention facility. No one told him where he was or what he was accused of, he said. As he was marched into prison, policemen lined up to beat him and his fellow detainees. The prisoners' handcuffs were tightened until the men screamed.\n \n The next day, he and his neighbour were blindfolded and transported to another facility, where his neighbour collapsed unconscious during a beating. He was then led into an interrogation room, where a policeman attached electrodes to his thumbs and toes. \"I immediately asked what they wanted and he said something like, 'You have been targeting police and national guardsmen'. Without waiting for my response, he switched on the electricity, then kept on turning it off and on until I could hardly breathe.\n \n \"I screamed under torture,\" Omar said. \"It's not a place to prove your courage. These guys are trying to kill you for nothing.\" He was released without charge after 12 days.\n \n The abuse has not gone unnoticed by the coalition, but little has been done to address it. A US State Department report in February stated that Iraqi authorities had been accused of \"arbitrary deprivation of life, torture, impunity, poor prison conditions - particularly in pre-trial detention facilities - and arbitrary arrest and detention.\" A Human Rights Watch report also noted that \"unlawful arrest, long-term incommunicado detention, torture and other ill-treatment of detainees (including children) by Iraqi authorities have become routine and commonplace\".\n \n Evidence of extra-judicial killings by the security forces has also come to light. Mr Sultan is investigating the case of three members of the Badr Corps, the paramilitary wing of one of the main Shia parties in government, who were arrested by police, handcuffed and beaten to death.\n \n An Iraqi official said that the Iraqi National Guard, the US-trained paramilitary police, regularly disposed of the corpses of its victims by throwing them in the river. \"The problem is that some people have still got that training from the past,\" he said. \"You have ten or twelve of them in the same unit working, and if they seize terrorists they will torture or kill them.\"\n \n He added that while the de facto death squads were not part of government policy, little was being done to counteract them. \"These are exceptional times. It's an emergency.\"\n \n General Adnan Thabet, the commandos' commander and a special adviser to the Interior Minister, was a senior officer under Saddam. He was sentenced to death for plotting against the former dictator and was tortured after his sentence was commuted.\n \n He denied any allegation of torture, but admitted: \"This is a dirty war. We are the only ones with the nerves to fight it.\"",

By dissidents do you mean Iraqi citizens who did not agree with the brutal regime that Saddam was running? The regime that jailed innocent people for long periods of time for no reason, raped women freely, and gassed 5 thousand of it's own citizens? So you mean the people that rebelled against this? Those dissidents? \n \n Ask yourself who the real terrorist was in Iraq prior to the invasion.\n \n \n \nI doubt that most of these people had any sort of due process.\n The article describes people being picked up almost at random and tortured.\n\n First off, it is one article. Just because someone took the time to write it down or put it in a news report does not make it fact. I am sure that it does happen, but I doubt if it is the frequency claimed here. It all comes down to asking how many of these tortured people are really innocent, and how many are indeed terrorists and insurgents.\n \n \n \nYou would probably make a fine cleric under Sharia Law. ;)\n\n I don't wear robes well.",

   "Just what insurgents did Saddam ever torture? \n\n Shia clerics for just one example.\n I'd call them dissidents before I'd call them anything, but given the chance (and it was building) they would have become insurgents.\n \n There were Shia and Kurd uprisings that were crushed by Saddam throughout his tenure (the one's after GWI we just stood by and let happen).\n \n These were insurgents. Surely at least a few of these people were captured and tortured.\n \n \n \n It's not like he was taking Islamic terrorists into custody and torturing or killing them to prevent future acts of terrorism.\n\n What are you joking?\n \n Ok, practiaclly everyone in Iraq except a few percent are Muslims.\n \n The whole reason Saddam would torture anyone was to prevent future uprisings. \n \n \n\n Saddam was a friend of the terrorist, which in my book, makes him a terrorist too. \n\n He wasn't a friend to the anti-Saddam terrorists (or were they freedom fighters?)\n \n \nAnd if you will notice, the insurgents are not just fighting the amercian and coalition soldiers.
