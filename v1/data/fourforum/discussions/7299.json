   "Having been brought up Catholic, there were a number of phrases that were always used and repeated that really were not fully explained and that I have always had questions about. My main questions include:\n \n 1. Jesus is our savior, a lamb of God: What does this mean exactly?\n What exactly did he save us from? Did he save us from the vengeance of God against humanity for the apparent sins of most or all of its members by sacrificing his life to appease God's anger? That doesn't exactly sound like a loving God to me. Even if that were the case, how would Jesus' sacrifice change anything regarding the state of sin-hood of humanity? What would God have accomplished by this sacrifice?\n \n 2. In what way is Christianity a monotheistic religion?\n All versions of Christianity involve at least two supernatural entities - God and Jesus - and many (including Catholicism) add the vague notion of the \"Holy Spirit\". How can one claim monotheism when there are at least two or three separate entities? This doesn't even count the realm of angels, demons, saints, etc. The notion of the trinity being three entities in one has always failed to explain in what way they are one.\n \n 3. What is the role of God in the Christian faith? \n The Christian faith seems to focus almost exclusively on Jesus and those surrounding him. Though God plays a very major role in the Old Testament, his role seems to draw much less focus in the New Testament. So, what really are the views of Christianity on the present roles of God and Jesus?\n \n To be honest, I must mention my background that, despite a moderate Catholic upbringing, I have wavered in that faith ever since my teenage years - somewhere between a version of Christianity and agnosticism. As a scientist, it is impossible to reconcile most Christian theological beliefs with Science. However, despite negative examples, there are a lot of good lessons and intentions in most Christian beliefs which still draw me to try to hold on to some version of faith - at least that which can still fit within the unknown or un-disprovable regions of Science.",

Not all who say he is saviour accept this though: to some he saves through incarnation rather than death (by God becoming human he can help humans become like God).

   "I can understand the last point - that of giving moral teachings and helping us know God, but the other two are still vague to me. Why was a sacrifice necessary?\nThere's that it would be against God's justice to let sins go unpunished.

Maybe he was just a man in that second (that last bit is technically heresy, which doesn't mean people don't think it's orthodox.\n \n 2) He's quoting a Psalm: maybe 28, I can look it up. It starts asking 'Why have you forsaken me' and ends 'he has done it' or 'it is finished', which according to some accounts are Jesus' last words\n \n \nI can certainly see how it was mainly Paul who made Christianity Chistocentric.

Christianity almost purely seems to dwell on the story of Jesus' brief life as a human.\nIt is unclear. To some the Holy Spirit seems to be the only active participant from now till the Judgement. Another idea, modelled on the idea of relationship in the Trinity, is that the Holy Spirit which has entered you prays to God who is above you, guided by Jesus beside you.

The only way I can see this working to limit sin is if the sacrifice is so dear that the person donating the sacrifice suffers from its loss. Could that be part of the idea behind the sacrifice of Jesus? Namely, the loss of his life so early on was and is dearly felt by humanity, who would have much rather had him continue his teachings than be sacrificed.

So that our punishment for sin was to have him taken away from us too early. Anyway, in my experience with the Catholic Church, this was never really made clear.\nThe sacrifice was meant to be the best of the flock, so it was a financial loss. Also it would hopefully make you aware of what a bad thing it was. But yes, this idea exists in many place and it does seem to be a symbolic evasion of punishment - or rather cleansing of sin.\n \n \nIf those before Christ got a \"back-dated salvation\" then there really was no new benefit added. The bottom line was that people who followed God's principles could get \"saved\" (i.e. go to heaven) before the life of Jesus no less so than afterwards. Where was the new benefit?\nBecause if Jesus hadn't died, the salvation couldn't have been backdated. You have to remember that the main idea of paradise in Christianity is bodily resurrection at the end of time, not immediate ascent at death, and that God is outside history. A good metaphor for the effect of the event of Jesus' death on prior and later history is that the comparitively tiny moment of the cross is an axle through history, giving it a whole new direction.\n \n \nBoth of these explanations concern me. The first seems to be a contortion of belief in order to make separate identities still fit into a concept of unity.\nIt does fit better with the heretical ideas that Jesus was just a man totally in contact with God: a transclucent soul, as such, or else was a man almost 'possesed' by the Holy Spirit. \nAs for the second, the concept of Jesus as God contorting his actions to fit human professy seems problematic and has always bothered me.\nWell, Jesus often made references, open and subtle, to previous scripture and Jewish tradition.\n \n \nPerhaps I don't have my terminology right. If you define theology as dealing with the metaphysical and ethical then what term would you use to define the supernatural story behind the religion - creation story, miracles, and other such methods by which the supernatural interacts with our physical world?\nThe story is myth, or to avoid the negative leanings of that term 'muthos', from the Greek. It is events portrayed not necessarily to depict literal fact (though it may coincide: Jesus is considered by some a myth incarnate, as such), but to make an ethical, salvific or philosophical point.\n \n \nI am not saying that Paul created the idea of the deity of Christ, just that he made Christ practically the sole center of Christianity where God seems to be rarely mentioned outside of the story of Jesus.\nYou are quite right to make the distinction. Paul's emphasis on Christ as Saviour actually means he places little emphasis on the question of whether he was God, divine being or man.",
