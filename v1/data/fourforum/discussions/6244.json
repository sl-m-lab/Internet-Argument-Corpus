   "Funny, I have not heard the current administration calling for war in S. America. I did not know we were standing at a crossroads of either killing Chavez or going to war in Venezuela. I have not seen one person yet publically state that the prefer war and the deaths of thousands in Venezeula Vs. Killing one man. \n\n \n So? Does that mean one can't hypothetically talk about it and use this as an obvious springboard about the ethical delimma of choosing the death of one life versus thousands?\n \n \nJMHO, but it is never the high moral ground for a religious leader to publically call for the assassination of any leader, nor any human for that matter. The whole \"thou shalt not kill\" thing comes to mind. Yeah, I'm sure I heard that one somewhere...oh yeah, that little handbook the christian crowd so proudly waves. \n\n \n I never said it was a moral high ground. You guys keep trying to turn this into a religious Biblical thing, when in fact if a non-religious person had made those comments you probably wouldn't be all hot and bothered about it like has happened here. It was a political comment, pure and simple. Very misguided, yes. Turning it into a religious issue like you are trying to do is a diversion--this is a political and international policy issue. Whether or not Robertson's comments were in conflict with his religion is not the important issue here. That's his own problem.",

But surely this doesn't make him a threat, after all he's not doing anything directly against the US, he just seems to be trying to reorder his ****ed up country, and one result of that is a small number of foreign investors are suffering (very slightly). \n Additionally, I have seen some American commentators (including Robertson) refer to Chavez as a dictator. Is this taken seriously by anyone? Do these people know how ridiculous they sound, considering Chavez has been elected and approved in polls and referenda 7 times, with the elections announced by Jimmy Carter as \"free and fair\".\n Or do people just take issue with the fact that he seems friendly with Fidel Castro? (they are exchanging Cuban doctors for Venezuelan oil).\n I can imagine that the right-wing media would portray Venezuela as a threat, but I can't believe this sort of thing is taken seriously by ordinary Americans.\n Then again, they seemed to believe that Nicaragua was a threat in the 80s...",

Speaking at its national convention in Honolulu, the group's national commander called for an end to all \"public protests\" and \"media events\" against the war.\n \n \"The American Legion will stand against anyone and any group that would demoralize our troops, or worse, endanger their lives by encouraging terrorists to continue their cowardly attacks against freedom-loving peoples,\" Thomas Cadmus, national commander, told delegates at the group's national convention in Honolulu.\n \n The delegates voted to use whatever means necessary to \"ensure the united backing of the American people to support our troops and the global war on terrorism.\"\n \n In his speech, Cadmus declared: \"It would be tragic if the freedoms our veterans fought so valiantly to protect would be used against their successors today as they battle terrorists bent on our destruction.\"\n \n He explained, \"No one respects the right to protest more than one who has fought for it, but we hope that Americans will present their views in correspondence to their elected officials rather than by public media events guaranteed to be picked up and used as tools of encouragement by our enemies.\" This might suggest to some, however, that American freedoms are worth dying for but not exercising.\n \n Without mentioning any current protestor, such as Cindy Sheehan, by name, Cadmus recalled: \"For many of us, the visions of Jane Fonda glibly spouting anti-American messages with the North Vietnamese and protestors denouncing our own forces four decades ago is forever etched in our memories. We must never let that happen again....\n \n \"We had hoped that the lessons learned from the Vietnam War would be clear to our fellow citizens. Public protests against the war here at home while our young men and women are in harm's way on the other side of the globe only provide aid and comfort to our enemies.\"\n \n Resolution 3, which was passed unanimously by 4,000 delegates to the annual event, states: \"The American Legion fully supports the president of the United States, the United States Congress and the men, women and leadership of our armed forces as they are engaged in the global war on terrorism and the troops who are engaged in protecting our values and way of life.\"\n \n Cadmus advised: \"Let's not repeat the mistakes of our past. I urge all Americans to rally around our armed forces and remember our fellow Americans who were viciously murdered on Sept. 11, 2001.\"\n E&P Staff (letters@editorandpublisher.com) \n\n \n What do they mean by \"any means necessary\"?\n Sounds like a threat...",

It is a moot point since you cannot prove and have no evidence that: Not killing Chavez = War in Venezuela. I hear nobody else on here punching that card except you. It is rediculous to think that it is an either/or choice. I thought the \"christian\" attitude would be for the preservation of life in all cases, not weighing one death Vs. many, especially when there is no need for anyone to be killed. \n \n \n \n \nI never said it was a moral high ground.

Anyone making this comment would have got me all \"hot and bothered\" as you say, especially if it still gained this much publicity. I think it is an incredibly stupid and dangerous thing to say considering our current world image, and even the price we are paying for gas. However, what bothers me in addition about the issue, is that the man claims to be a devout servent of the christian god, who clearly tells christians that \"thou shalt not kill\". Yet Pattycakes stands up and in front of the entire world and advocates the assassination of this man. And he did it on his religiously based show (you know, The 700 Club, that show on the Christian Broadcast Network?) So yes, I think this is like the elephant in the living room, it is hard to ignore the fact that there is a religious component to this story. It just gives me one more reason to hate (yes, I said hate) evangelical christian ministers like Robertson. As an American, I am ashamed of his comments, and mad that they reflect badly on my country. As a christian, I would think you would be livid.",
