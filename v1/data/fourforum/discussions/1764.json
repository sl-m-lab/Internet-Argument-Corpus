   "Your children are hungry. It's been over two days since you were able to find food for them or for yourself. Since your home was seized by the new global government the only shelter you could find was under viaducts and in doorways. Trying to count your blessings, you realize how fortunate you are not to have been in California when a quake hit earlier in the month and sent the entire west coast into the sea. \n Tuning your short-wave radio into the Christian underground radio network for inspiration and news updates you notice your youngest child is developing a cough similar to the one that tragically took the life of your toddler and his mother only six weeks before. You wonder, \"Is it worth it?\", in a barely audible voice. Is it worth watching your family die one by one simply because you refuse to get the global government's ID number bar-coded in infrared on your right hand? After all, that is surely the Mark of the Beast the Bible warned you about, for the total numerical value of the name of the President of the One World Government equals the sum of 666. And it was his idea concerning the bar-coding of the ID number. Sure, the new government says it needs to use such a draconian identification method to insure bandits don't steal more traditional cards. For ever since the economic and political collapse of the traditional national governments around the world, chaos has reigned. Street gangs rule the cities while homeless and hungry citizens huddle together in makeshift refugee centers around the country and around the world. Surely Jesus will come soon. \n \n As you begin to focus on the Reverend's voice speaking to you from your short-wave you can't believe his message. Apparently, there has been an error. Church leaders have decided at an emergency conference held in Virginia Beach, Virginia that the Latin version, and not the Hebrew version, Bibles are correct in reference to the Mark of the Beast. And the number of the dreaded Mark of the Beast in Latin is 616, not 666. \n Relief rushes over you as you realize you can once again buy and sell and live a normal life. You can even seek medical attention for your remaining children. REMAINING CHILDREN! The result of your superstition has brought the reality of your decision to blindly follow man-made religion tearing and clawing at your soul. Your innocent trusting child and wife are dead. Your own flesh and blood! And for what? Some preacher's interpretation of ancient Judeo-Christian mythology??? \n Christians all long for the day when Jesus comes flying out of the clouds in his last great act to ensure individual Christians will never be responsible for themselves. They see it as Biblical fulfillment. Thinking honest people see it as hog-wash. The above example demonstrates the overwhelming credulity required to honestly and sincerely embrace Christianity. As any thinking mind can see, if the Bible were true God has left His people in a terrible predicament: we must take a 50/50 chance on which translation is correct, the Hebrew 666 or the Latin 616 with the lives and eternal welfare of ourselves and families resting upon it. \n An obvious phenomenon that would be a definite reality if the Bible were true would be the indestructibility and unalterableness of a Bible. If God made the creation with these qualities, as we know He did from our knowledge of science and every day experience, He would have made His Word to mankind with these exact same qualities to ensure we are not led astray from Him. A Bible, however, can be destroyed and altered. That is common knowledge. If the Bible, then, doesn't possess the same qualities God uses in His creation, which there is no doubt He is the Creator and designer of, why do we attribute this poorly written contradictory collection of books to Him? \n Asking this one sign, a sign that already exists in His other work of the creation, is not asking too much. And it would complement the reason He already has given us. \n If the Bible were the Word of God, would it portray God as the murderer and killer of all forms of life on Earth, obviously including babies, the elderly, puppies, kittens - everything, as is done in the horror story of Noah and the flood? (A joke going around in the time of Tom Paine was, \"Do you believe in No-ah?\", and the response being, \"Ah-no.\"). Can you imagine a just God drowning your children, siblings and parents and ruthlessly including even the unborn? What sins could they have committed??? \n If the Bible were true, why would God give us reason which is contrary to the Bible? \n If the Bible were true, why are there hospitals full of sick people, when Jesus allegedly said, in Mark 16:15-18, that his followers would be able to heal the sick? Pat Robertson claims to be a follower of Jesus, so why doesn't he get busy and heal the sick of the world? In fact, with the great overabundance of televangelists throughout the world, there is absolutely no reason to have any type of illness afflicting society. Based on what is written in the Bible, they could have all the hospitals and doctors out of business within a six month period. Imagine, children stricken with leukemia and muscular dystrophy getting up from their beds and walking out of the hospitals! People who've lost limbs for whatever reasons having them grow back healthier than before! That truly would be great. Unfortunately, the Biblical claims to healing are only as true as the Bible is. \n It's about time people snapped out of their ancient religion induced slumber and demand accountability from those who use religion for their own advancement, whether its for political or financial greed. We should demand OUR government police the air-waves and churches for false claims of healing. When a suspicious preacher is found making ridiculous claims of Biblical healing, he or she should be required to cause through prayer alone the regrowth of an amputated limb. If they succeed they can continue preaching, if not they are punished for deceiving the people.",

   "You can't believe it. The Reverend Pat Robertson has agreed to hear your case when it is brought before the highest court in the land, the Federal Ecclesiastic Court. Reverend Robertson himself! The man who led America out of its Satanic stupor of secularism. He not only brought an end to abortion on demand, he led the Christian Coalition and the politicians they endorsed to outlaw abortion completely, regardless of the effects on the mother. He brought God back into the schools and banished Satin from the halls of education whether he was taking the form of Islam or some other anti-Christ religion, evolution, or sexual equality. God speaks audibly to Reverend Robertson, so we know God would want it this way. \n \n Reflecting on your case you realize you are guilty. You violated the Word of God and both counts against you in the indictment are true. The first count, that of allowing your wife to enter the church before the mandatory 33 days after giving birth to your son had elapsed thus violating Leviticus 12:4, stems from not adhering religiously to I Corinthians 11:3 and 14:34 which places the man as the authority over the woman and forbids women to speak in church. \n \n As you enter the courtroom you notice the huge American flag draped over the wall with the cross of the risen Christ emblazoned across it. Reverend Robertson enters with his white powdered wig and flowing robes which are meant to return us to our proud Anglo-Saxon roots. The people in the room rise. After the Reverend/Judge sits the attorneys and spectators sit, but as a prisoner and defendant you remain standing. \n \n The case before your's involves a Jew who has refused to accept the Lord Jesus as his personal savior. To make matters worse, he is charged with attempting to impede the evangelical mission of the Christians among the Jews. He just doesn't realize the importance of Christ's commission to true Christians to win the world for Jesus. \n \n Suddenly Reverend Robertson says, \"Thus saith the Lord, 'You my son, I have loved since before you were born, I allowed you to be born into the house of David, yet you refuse my love through my only Son Jesus. Before you poison the minds of your brothers, and harden their hearts against me, I order that your tongue be removed, your property be confiscated and distributed equally between Church and State and you be imprisoned for a term of 10 years of hard labor.'\" \n \n You realize the sentence is light because the Old Testament, in Numbers, 15:32-36, calls for death to those who do not honor the Sabbath day, and the rebellious Jews still cling to the old Sabbath of Saturday instead of the true Sabbath which is Sunday. \n \n As the ungrateful Jew is taken out by the bailiffs to have the sentence immediately carried out, for society is no longer coddling criminals by allowing appeals of sentences particularly in the Ecclesiastic Courts, your name and case number are called. The Reverend Robertson is going over your file when his eyes begin to squint and he raises his right hand in the air. You realize from seeing him so often on the 700 Club that he is receiving a word of knowledge from the Lord. After a few moments he says, \"The Lord has revealed to me important facts regarding your wife.\" Your heart starts racing. Has the Lord told him??? \n \n The Reverend continues. \"I will ask you one time and one time only. Was your wife a virgin when you married her?\" \n \n It was what you feared. If you answer honestly and say no, they will execute her according to Deuteronomy 22:13-21, and if you lie you are going against the Lord. Suddenly you remember that the first child born to Reverend Robertson was born early enough to remove any doubt that the child was conceived before marriage, which puts Mrs. Robertson in the same situation as your wife. \n \n \"Reverend, Sir,\" you begin nervously, \"may I ask you concerning the birth of your - \" \n \n \"No!\" thunders the once smiling Reverend/Judge. \"YOU are on trial here! YOU have sinned against the one true God! I will not tolerate Satan in my presence! You are guilty of not only the original charges against you, but also of attacking the messenger of the Lord! Thus saith the Lord, 'Your spouse has violated my sacred scripture and shall surely be put to death by stoning, and you who have taken this ***** as a wife, who even then refused to be a true man and discipline her according to My Word shall be made to suffer the punishment of death by burning and your property taken and distributed equally among the Church and State.'\" \n \n As they are leading you to your horrendous execution your mind is attacked by not only fear, but worse, by doubts. Doubts about the Holy Scriptures, about Pat Robertson's ability to communicate directly and audibly with God, and about revealed religion itself. You wonder if Pat's real source of revelation regarding your wife was a neighbor you confided in regarding that situation. Could it have been him who betrayed you? \n \n The above scenario could become reality if the religious right continues in its takeover of the US Government. Everything in it is based on Biblical realities, and it is the Bible the Christian Coalition and the various Christian zealots want to rule America, and eventually the world, with. In the past, when religion dominated government and there was no wall separating Church and State as Jefferson recommended, the Church would sentence the accused and the government would carry out the sentence which many times would be an execution. It not only happened in Europe, but it also happened in pre-revolutionary America. In fact, it is happening right now as you are reading this, in Islamic countries. The important question, however, is, are we going to let it happen here and now? And if we don't want it to become a reality in our lives or in the lives of our children and grandchildren, what are we doing to prevent it? \n \n The time is NOW to take positive action and counter the narrow minded religious bigots.",
