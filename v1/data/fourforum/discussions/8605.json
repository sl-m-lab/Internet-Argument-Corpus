And current US administration is still miffed at Turkey for not allowing US Military staging in Turkey for the Invasion of Iraq.",

   "Well Turkey is RIGHT. 14 soldiers dead and they haven't started war yet like the Israelis? Wow, I guess they have better restraint. But even so, under the great words of our ignorant, undiplomatic, one-sided president, George Bush, Turkey, like any other country as a right to defend itself.\n \n Hmmm, Israel can start a war killing innocent civilians in the hundreds, if not thousands, because of two kidnapped soldier, well then Turkey, should now be able to launch a full out assault and invasion 10x greater than that of Israel, after all 14 soldiers were killed, from a terrorist group.\n \n Go ahead Turkey, and lets see the U.S president dig his hole deeper.",

Iraqi Kurds are somewhat the current US darlings in Iraq and in the middle of how to divide Iraq's oil. And current US administration is still miffed at Turkey for not allowing US Military staging in Turkey for the Invasion of Iraq.\n\n \n What is interesting is how this has backfired. Iran has been sending fighters to hizbollah, but instead of outrage, people seem to be thinking more along the lines of \"Well, israel is bombing the heck out of lebanon....lebanon can use all the help they can get\". Other nations in the ME are starting to step out of line (for example, Jordan just sent medical teasm to help assist with \"victims of Israeli agression\"). AND, Israel is looking pretty terrible in all this. Their supposedly great intel service looks pretty poor when you kill more civilians than hizbollah fighters by orders of magnitude, their military is looking pretty shoddy since they have been raining destruction on S Lebanon and Hizbolah is still fighting back and does not seem to have been harmed too much. \n \n It will be interesting to see exactly how this plays out. I would expect to see a mandated (by the US and GB) peace fairly soon, because if things keep going as they have, Israel will be the laughing stock of the entire world. \n \n On the question of Trket invading Iraq, I think that has been inevitable since the first. Bush and Co were just too stupid to see it. The governemtn of IRaq cannot control the kurds in the north, the Us doesn't want to, and they are sitting on enough oil that if Turkey takes it the Turks will profit handsomly from the acquisition in the long run.\n \n I have to wonder if those who are so supportive of Israeli agression will be as supportive of Turkish aggression when it goes against the wishes of the United States. The Iraqi Kurds have been working with the Turkish kurds to attack the Turkish government for years. There is FAR more justification for a turkish invasion than there has ever been for an israeli invasion.",
