   "I recently heard of the TNIV Bible that has recently come on the scene.\n \n Have any of you Bible scholars read or heard about the changes it makes from the NIV? (The NIV is bad enough as it is.)\n \n My initial take is that it's an effort to remove gender reference by taking out \"man\" and substituting \"those\", and in some instances removes the mention of Jesus from the text.\n \n What's up with that?",

   "A couple of points:\n \n Why you are sour on the NIV is puzzling. It's the most widely read translation yet, and is considered easier to understand than others. It has a good reputation with liberal-minded Christians, which is where I thought we might find you residing.\n \n James Dobson actually had enough power to quash the entire TNIV project for over two years and attempted to institute his own guidelines. James Dobson is the most dangerous religious leader in America, IMO, and should be watched very closely. \n \n In addition to Dobson, it was quickly rejected by James Kennedy and Pat Robertson, among many other conservative fundamentalists. It is beyond their Christian compassion and understanding to read \"children of God\" instead of \"sons of God\".\n \n It has been useful in driving another intractable wedge between liberals and conservatives and therefore has my full blessing. :)",
