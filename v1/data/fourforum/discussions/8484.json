He owned slaves, but we don't typical judge him in entirety for that. If we took the gay-pride-movement's tactics over homophobia we would do so, however. (and he would have never been thought of as a respectful founding father, but rather just a racist.)

Or at least that's the way I think it should be. \n \n \n \nWhat if (this is not the case, just an example) the KKK had been an organization that preached peace and happiness, but their view of peace and happiness was a world without blacks? \n\n \n Well, your example is of an organization dedicated for the sole purpose of racism. So in your example I don't think rampant, dedicated racism and peace/happiness really can go together. I don't think there could be such an example. If it did exist it would be such a contradiction it would be an enigma. The KKK is dedicated to racism. That's their very purpose. I understand you were using a hypothetical, but it's a hypothetical that could never be, IMO. Like it or not, most people are homophobic to some degree. The BSA, led by people, are as well. That doesn't mean they should be judged as evil anymore that it means Thomas Jefferson should be judged as evil for owning slaves.\n \n I understand your point. I'm just saying that a whole organization or person shouldn't be judged entirely on that one issue if they did a lot of good things, particularly if that issue was rather small part of their work. And I've seen quite a smear campaign against the BSA--and people right here on this forum say they are against them. But when they oppose and go against the BSA, they are going against all the good things the BSA does as well. They've judged this group entirely on that one issue. The BSA may have a problem with homosexuality, but that doesn't change the fact they do a lot of good things--and the good things they do far, far outnumber that one issue, IMO. I know there are a lot of people here who hate Dobson, but I feel the same way about him too, because I've read and looked into the bulk of his life's work, most of which has nothing to do with being against homosexuality. But listening to your movement, one would think his view on homosexual marriage is his only purpose in life. IMO, this trend in the gay-pride-movement of all-or-nothing judgement based on one issue is not good. (And it's just as bad when done by opponents of gay marriage too)",

   "Yep, it's disciminatory. Just like women's spas are discriminatory and hurtful for not admitting men, or restaurants are disciminatory for giving better prices to people over 50. Yet if a restaurant gave better prices to straights than gays, you'd be flipping out, no doubt.\n \n Those men just aren't worthy of going to that spa. Those 30-somethings just aren't good enough for the better prices. \n \n I have very little patience for arguments such as yours that make sweeping moral judgements on people and consider them and their views evil just because you've descided to put \"discrimination\" so high up on your list of social evils. That makes you no better that those you oppose. And to make matters worse then you only hold discrimination as evil selectively, so it rings pretty darn hollow. You don't even apply equality in the way you think of discrimination being bad, so it's hard to take your argument seriously.\n\n \n You are doing it again. How dare we get upset over their discrimination - whatever those who oppose homosexuality do is reasonable (short of violence) - and any protest of them is unreasonable. \n \n Plus your analagies fall short. \n \n We all will be senior citizens one day - so the lower prices only discrimates against those who die young. \n \n Men have spas, and there are co-ed spas as well. The spas aren't segregating becuase they find greater value in one of the sexes, they are selling to a specific market. That is not the case with boy scouts. There is no gay boy scouts options where gay men and boys can work on all the wonderful things you attribute to the boy scouts. And, no, I don't think its a good organization. All the good they due is tainted by the message that good works, spritual growth and good citizenship are only attainable to heterosexuals. It's not a lesson my son will learn - so he will never be a scout.",

   "Not necessarily. Take Thomas Jefferson for instance. He owned slaves, but we don't typical judge him in entirety for that. If we took the gay-pride-movement's tactics over homophobia we would do so, however. (and he would have never been thought of as a respectful founding father, but rather just a racist.) It's not a cut-and-dry matter--it depends on degree, context, etc. It depends on how much good and how little or much racism was engaged in. Or at least that's the way I think it should be. \n \n \n \n \n Well, your example is of an organization dedicated for the sole purpose of racism.

If Dobson would just keep his opinion to himself or better yet just concentrate on hetero families the world would be a better place. If the BSA would just admit gays and athiests then they would be a better organization. BTW GSA admits and openly supports lesbians so why doesn't the BSA admit and openly support gay men.",
