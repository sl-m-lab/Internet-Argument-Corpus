   "How to Deal With Religious People if You Are an Atheist\n \n Many devoted followers of the major religions see atheism as a disease to cure, or a sign that they should teach you their religion in order to help you reach their religion's heaven. These arguments can often be avoided, but engaging in honest conversations with someone who genuinely wants to discuss their viewpoint (rather than argue) may actually prove beneficial. You may try to remember not to think of \"religious\" and \"non-religious\"; there are many flavors of religion, and many ways to be an active atheist. Here are some ways to get along as an atheist in a deeply religious society.\n \n What follows are different takes on how to react in a deeply religious environment.\n \n Don't bring up your beliefs unnecessarily. Try to avoid the subject. What they don't know won't hurt. If they do start talking about their religion don't lie; just say your point of view. Try not to drag it into a debate, because it almost never turns out well. \n Others might argue however, that if, for example, some impose their religious beliefs that homosexuals shouldn't have the same basic human rights as heterosexuals do, or that their creation theory and theirs alone should be taught along side evolution in the science class, then yes, what they don't understand can absolutely hurt those we love and respect. Be proactive in the causes that you believe in! For example, find groups that fight for equal rights, or make a presence at your next local Board of Education meeting. \n \n Use the word \"atheist\" with care. When around very religious people it may be wise not to label yourself as an \"atheist\". The word atheist may carry (false) connotations of being \"anti-religious\" or \"satanic\", which it is definitely not. If you suspect the person you are talking to may not understand the intended meaning of the word, just say you are \"not religious\". The aim is to convey your beliefs clearly to the person, not to aggravate them by using a word they might misunderstand. \n Others might argue however, that if the word \"atheist\" is misconstrued in your community then as a proud and responsible atheist you should absolutely use the word, ATHEIST! If the subject comes up, explain what it means to be an atheist, and of course, always speak with more respect than you receive. Let others understand that being an atheist by no means is the same as not having morals or ethics, and for some it doesn't even preclude being spiritual. And of course, practice what you preach (pun intended). Be, above all, a good person. Volunteer at a women's shelter. Pick up your trash. Treat others with respect. \n \n Get support from others, just like being in a church. If you are feeling ostracized by a religious society, join another group, kind of like being in a church. Getting to know other atheists/believers might help. In such a society, there may not seem to be many, but there are - you may even already know one. However, avoid aggravating others with your inquiries, and don't allow atheism to become a criterion for friendship. If you respect the beliefs of others, you can form friendships with others who respect you. \n The idea of community is very important. A good place to find a few atheists might simply be a science class, or the right section in your local bookstore. The American Humanist Association (http://www.americanhumanist.org/index.html) is also a wonderful place to find a community of free thinkers, and there is probably a chapter in your area. Alternatively, even the Unitarian Church can be a place to find open minded people, and of a more spiritual nature. \n \n Don't try to change the religious views of others, because they will resent that. If you are resentful towards religion, consider that much of your resentment probably stems from religious persons attempting to force their beliefs on you. If you feel like your friends are trying to \"enlighten\" you, explain to them that you have made a conscious choice and are not simply ignorant of their religion. If they still attempt to convert you, perhaps you should not be friends. \n Others may argue that atheists don't impose their beliefs door to door, on TV, billboards, music, politics, etc--and that maybe we shouldn't worry so much about forcing our views on the community. As mentioned earlier, if you feel that others are forcing their beliefs on you, stand up for what you believe in! Find other, like minded people and be proactive! \n \n Know and understand the religious mythology of your society. When the subject of religion comes up, you want to be well-informed. If you understand your acquaintances' beliefs as well as they do, they'll eventually see that attempting to \"educate\" you is unnecessary. \n The web can be a great jumping point for understanding the basics, and any number of books on the subject can be found at your local bookstore. Richard Dawkins, a biologist and a strong proponent of atheism, has written many books on the subject, the most recent being \"The God Delusion\". From a philosophical perspective you could try Antony Flew's \"God and Philosophy\", or go straight for the classics like Karl (religion is the opium of the people) Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Michael Martin, or Bertrand Russell. There is also George Smith's \"The Case Against God\", Sam Harris' \"The End of Faith\", George Smith's \"Atheism: the Case Against God\"... the list is endless! As always, try starting with Wikipedia. \n \n Avoid entering arguments. Arguing with those that attempt to convert you may be an excellent way to clarify your thoughts and learn more about others' beliefs, but arguing will never convert either of you. If you choose to argue with a friend, approach it as a sharing of beliefs and not a clash. Before beginning to argue, consider whether or not your friend may be able to do this. If you find your friend's attitude offensive, or if you think things are becoming too emotional, let your friend know and gently end the argument or refer back to point 4, you don't need them. \n Others might say that this completely depends on the situation. You won't convince a devoutly religious person, but that may not be true for conversations with agnostics or others with an open mind, or people in an audience. If you know your stuff, show respect and stand your ground, you can do wonders. \n \n The way you react in a strongly religious community will of course depend on the situation. If you are a student you may worry about how being vocal will affect your student standing or your GPA, or you may even be concerned about physical harm, or worse. On the other hand, if you feel there are many others who are like you or are sitting on the fence, it may be refreshing and empowering to have a voice. Wear your Darwin fish with pride, and make a difference in your community. \n http://www.wikihow.com/Deal-With-Religious-People-if-You-Are-an-Atheist",
