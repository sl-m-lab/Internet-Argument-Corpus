I'm just saying there's no reason to take any notice of them just because they're \"famous\".\n\n I agree, fame doesn't make someone right. However, there's an army of right wing types who make a bunch of noise when celebrities express their opinions, and immediately try to discredit them. They don't, however, make the same noises when CEOs and lobbyists express their opinions. Or in this case, when an athlete uses his  fame to promote their  views.\n \n I believe that the opinions of many Americans are just as thoughtful and valid as those of politicians. To invalidate someone's political opinion because they are not a 'professional' seems to run counter to the democratic process.\n \n \n \nWhether they have a \"right\" to do so is another question and a good logical argument can be made that shows they have no such \"right\" unless their opinions happened to be true.\n\n Actually, that question is answered definitively by the Constitution's Bill of Rights:\n \n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n \n Even politicians aren't held to an \"unless their opinions are true\" standard.

(And with all the shrillness coming from both right and left camps I'm really glad that non-partisan resources like factcheck.org exist.)\n \n In my opinion, the problem with regulating 'untrue opinions' is this: Who decides what is true? The administration currently in power? According to the Bush Administration there were WMDs and an imminent threat in IRAQ and any other opinion was untrue. According to the Bush Administration, Iraq--currently under martial law--was a \"mission accomplished\", and any other opinion was untrue. And this isn't a partisan thing--similar statements could be made about any prior administration, Republican or Democrat.\n \n In American politics, determining the truth of a matter is up to us, its citizens. Fortunately, we all have access to a wide range of information sources that can help us triangulate in on the truth--assuming we can keep our minds open enough to recognize it when we see it.",

   "Famous people have virtually unlimited access to the media. They are followed around by photographers trying to get a scoop picture of them doing just about anything.

Freedom of speech is a very delicate thing, and limiting access would have a ripple effect that I'm sure would not improve matters.\n \n I do agree with your comment on newspaper endorsements. That has always struck me as odd. I don't think it should be regulated, mind you, but I do think that papers should refrain from endorsements in the interest of journalistic integrity. Individual writers could certainly write editorials in favor of candidates and issues, but be credited as individual writers, not as \"The Washington Post\" or \"The New York Times\".",

I believe each person can endorse a candidate. But how can a newspaper side with one candidate? Celebrities don't publish their views, the media publishes them. So again, do you favor restricting their rights to talk to the media?\n \n \n\n It's amazing how people drool for any kind of words from the so-called \"rich and famous\".

Now when many people speak out against the country to try to change it and people call it unpatriotic I will argue against that. Patriotism is loving your country and trying to make it the best that it can be, and I think everyone should try to do that by staying informed in politics and making the best decision. Now moving to Canada and such is totally unpatriotic. Even if they disagree with what we're doing it they should try to do something about it. When your dog gets sick do you just ditch it and find a new dog? Or do you stick with it and help it get better (medication, etc.). When the times get bad is the time to help make this country better, not ditch it find another country.",
