   "It is important to note that these represent only a fraction of the total number of incidents involving CCW licensees that happen every week.\n \n On Jan. 24, 2002, a derringer belonging to Ronald T. Cox, 54, accidentally discharged at an Indianapolis restaurant, wounding another patron. Investigators say the gun was in the pocket of Cox's leather coat; it went off when he placed the coat on the back of a chair. Cox had a concealed-carry permit. Police also found marijuana in Cox's coat.[2]\n \n On November 25, 2001, James Craig Wilson became frustrated and angry when he had trouble untangling the Christmas lights he planned to hang at his suburban Vancouver, WA, home. After going inside to calm down, Wilson went outside and fired his .45-caliber pistol into the ground multiple times. After his arrest for reckless endangerment, Wilson said that he had attended anger management classes six months earlier. \"I thought discharging my gun would help me discharge my anger,\" Wilson said. \"I guess I'm going to lose my concealed weapons permit.\"[4]\n \n On November 14, 2001, a gun carried by 32-year-old Cesar Solis accidentally went off in a Chester County, PA, tavern, injuring three people including himself - one seriously. Solis was charged with two counts of aggravated assault, two counts of recklessly endangering another person, and one count of discharging a weapon in a building. Police said Solis, who had a permit to carry the gun, was at the Birch Inn late Sunday night with his brother when Cesar Solis pulled the gun from his waistband. The gun discharged and hit his brother and Sandra Pierson, who was seated at a nearby table.[5]\n \n On November 7, 2001, the Alaska Court of Appeals ruled that under Alaska law a judge could not take into account a man's mental illness when taking away his concealed-weapons permit. In October 1998, Timothy Wagner walked into an Anchorage store and told an employee that he needed to soak out the chemicals that had been injected into him or else they would kill him. He also said a computer chip had been implanted in his head. When police were called to the scene, Wagner failed to tell police immediately that he was armed as required by law. Despite a history of mental illness, Wagner was able to get and keep an CCW permit because Alaska's concealed-weapons law was changed at the behest of the gun lobby to prohibit law enforcement from considering a person's mental state when applying for a permit.[6]\n \n Just one month after the September 11 terrorist attacks, an unnamed Washington state woman was stopped for having a loaded two-shot derringer in her carry-on baggage at Sea-Tac Airport.[7]\n \n On July 6, 2001, an unnamed man fatally shot 17-year-old Jacob W. Walton during a road rage altercation in Spokane, WA. Walton was a passenger in a car that got into an altercation with the shooter. According to police, the shooter had a concealed-weapons permit.[8]\n \n On July 5, 2001, an unnamed 75-year-old businessman was arrested for pulling a .38-caliber handgun on two associates in Troy, MI. The man, a concealed-weapons permit holder, had gotten into an argument with the two men over debris in a lot he going to lease to them. When the two men refused to clean up the debris for which they were not responsible, the man \"became angry, made threats, pointed the gun at one man, even threatening to shoot out the tires on his truck.\"[9]\n \n On the second anniversary of the Columbine High massacre (April 20, 2001), a 44-year-old substitute teacher, Cynthia Seymour, was caught with a loaded .38-caliber revolver at Tampa Bay Technical High School in Florida. A school resource officer discovered the gun when he noticed the butt of the gun sticking out from her back pocket. School district policy prohibits employees from bringing weapons to school unless they are law enforcement officers. Seymour, who holds a concealed-weapons permit, was a former sheriff's deputy, but a school spokesman said, \"Regardless of her rationale for having it . . . it's not justifiable. School district employees should not be carrying weapons on campus, just as students should not be carrying weapons.\"[10]\n \n On February 15, 2001, Renee Rudenick, 53, was arrested for possessing a firearm on school grounds in King County, WA. Police confirmed that Rudenick has a permit for the weapon, but it is illegal for anyone, including CCW permit holders, to have a gun on school grounds. Rudenick's boyfriend said that he usually takes the gun with him when he drops her off at work but that he must have forgotten to take the gun out of her purse that morning. The incident was brought to the attention of school officials after Rudenick told a principal that she had misplaced her purse and thought her loaded .38-caliber revolver might be in it. She has been fired by the school district.[11]\n \n On November 25, 2000, a man accidentally shot himself in the abdomen in a Hoover, AL, movie theater Saturday night. According to the police report, Richard Nelson, 43, went to see 102 Dalmatians with a Glock 17 9-mm pistol in his jacket pocket. After the movie ended, he was putting on his jacket when something hung on the trigger of his gun, causing it to discharge. According to police, Nelson was licensed to carry a gun for personal protection.[12]\n \n During the summer of 2000, Austin, TX, taxi driver Wayne Franklin Lambert Jr. shot and killed two unarmed men, both high-tech professionals, who had been his passengers. According to police, Lambert, a gun enthusiast with a Texas concealed-handgun license shot one of the men three times in the back. The other victim gave a deathbed statement, saying that the taxi driver became angry over something his friend had said and challenged him to a fight. Other cab drivers gave police sworn statements saying Lambert was \"very short-tempered\" and \"always angry at just about everything.\" One cab driver claimed Lambert once said, \"I would shoot someone over a dollar.\" According to state records, Lambert was charged with assault after beating, choking and threatening to kill another taxi driver in August 1994. Lambert was charged with capital murder, representing the second multiple murder case brought against a Texas concealed-gun licensee in the last three years.[13]\n \n On July 1, 2000, the Courier-Journal (KY) reported that a man with a concealed weapon and a bystander were injured when the gun fired after falling from the man's pocket at a concession stand at Tinseltown movie theaters, police said.

Newman was hit in the leg when the gun went off shortly after 8 p.m. The bullet also hit Juanita Sparks, 60, in the hip, Biven said.

   "It is important to note that these represent only a fraction of the total number of incidents involving CCW licensees that happen every week.\n \n On Jan. 24, 2002, a derringer belonging to Ronald T. Cox, 54, accidentally discharged at an Indianapolis restaurant, wounding another patron. Investigators say the gun was in the pocket of Cox's leather coat; it went off when he placed the coat on the back of a chair. Cox had a concealed-carry permit. Police also found marijuana in Cox's coat.[2]\n \n On November 25, 2001, James Craig Wilson became frustrated and angry when he had trouble untangling the Christmas lights he planned to hang at his suburban Vancouver, WA, home. After going inside to calm down, Wilson went outside and fired his .45-caliber pistol into the ground multiple times. After his arrest for reckless endangerment, Wilson said that he had attended anger management classes six months earlier. \"I thought discharging my gun would help me discharge my anger,\" Wilson said. \"I guess I'm going to lose my concealed weapons permit.\"[4]\n \n On November 14, 2001, a gun carried by 32-year-old Cesar Solis accidentally went off in a Chester County, PA, tavern, injuring three people including himself - one seriously. Solis was charged with two counts of aggravated assault, two counts of recklessly endangering another person, and one count of discharging a weapon in a building. Police said Solis, who had a permit to carry the gun, was at the Birch Inn late Sunday night with his brother when Cesar Solis pulled the gun from his waistband. The gun discharged and hit his brother and Sandra Pierson, who was seated at a nearby table.[5]\n \n On November 7, 2001, the Alaska Court of Appeals ruled that under Alaska law a judge could not take into account a man's mental illness when taking away his concealed-weapons permit. In October 1998, Timothy Wagner walked into an Anchorage store and told an employee that he needed to soak out the chemicals that had been injected into him or else they would kill him. He also said a computer chip had been implanted in his head. When police were called to the scene, Wagner failed to tell police immediately that he was armed as required by law. Despite a history of mental illness, Wagner was able to get and keep an CCW permit because Alaska's concealed-weapons law was changed at the behest of the gun lobby to prohibit law enforcement from considering a person's mental state when applying for a permit.[6]\n \n Just one month after the September 11 terrorist attacks, an unnamed Washington state woman was stopped for having a loaded two-shot derringer in her carry-on baggage at Sea-Tac Airport.[7]\n \n On July 6, 2001, an unnamed man fatally shot 17-year-old Jacob W. Walton during a road rage altercation in Spokane, WA. Walton was a passenger in a car that got into an altercation with the shooter. According to police, the shooter had a concealed-weapons permit.[8]\n \n On July 5, 2001, an unnamed 75-year-old businessman was arrested for pulling a .38-caliber handgun on two associates in Troy, MI. The man, a concealed-weapons permit holder, had gotten into an argument with the two men over debris in a lot he going to lease to them. When the two men refused to clean up the debris for which they were not responsible, the man \"became angry, made threats, pointed the gun at one man, even threatening to shoot out the tires on his truck.\"[9]\n \n On the second anniversary of the Columbine High massacre (April 20, 2001), a 44-year-old substitute teacher, Cynthia Seymour, was caught with a loaded .38-caliber revolver at Tampa Bay Technical High School in Florida. A school resource officer discovered the gun when he noticed the butt of the gun sticking out from her back pocket. School district policy prohibits employees from bringing weapons to school unless they are law enforcement officers. Seymour, who holds a concealed-weapons permit, was a former sheriff's deputy, but a school spokesman said, \"Regardless of her rationale for having it . . . it's not justifiable. School district employees should not be carrying weapons on campus, just as students should not be carrying weapons.\"[10]\n \n On February 15, 2001, Renee Rudenick, 53, was arrested for possessing a firearm on school grounds in King County, WA. Police confirmed that Rudenick has a permit for the weapon, but it is illegal for anyone, including CCW permit holders, to have a gun on school grounds. Rudenick's boyfriend said that he usually takes the gun with him when he drops her off at work but that he must have forgotten to take the gun out of her purse that morning. The incident was brought to the attention of school officials after Rudenick told a principal that she had misplaced her purse and thought her loaded .38-caliber revolver might be in it. She has been fired by the school district.[11]\n \n On November 25, 2000, a man accidentally shot himself in the abdomen in a Hoover, AL, movie theater Saturday night. According to the police report, Richard Nelson, 43, went to see 102 Dalmatians with a Glock 17 9-mm pistol in his jacket pocket. After the movie ended, he was putting on his jacket when something hung on the trigger of his gun, causing it to discharge.
