   "Saw it on Thursday in IMAX and I have to say it was amazing!! I really dont' understand the booing and crying of some trekies because it's not cannon. It opens up the franchise into a whole new area of plot and expansion. The acting was well done, great effects, wonderful film score. Go see it!emoticon_xagree",

   "I'm not a Trekkie who goes to conventions and speaks Klingon by any means, but I watched the original series in first runs as a kid and do call myself a Trekkie none the less. Maybe I can explain what devotees didn't like about it. But first, what was so good about this movie was the back stories and history it gave about how the crew met as young people. What I think some devotees didn't like was that it didn't answer all of the questions from the original series which it touched on. Captain Pike for example, although he was in a wheel chair in the end, he wasn't the deformed and helpless cripple in an automated wheelchair as the original was.\n \n To me, this leaves room for another movie where he meets that fate since the aliens who did that to him in the original series weren't Romulans anyway. \n \n And doesn't it create a true paradox for young Spock and old Spock to meet face to face? But hey, it's fiction and it also leave room for old Spock to appear in future films. \n \n The whole time continuum thing also threw devotees off since it changed the past and the original story line regarding Kirks life with his father who died early in this movie, but lived to see him become a Captain in the original series.\n \n Also, one thing that bothered me was that Spocks human mother made many visits to the Enterprise in the original series but in the movie she died when Vulcan was destroyed. They made it clear that the disruption of the space time continuum was the reason for these changes in reality, but I think the devotees would have been much happier had they been able to correct that in the end. Maybe by George Kirk and Jims mother being there when he was made Captain of the Enterprise at the end. That would have satisfied them that Spocks mom was also alive again and that Vulcan was back. Because Vulcan was never destroyed in the original series either.\n \n With all of this said, I loved it and would have paid double to see it even though I saw it for free. emoticon_xgood Thumbs up is my vote. emoticon_xagree",

   "Trekkie here from the original. Which was the best, and I've seen everything since, though not the latest (yet).\n \n Pike was a heartbreaking episode. Too bad about Spock's mom. She was a key indicator, in the original story line, to his subconscious. A wonderful actress; I remember this moving scene where she spoke about how there was a part of her in Spock, too. \n \n There appears much enthusiasm about the web to the latest movie and I look forward to seeing it. Thanks for the reviews.\n \n Live long and prosper. Dif-tor heh smusma. (Perhaps there should be a yellow smilie head with a vulcan hand sign to hold up.)",
