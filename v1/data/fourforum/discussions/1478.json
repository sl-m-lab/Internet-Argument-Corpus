   "Girl Esq.", 
   "This morning in my scripture reading I happened across the story of Jacob and his search for a wife, after cheating his brother Esau out of his birth right (Genesis 29 & 30). If you will recall, Jacob was attracted to his first cousin Rachel, but he was tricked by his Uncle Laban into marrying his first cousin Leah. When Jacob discovered he had been had, he insisted on having Rachel as well. \n \n So not only did Jacob enter into a polygamous marriage, but his wives were sisters who also happened to be close relatives. \n \n When Rachel turned out to be barren she gave her maid to Jacob saying,\" Here is my maid Bilah, go into her , that she may bear on my knees, that through her I too may have children.\" So Rachel's maid sits on her lap through labor and childbirth and Rachel pretends she is giving birth. Not to be outdone, in chapter 30 verse 9 Leah gave her maid Zilpah to Jacob for sexual intercourse and she bears him a child. \n \n I don't presume to speak for anyone but myself, however, this whole arrangement strikes me as pretty undesirable. It would break numerous cultural taboos in the US, yet it was clearly acceptable to God and to the people of that culture. God did not punish Jacob for this marriage and for having sex with his wife's maid but rather blessed him (See verse 25) In Genesis Chapter 30 verses 18-20 Leah says that God specifically blessed her for sending her maid into Jacob.\n \n Just some quick thoughts and queries.\n 1. In light of the aforementioned arrangement a monogamous marriage between two loving people of the same sex seems down right conservative.\n \n 2. If as the New Testament proclaims, we are not under the law any longer, then why do hypocritical people persist in bringing up the verses in Leviticus that seem to prohibit a male using another man as he would a woman but ignore the other prohibitions and commands found throughout the Old Testament? If we are still under the Old Testament law then why don't more parents stone their disobedient children as is commanded. If you quote the Old Testament to condemn homosexuality I challenge you to read the books of Exodus, Leviticus Numbers and Deuturonomy and ask yourself if you would feel comfortable adhering to all of the prohibitions and commands?\n \n 3. The story of Sodom and Gomorrah is another example of a story twisted out of context to serve the purpose of condemning homosexuality. In most Bibles if you look in the concordance for the word Sodom you will find no reference to the following passage in Ezekiel. Why? Because it debunks the myth that Sodom was destroyed because it was full of homosexuals. Ezekiel 16:49-50 [I][B]\"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them when I saw it.\"In the original text, the word translated \"abominations\" is actually,, the word for \"acts of lawlessness.\" Thus, the passage literally reads, \"they acted lawlessly before Me.\" \n \n 4. The New Testament reference in I Corinthians 6:9 that many translate as homosexual are the Greek words, Malakos (literally means soft, fine or feminine) and Arsenokoites (literally means man bedders) The NT reference in Timothy is also Arsenokoites. No mention of female homosexuality in either of these two verses. Likewise these references do not condemn non promiscuous monogamous loving relationships between men. God is very clear in what he condemns throughout the Bible. For example there is no question but that adultery is impermissible. If a verse is not unambiguous it is the height of arrogance to purport to go beyond what God intended. The most that can be taken from these words in this list is that promiscuous copulation with a male is unacceptable. \n \n 5. Romans 1: 26-27, People often use this verse to condemn female homosexual relationships. However, in this Chapter Paul is condemning the practice of heterosexuals engaging in homosexual sex acts as part of idolatrous temple sex rituals. Homosexual acts are not natural for a heterosexual but they would be for a homosexual. In this context it is the issue of heterosexuals engaging in orgiastic homosexual sexual acts for the purpose of worshiping false Gods that Paul is concerned with, not faithful monogamous gay couples. These verses are a far cry from a clear prohibition on monogamous homosexual relationships. \n \n 6. In Matt 5:32 Christ said that , \"whomever divorces his wife, except for the cause of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and whomever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\". In Mark 10:11-12 Christ said, \" Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her; vs. 12: and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery.\" I wonder how many heterosexual people who would support a constitutional ban on gay marriage are on their second marriage? If heterosexuals want to protect the sanctity of heterosexual marriage why not a petition for a constitutional ban on divorce except for immorality and/ or a constitutional ban on adultery?\n \n 7. Matt 7:5 \"You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.\"\n \n 8. Finally, you cannot ban gay marriage as long as any pastor is willing to perform the ceremony. You can only ban recognition of gay marriage by a government entity.",

   "Christ says he came not to save the righteous, but to save sinners. A two thousand year-old philosophy is not something a wise self-confident person would follow closely. However, a screwed-up person can look at herself and rightly feel not up to deciding which of the modern notions she should believe. She will prefer something traditional that her ancestors believed. So she will likely be led to Christianity if she lives in the West. \n \n Since religion is useful mainly to people who consider themselves screwed-up, and since often people who consider themselves screwed-up really are screwed up, it is more important for religion to be against the abominations that screw people up than it is for it to be against anything else. In particular, if a religion is not against sodomy (see my thread Sodomy a vile addiction), it is worse than worthless. Such a religion is basically just a place for corrupters to dress up their corruptions in the garb of traditional values in order to better corrupt others.\n \n It is true, though, that you can't just judge a religion by how much it is against sodomy. In particular, oftentimes religious people have an agenda against unselfish loving affectionate behavior. There is an unfortunate ambiguity in most people's minds about what exactly constitutes sexual depravity, which frigid females are not above exploiting. Take sex outside wedlock, for instance. Clearly, it is more unselfish and loving for a female to not demand commitment of resources or caring of a male before having sex with him. Accordingly, if a female has (male-commitment-free) sex outside marriage because her beloved doesn't love her enough to marry and commit to her, that suggests that she is virtuous, not that she is stupidly sinful. Similarly, a man is more pleased by sex if the female is lustful, so female lust qua lust is virtuous of the female rather than sinful. \n \n Sodomy has the capacity to make people behave unselfishly toward evil people for stupid reasons. It can make people think they are in love more than they are, and it can make people feel lust when they ordinarilly would feel quite the opposite. What selfish religious types do is purposefully confuse unselfish sexual love with the sodomy that is the abomination; that way, they can justify their unwillingness to be sexually affectionate by pretending that such affection is basically the same as stupid sinful sodomy-induced dissipation.\n \n Of course, sodomites do the same thing--they too try to confuse people into thinking that a dissipated female's desire to be sodomized is basically the same thing as female loving sexual affection. Of course, they do this for the opposite reason, namely that people's love of the latter will convince them that the former is also worthy of love. That bad people of both extremes happen to be united in confusing people about what exactly constitutes depravity largely explains why people are so confused about what exactly constitutes sodomy and what exactly constitutes sex. It is not complicated--just one hole versus another!\n \n Of course, I'd rather see an anti-sodomy amendment to the Constitution (or at least an amendment reinforcing the right of the states to enact anti-sodomy laws, a right that the Supreme Court removed this year through a judicial innovation similar to Dred Scott) than a marriage amendment. But you've got to understand the political dynamic at play. The selfish church types don't care so much about sodomy per se, they just feel the need to make sure marriage is seen as the opposite of the male homosexual lifestyle. They don't want to be seen as caring much whether unmarried people are protected from sodomy since they basically want others to have the impression that they feel intimacy outside marriage is perverse anyway. Politically, though, an anti-gay- marriage amendment is much more plausible, so I am not against it probably. Male homosexuals will be hurt by being encouraged to view their behavior as respectable by our government allowing them to get married. As for female homosexuals, I suspect most of them really are just bisexuals who have not met the right male yet, so I doubt they much would want to get married anyway. Yes, they might want to live together, but then oftentimes, probably, female friends who are single mothers could want to live together and share in child-raising responsibility, regardless whether there is any sexuallity involved between them.\n \n I don't know whether what scripture says exactly is all that important. Christianity is a tradition; most of the tradition does not date from Biblical times. E.g., to me, Pilgrim's Progress is almost as much a part of protestant Christianity as the Bible. As a tradition, Christianity has been pretty much against sodomy. E.g., I believe that many if not most of the anti-sodomy laws date from the Puritans and Oliver Cromwell. And I believe that the medieval Catholics were quite intolerant of sodomy in their pronouncements, but then they were against the clergy having sex and masturbation, also. But at any rate, sodomy as I define it (semen in the digestive system) has pretty much always been viewed as sinful by the major religious tradition.\n \n As for lesbianism being viewed as akin to male homosexual sodomy, I believe that is a recent innovation. Reading letters from the nineteenth century, I don't believe that females really viewed female/female intimacy as sex or sodomy, but more akin to innocent hugging and kissing. People try to define female/female eroticisim as involving pelvis-licking or some such unsanitary behavior, but I'd say that's mostly just a modern innovation on the part of sodomizers to try to give male homosexuality a certain amount of regard by making it seem similar to innocuous and sometimes special female/female intimacy. I doubt females attracted sexually to other females typically want to engage in pelvis-licking or some other such not pretty behavior.\n \n I have much respect for religious people who sincerely wish to fight sodomy or male homosexuality. Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams, in particular, wrote an excellent book, Homosexuality and the Nazi Party , on the connections between male homosexuality and the Nazi movement, for which I must respect them. With the possible exception of the anti-sodomy chapter of my book, I know of no more effective and clear-headed polemic against sodomy. There is a place for religion, and it is mainly to reform people from sodomy and other chemical addiction.",

   "Dear Step 314;\n \n This is what I was able to extract from your response. \n \n You fancy yourself an erudite original thinker.\n\n \n True.\n \n\n You are under the impression that pretty words strung together, equate with clearly expressed logical ideas.\n\n \n No. Matter of fact I am a mathematician by training, and mathematical words aren't particularly pretty and math is basically nothing but logic. Much of my prose style tends to come from my having read carefully a good many math books.\n \n\n You think any woman who is not panting for penis is likely frigid.\n \n\n \n No, not hardly. Matter of fact, you should have inferred the opposite from my believing that so-called lesbians are mostly bisexuals who have not met the right man yet. Indeed, my explanation for such error is that females fancying themselves to be exclusive homosexuals tend to be females who from believing prevailing stereotypes wrongly think that heterosexual women are supposed to easily pant for penis the way that men tend to want sex quite generally. Females tend to be quite particular about whom they want to sleep with, but the prevailing stereotypes created by the more empowered male gender tries to make females think themselves something else, so that they may be persuaded to have sex more easily. It is normal for a female to not have strong sexual desire for a male until she finds one she loves well enough to seriously consider wanting sex with, and it is not in the female nature for that to happen often. What's frigid is a young female who doesn't pant (not perhaps the word that I would use, but close enough) for penis when she should be deply in love.\n \n \nYou prefer women of low self esteem who will put out on command without any expectation of love or companionship. You believe women looking for a relationship in conjuntion with sexual intercourse are inferior creatures to be avoided.\n\n \n No. Not that it is wrong for a female to appreciate money and caring somewhat; but, yes, there perhaps is no female more distasteful to me than one who excessively bases her sexual decisions on considerations of how well she will be paid or cared for. I believe that whoring is immoral not because whores are cheap, but because whores are expensive. There is no sphere in which unselfishness is more appropriate for a female than in her sexual decisions. Of course, it is well for a female to get to know me (via a relationship) before having sex with me, but that is different from caring. Basically, I would care for a female only if I married her. And I wouldn't marry a female unless I loved her, and yes, if I felt she was not the sort of female to be willing to have sex without caring if she should love a man extremely well who doesn't want to marry her, it would be extremely unlikely that I would want to marry such a selfish person. Goodness evolves largely because the men willing to care when much in love just care for women who are willing to have free sex when much in love, and because the women who are willing to have free sex when much in love just have free sex with the men who care when much in love--unselfish people mainly love unselfish people, and so unselfishness and goodness evolves.\n \n \n\n \n You are enamoured with the word sodomy and any of its derivatives. You like the way it looks on a page. No other word will do. \n \n \n\n \n Hmm. You are inferring things beyond your ken. The only synonym I know for \"sodomy\" is \"buggery\", and that is not used here in the US much. And as for why, for instance, \"oral sodomy\" is preferred to \"oral sex\", a more obvious explanation than my being in love with the word \"sodomy\" is my strong belief (as I mentioned) that it is important to distinguish sodomy from sex. They are not the same!\n \n \n\n \n You believe anything other than sexual intercourse missionary style is depraved and to be avoided. \n \n \n\n \n Nay, what I believe is depraved is the putting of semen in the digestive system. That should have been clear to you. As for female/female pelvis licking, that strikes me as unsanitary but not probably addictive. But, yeah, Why take chances? That could be imprudent.\n \n \n \n \nYou find the the idea of semen in the digestive tract strangely attractive and respulsive all at the same time. Your conflict thus compels you to write about it obsessively.\n\n \n What did I say to suggest that I find the idea of semen in the digestive tract strangely attractive? I don't believe I in any way find the idea of semen in the digestive system compelling. Do you have any reason to believe that other than that I express my distaste for the idea? Do you often think that people who argue something really believe the opposite? Why would you believe from my arguing against sodomy that I secretly believe that sodomy is attractive any more than you would (say) believe from MLK arguing against racism that Martin Luther King was secretly a racist?\n \n \nYou find a woman's genitals nasty and unappealing and you definately don't like \"pelvis licking.\"\n\n \n I think females' genitals are great and that female nudity can be extremely pretty and beautiful. But I don't particularly want to taste a female's genitals, no. If a female desires it, I quite possibly would very much like to have sex with her genitals, but I can't say I particularly would want to taste them, no that's true.\n \n \nTaking all of these conclusions into account it appears that you are either an intelligent adolescent male, a pseudo intellectual adult male with serious psychological issues, or a self loathing homosexual male locked in a desperate struggle to convince himself he is heterosexual. \n \n Just so as to disabuse you of any mistaken notions about lesbian sexuality, we do like \"pelvis licking.\" :)\n\n \n Yeah, well, all the little lemmas (except the first) that you listed to presumably come up with your conclusion turned out to have been mostly erroneous, so I won't take your presented opinion of me seriously. As for lesbians liking pelvis licking, I would humbly present to your consideration that perhaps you and other \"lesbians\" are excessively allowing your own opinion of your own sexuality to be determined by the prevailing \"politically correct\" gender stereotypes of what females attracted to females are supposed to be and do.",

If you want sources I can get some no problem, but that info isn't hard to find yourself.\n\n \n Fascinating. Females rubbing genitals together in fact is exactly what my intuition and thought considers as significant about lesbianism. I have several hypotheses about the sexual significance of female/female intimacy.\n \n (1) Sperm going back-and-forth between females selects for sperm able to survive such going back-and-forth sex (this sperm tends to be sperm whose ancestral sperm was loved by several females, and thus it tends to be unusually studly, i.e., having (desirable) characteristics that are well-loved by females).\n \n (2) Lustful females putting their genitals together causes a kind of allergic reaction that increases vaginal mucous production much the way allergic reactions can cause mucous production in the nose. This \"lust mucous\", as I call it, I believe can get absorbed by the male, rewarding him by producing probably many complicated genetic and epigenetic effects in his spermatazoa that make them evolve better.\n \n (3) Young females being intimate with older females probably makes the former more fertile as a result of some chemical being absorbed by the young female. That way, young females will be especially fertile only if an adult female doesn't find it inappropriate for the former to be sexual. Since most of the adult females that young females are around tend to care for the latter, this connection between intimacy with adult females and fertility gives young females a kind of protection against becoming pregnant through abuse, rape, or deception.\n \n Intuitively to me, the first two effects definitely involve intimacy between female genitals. The last effect, which I'm less sure about, I'm not as sure intuitively what that involves, but my guess is that it involves the same thing, and if not, perhaps involves scent.\n \n Actually, I wouldn't mind reading some of that Victorian porn. Sounds much better than what there is nowadays, and at any rate it might improve my understanding of history.\n \n Though nowadays it is the male homosexuals who probably are most responsible for lesbians thinking of themselves as akin to male homosexuals, I should point out I don't think it started out that way. Originally, I suspect, in the late 19th-century when the notion really started to take hold, females attracted to females were made to feel analogous to male homosexuals by male heterosexuals annoyed that they were not equally attractive to the same females. I've heard that Henry James's The Bostonians  has that undercurrent, though I haven't read it. Supposedly some of my female relatives inspired it.\n \n I'll do a Google on \"frottage\" and see what I come up with. It sounds quite the interesting word, and I'll add it to my vocabulary. Thanks for the info.",

In these cases, although some \"femme\" women did occasionally date men, most of these women were also exclusively homosexual. \n \n In point of fact, I would theorize that at the same time as the sexual behaviour of lesbians has changed to incorporate oral sex and dildo or hand penetration/stimulation, the number of women being bisexual in practice has increased as well. \n \n \n I have several hypotheses about the sexual significance of female/female intimacy.\n\n \n Although the depth and breadth of your imagination is interesting, nothing about this is in any way scientifically supported.

Why would I or anyone else be wrong to believe something original without scientific proof when the negation of the same idea is also something no one has no scientific evidence for? What's a human supposed to do? Flip a coin to decide how to be a lesbian because no acclaimed scientist really has thought productively about it? Better to use your own brain and try to put two and two together yourself.

The response was something along the lines of \"No, there is no scientific evidence to support that.\" Well, that doesn't mean diddly unless there also is no scientific evidence to support that drinking lots of water does not make you less healthy. If you think maybe you feel better when you drink lots of water, drink lots of water. As some famous scientist said, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. To believe conformity over your own best impressions as regards questions that have never been investigated by scientists you would respect is not scientific or reasonable, it's insanity.\n \n True, though, I don't want to go much more in to all the various particulars of what I believe about lesbianism. It's too technical for this board, and mostly it's in my book anyway. Do you have links for some of the references you have given, or are they not so readily available? That lesbianism was formerly almost exclusively \"frottage\" does not surprise me and supports my hypotheses. That lesbianism nowadays has more bisexual overtones than it did formerly would be surprising to me.",

   "This morning in my scripture reading I happened across the story of Jacob and his search for a wife, after cheating his brother Esau out of his birth right (Genesis 29 & 30). If you will recall, Jacob was attracted to his first cousin Rachel, but he was tricked by his Uncle Laban into marrying his first cousin Leah. When Jacob discovered he had been had, he insisted on having Rachel as well. \n etc....\n 1. In light of the aforementioned arrangement a monogamous marriage between two loving people of the same sex seems down right conservative.\n\n \n How so? What makes for one bad situation as being better than another? You seem to recognise that Rachel was not coerced, what she did was out of love. What criteria are you using to judge that one is worse than the other?\n \n Secondly, where does it say that the situation as portrayed (re: Jacob) is the model by which we should all follow? I've read another history - about how Mary Tudor burned people at the stake, but don't recall anyone suggesting that we should still do this. The Bible seems to have confused you somewhat. The historical tracts seem to have been mixed in your mind with the law ones.\n \n \n2. If as the New Testament proclaims, we are not under the law any longer, then why do hypocritical people persist in bringing up the verses in Leviticus that seem to prohibit a male using another man as he would a woman but ignore the other prohibitions and commands found throughout the Old Testament? If we are still under the Old Testament law then why don?t more parents stone their disobedient children as is commanded. If you quote the Old Testament to condemn homosexuality I challenge you to read the books of Exodus, Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy and ask yourself if you would feel comfortable adhering to all of the prohibitions and commands?\n\n \n Have you not heard homosexuality condemned in 1 Corinthians 6:9? (Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders). (It's also hinted at, in Romans 1:26-27). But why are you feigning ignorance, because you deal with these passages below. :)\n \n But again, your pro-Protestant stance towards the Bible is very interesting. You look at only what the Bible says. We Orthodox work from Holy Tradition.*\n \n \n3. The story of Sodom and Gomorrah is another example of a story twisted out of context to serve the purpose of condemning homosexuality. In most Bibles if you look in the concordance for the word Sodom you will find no reference to the following passage in Ezekiel. Why? Because it debunks the myth that Sodom was destroyed because it was full of homosexuals. Ezekiel 16:49-50 [I][B]\"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them when I saw it.\"In the original text, the word translated \"abominations\" is actually,, the word for \"acts of lawlessness.\" Thus, the passage literally reads, \"they acted lawlessly before Me.\" \n\n \n That is one translation. Another says \"They were haughty and did detestable things before me\". Everyone reading it would recall the story, and know what those 'detestable' things were.\n \n \n4. The New Testament reference in I Corinthians 6:9 that many translate as homosexual are the Greek words, Malakos (literally means soft, fine or feminine) and Arsenokoites (literally means man bedders) The NT reference in Timothy is also Arsenokoites. No mention of female homosexuality in either of these two verses. Likewise these references do not condemn non promiscuous monogamous loving relationships between men. God is very clear in what he condemns throughout the Bible. For example there is no question but that adultery is impermissible. If a verse is not unambiguous it is the height of arrogance to purport to go beyond what God intended. The most that can be taken from these words in this list is that promiscuous copulation with a male is unacceptable. \n\n \n We Orthodox wrote the Bible in Greek. You are trying to teach the Greek Church how to interpret Greek! You don't understand the meaning. You suggest that the chapter in question uses two words, yet you acknowledge that \"God is very clear in what he condemns...\". Not for you.\n \n Yes, copulation of a male with another male is unacceptable. A homosexual, struggling against his sin, and not living in it is acceptable.\n \n My Church put the Bible together. It interprets it, as it should. Your selective interpretation does not stand up.\n \n \n5. Romans 1: 26-27, People often use this verse to condemn female homosexual relationships. However, in this Chapter Paul is condemning the practice of heterosexuals engaging in homosexual sex acts as part of idolatrous temple sex rituals. Homosexual acts are not natural for a heterosexual but they would be for a homosexual. In this context it is the issue of heterosexuals engaging in orgiastic homosexual sexual acts for the purpose of worshiping false Gods that Paul is concerned with, not faithful monogamous gay couples. These verses are a far cry from a clear prohibition on monogamous homosexual relationships. \n\n \n Again, the Church that wrote it, disagrees.\n \n \n6. In Matt 5:32 Christ said that , \"whomever divorces his wife, except for the cause of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and whomever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\". In Mark 10:11-12 Christ said, \" Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her; vs. 12: and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery.\" I wonder how many heterosexual people who would support a constitutional ban on gay marriage are on their second marriage? If heterosexuals want to protect the sanctity of heterosexual marriage why not a petition for a constitutional ban on divorce except for immorality and/ or a constitutional ban on adultery?\n\n \n Many things are condemned by the Bible. Divorce is wrong. Killing is wrong. Both are condemned by the Bible. However, sometimes circumstances might entail you killing someone; such as in self-defence. Our church still maintains that it is wrong - you've merely substituted one bad thing for another (your own death). How God decides to judge you for doing these wrongs is up to God. But you've still done a wrong.\n \n Divorce is still wrong. Living in a hateful relationship is wrong and married adults have to decide for themselves which wrong to choose.\n \n \n7. Matt 7:5 \"You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.\"\n\n \n If you believe Jesus is saying \"Never ever judge\" then you are wrong. He implores us to speak up against evil where and when we find it. Jesus didn't arrive as some kind of new age guru preaching a love-in. He came to show us the way back to God. Part of this is not being judgemental true, but there's a balance. Jesus appointed his Apostles as Bishops. As time progressed they added more to this number - read the letters of St. Paul. He continually harangues people for sinning - obviously he is judging people - why? Because he has been accorded the right to do so.\n \n See\n http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-07/anf07-41.htm#P5421_1955513\n On how a Bishop should judge!\n Also...\n http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-08/anf08-56.htm#P4802_1421870\n \n \n [QUOTE=Girl Esq.]8. Finally, you cannot ban gay marriage as long as any pastor is willing to perform the ceremony. You can only ban recognition of gay marriage by a government entity.\n \n A marriage enacted by such a pastor is not a sacramental marriage.\n \n \n \n *\"The church does not believe that the act of committing a sin kills a man. The man's disposition before and after is what determines his fate. Does he say \"Blessed art Thou O Lord, teach me Thy statutes\"? If he does, he will lament any transgression from God's law, especially those that are very obvious and grievous. He will struggle against his passions, and will try to amend himself. When he falls, he will get back up. He will not wallow in his sins, and make excuses. \n Someone once told me that \"homosexuals are children of God, no more sinful than myself.\" This is an extremely misleading statement, although elements of it may be true. Whether anyone is more sinful than myself, a poor sinner, I cannot say, but I do know that a homosexual is an obedient child of God only if the above conditions are followed. A homosexual who makes excuses for this sin, and does not struggle against it (notice: I did not say that he must never fall) is estranged from God. \"\n http://www.orthodox.net/articles/homosexuality.html\n \n \"When does this sin separate us from God, and cause our guardian angel to flee from us? The answer is equally clear: when the sin is not repented from. If one is living a continual, habitual lifestyle in which sexual impurity plays a major role, and this person is not struggling to correct himself, he is estranged from God. \"\n Ibid",

   "Just a quick question before I reply later at more length to this...\n \n How do you believe you have the right to interpret Scipture?\n \n The reason I ask, is because you're taking a very Protestant approach to the Bible - interpreting it for yourself as you see fit... hence you obviously don't agree with a condemnation of homosexuality in Leviticus 18:22, but you're happy to literally interpret Matthew's commendation about not judging people.\n \n I'd like to know why you've chosen some passages with a literal interpretation, and others not. Are you a Bible expert? Are you an Orthodox Christian (we're the ones who put it together and believe that the Bible can and should, only be interpreted in the context of Orthodox Faith).\n\n \n Actually the approach I am taking is neither Protestant, Catholic, Greek Orthodox or Anglican. The only legitimate body is the Body of Christ. No where in the Bible does God reveal a preference for a particular religion. Religion is man made and therefore devisive. The Royal Family of God should not be divided. Ephesians 4:2-6 says: \"Be completely humble and gentle; be patient , bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.THERE IS ONE BODY AND ONE SPIRIT --JUST AS YOU WERE CALLED TO ONE HOPE WHEN YOU WERE CALLED -- ONE LORD, ONE FAITH ONE BAPTISM; ONE GOD AND FATHER OF ALL , WHO IS OVER ALL THROUGH ALL AND IN ALL.\" \n \n Galatians 3:26 says,\" You are all sons of God through faith in Jesus Christ, for all of you who were baptized in Christ have clothed yourself with Christ, There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\"\n \n I believe that Jesus Chist is the Son of God and came to earth to die on the cross for the sins of mankind. Through his sacrifice I am redeemed. I believe I neither earned nor deserved my salvation. Ephesians 2:9 \"For it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works so that no one can boast.\" That makes me a Christian and part of the Royal Family of God. Therefore, I have a duty to try and understand what my Heavenly Father wants and expects of me and to speak openly about the what is contained in the Word of God. The only way I can know what my Heavenly Father wants, is to pray without ceasing, study scripture and learn through the teaching of an individual who has been given the spiritual gift of Pastor/Teacher. Fortunately, I do not have to rely on my own understanding, as I and every other Christian seeking discernment will be guided by the Holy Spirit who indwells us and reveals the truth of God's Word and the lies of mankind. \n \n I John 2:20 \"But you have an annointing from the Holy One and all of you know the truth.\" \n \n I Corinthians 2:10-15 \"but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. We have not received the Spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment.\" \n \n That being said, I readily acknowledge that I am a sinner and I fight from moment to moment, the urge to give into my sinful nature. (For example resisting the urge to respond in anger to someone who attacks or offends me) Some days I am more successful than others but fortunately God has promised in I John 1:9 that, \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins, and purify us from all unrighteousness.\" \n \n As for Leviticus, it is a part of the law. In Galatians 3:19-23 Paul says:\"What then was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through the angels by a mediator. A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one. Is the law therefore opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteouness would certainly have come by the law. But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Christ, might be given to those who believe. Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith. NOW THAT FAITH HAS COME WE ARE NO LONGER UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE LAW.\"\n \n Ephesians 2:14-22 \"For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace, and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross by which he put to death their hostility. He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near. For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit. Consequently you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's houshold, built on the foundation of the apostles and phrophets with Christ Jesus himself as the cheif cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.\n \n Galatians 5:4-5 \"You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.\" \n \n Galatians 5:14 \"The entire law is summed up in one single command: Love your neighbor as yourself. If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.\"\n \n Titus 3:14 \"But avoid foolish contoversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because they are unprofitable and useless.\"\n \n The entire chapter of Romans 14, instructs us not to judge another believer.",

If a particular practice is outside of a person's frame of reference they might find it unsettling or even repugnant but that does not necessarily make the practice wrong. There is a difference between cultural taboos and activities that are forbidden by God. Cultural taboos change with time and geography. I merely observed that in marrying two sisters that happened to be his cousins, Jacob did something that would be frowned upon by most Christians in the US today. Yet God blessed Jacob and nowhere does it say that Jacob's marriage was displeasing to God or that God punished him for marrying his cousins.",

   "That is in fact a Protestant approach - the belief that you can read and interpret the Bible for yourself. \n \n \n Orthodoxy, which is the Church founded by Jesus; given the gifts of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, suggests otherwise.\n Ephesians 5:25\n Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; \n Jesus established the Church - the Book of Acts is full of the doings of the early church - appointing of Bishops and divers administrative posts\n \n Recall the story of Philip and the Ethiopian? Acts 8\n 30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?\n 31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.\n \n He needed guidance in the words of God. Philip didn't say \"Interpret for yourself\"\n \n Paul's letters are full of him judging, admonishing people who have broken faith with Christian teachings. Which alone suggests you've misunderstood his meaning... unless you believe either\n a) he had special right to do what he forbade others\n or\n b) he's a hypocrite.\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:18\n Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.\n \n How is it a sin, unless it is 'judged' to be so?\n \n 1 Corinthians 4:14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.\n The whole passage is about them going astray. What does he do?\n 1 Corinthians 4:17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.\n \n \n That is, he has sent them an instructor, someone versed in the Traditions. No time does Paul say \"You've got faith in Christ, now go out and do your own thing.\n \n Not just Paul, but Peter called people back to the Church\n 1 Peter 2:25\n For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. \n \n \n Acts 10\n 1 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,\n 2 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.\n \n That is, he had 'faith' already. But what is he compelled to do? He has to call Peter, the Lord's appointed Bishop, who has the gifts of the Holy Spirit within him. Peter goes to the Centurion and baptises him. He then speaks\n 44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.\n 45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.\n 46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.\n \n Thus the Holy Spirit came to them after Peter passed the power on to them. It was through Jesus' appointed that this was possible. It was through Jesus' appointed that the faithful centurion had turned.\n \n \n Further, note at...\n Acts 10\n 28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.\n \n That is, Peter, so appointed by Jesus, has the right to decide to break with the laws of the old. In other words, the early Christian community is making decisions of dogma.\n \n The Orthodox Church is God-made. \n\n \n Montalban forgive me but it looks as though reading and interpreting the Bible for yourself, is exactly what you are doing in these posts, unless you are dictating as your priest stands beside you. Our gracious Heavenly Father has provided for all of our needs. Yes, God has given men the gift of pastor teacher and has told all believers to assemble together in the local church for worship and edification. But God has also sent the Holy Spirit to act as an enabler and to indwell all believers from the point of salvation (see I Corinthians 3:16). I exhort you to read I Corinthians Chapter 2. If we seek the truth God will provide it through the Spirit.",

   "Orthodoxy was founded at Pentecost. We put the Bible together. The proper interpretation of Scripture, then, is within the context of the Orthodox Church...] \n\n \n The church spoken of in the Word of God is the body of all believers, the Royal Family. That church consists of all of your brothers and sisters in Christ, not merely the members of your local church. Christ is the head of the Church. We are Christians, that is the faith that binds us all together as brothers and sisters in Christ. The Orthodox Church is a religion. Religion is about ritual, Christianity is about faith and worship. Read I Corinthians Chapter 3 in it Paul addresses the issue of bickering among believers about whose leader is best. I Corinthians 3-7 \"You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men? For when one says, \"I follow Paul,\" and another, \" I follow Apollos,\" are you not mere men? What after all is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe-- as the Lord has assigned to each his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who makes things grow.\"\n \n \nYou can take Scripture out of that context to mean anything you want it to... which is why there's 10,000 + different Christian denominations. \n\n \n This was the exact point of this thread. Individuals and religions have taken scripture out of its context for centuries to suit their own purposes. They pick and choose what is convenient and ignore what is inconvenient. Most people refuse to study and learn and grow. They spend an hour once a week listening to a pastor and then leave it at that. They are satisfied to be largely ignorant of God's will. We should be more like David who said in Psalms 63, \" Oh God you are my God, earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you, my body longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there is no water.\" Think about it if you rely only on your priest to teach you and never read the Bible for yourself you will never know all that the Bible says in time to use it on this earth. How many verses does your priest exegete a week? Go to church and study for yourself. You get that much more.\n \n As church age believers we have a unique opportunity to know God's truth through the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. Sadly most people waste that opportunity and glance at their Bible every so often relying only on a once a week sermon for edification. I have been guilty of as much. Believers should be studying God's Word daily. We should know it word for word but most don't. We should read and pray for discernment. God will reveal his truth to you. \n \n \nYour pastor is but one man.\n \n Orthodoxy has 2,000 years of such and other teachers within it.\n \n When you say that 1 Corinthians does or doesn't say something - that is your interpretation. The Church that put the Bible together put the books together for a reason. Just because your church comes along 1,900 years later and decides against something doesn't in my mind, decrease Orthodoxy's valdity. \n\n \n I challenge you to read Corinthians for yourself. What does your Bible say in I Corinthians 2 about the Holy Spirit? \n \n As for Paul's alleged use of the word homosexual, I challenge you to find out what the original Greek word was and how it was used at the time Paul write it. Are you arguing that Paul used the English word (homosexual) and not the Greek word (arsenokoites)? So what is the literal translation of arsenokoites? The word homosexual did not exist at the time of Paul. It was not coined until the 1800s. \n \n I also challenge you to personally study the historical context in which Paul was writing his letters to the Romans and the Corinthians. What was going on, what problems was he addressing?\n \n \nEven non-Orthodox sources recognise our history\n \"The origins of the Orthodox Church can be traced back continuously to the earliest Christian movement. So can the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Community, and many other Christian faith groups. Each has their own belief system about their group's origins.

It is my contention that your view of what is meant by Christ's Church in the New Testament is limited and inaccurate. God's Church is made up of every person who has accepted Jesus Christ as their personal savior. By Christ's blood we are made heirs and members of His Church/Royal Family. By your definition I am not a member of Christ's Church because I do not belong to your Orthodox religion. However, Christ established the Church with his blood and with his blood he made us whole, each person who would believe on him. Acts 20: 28 Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepards of the Church of God, WHICH HE BOUGHT WITH HIS OWN BLOOD.\" Christ did not just buy your congregation with his own blood he bought all believers with his own blood.

The early church wrote dozens of books before the Bible. Do you consult any of these? What about the Didache - written in 120AD?\n \n \n \n *Acts 20:28\n Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you bishops. Be shepherds of the church of God,[ 20:28 Many manuscripts of the Lord] which he bought with his own blood. \n Philippians 1:1\n Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the bishops and deacons: \n 1 Timothy 3:1\n Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an bishop; also in verse 2] he desires a noble task. \n Titus 1:7\n Since a bishop is entrusted with God's work, he must be blameless-not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.\n \n The Church was quite clearly hierarchical. Peter was deemed to be the leader. The Church leaders made decisions on matters.\n \n See what early Christians thought on personal interpretations:\n http://www.cin.org/users/jgallegos/private.htm\n\n \n Heaven and earth shall pass away but my\n \n Words shall not pass away (Mat. 24:35)\n \n All Scripture is God breathed, and is profitable\n \n for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction\n \n in righteousness, that the man of God might be mature,\n \n thoroughly furnished unto all good works (2 Tim.3:16-17)\n \n Study to show yourselves approved unto God,\n \n a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly\n \n dividing the Word of Truth. (2 Tim. 2:15)\n \n \n \n My only concern is for what God commands. You obviously value the word of men and silly rituals more than God. From this point on I am going to have to let you argue with yourself and just agree to disagree. However, I will pray for you.",

   "My own personal feelings have told me from my first feelings of attraction, that I am exclusively attracted to people of the same sex.\n \n \n Sorry, that's not what I meant.\n \n You assert that Gays are being suicidal/repressed because religious people are telling them that they're wrong - and therefore depressing them with 'guilt'.\n \n I believe that homosexuality is a sin.\n \n But you've yet to show that gay people listen to my opinion. If they don't - how are they feeling guilt? Who are they listening to? Who is putting them down.\n \n There's no causality, because there's no connexion between the two sets of beliefs.\n \n (Perhaps it's their own inner-voice telling them it's wrong; but like your theory that's just speculation)\n \n So...\n \n \nMy link showed the consensus of opinion in opposition to so-called reparation therapy or conversion therapy among health professional organizations. If that is not acceptable to you, so be it.\n\n \n That's okay, I understand if you have no facts. You present a site that suggests the same as you - Christians putting homosexuals down - this despite the fact it lists dozens of Christian and other religious / non-religious groups that support homosexuals. Obviously you are trying to suggest that despite this mass of encouragement, one negative group has caught their attention... and they are paying such heed to this group, it's depressing them and driving them to (some unknown figure of) suicide.\n \n What consensus? A group says that one religious body is repressive. So?\n \n To look at it another way...\n \n I mean, the NRA is pro-gun. I am against guns. The NRA writes all manner of things about commie/left-winger/liberal notions that I have. I am said to be undemocratic, anti-USA, anti-freedom etc. But, frankly I don't give a frig. It's not depressing me. It's not driving me to suicide, because, I know I'm right.\n \n And also, some non-religious people discriminate against homsexuals. You focus on one religious group as if that is a normative cause for homosexual suicides.\n \n Your argument boils down to opinion based on your own anti-religious feelings, no more.",

   "Sexuality is a much more important part of a person's identity, compared to political ideology.\n \n Homosexuals are a minority who often lack the supports of family and peers that heterosexuals take for granted. Unlike racial minorities, homosexuals cannot turn to parents, because those parents are sometimes hostile toward their son's or daughter's identity.\n \n Gay and lesbian people often feel isolated from the age of their first sexual feelings, as a result. If young gay people are taught in family and from peers, or from some trusted authority figures(religious or otherwise), that this important part of their unchosen identity, their sexuality, is bad, of course they are going to feel bad about who they are. Hopefully, the gay person can find some good supports somewhere. \n \n I can't prove that one's sexuality is unchosen and unchangeable, because sexuality involves deeply personal feelings. How would I go about proving that? I know my exclusive attraction to people of the same sex, which I talked about earlier, is unchosen and unchangeable, and it is good(for me). Those who can be \"changed\", either from gay to straight, or from straight to gay, probably were not the original sexuality in the first place.",
