   "From speaking with a bunch of antis (they're everywhere here in NJ) I figured out how to really stop them in their tracks. Rather than being like, \"What did the people ever do to make you not trust them with arms?\", say, \"What have I ever done that makes me unworthy of owning a gun?\"\n \n There is no way to argue against this, unless you're a convict or a delinquent. Antis may say: \"It's not that you personally have done something, it's just not a good idea to trust most people with arms,\" in that case just say, \"Well then obviously you'd have easy means for me to obtain arms, right?\" they'll say, \"Why easy?\" say, \"Because I really don't have time to get through a bunch of government red-tape in times of crisis.\"\n \n Using this argument I've never lost, because of the fact that I am a responsible person, and when you make people see that, and the fact that most people are in fact to be trusted with arms, they may reconsider their views.",
