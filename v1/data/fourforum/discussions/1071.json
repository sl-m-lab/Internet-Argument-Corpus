   "I think that is an important distinction, and too many people don't make it.\n \n IMHO, we already have strict gun control designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Felons are not allowed to own guns, nor are you allowed to use a gun in the commission of a crime.\n \n All the other XXXX just makes it more difficult for the rest of us.\n \n The second amendment question in regards to concealed carry is a simple one. \"Shall not be infringed\". It does not say \"shall only be infringed a little\".\n \n I have heard people say that you have no constitutional right to defend yourself. You also have no constitutional right to privacy. We expect to be able to defend ourselves, and we expect privacy. The fact that a right is not specifically recognised in the constitution does not mean that we do not have it.",

Could you tell me roughly where in the opinion the 2nd amendment is mentioned? Thanks in advance.\n\n Look for this paragraph-\n \"But we are also of opinion that, even if the contract of a seaman could be considered within the letter of the thirteenth amendment, it is not, within its spirit, a case of involuntary servitude. The law is perfectly well settled that the first 10 amendments to the constitution, commonly known as the 'Bill of Rights,' were not intended to lay down any novel principles of government, but simply to embody certain guaranties and immunities which we had inherited from our English ancestors, and which had, from time immemorial, been subject to certain well-recognized exceptions, arising from the necessities of the case. In incorporating these principles into the fundamental law, there was no intention of disregarding the exceptions, which continued to be recognized as if they had been formally expressed. Thus, the freedom of speech and of the press ( article 1) does not permit the publication of libels, blasphemous or indecent articles, or other publications injurious to public morals or private reputation; the right of the people [165 U.S. 275, 282] to keep and bear arms (article 2) is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons; the provision that no person shall be twice put in jeopardy (article 5) does not prevent a second trial, if upon the first trial the jury failed to agree, or if the verdict was set aside upon the defendant's motion (U. S. v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 627 , 16 S. Sup. Ct. 1192); nor does the provision of the same article that no one shall be a witness against himself impair his obligation to testify, if a prosecution against him be barred by the lapse of time, a pardon, or by statutory enactment (Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591 , 16 Sup. Ct. 644, and cases cited). Nor does the provision that an accused person shall be confronted with the witnesses against him prevent the admission of dying declarations, or the depositions of witnesses who have died since the former trial.\"\n http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/getcase/us/165/275.html",
