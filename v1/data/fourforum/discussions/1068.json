   "ye shall know the tree by the fruit it bears\n \n \n I shall show several instances typical of the man Martin Luther. He was a man, remember, and not God. The Church he established, therefore was a man-made Church. Not a Christ-made Church. The Church Christ established is without error and continues to this day, despite the best efforts of Martin Luther.\n \n Martin Luther claimed to rest all his defence on Scripture...\n \n How did he treat the Bible?\n \n \"...the reformers did not translate (the Bible) for the sake of pure detached scholarship...Defending his translating methods in 1530, Luther justified adding the word 'alone' to his translation of Romans 3:38 ['we conclude that a man is justified by faith alone'] partly with reference to native German idioms; but also in terms of his principal dogma. In other words, the reformer arrived at his beliefs (through Scripture) and then interpreted and translated Scripture as it best conformed to those beliefs...\n One the Bible had been 'corrected', translated, and interpreted, then (and only then, one might say!) it was offered to the people. Since the reformers appealed to Scripture as their source of authority, they represented themselves to their audience as proclaiming the 'truths' of Scripture...\"\n Cameron, E., (1991) \"The European Reformation\", Clarendon Press, Oxford, p141.\n \n When the peasants of Germany wanted political and social reformation as well, Luther was horrified by the outbreak of 'the Peasant's War'. He wrote numerous against peasants: (http://www.historyguide.org/earlymod/peasants1525.html).\n \n He used Biblical texts to suppress dissent. \"Luther uses the same arguments as do the Anabaptists, appeals to the same Biblical texts. he calls all true Christian believers to love the enemy, to bear the cross willingly, suffering even under an unjust regime. If you suffer the injustice of a tyrannical regime, it might well be that God wants to chastise you? That is no grounds for taking it into your own hands to change the regime (\"Whether Soldiers . . .,\" Works, 46:108-114).\n Is there then no recourse at all for the victims of tyranny? Yes, there may well be, in the providence of God, but not through the uprising of Christians subjects.\"\n http://www.nd.edu/~theo/jhy/writings/justwar/justrevo.htm\n \n Not only this, but he relished in the butchery against the peasants!\n \"Ironically, the Peasants' War of 1525 may have resulted in part from Luther's own speeches. Although he detested the use of force, he did not realize the effects of his own words on his listeners. Luther often lacked self-control in his speaking, and his messages fell like sledgehammers on the minds of the oppressed people. \n He always opposed violence, however. As the fighting continued, he eventually felt compelled to write a very strong tract, Against the Murderous Thieving Hordes of Peasants. In this terrible pamphlet Luther encouraged the princes to stab, smite, and slay the rebels. After the peasants were defeated, he lost much of his support among the common people. [George Wolfgang Forell, The Luther Legacy (Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing House, 1983), p. 61] This dark episode may be the greatest blot on Luther and his noble career.\"\n http://www.martinluther.info/wittenburg/\n \n In a similar fashion, \"At the beginning of his career, Luther was apparently sympathetic to Jewish resistance to the Catholic Church. He wrote, early in his career:\n The Jews are blood-relations of our Lord; if it were proper to boast of flesh and blood, the Jews belong more to Christ than we. I beg, therefore, my dear Papist, if you become tired of abusing me as a heretic, that you begin to revile me as a Jew.\n But Luther expected them to convert to his purified Christianity. When they did not, he turned violently against Jews.\"\n http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Luther_on_Jews.html\n \n But not only was he against Jews and Catholics, but also other Christians (see: Shelley, Harold P. \"Opposition To Radical Reform: Martin Luther Against Anabaptists and Radicals.\" An article written in the 1996 Alliance Academic Review (Camp Hill, PA: Christian Publications)). Martin Luther urged the violent suppression of Anabaptists. He began to become just as 'dogmatic' as the church he railed against.",
