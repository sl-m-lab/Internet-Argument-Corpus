I fully believed them for 30 years ( I was 15 years old in 1969) but in about 1999 when I was encouraged to put them to the test, my belief easily crashed, as it would with most people if they would do some basic questioning of it.

Its not proof that we never got there, just helps add to the doubt that we did.\n\n The technology was not suffucient 40 years ago to keep humans alive in space for extended periods of time. We were in a race with the USSR. It was a matter of national pride, cultural achievement, and scientific innovation. We sent men to the moon on the most limited of systems, with little to no safety net in place. It's not like we could just leave those guys out there and tell them to set up camp. Since the last moon landing, we have spent 30 years in earth orbit learning more about what we need to survive extended periods of time in space, studying much of what may eventially allow us to take the next step of setting up some sort of permanent or semi-perminent life in space. Look at the space station. Much of the astronaut corp has gone from being highly skilled Navy and Air Force pilots trained to do a few simple experiments to being scientists and PhD's that have greatly increased our knowledge of physics, biology, and engineering as pertaining to space travel and living. We have come a long way in the last 40 years.

Certainly not by any authority I know about<b></b>: Outer Space Treaty - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n From there:\n \nThe Outer Space Treaty represents the basic legal framework of international space law. Among its principles, it bars States Parties to the Treaty from placing nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction in orbit of Earth, installing them on the Moon or any other celestial body, or to otherwise station them in outer space. It exclusively limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations, and fortifications (Art.IV). However, the Treaty does not prohibit the placement of conventional weapons in orbit.\n \n The treaty explicitly forbids any government from claiming a celestial resource such as the Moon or a planet, since they are the Common heritage of mankind.[1] Art. II of the Treaty states, in fact, that \"outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means\". The pendant for giving up sovereignty in outer space is the jurisdiction and control that the State that launches a space object retains. According to Manfred Lachs, jurisdiction and control is giving the means to the State to conduct a mission of space exploration\n \n\n This was signed and put into force by Great Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union (99 total countries have signed and ratified) in 1967 - two years before the US landed on the moon.\n \n So I would dearly love to see unkerpaulie's evidence for his claim.",

   "This is an issue that isn't (or shouldn't be) as intense as political or worldview debates, because I think the time will come, possibly in the not too distant future, when it will be proven once and for all if Apollo was real. The proof will come via clear proof of the existance or non-existance of the various equipment that was left behind on the moon. For a skeptic such as myself, the pictures linked in post #3 don't come close to getting it done. We should have the technology to get better pictures, and we need someone besides NASA to get them. China is in the process of putting up lunar orbiters, and it seems to me they should have a neutral interest in finding out what the truth is. \n \n Only if a person starts out with some faith in the matter do the \"proofs\" from posts 22, 24, or 30 mean a thing. They're the equivalent of a Christian claiming that since the Bible claims God exists, that's proof that God exists. That gets a chuckle from atheists, why should NASA's pictures and claims of paperclip accurate measurments not get a chuckle from skeptics? They've done some amazing dances - I'll get into one below. They may have actually gone to the moon, but something is fishy, something is being covered up. The \"other countries tracked it\" mantra is as questionable to me as anything else - there's no proof that any country in 1969, including the Soviet Union, were capable of tracking anything more than NASA allowed them to track. A spaceship heading toward the moon isn't the same as men walking on the moon. \n \n The last time I was on-line (several nights ago) I saw somewhere - don't remember where - that skepticism, national and international, is slightly on the increase concerning apollo. It makes sense, the \"giant leap for mankind\" doesn't seem to be there 40 years later. Claims that apollo enhanced our current space programs are just that - claims. Younger people seem less likely to believe it - they don't have the passion for John F. Kennedy (the promiser of a man on the moon) that was very much present in 1969, only 6 years after he was murdered. \n \n I'm only \"agnostic\" about it, I'm not firmly convinced it wasn't done. But there are two different, unrelated ways to study and form an opinion on it, and they both fail my (admitedly layman, unscientific) tests. \n \n 1)One is, of course, an analyzation of the video and pictures, the mechanics of it, all the technical, scientific data about how it was physically done. \n \n 2)The second one is the follow up of it all for the next 40 years. Not so much the technologies, but the basics of what happened (read, what DID NOT happen) from 1969 to today. \n \n As the opening poster quoted me in post #1;\n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] The Apollo \"moon landings\" are one prime example. I fully believed them for 30 years ( I was 15 years old in 1969) but in about 1999 when I was encouraged to put them to the test, my belief easily crashed, as it would with most people if they would do some basic questioning of it. They don't. \n\n \n It was somewhere around 1999, maybe early 2000's (I don't remember, it doesn't matter) that I saw the tapes made by David Percy and James Collier, both from England I think. They had freeze frames, zoom ins, speculation about radiation belts, etc, they had many different \"proofs\" that it was faked, and there's no question they tried really hard. In some ways I thought they tried too hard! One of their issues was how calm Armstrong and Aldrin seemed to be as the \"Eagle\" was landing - they were skeptical of the lack of excitement in their voices. I think that suspicion can easily be discarded - In a few news reports over the years I've heard actual tapes of airplane pilots describing their situation when coming in for an emergency landing. They are trained to be calm and clear no matter what the circumstances. I distinctly remember one pilot (don't remember the plane size or if he had passengers) calmly saying \"yes, we will\", when answering a question from the ground if he needed \"equipment\" - fire trucks and ambulances, upon landing. About 2 minutes later he was dead. So that was one area I think Percy and Collier tried too hard, and makes me wonder about their complete honesty. But the shadow issue, and well as other things closely analyzed in the photos and videos, are very questionable. There's plenty of back and fourth on that on the internet, and there's nothing to be gained by rehashing much of that here - it seldom changes minds. \n \n So what I'd like to get into more here is what I haven't noticed anywhere else - a look at the lack of follow up of the past 40 years, as well as the non-technical stuff of 1969, the hype and fanfare. \n \n There's little question that NASA would have loved it if their government superior(s) whoever they were, or President Kennedy, would have told them \"we don't care about a TV show - we just want you to go to the moon, bring back some astronauts descriptions and a few rocks, and we'll cut you a check for $27 billiion. Forget the camaras, an American flagpole, and all of that. You've got enough stuff to carry - worry about weight, safety, life support. BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT, DID THEY? It was more like - you WILL give us a TV show, you WILL make sure there's a camara all ready as the first man goes down the ladder, and our board of executives already have the perfect line for him figured out to say as he steps on the surface of the moon! (too bad he screwed it up - more on that later)\n \n If there's one thing eveyone should be able to agree on, it's that fanfare was an important part of the Apollo moon landings. Those who believe it was all on the up and up can say it was an extra, and that it didn't interfere with other things, but they can't say it wasn't a big part of it. What are some others opinions about fanfare? All I'll say at this point is that fanfare and truth don't automatically correlate. \n \n The biggest red flag for me in the whole situation is the lost knowledge of the entire Apollo program. It was either intentionally destroyed, or a lot of people made a lot of mistakes. \n \n From a four year old source;\n \n \nIt has been 33 years since the US landed its last astronaut on the moon. From 1969 to 1972, the US landed 12 astronauts on the lunar surface, but according to a recent report in the New York Times, most of the knowledge from the Apollo programme that sent men to the moon has been lost and the US probably couldn't go back to the moon today even if it wanted to.\n NASA has 'forgotten' how because engineers who built the original Saturn V rocket retired from the space agency in the 1990s without leaving any collective memory. Important blueprints were never catalogued. \n\n \n And from author David W Delong;\n \n \n...sometime in the 1990's NASA has lost the knowledge it had deveolped to send astronauts to the moon. In an area of cost cutting and downsizing, the engineers who designed the huge Saturn 5 rocket used to launch the Lunar landing craft were encouraged to take an early retirement from the space program. With them went years of experience and expertise about the design trade-offs that had been made in building the Saturn rockets. Also lost were what appear to be the last set of critical blueprints for the Saturn booster which was the only rocket ever built with enough thrust to launch a manned lunar payload. One NASA manager confessed if we want to go to the moon again, we'll be starting from scratch because all of that knowledge has disappeared. It would take at least as long and cost at least as much to go back. \n\n \n Lost knowledge: confronting the ... - Google Books\n \n \n I don't know how many paid NASA spokemen we have, if they all have their stories straight, or even if this one that I found is official. But it should show anyone with an open mind that, uh Houston, we have a problem. Here it is in question and answer form, (last one on this page) \n \n \n32. Why did ALL of the blueprints and plans for the Lunar Module and Moon Buggy get destroyed if this was one of History's greatest accomplishments?\n \n The aren't all destroyed. Many of the detailed plans for the Apollo hardware are on microfilm at the United States National Archives. \n Unfortunately the design documentation for something as complicated as a space ship or the lunar rover is not something that just comfortably fits in a file cabinet. It typically occupies several hundred thousand cubic feet. Grumman engineers were, at one point, producing more than 4,000 drawings per week. In addition, each unit produced requires installation, service, and modification documentation for each individual part on the unit. \n Congress provided no funding for the storage and archive of the detailed design documentation. The private companies who had custody of it did not have the funds nor the desire to archive materials that required an inconveniently large building in which to house it. They are for-profit companies, not museums. Thus the detailed documentation was regretfully discarded while the basic documentation was preserved. \n There is a very large amount of information available on the design and construction of these spacecraft, both in print and online. \n\n \n According to the two links above, some critical basic documentation was NOT preserved. Congress didn't provide money for filing cabinets?? Do all true believers in the Apollo program not see a problem with this, in light of all the other suspicions of it all?",

To swallow his pride and ignore the jeers and jests from those who persecuted him even unto utter death and torture.\n \n So I've decided to emulate the very savior YOU claim to follow and preach about so virulently and take the high road.
