   "I found this article of interest over at Police On Line dot com. \n \n   8 tips on contacts with 'open carry' citizens \n&#8230;\n I support the right to both own and carry a weapon for self defense, sport, or what have you. This right is supported and articulated both in the United States Constitution and in applicable laws found nationwide. I am also in support of law enforcement officers and others who wish to be able to feel safer in their dealings with people on the street. In the end, we have to look at what the law allows and be able to deal with a legal activity, regardless of our personal feelings on the matter.\n \n Open carry doesn&#8217;t fit into the hunting or sporting use of firearms. It really isn&#8217;t about hunting or sport shooting. It&#8217;s about the fundamental right of self defense and is a form of political protest. There are many internet forum discussions on open carry that deal specifically with this type of organized protest.\n \n  Officer Safety Issues \n As with concealed carry, there seems to be a lot of hypothetical rhetoric in regards to threat situations of &#8220;what could happen?&#8221; versus &#8220;what does history show us has happened?&#8221; Is there a heightened state of criminal activity associated with open carry versus concealed carry versus no carry (other than the obvious firearms violation for school zone or whatnot)? \n \n The answer appears to be &#8220;not really.&#8221; Regardless of opinions or beliefs, there is not a spike in criminal activity associated with merely carrying a firearm. The same is true of concealed carry. It is always the intent of the person, not the firearm, that matters.\n \n Practical Tactics & Strategies \n So, what can you do as a law enforcement officer or, as a citizen who will read this article on various forums nationwide? Here are some thoughts to ponder as well as tips to go by.\n 1.) Open carry is a legal right. Regardless of where personal beliefs may lie, it carries the weight of law and cannot be ignored, pushed aside, or worked around. \n \n 2.) Understand that &#8212; as with any belief that people feel strongly about &#8212; open carry is a form of political protest. While the majority will do what is asked of them without a lot of fuss, there will be extremists who are willing to be political martyrs by doing whatever it takes to push their agenda and raise awareness to their cause. \n \n 3.) Targeting open carry by finding ways to charge people with other violations and then ticketing or arresting them may backfire and could be very expensive in the long run. One of the universities in Utah apparently tried this approach and it was leaked to the press. Now we run into civil liberties violations, etc. \n \n 4.) Know the letter of the law and the interpretations of the law in various districts. Have a written document that can be referred to online or given to those parties interested in them. \n \n 5.) Even if you don&#8217;t agree with open carry, stay objective and keep your feelings to yourself. It is the behavior of the person &#8212; not the gun &#8212; that we key on. If they get annoyed and start protesting you, remember that unless they are threatening you with harm, they have a right to voice their opinion, even if they raise their voice at you. \n \n 6.) It still takes time to draw and load the firearm. It can be done in around two seconds for well trained individuals. As with any contact, watch the hands and body language. \n \n 7.) Follow good judgment. IF THERE IS PROBABLE CAUSE to treat them as an armed criminal, by all means do so. However, when you make contact with someone carrying openly without good probable cause, the strategy of &#8220;when in doubt, prone &#8216;em out&#8221; would not be my first choice. Keep your distance if you can, and ask questions so you can get some indicators of the mental/emotional state of the contact prior to moving in closer. \n \n 8.) From a officer safety perspective, at least you KNOW that they are carrying a weapon! That knowledge alone will keep you from becoming complacent. Think of it as an opportunity to practice your officer safety tactics.\n \n Conclusion \n The right to self defense &#8212; as well as the right to keep and bear arms &#8212; is fundamental and has huge support in this country. Open carry has come about because of perceived government infringement on those rights. You as a law enforcement officer will be looked upon as part of that infringement and will incur indignation, hostility, and anger expressed as verbal or non-verbal protest. Don&#8217;t take it personally. They see government when you contact them. Stay calm, professional, watchful, and respectful. \n\n More at website.",

   "I like the way you edited out the inconvenient portions of the article.emoticon_xkill\n \n \"The common perceptions of a person carrying openly is an escalation of perceived threat, potential for violence, possibility of the weapon carrier being targeted during criminal activity such as a bank robbery, and the possibility of an &#8220;untrained&#8221; person causing more harm than good in violent encounters. Add to that list the general unease from people who are simply not comfortable with the idea of people who are not cops, not in uniform, but running around with guns on their hips.\"\n \n sinjin - Wonder where the townsfolk ever came by their unease? Cultural memory? Movies?\n \n Officer Safety Issues \n \"Imagine dealing with a carload of people with guns on and having them step out of the car to confront you, no matter how peaceful their intent or actions might be. Raise the bar by having them challenge your legal authority to check them, regardless of their lack of resistance. It simply raises tensions on both sides. I dealt with this type of situation from time to time as a deputy sheriff and having to deal with posse comitatus members and other similar types in Colorado.\"\n \n sinjin - I think the advice to officers says it all:\n \n \"Keep your distance if you can, and ask questions so you can get some indicators of the mental/emotional state of the contact prior to moving in closer.\"\n \n sinjin - Good advice for all of us.",

Kline V Lis. \n \n NOW!\n Color of law\n \n   Color of Law \n U.S. law enforcement officers and other officials like judges, prosecutors, and security guards have been given tremendous power by local, state, and federal government agencies-authority they must have to enforce the law and ensure justice in our country. These powers include the authority to detain and arrest suspects, to search and seize property, to bring criminal charges, to make rulings in court, and to use deadly force in certain situations. \n \n Preventing abuse of this authority, however, is equally necessary to the health of our nation's democracy. That's why it's a federal crime for anyone acting under \"color of law\" willfully to deprive or conspire to deprive a person of a right protected by the Constitution or U.S. law. \"Color of law\" simply means that the person is using authority given to him or her by a local, state, or federal government agency. \n\n That makes anyone who prevents the free exercise of it, a Criminal! So belly up to the bar and take responsibility for your criminal actions. emoticon_smile\n \n What? \n \n Too strong? \n \n Just fooling around with the anti-gunners, and an undeniable truth! :) \n \n Sorry. :)",

A permit is not required to carry this way. Carrying a pistol openly on the hip is not breaking the law. This action in and of itself alone is not a basis for a stop.\n \n Neither is carrying a gun openly disorderly conduct or inducing panic. If an officer engages in conversation with a person who is carrying a gun openly, but otherwise not committing a crime, the person cannot be required to produce identification. The law does specify that a person may not carry a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle except under the provisions set forth for a person who possesses a concealed handgun license (CHL).\n \n It is rare that people carry this way in Akron. However, if you do come across a person with a gun holstered in plain view, think before you act. Is he breaking any law? Is he threat? Is he doing anything that constitutes a Terry stop? If not, be cautious, keep on eye on his actions and let him go about his way.\n ______________________________________________\n Sgt. Jeff Mullins, Training Bureau. Reviewed and Approved by Police Legal Advisor, Mr. Tom DiCaudo, Asst.\n Prosecutor, City of Akron.\n\n Treated like a leper, my Behind! Not in Ohio. Just wait until this gets to the Supreme Court, WHICH, California seems to be doing a bang up job of making happen. emoticon_smile \n \n Here SNORT THIS boded part of Ohio law! \n \n9.68 Right to bear arms - challenge to law.\n (A) The individual right to keep and bear arms, being a fundamental individual right that predates the United States Constitution and Ohio Constitution, and being a constitutionally protected right in every part of Ohio, the general assembly finds the need to provide uniform laws throughout the state regulating the ownership, possession, purchase, other acquisition, transport, storage, carrying, sale, or other transfer of firearms, their components, and their ammunition. Except as specifically provided by the United States Constitution, Ohio Constitution, state law, or federal law, a person, without further license, permission, restriction, delay, or process, may own, possess, purchase, sell, transfer, transport, store, or keep any firearm, part of a firearm, its components, and its ammunition. \n \n ... (1) The possession, transporting, or carrying of firearms, their components, or their ammunition include, but are not limited to, the possession, transporting, or carrying, openly or concealed on a person&#8217;s person or concealed ready at hand, of firearms, their components, or their ammunition.\n\n Constitutional and codified!

   "Problem. Sometimes, in Concealed Carry, carry guns accidentally become visible. That initiates calls to the police of a man with a gun call. Before, that meant the the whole department was called out, and the innocent man or woman had several guns pointed at them, proned out, in a dangerous traffic stop. NOW here in Ohio, however, the dispatcher says Ms, or Sir, this may not be a violation of the law. Tell me what they were doing? Were the robbing the store, or just paying for their gas? Before, the S.C. and their Open Cary decision, that minor accident constituted a violation of the law.

Not just that there are no laws against it?\n \n Remembering that Scalea said that there is no Constitutionally protected Right to Concealed Carry. He was QUOTING our Supreme Court who said the exact same thing, when rendering the verdict. However, they also included that our legislature, with the guidance of Ohio Police departments, said Concealed Carry imposed a particular danger to our police, so, with this in mind, they made Concealed Carry laws. The court said, Concealed Carry CAN be regulated, because Open Carry was a viable option, and therefore the Concealed Carry laws met the rules of scrutiny. The Bear Part of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms.\n \n Now it seems that you want to argue the reverse. Sorry, but you can&#8217;t have it both ways. With a stroke of the pen, Concealed Carry laws can become restrictive yet again. Thus leaving us with no constitutionally protected option. Something IS a protected Right. Discuss it among yourselves, and get back to me when you decide which it is. \n \n What is it going to be?\n \n Man!

Open carry has become an issue in a lot of states because people with valid concealed carry permits have been arrested when their concealed weapon comes into view (jacket blows back, etc...). Many states that have passed concealed carry have had to go back and pass open carry laws to head off overzealous, anti gun, law enforcement officers.\n \n That said, odds are that if you are wandering down the street and see somebody openly carrying, you are looking at a putz and, no, I do not exempt police officers from that statement. I think most of them are putzes as well. \n \n From a tactical standpoint, a private citizen carrying openly is a tactical nightmare. Nothing screams \"Shoot me FIRST, and RIGHT AWAY\" like a .44 hanging from your belt. It removes pretty much all non lethal possibilities from anybody who might wish to do you harm. It also provides a MAJOR incentive to rob you because that gun is easy to turn into cash or drugs on the street. Carrying a weapon does not really make you harder to take out. It just assures that a would be assailant is going to shoot you in the face as soon as you come around a corner as opposed to just waving a gun at you and stealing your wallet. 99% of the advantage that comes from concealed carry is the element of surprise. It allows you to escalate the encounter beyond what your adversary is able/willing to accept. Walking around with a gun on your hip is like a general sending the enemy a complete roster of his men and firepower. It is a stupid idea. \n \n Now, before somebody tosses out \"cops carry openly\", I will lay that one out for all those who are not bright enough to figure it out on your own. Cops carry openly because they already enjoy a degree of deference. They do not get that because of the gun at their hip. They get it from the fact they can pick up the radio and get 500 more guys with guns in 3 minutes. That is the reason that people dont kill cops in general if they can avoid it. Most people are not afraid of a single cop...I mean...we are talking about a guy with a below average IQ (and yes...they do test them to ensure this) and the minimal amount of training that the law requires. They are not afraid of the cop, they are afraid of the hundreds of cops that will follow if they just shoot that XXXXX who is writing them a speeding ticket. You take down one of them, and they will throw the entire world at you. \n \n If you have that kind of pull in your community, go ahead and carry openly. I wont call you a putz. Then again, if you have that kind of pull and backing in your community, you probably dont feel like you need to carry a gun. \n \n I dont personally care if a putz carries a gun openly. If it makes him feel good to look like a putz, more power to him. \n \n That said, tactically it is a bad idea, and you are pretty much just doing it as a fashion statement because that gun that everybody knows about is not going to do you any good. \n \n Then again, I think it is a stupid idea to get a concealed carry permit. It is amazing to me that so many people who go absolutely nuts at the idea of registering weapons line up to PAY to get their name put on a list of gun owners. I am not nearly as anti registration as some folks around here, but I am not dumb enough to put my name on a list like that. If I feel like my life is threatened and I need to be carrying a gun, I will. I dont really care what the law says about it. It will be concealed, so nobody will know. Other than that it is so rare that I have to blow somebody away on the way to the gas station to get my soda that I just dont feel like I generally need to pack heat. My days just dont involve that many shootings.",

I've yet to encounter a single one I'd describe as \"anti-gun\".\n\n \n I have. Several of them. They considering carrying a gun a privilege for \"them\". Not us. \n \n You are expecting our legal system to be intelligent. It is not. I have had many, many attorneys tell me over the years some variation on \"Our legal system is not fair, it is not just, it is not intelligent. It is what we have got, though, so you had better get used to it\". I also once had one tell me \"I am going to charge you about $15,000 on this case and you are not going to get any justice at all. If you want justice, I know a guy who will deliver all the justice you want for about $500 and even film it for you so you can enjoy it over and over. Courts have nothing at all to do with justice. They are there to screw the other guy over\".\n \n IF you previously had laws that made openly carrying weapons illegal, and you then pass a concealed carry law, if somebody is carrying a gun and it is not concealed, they are breaking the law. \n \n Any reasonable person would recognize the stupidity in this. WE are not talking about reasonable people. We are talking about a justice system that is in no way reasonable. \n \n To make that activity legal (the carrying of a weapon that is not concealed) they would have to actually go back and remove the law that made it illegal. \n \n At one time it was a defense that your violation of the law was not willful. For example, the wind blew your jacket open so the cop saw your uzi. In that circumstance you would have been clear because you did not willfully wear your uzi in an open manner, you took steps to ensure that it was concealed in accordance with the law. The legal concept is known as Mens Rea (guilty mind). For all intents and purposes, Mens Rea is dead as a defense. Our legal system has become so complex that you can literally set out to discover whether something is legal or not, ask 2 different seasoned attorneys, and get 2 different answers. \n \n When your legal system is that screwed up, removing Mens Rea as a defense is a necessity. If 2 attorneys cant agree on whether something is legal or not establishing Mens Rea is an exercise in stupidity, so we have pretty much done away with it.",
