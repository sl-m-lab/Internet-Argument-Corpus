   "Most of the people protesting for peace are protesting for communism, the most violent and oppressive form of government imaginable. Did you know that Saddam Hussein is a socialist? The Baath Party is a socialist party. We should have known we would have to defeat him later, based on this alone. However, the desire for retribution, with respect to Iran, caused us to step out of character and act opposite to the norm at that time. \n \n Some of the worst scumbags imaginable have been socialists. No wonder some people are so quick to defend the man. No wonder he allowed a British socialist to interview him. No wonder the Workers World Party is funding antiwar protests. No wonder France, Germany, China, and Russia are defending him. No wonder the democrats are attacking the president first and aligning themselves with these anti-American forces. Socialists are too transparent.",

   "They were absolutely a completely participatory democracy.\n \n The Haudenosaunee Grand Council functioned by consensus of the sachems (\"chiefs\") of all nations in the confederacy. The sachems made their decisions based on consensus among their people. No person was ever required to follow a \"law\" they did not agree to, and no \"law\" was enforced by anything more forceful than public dissaproval.\n \n If you want to call the sachems \"representatives\", go ahead, but I think you should differenciate in that case between people who function basically as spokespeople, and politicians, who are essentially elected and then do as they please.\n \n There were also other systems of checks-and-balances that allowed for the dismissal of sachems who did not do as their people wished, as well as direct consensus in the case of major decisions, and veto power in the case of proposed warfare.\n \n There was a women's council and women representatives, which had seperate powers and responsibilities.\n \n All members of all clans of all Nations had the power to have a say in the running of their Nation, in all areas, with respect for the fact that certain people had more investment in certain issues.\n \n And yet, they managed to live relatively very peacefully, raise children, feed themselves, live together, trade, for thousands of years.\n \n No cops. No jails. No military. No politicians.\n \n So, obviously, it can be done, and in fact was the norm in America until the 1600s...\n \n edited to add: This is also the system that most Haudenosaunee traditionals propose re-instituting, along with the Great Treaty of Peace. Interference by foreign states such as the US and Canada have outlawed their governmental and other practices, and their sovereignty in general.",
