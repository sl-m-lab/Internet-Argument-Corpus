   "The Latter Rain movement is apparently an offshoot of a revival movement(for lack of a better term) which I was born into. (I found this out today! I'd thought I had been born into the Latter Rain, while it seems that the particular group I'm involved with is somewhat different.) \n \n Basically, in 1948, there was a revival at North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada. It is apparently quite well-known, more than I'd expected, considering the number of related web-sites I found. Anyhow if you're curious, a monthly newsletter The Sharon Star can be found here: http://thesharonstar.org/\n \n Anyone interested, please read a few articles. The site also has a short statement of our beliefs. I couldn't find anything else about my particular group, althought their is plenty about the Latter Rain movement.\n \n What I want to know is if you would consider our beleifs heresey or blasphemous. It seems to be the main opinion, judging by web sites, that the Latter Rain movement is feared and criticized, but they are different from us.",

Qualifications of an elder are in titus and timothy. \n \n I too am uncertain as to the definition of apostolic elder. \n \n The doctrine does seem mostly mainstream christian, although I am inclined to see this as a \"church of God Holiness\" denomination. I think it may be on the same order as the assemblies of God but the tongues thing is an indication of a slightly more \"evangelical\" church.",
