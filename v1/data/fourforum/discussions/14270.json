It tells people that they don't have to try, that if they're a member of a minority then they'll be advanced even if they're at the bottom of the barrel, simply because they're not white and it's all in the name of political correctness.\n \n Should somebody who couldn't even graduate high school, be given a vice presidency job at a company?
