Natural Eunuchs were homosexual men of that time and had all rights and duties of ordinary men.\n\n proof plz?\n \n this assumption seems to fall out of the sky. a homosexual man is someone that is sexually attracted to men or has sexual intercourse with men. a eunuch cannot sustain an erection because he has no testicles. this in no way indicates that eunuchs were homosexuals. \n \n not only that, the author notes that castrated eunuchs of the time, though unable to have sex, would sometimes marry women and have children. the lack of a fucntional penis does not make one gay\n \n finally, if these \"natural eunuchs\" were indeed gay, as the author blankly assumes, they could only be recipients of gay sex. the \"givers\" would be fully functional males with testicles, if such was even the case to begin with.\n \n this flaw in logic causes the whole argument to fall apart. unless we can substantially demonstrate that \"natural eunuchs\" equated to gays, then there is no reason to accept this assumption",
