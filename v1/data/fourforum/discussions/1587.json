Maybe it is time to make that step but a whole lot of good it does us. Putting a person on Mars? Please, what a waste of money. I am 30% for and 70% against this space program. In one way it makes sense for us to start focusing more on space but then again it really does sound stupid on paper and its not like Bush needs to find a way to increase our debt any further than it is already.",

My understanding is that the big science projects provide benefits many times their cost in new discoveries that help mankind and advanced technology. If so, it seems like we would be promoting these kinds of projects. However I would like to see a committee of scientist setting priorities instead of politicians. \n \n I&#8217;m not an expert in world hunger, but from what I understand, most of the world hunger is because of political unrest, not from lack of food.",

Even if he had stopped at \"return to the moon\", it is still likely more than he will be able to accomplish in his administration, especially when you consider that currently, with our shuttle fleet grounded, we do not even have a vehicle capable of reaching orbit, much less a trip to the moon (the shuttles are ill suited to visit the moon).\n \n A trip to mars is more than a lot of peoplke can envision.

It doesn't seem like much, but think about it. Think about how much easier velcro has made things. Think about all the little things, shoes, backpacks, and other containers all take advantage of this technology. We will no doubt recieve many rewards, in the forms of civilization advances, if we undertake this venture.\n \n As for paying for it. Bush wants to phase out the \"shuttle program\", which really in itself is a waste of tax payer's money. Now the International Space Station is good and dandy but c' mon.
