We're the ones who are living our lives openly and are suffering for it for the sake of political ambition of \"one of our own\".\n First of all if you're going to earn people's sympathy and respect you have to be a saint. The benefit of calling someone out is, I think, outweighed by the cost of exposing gays and lesbians to some serious criticisms, including (perhaps well-justified) criticism about how our 'community' deals with dissent. By living our lives openly, we also open our actions to public scrutiny and we do not want to give people the opportunity to slander us worse than we are already. Furthermore I don't really see the difference between suffering for the sake of the political ambition of a gay man or a straight man. The only difference seems to be that we can be bitchy about the gay man and call him a traitor. \n \nFirst of all, since when is being gay all about someone's sex life?\n I don't recall making that claim. What I did say was that people's sex lives are their own business, and if Joe Politician doesn't want to be gay like you and be proud of it, that's his business.\n \nAnd when did we become the ones making it all about our sex lives?\n Roughly about the time some of us thought that forced 'outings' were any way to deal with closet-cases whose politics dissented from our own.\n \nHowever, these closet cases, who are bigots to the extreme, use our our sexuality for political gain. I have no problem returning the favor. Let her/him stand out and proud as the homosexual bigot that they are.\n The point is that they aren't proud of being gay - they're ashamed and miserable about the whole business. Closet cases disagree with the received wisdom of the gay community and that disagreement is reflected in their politics. A forced 'outing' does nothing more than alienate them further from us and themselves. \n \nSecondly, politicians are all about \"who they are\". That is what they use to get elected.\n Really? The last I checked politicians had their images and public personas doctored and spun and manipulated beyond recognition.\n \nI am from Massachusetts. How, exactly am I allowing some closet bigot from Florida to be elected?\n Pretty much the same way that you let G.W.Bush be re-elected - by not giving Joe Redstate a reason to support you and yours.

What I did say was that people's sex lives are their own business, and if Joe Politician doesn't want to be gay like you and be proud of it, that's his business.\n\n \n I am probably reading this wrong, but this sounds really condescending. No one has to be \"gay like me\". I don't walk down the street announcing to the world that I am gay. But there is no hiding it. I was being harassed for being gay back when I didn't realize I was gay, so for those of us who are \"gay like me\", there isn't much choice in hiding. And just because some politician can \"hide\" doesn't mean that he should get away with slandering GLBT people just to further his own political agenda. IMO, I find that worse that the straight politician that slanders us.\n \n \nRoughly about the time some of us thought that forced 'outings' were any way to deal with closet-cases whose politics dissented from our own.\n\n \n I disagree.

But that is not my issue. \n \n My issue is when these closet cases (only in their professional lives, mind you) use our supposed immorality to slander us and get votes to stay in power. Then they have the nerve at the end of the day to complain that their sex lives are private. Well, so is mine. No one other than my partner/s know what I do behind closed doors. So why is it okay for that politician - the closet case - to to assume all these nasty things about me, when s/he should know better?\n \n My issue is when s/he votes against job protections for glbt people when s/he is confortable in her/his because of their ability to pass as straight.\n \n My issue is when these people can walk wherever they desire without being harassed, while I, mainly due to their rhetoric, will be be afforded no such luxury.\n \n \nReally? The last I checked politicians had their images and public personas doctored and spun and manipulated beyond recognition.\n\n \n That is true.

   "Personally, when I find that a lawmaker or politician who opposes gay special rights is actually gay after outing attempts by the gay lobby, it only makes me have all the more respect for that lawmaker. It's one thing to do what's right when the person doing it doesn't have to feel he or she is making a sacrifice--it's another when they DO make a sacrifice.\n\n \n These are \"special rights\", and the closeted person is making a personal \"sacrifice\" by rejecting them? That is a contradiction. Being treated as an equal, not accepting inequality, is not being treated as special. These closeted people are ashamed of who they are, so they are willing to accept and promote inequality and oppression against others like them.

And if peopel cannot figure out why the \"gay community\" is punishing him, then they need to look up the term hypocrisy.\n The problem is very much yours. And since the reasons for punishing someone by 'outing' are weak at best and despicable at worst, I really can't fault the average straight guy for getting a bad impression from forced outings. Without the understanding of your fellow citizens, your goals and interests will be constantly frustrated by the bedrock of bigotry: ignorance. If you want to be anything more than a misunderstood and therefore marginalized minority, you're going to have to help raise public awareness and understanding of gay issues. \n \nYou may have similar \"goons\" but I would bet that they do not have the power that they have here. And that is what we're up against. \"Goons\" with power.\n Actually the \"goons\" here have more power than they do in the US. The parliamentary system means that if the biggest goon, a chap named Stephen Harper, becomes Prime Minister he will be able to roll back same-sex marriage, gay rights, and repeal the entire constitution if he's so inclined, thanks to a clause in our constitution that allows people to suspend it or specific rights in it.\n \nI let nothing happen.

Maybe it is easier for Canadians to say so, but unless you actually participate in the political process here in the US, you really have no idea what you are talking about. Because money controls so much of the political structure, we are forced to choose between the lesser of two evils in a two party political structure.

Heck, in Canada where patronage is the order of the day, people still manage to vote for three opposition parties. So that isn't a barrier to multiple party politics. \n \n But, if you want to argue about whether the Democrats lost or the Republicans won, there's a government forum.

That is to the same end, not a different end, in my view.\n You're not asking for a \"true choice\" though, you're asking that your choice of partners be expanded to include members of the same sex.\n \nTheir sexual orientation is their sexuality, which is part of who they are.\n Sure, it's a part of who they are, but it's not \"who they really are\". They really are who they are: a person that has problems with their sexual orientation.\n \nUnder coercion, duress? Choose this way, even if you don't want to, or else you will have fewer rights, is not the same as a free and equal choice. How do you come to the conclusion they prefer their choice to the one I made? Afterall, they are in a closet, and I am not.\n You're confusing the right to choose with the options that you have to choose from (\"choice\" with \"choices\"). I come to the conclusion that closet-cases prefer their choice to the one you made because they choose it. They have the option of coming out of the closet, embracing their sexuality, and so on, and they refused that option. Quite simply they looked at their options and preferred to stay in the closet.",

   "Right now you're being treated like a straight person, and by extension a straight person who refuses to indulge in straight priviledge.\n\n \n \n I wouldn't go so far as to say I don't \"indulge\" in said priveledges, moreover that they don't apply to me in my HONEST state of being. Since I won't play a game of charades. \n \n \n Physically disabled persons were treated just like physically abled persons until it was realized they have needs and differences which were not being addressed. I'm no different in that light since my being gay makes marrying a person of the opposite gender perpetuating fraud.\n \n \n Since you already get treated equally to straight people, and you refuse to be satisfied with that because you're not straight and cannot be treated equally as a straight person, then you want special treatment that does treat you as equal to a straight person.\n\n \n \n Is it \"special treament\" and \"special rights\" aren't what I would call the same thing. Building a ramp so that a physically disabled person can EQUALLY ACCESS a public building is definitely \"special treatment\" but their rights aren't any more \"special\" than mine. \n \n \n Hardly. But respecting a person's right to keep their sexuality, and indeed their whole private life, private doesn't seem like too much to ask. Especially since doing otherwise is harmful as I have explained earlier in this thread.\n\n \n I don't walk around with a neon sign saying \"Lesbian\" above my head. I'm not asking to be allowed to do so either. I am asking that my being gay does not constitute justification for discrimination and denial of access to civil rights. \n \n \n Whether he is out or not doesn't affect my equality, for obvious reasons, and doesn't affect your equality because he'll hate himself and you whether he's out or not. Unless he can be out and proud about it, rather than out and ashamed of it, it makes little difference whether he's out or not, and the outing will have bad repercussions.\n\n \n His being ashamed of it is WHY he's still in the closet. What I have pointed out several times, and you seem to choose to ignore is (our example) he is not only in the closet but is in the closet and taking his fears out on the rest of us \"open gays.\" \n I'm sure there are those closeted gays who do not make it their life's work to destroy and deny civil rights to other gays just because they can't accept their own being gay. \n \n \n And if he were straight, and you couldn't out him, then he would still be working against gay equality.\n\n \n Yes, but that isn't the case so your comment is actually quite pointless here.\n \n \n Yes, the right to marry someone he's not sexually attracted to, the right to live with in self-loathing and fear, and so on. \n \n Declaring that he gets all the rights and priviledges of being straight by remaining in the closet plays right into the hands of those who deny that gays have less rights than straights. After all, they say, if the closet-cases can accept the same rights and benefits as straights, why can't you? \n\n \n Which really is my point, but you are playing devil's advocate with it by using against me. \n It's a lie, it's perpetuating the descrimination and culture of hate and fear. It's just simply wrong. \n \n \n Ah, so we should gain the moral high ground by sacrificing him to the 'gay cause'?\n\n \n No, but why is it ok for him to use us as sacrificial lambs for his own personal gain? On the large scale it only benefits him and him alone to do so. While the rest of us, the open gays, must suffer and continue to sacrifice our civil rights so he can be \"comfortable\" in his own fear. \n \n The needs of the one should not be allowed to override the needs of the many. Allowing gay marriage and other civil rights to gays does not infringe upon any other persons' individual rights and/or liberties. But one closeted gay man who can't deal with his own sexuality does infringe upon the rights of ALL gays! \n \n Personally I think the continued existence of these closet-cases bespeaks of unfinished business in the gay community's back-yard. If you can't convince a XXXXX that his best interests lie with you and the promotion of gay rights, how do you expect to ever convince straight people?[/QUOTE]",

   "Again you're missing the point about the different ways in which 'respect' can be cashed out. As a synonym for politeness, for example \"Listening respectfully\", it's useless because people confuse all senses of 'respect' with 'politeness'. \n\n \n You have yet to specify what you mean. If you do not believe that politeness is an integral part of respect, then I am just going to have to leave it at that. I don't feel as if I have to prove anything to anyone. I don't think down or talk down to someone because they're supposedly from the south, or the go to church every Sunday or whatever it is that Red Staters are supposed to do. I know a lot of people who have similar \"values\" that live in the Blue state that I live in, yet voted for Kerry. I have personally had discussions with people who did not understand why gay people needed marriage, and, while still not \"agreeing\" with me, did not resort to the nastiness that you heard from our politicians on the national level.\n \n We appear to be on two different wavelenghts. \n \n \nAmusingly this is exactly how Joe Sixpack feels about you, and so instead of giving each other any real respect as citizens, you're merely tolerating each other's presence. Except when either or you start to feel threatened, in which case that facade of politeness disappears and things start getting ugly (DOMA, same-sex marriage bans, gay-bashing, etc).\n\n \n Unless you actually talk to joe sixpack you have no idea. I can tell you that I have. And while we still may not agree on many things, at least we both understand where the other is coming from. The problem is, there aren't many of me around many joe-sixpack. And as long as he is getting all his information about me from people who have an agenda, there will continue to be a divide. The more people that are out and about and living their lives openly, the less of a divide there will be.\n \n \nThe problem is very much yours.\n\n \n No it isn't.\n \n \nAnd since the reasons for punishing someone by 'outing' are weak at best and despicable at worst, I really can't fault the average straight guy for getting a bad impression from forced outings. Without the understanding of your fellow citizens, your goals and interests will be constantly frustrated by the bedrock of bigotry: ignorance. If you want to be anything more than a misunderstood and therefore marginalized minority, you're going to have to help raise public awareness and understanding of gay issues. \n \n \n Exposing hypocrisy is never a weak argument. You might think so, but I do not. This issue isn't about what the average straight guy thinks. It's about a gay person demonizing gays and passing legislation that ensures second class status for glbt people.\n \n Do not get me wrong. I do believe public awareness is something we will forever need to work on. But civl rights advancement does not solely come from the \"approval\" of the majority. If that were the case, interracial marriage would still be outlawed in some states. And we have come further in less time than most other ostracized minority groups. We still have a long way to go.\n \n I have personally done rallies and protests. I remember when gay marriage was nothing but wishful thinking back in 1993. I and several other people did a small protest in Downtown Boston, enduring heckles and trash thrown at us just doing mock committment ceremonies when I was 19 years old. It took over 10 long years, but in a combintation of public awareness, court victories and a lot of patience, gay marriage is a reality here in Massachusetts. I don't feel I should be lectured about what I need to do. I have been doing what I need to do on my end.\n \n \n \n \n ... if you want to argue about whether the Democrats lost or the Republicans won, there's a government forum. Here I believe we're discussing forcibly outing closeted officials who don't toe the party line.\n\n \n You were the one who brought this up, not I. You felt the need to \"blame the victim\" by accusing those of us who actually voted for Kerry of allowing Bush to win. Should I also hold you at fault for allowing Stephen Harper to win?\n \n I am still not following the logic on that one.",

   "I wouldn't go so far as to say I don't \"indulge\" in said priveledges, moreover that they don't apply to me in my HONEST state of being. Since I won't play a game of charades.\n Exactly. You're unwilling to indulge in straight priviledge. \n \nIs it \"special treament\" and \"special rights\" aren't what I would call the same thing. Building a ramp so that a physically disabled person can EQUALLY ACCESS a public building is definitely \"special treatment\" but their rights aren't any more \"special\" than mine.\n Hmm, that last paragraph came out poorly. I was trying to point out that in order for you to have equality with straight people you need to be treated differently than straight people - to make a more careful distinction between ends and means.\n \nI don't walk around with a neon sign saying \"Lesbian\" above my head. I'm not asking to be allowed to do so either. I am asking that my being gay does not constitute justification for discrimination and denial of access to civil rights.\n Indeed, and other people both gay and straight are saying that the way you choose to express your sexuality does not entitle you to the special rights that you need if you are going to express your sexuality that way.\n \nHis being ashamed of it is WHY he's still in the closet. What I have pointed out several times, and you seem to choose to ignore is (our example) he is not only in the closet but is in the closet and taking his fears out on the rest of us \"open gays.\"\nThat is the way that you characterize it, and I find that characterization wanting. The reason why I find that characterization wanting is because it ignores why he is ashamed of his sexuality, and why that shame keeps him in the closet. More to the point, his own sexuality and his attitude towards it seems to be contingently related to our sexuality and his attitude towards how we express it. Given that a straight politician with a negative view of homosexuality would do the same, his sexuality and his attitude to it seems to be beside the point. \n \nI'm sure there are those closeted gays who do not make it their life's work to destroy and deny civil rights to other gays just because they can't accept their own being gay.\n Indeed, and what do you think makes the difference?\n \nYes, but that isn't the case so your comment is actually quite pointless here.\n It's not the case, but it puts the case in context and helps us determine relevant elements of contrast. Since an attack on the private life of a straight politician would be pointless and counterproductive, and the politican's sexuality is beside the point, it follows that an attack on the private life of any politician is pointless and counterproductive.\n \nWhich really is my point, but you are playing devil's advocate with it by using against me.\n It's a lie, it's perpetuating the descrimination and culture of hate and fear. It's just simply wrong. \n And so is forcing someone to live by your beliefs, which is the crux of the problem. How far will you go in forcing your beliefs against discrimination on people? You won't get very far because force creates resistance. By all means shoot the gay rights movement in the foot by outing dissident politicians, and perpetuate the climate of discrimination and fear on both sides. Just remember who your methodological bed-fellows are - bigoted straight people who don't want to give you equality.\n \nNo, but why is it ok for him to use us as sacrificial lambs for his own personal gain? On the large scale it only benefits him and him alone to do so. While the rest of us, the open gays, must suffer and continue to sacrifice our civil rights so he can be \"comfortable\" in his own fear.\n It's not okay for him to do that. But since two wrongs don't make a right, and in fact perpetuate the tit-for-tat exchange of wrongs, you may want to turn the other cheek and defeat him by taking the moral high ground. \n \nThe needs of the one should not be allowed to override the needs of the many.\nSorry, but I can't say that I subscribe to such utilitarian-socialist ethics, as the converse is that the interests of the many outweigh the needs of the few, and that's a recipy for tyranny of the flavour that you American XXXXXX should be familiar with. \n \n Allowing gay marriage and other civil rights to gays does not infringe upon any other persons' individual rights and/or liberties. But one closeted gay man who can't deal with his own sexuality does infringe upon the rights of ALL gays!\n If you can't deal with a single dissenter, or indeed the phenomenon of dissent, then you really aren't entitled to dissent at all. I fail to see how one closeted gay man infringes upon the rights of all gays any more than one open straight man in the same position might, except that he threatens received stonewall orthodoxy.",
