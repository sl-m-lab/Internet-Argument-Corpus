   "I'm sitting at the East Gate of Jerusalem,\n waiting for a sign of God.\n The ground is hard packed quiet,\n and the trumpets lay at rest.\n \n I'm sitting at the East Gate of Jerusalem,\n waiting for a sign of God.\n They say when he comes back, this is where it will be,\n this is where I should wait.\n \n I see nothing but the haze of the sand,\n burning images of time into my eyes.\n A drop in the barrell for every forged soul,\n a drop for every forgotten cry.\n \n I'm sitting in the doorway of a children's shelter,\n waiting for a sign of God.\n A child runs by, dripping with juice,\n stained with tears.\n \n I want to see him,\n I want to say that\n children's blood should be blue,\n never red.\n \n I'm sitting at the East Gate of Jerusalem,\n writing my name in the sand.\n In case I get left behind, \n I want to remember who I am.",
