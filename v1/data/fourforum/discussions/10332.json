The government, rather the supreme court dictators, became involved in the woman's body in 1973. You must be against roe v. wade.\n\n \n Well roe vs wade actually was a case which was undertaken by the plaintiff to get the gov out of womens bodies (metaphorically speaking). And thats what it did - it removed government controls it did not add them. It provided a wider range of options not a narrower range. Indeed a range of options more in accord with reality than before. And by the way a dictator is classically a single individual (see ancient greek history) not a panel of 9 drawing decisions by majority vote. That would I believe be a nonarchy or nonaship not a dictatorship. And of course the court provided relief to the plaintiffs from an existing set of restrictive laws which had been on the books for a long time meaning that the involvement of gov in womens bodies predated RvW by many decades.\n \n And why do you think that Medicare/Medicaid puts the government in womens bodies - those are insurance programs designed to protect the economic welfare and health of the patients who have them. Granted there are restricitions and limits, but frankly the programs are pretty good about covering a whole bunch of medical needs. Disclosure - I am disabled and a participant in SSDI and my medical bills are rather high (like 128K for a pacemaker replacement! which neted my cost to about $250 or less).",

   "If the cell has not even been fertilized, then it is not even a human life yet. Thereby, it would be pointless to even go back that far in the first place.\n\n It is human life, as all the cells of our body are human. It simply needs the extra step of fertilization in order to start the growth process that will eventually lead to someone like you and me. The only thing that differentiates it from a newly fertilized zygote is:\n 1) A full set of human DNA as opposed to a half set for the egg.\n 2) The growth process has started for a zygote but needs the fertilization step to start growth for the egg.\n \n Which of those criteria are the necessary ones for you to define something as murder? Or is there some other criteria that I have not included, such as a belief on your part that a zygote has a soul?",
