   "ONE\n When I was about 15 my best friend said his parents were taking him to see a show for his birthday and he invited me along. There was a magician and some other acts at this club; a real family affair.\n \n Anyway, I sat across this table from his mum. During the night I got a really itchy foot. I slipped out of my shoe and began rubbing it against the leg of the table. Occasionally I looked at his dad and his mum and we all smiled at the magician's acts.\n \n Then I realised that it was his mum's leg that I was rubbing up against, not the table leg. She hadn't said a word the whole time!\n \n TWO\n In about 1991 Sydney still had trains with manual operated double doors. These were removed from service because they were too unsafe. I ran up the stairs at Central Station and saw one pulling out of the station. I hesitated, then decided to leap in through some doors that someone had left open. It was going too fast. I hit an internal wall, and bounced straight back out of the train and fell onto the platform, still holding my bag. I got up. People were just looking at me; no one offered to ask if I was alright. I left the platform and the station and walked to work instead. I know of no other person who can claim to have collided with a train. And this shows why these sorts of trains were removed.\n \n THREE\n When I was little; about 5, I used to like to climb trees. My neighbour was hanging out the washing in her backyard. I called out to her. She waved. I waved back, and fell. I ran into the house to my mum. She was mopping the kitchen floor. She wiped my tears away and then, to get me out of the way, she sat me on the window ledge. I leant against the fly-screen and it gave way. I feel head first about 6ft onto a brick footpath. I didn't even need stiches! I cried, but I was alright soon after.",
