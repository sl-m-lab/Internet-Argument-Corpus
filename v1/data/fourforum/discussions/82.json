   "I suppose in the eyes of the misguided men who formed it, it would be a success. Then you have to really wonder what they had in mind.\n **************************************************\n First you have to know the purpose of the Social Security System before you can determine whether or not it is a success.\n \n One of its original purposes was to provide a pension for the working man when he retired. Doesn't that sound wonderful. Maybe, if you like Socialism or Welfarism.\n \n The Social Security System penalizes the enterprising spirit of the man who believes in Capitalism. He is forced to pay into this system whether he wants to or not. Furthermore, he is not paying towards his own savings account but to the pension check of some retired person. What happens when there are more retired persons then there are workers? \n \n The Social Security is faulty and doomed for failure. It teaches people to depend upon the government and makes them irresponsible. Any American who wishes to always be financially secure is no advocate of freedom. Freedom is the opportunity to succeed and yes, even to fail. I would rather have freedom with the opportunity to take risks than to live always securely and never really live.\n \n \n\"If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from us in peace.

   "Fallingupwards I have no problem with the fact that you like socialism. I am not against helping the poor. Now your third question makes me think of something. If the now retired once working class had been able to save money for themselves there would be no problem. They wouldn't have to rely on future generations to support them. \n \n Now, what is welfarism? It is \"The set of policies, practices, and social attitudes associated with a welfare state.\" A welfare state is \"1. A social system whereby the state assumes primary responsibility for the welfare of its citizens, as in matters of health care, education, employment, and social security. 2. A nation in which such a system operates.\" If you like socialism, I am also sure you will like welfarism. \n \n One of the major problems with this system is the time period in which it was formed. When it was implemented under FDR in the 1930's the majority of people were simply not retired for ten, twenty, and now even thirty years like they are today. Life expectancy was not as high. Men often kept working until they died and if they retired they did not\n usually live for many years afterwards. \n \n This system was formed to make men rely upon the government and be less independent. My point is that freedom and constant security do not co-exist. You have to decide whether security or freedom is more important to you. (BTW: I define freedom as \"the absence of coercion.\") Security appeals to the natural man. Everybody needs security. However, security is not found in relying on the government. Our founders knew this. They had just fought a war against a tyrant who had been attempting to overthrow their system of government. These men knew history. They understood the fallen nature of man. \n \n As George Washington so wonderfully put it, \"Government is not reason; it is not eloquence; it is force! Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.\"\n \n Bastiat explained better than I ever could of why socialism and welfarism doesn't work.\n \"Self-preservation and self-development are common aspirations among all people. And if everyone enjoyed the unrestricted use of his faculties and the free disposition of the fruits of his labor, social progress would be ceaseless, uninterrupted, and unfailing. But there is also another tendency that is common among people. When they can, they wish to live and prosper at the expense of others. This is no rash accusation. Nor does it come from a gloomy and uncharitable spirit. The annals of history bear witness to the truth of it: the incessant wars, mass migrations, religious persecutions, universal slavery, dishonesty in commerce, and monopolies. This fatal desire has its origin in the very nature of man in that primitive, universal, and insuppressible instinct that impels him to satisfy his desires with the least possible pain.\"\n \n Socialism would work if everyone was perfect. But men are not angels.\n \n \n \nWe've been creeping closer to socialism, a system that someone once said works only in heaven, where it isn't needed, and in hell, where they've already got it.\" ---Ronald Reagan\n\n \n \n\"If men were angels, no government would be necessary.\" ---James Madison\n",

   "Good article about Texas. Some problems with SS that people can't \"ignore\" or deny\".\n \n 1) When the tax started it collected just 1.5% from employees. Alot less then the current rate. It was that rate into the 50's if you'll notice. \n \n 2) Last year I read an article in USA Today that said a SS retiree will collect everything they put into SS in about 3 yrs 9 months (todays retirees who contributed during the 1.5% days).\n \n 3) If the system were solvent it would require a dollar for dollar match (contributions for benefits). Since it doesn't most of the retirees today are simply living off the money WE pay now as SS taxes.\n \n 4) Pensions. Fewer then 10% of companies today provide the traditional \"pension\" plan. 401K IS NOT A PENSION. More then 50% of companies provided pensions in the 50's.\n \n 5) People are currently NOT SAVING nearly enough for their retirement. Considering there really are no pensions anymore (except for union and government jobs) people need to start saving. We'll have an entire generation of welfare people.\n \n 6) In the 50's there were 32 workers paying SS taxes for every 1 receiver. Today its 4 workers for every 1. In 2015 it will be 2 workers for every 1. Do the math. (Thats from the General Accounting Office - I didn't make it up).\n \n Personally I'm in favor of the following steps.\n \n 1) Increase the SS tax contribution (the employee half) to 8.5%. Use the difference (1.3%) from the current rate to fund an individual retirement account of sorts. Do not raise the employer contribution BUT if they do contribute more allow for a tax CREDIT for the corporation. In other words they can also donate 1.3% into this employee fund (individual) and they will receive a credit for that amount. (Kind of a forced pension).\n \n 2) Raise the income limits for IRA's and 401K's. I'm continually XXXXXX OFF when I see the different single and married rates FOR EVERYTHING. You know what, as a gay person I can't get married. Sure I have kids (some deductions) but when I sell my house upon retirement I can deduct $250,000 of capital gains while a married couple can deduct $500,000. This is NOT FAIR considering houses don't appreciate at different amounts based on your maritial status. I didn't pay 1/2 what a married person would pay for my house so I should be allowed the FULL exemption on the gain. Same with IRA and 401K. There are \"single\" limits and \"married\" limits. You know, getting married is a personal decision (just like having kids). I don't think people with spouses or kids (myself included) should have our taxes subsidised by those who don't (single people with no kids). \n \n 3) Increase the deductable contribution limits for IRA's.\n \n All these things would impact the federal budget somewhat (tax revenue) but do not AT ALL affect currect social security benefits. I'm sure in the future we'll see benefits reduced and taxes raised. The question is - when they do this will they give us the tools to make up the difference ourselves?\n \n AZwebDESIGNER\n \n azwebdesigner@yahoo.com",

The money that is paid in by today's employees is being paid out to those receiving benefits. When today's workers retire, the worker's at that time will finance the benefits for today's workers.\n \n The problem with the social security system is that, somewhere around 2010 (estimated by Social Security Administration), the amount of money being paid in by workers will be more than the money being paid out, so Social Security will have to begin dipping into additional money that has been saved up from surpluses over the past years. By 2030 (again, estimated), the money from the surpluses will have run out, and there will not be enough more money for Social Security benefits.\n \n Also, Social Security was not meant to provide money to retire and live on.

What we are paying today is going to the retired people NOW. \n If that's the case, then SS is going to be nothing but a joke in a few years.\n Personally I think SS was a good idea in the beginning, until the $$ was used to pay off some of our great national deficit. As of now, I don't really hold an opinion until I find out how much is in the fund RIGHT NOW. If someone could tell me, that would be great",

Congress and adminstrations since the birth of SS have raided the SS fund to pay for their expenditures. Bush raided $150 billion, and Clinton probbably did just as much. Also, SS money goes into the general fund, which is used to pay for all sorts of federal stuff, from Iraq to subsided school meals. If we did not do this, there probably wouldn't be a problem. \n \n you are being forced to pay for the actions of Congress-es and the Presidents and the inability of past generations to vote the SOBs out of office.",
