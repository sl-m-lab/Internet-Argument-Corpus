   "I know this may sound weird. Hear me out. \n \n I stumbled across a few pages on the net all have the purpose of converting other \"non- Christians\" to their breed of Christianity. Buddhist, Hindus, Muslims, Jews, and even Roman Catholics are targeted. The smaller fish caught in these dragnets are third party Christian groups that are thrown into generic anti-cult campaigns ran by most \"OEM\" Christians orgs. I noticed a weird trend. They all say the same thing to every group! \n \n If you are for example Roman Catholic take note; someone out there thinks you are practicing false religion and you are misleading the world, and for this devil work you are going to burn in hell! They claim they love you and are saved by grace, but you are misguided. Because they have the \"truth\", with help of the \"Holy Spirit\"\u00a9 you will give the pope the finger, and join what ever the denomination they happen to be, or else you will burn in hell!\n \n This is the weird part I am a Jehovah's Witness and it seems rather odd to be lumped someplace between Catholics and Hindus. They whom ever \"they\" is this week are lumping every single religion that is not of ASP (for lack of a better term) origin into the realm of the pseudo occult. \n \n Montalban don't ask for proof.\n \n Anyone here want to state their religion and if it is in the cross hairs of some well meaning protestant spin off trying to save you from your faith? JWs don't count :P",

   "I'm Lutheran. If you don't know your religious history, it was one of the first Protestant churches to leave the Roman Catholic church. I have many friends who are Catholic, and my dad was Catholic until he converted (wasn't much of a struggle, his family was Catholic in name only) and became the president of our congregation. I haven't had any problems, nor do I give them much without first learning of another's faith. I do look at each denomination first. Most of the time, they only differ from my church in procedures, which are not that big of a deal. However, when they differ from me in doctrine, I tend to ask them why and where they get such beliefs from. \n \n Just curious, I have a couple of questions for you about the JWs. It always seems to be a target, and I want to hear your side of the story.\n Do the Jehovah's Witnesses believe Michael the Archangel to be Jesus?\n Do you believe in a Triune God, Father, Son, and Spirit, that is three-in-one, none of them higher than the rest?\n What's your stance on Heaven and Hell?\n Is it true what they say that the JWs have changed the Bible in some parts?\n \n Again, I do not mean to be hostile, but I want to know the whole story before judgments.",

   "Where do you find the Michael = Jesus evidence? In the Bible, it specifically draws distinctions between the two.\n\n QUOTED FROM 'REASONING FROM THE SCRIPTURES' (WBTS)\n Is Jesus Christ the same person as Michael the archangel?\n The name of this Michael appears only five times in the Bible. The glorious spirit person who bears the name is referred to as \"one of the chief princes,\" \"the great prince who has charge of your [Daniel's] people,\" and as \"the archangel.\" (Dan. 10:13; 12:1; Jude 9, RS) Michael means \"Who Is Like God?\" The name evidently designates Michael as the one who takes the lead in upholding Jehovah's sovereignty and destroying God's enemies.\n At 1 Thessalonians 4:16 (RS), the command of Jesus Christ for the resurrection to begin is described as \"the archangel's call,\" and Jude 9 says that the archangel is Michael. Would it be appropriate to liken Jesus' commanding call to that of someone lesser in authority? Reasonably, then, the archangel Michael is Jesus Christ. (Interestingly, the expression \"archangel\" is never found in the plural in the Scriptures, thus implying that there is only one.)\n Revelation 12:7-12 says that Michael and his angels would war against Satan and hurl him and his wicked angels out of heaven in connection with the conferring of kingly authority on Christ. Jesus is later depicted as leading the armies of heaven in war against the nations of the world. (Rev. 19:11-16) Is it not reasonable that Jesus would also be the one to take action against the one he described as \"ruler of this world,\" Satan the Devil? (John 12:31) Daniel 12:1 (RS) associates the 'standing up of Michael' to act with authority with \"a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time.\" That would certainly fit the experience of the nations when Christ as heavenly executioner takes action against them. So the evidence indicates that the Son of God was known as Michael before he came to earth and is known also by that name since his return to heaven where he resides as the glorified spirit Son of God.\n \n \nAnd how can the three not be equal?\n\n LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS of reasons. Is there any real reason why they should be equal? I'm not trying to pass the burden of proof I just think it would be shorter if you gave your reasons first!!!",

   "What is WBTS (I am not familiar with that acronym)?\n But there is the whole \"one of the chief princes\" part. Would not God be King? And in Jude 9, it says that Michael \"did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him\" while Jesus did not merely bring an accusation against Satan but crushed his very power through his death and resurrection. And why then does Jesus assume the name of Jesus while on Earth but is Michael in heaven? And why does it say that \"At the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord\" (Philippians 2:10-11) when in heaven the name of Michael would be all-powerful, not his humbled state of Jesus.\n Genesis 3:22 And the LORD God said, \"The man has now become like one of us  knowing good and evil.\n Genesis 11:5 But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower . . . Come let us go down and confuse their language . . . So the LORD scattered them from there.\n John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

   "What is WBTS (I am not familiar with that acronym)?\n\n Sorry I forgot that was the first time I had used that abb. In this thread, WBTS = Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, the legal name of the organization known as Jehovah's Witnesses.\n \n \nBut there is the whole \"one of the chief princes\" part. Would not God be King?\n\n \n Sorry I don't understand, could you expand a bit?\n \n \n \nAnd in Jude 9, it says that Michael \"did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him\" while Jesus did not merely bring an accusation against Satan but crushed his very power through his death and resurrection.\n\n At that time Jesus hadn't crushed the \"power of Satan\" that won't happen until Armageddon. His death and resurrection bought back mankind from enslavement to sin, all we have to do is wait for the benefits of that to come in the new world order yet to come on earth. (Psalm 37:10,11, Matthew 5:5).\n \n \nAnd why then does Jesus assume the name of Jesus while on Earth but is Michael in heaven? \n \n \n In his prehuman existence Jesus was called \"the Word.\" (Joh 1:1) He also had the personal name Michael. By retaining the name Jesus after his resurrection (Ac 9:5), \"the Word\" shows that he is identical with the Son of God on earth. His resuming his heavenly name Michael and his title (or name) \"The Word of God\" (Re 19:13) ties him in with his prehuman existence. \n \n \nAnd why does it say that \"At the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord\" (Philippians 2:10-11) \n \n \n Because every knee should bend \"in the name of Jesus\" the \"name\" here is evidently the name that Jesus has achieved through his sacrificial death, not a literal name as such. If you look at the context of the verse at the end of 11 it says \"to the glory of God the father\" which would mean that this was all done for God the fathers glory and for his purpopse.\n \n \nwhen in heaven the name of Michael would be all-powerful, not his humbled state of Jesus.\n\n Michael is never spoken of as being \"all powerful\", he is the archangel the only archangel in the Bible, which simply means 'chief angel' or 'principal' not all mighty.\n \nGenesis 3:22 And the LORD God said, \"The man has now become like one of us knowing good and evil.\n Genesis 11:5 But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower . . . Come let us go down and confuse their language . . . So the LORD scattered them from there.\n\n I wondered how to answer these for a while, and then it suddenly struck me! Imagine you had never read the Bible before with no idea of what it would say, would you abruptly conclude that the \"us\" means persons being equal in knowledge and power? Or would you think that the \"us\" would simply mean they knew the same things regarding good and evil? This would also apply to the tower of Babel; God wasn't alone in the spirit realm.\n \n \nJohn 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God\n\n \n So the word existed before us, and was with God in the beginning. Agreed?\n \n \nand the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. . . . \n \n \n How can you be with someone yet being that person at the same time? Your translation just doesn't make sense! \n \n \nThe Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n\n \n Take a look at John 1:18 this says that \"no man has seen God at any time\" So the \"word\" couldn't have been almighty God!\n \n \nThose were the ones that my eye just happened to fall on as I paged through. I'm using an NIV (New International Version).\n\n Mainly I use the 'New World Translation' Published by (WBTS) which incidentally renders John 1:1 as \"the word was a god\".\n \n Here are a few reasons why I say they weren't equal;\n \n Philippians 2:6 \n 6 who, although he was existing in God's form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.\n \n Mark 13:32, \n \"Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\" Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal,",
