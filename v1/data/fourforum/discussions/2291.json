The rate at which the human race is growing and the rate at which the earth's resources are decreasing along with other items that are generated by us will sooner or later force us into other options. People have said that we should not look at this quite yet because there is no neccesity. This is the same approach the Romans' took to the huns, look what happened. Those are just my thoughts.",

How much money do you think alternative energies will be worth to entire developed countries per year? If we created a cheap way to make fuel right now our economy would soar. No more need for massive amounts of oil.\n \n Also, what happens if our atmosphere becomes so polluted that we cannot effectively work. Take a look at some places in the developed world that have become horribly over polluted. They have actually turned the corner and brought down pollution in order to improve their economies.

The next step may be small colonies on other planets as well as space stations in orbit.\n \n \nFrankly, I have no faith in humanity to take the right course, and save some fluke, their track record will stand for it's self.\n\n \n We have already had one fluke.
