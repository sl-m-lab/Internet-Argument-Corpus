I would prefer, if necessary, that we change the way that judges are being selected. Billsco, I trust your discretion when you decide that a given judge is less bias that another. However, since this issue is so controversial, I doubt that anyone is completely unbiased. Therefore, I suggest that we have something like a panel composed of both Darwinist and non-Darwinist judges, or simply don't have judges at all.",

   "Claims of \"irreducible complexity\" simply aren't that complex, they typically amount to one of three things:\n \n 1) Defining \"irreducible complexity\" in two different ways, and jumping between the two definitions to produce an argument that looks like it proves something but is actually a logical fallacy. e.g. I wish to use the term \"rotten bastard\" to mean a man who plays cards. Your husband plays cards, therefore he is a rotten bastard, therefore you should get a divorce.\n \n 2) Finding obscure creatures or organs that for various reasons have not well been preserved in a fossil record, and declaring that since we do not know *precisely* how they evolved, they must not have evolved. I'm not sure if you can call this a logical fallacy so much as dishonesty or ignorance of the subtleties of evolutionary processes. e.g. \"I don't understand how a radio works, therefore it must be powered by magic rainbow unicorns\".\n \n 3) Something is unlikely, therefore it is impossible. e.g \"I won the lottery, but the chances of that are one in a million, it could not have happened, I should just destroy my ticket\".\n \n It is a waste of time reading lengthy arguments which amount to the three featured above, so if you could perhaps cut down the 7 pages to the paragraph or two which do not revolve around these arguments, it might make for a more worthwhile debate.",

   "The scope of \"irreducible complexity\" underlies the premise of its doubtful scale. I believe, as it was first presented, \"irreducible complexity\" was simply an exercise to say simple linear evolution could never be the primary mechanism of the development of creatures as complex as a mammal. A more cautious approach would recognize that there are many possible ways in which small scale complexities, which are far more probable, can develop in a way that contribute to larger scale assemblies, giving the appearance of a much greater march of improbability than is the actual case. I would argue even behavior itself, reactive and interactive engagement with the environment, can be such a sub-unit in the development of such assemblies which has its origins, not in the present, but in the distant past, and owes its complexity to components developed first in the faster evolving genome of the \"primordial soup\". \n \n Evolution in effect could have borrowed from this vast library of components, subsequently enriching existing volumes through less complex means, but it also could arrange whole volumes in larger scale evolutionary combinations. Although I am asserting this is a possibility purely on the genomic side, through ordinary mutations, it also occurs through behavior which also accelerates genetic change, or \"enrichment\". Active selection through behavior is not that hard to understand; - almost every living creature does it. We routinely use our sense of preference to select mates within our own species, and throughout the ages, breeders and farmers have used it to select for traits in other species. Today geneticists have returned to its source to do it, the genome.\n \n So what looks like irreducible complexity actually is not, and life owes its underpinnings to fast combinatorial enrichment processes that occurred very rapidly in short lived primitive cellular organisms. What those cells learned at the beginning of evolution was added to the library of evolutionary possibility, thereby reducing the distance of probability that evolutionary advance would need to march in the future.",
