   "Stacy Harp's internet radio program called the Right View had Renew Amercia's own Guy Adams on as a guest. I found some reassurance in listening to this show that no one with a drop of common sense is going to listen to a word this man says. He puts himself right there with Fred Phelps in just the first few minutes of the show.\n \n Mr. Adams made some outlandish claims, thankfully, so illogical and crazy that nobody is going to take this man's claims with anything but a sense of humor. Sadly, he believes the things he says as hateful and wrong as they are.\n \n Some of his outlandish claims from part one of the show include:\n \n * Gays have sex with infants (He says its \"The New trend\")\n * Gays have sex with animals (yuck)\n * Gay relationships only last about a year and 1/2 (and that came from what study? cause every gay couple I am friends with has been together at least 8 years or more)\n * Gays have 200 to 300 partners in their lifetime (really? Where do they find time to do drugs, take over the schools and destroy marriage? Wow, they are busy)\n * Gays have made no contibution to society (except AIDS) (Elton John is crushed)\n * He says Dr. John Diggs in the foremost medical authority on AIDS. (not true its Ken Mayer from Boston, Diggs is a quack refuted in detail)\n * Quote: \"There are not alot of really good gays\"\n * Says we are working towards hate speech laws (first amendment 101 anyone?)\n \n WOW!\n \n Lucky for us, no one has to work all that hard to show this man is not telling the truth. At least if you are going to make some claims about gays, make them sort of believable!\n \n I will update you on the next part as soon as Ms. Harp posts it. Reminder though, it is Ms. Harp who is giving this man a venue for his lies. Doesn't make her look credible either.\n \n Update: Right after I wrote this post, I was thinking about these type of claims (gays have sex with animals and infants..etc...All I could say is where is people's sense of reality. These types of claims belong on the cover a the Star next to the ones that say aliens are running the Lottery. These claims are so outlandish, I wonder to myself who could possible believe such utter crazyness. Sadly, I am not dumb enough to ignore the fact some people really fo believe this stuff. Guy Adams himself, believes the stuff he is saying. Don't these people ever stop to think about it. Even the most anti-gay person should be saying to themself, wow this is out there.\n \n Think about some of the outlandish claims made about groups of people over the course of history and then think about the claims that Guy Adams is making. This XXXX belongs on the Jerry Springer show where people can laugh about it, not make laws on it. I wish people would stop this horrible rhetoric. It is just so wrong.\n \n \n Don't forget to read the threats he has made....to me...and others....",

   "Not sure if just quoting you is enough, but lets give it a shot.\n\n Yeah, I saw the Tut exhibit. It was kinda disappointing actually. The famous mask and series of caskets (for lack of better word) of King Tutankhuman where not on display (the ones shown on the front page of here: http://www.kingtut.org/). The good thing about it was that you got to see some stuff from his family as well and the exhibit kind of progressed down the family tree until King Tuts death at 19. They have some new science out on it and a long of artifacts from his tomb...just not the things I described earlier. Overall, a well done exhibit but is kind of misleading when you see the flyers with the mask all over it.\n \n If you go, purchase advanced tickets as they sell out everyday. Also, eat at the field museum sandwich and soup place....it is outstanding (right next to the big T-rex dinosaur). I might even suggest getting an early show, going to lunch, then seeing the rest of the Field Museum.\n \n :) Hope this helps...can someone PM this to Jitobear as well?",

I guess we should start with do you think he's deep ending here?\n\n \n You know it is not called the \"windy city\" because it is windy there...kind of an interesting fact :)\n \n As for the first post....I'm sure there are some gays like that, but I am just as sure there are some heterosexuals like that. I'm not all sure one could say \"gay causes x,y, and z\".....seems a little ridiculous to me. At the very best (or worst depending on how you look at it) you could try and prove that all people that turn out gay have had some kind of genetic component and raising component that made them do x, y, and z and also made them gay (note: i'm not even saying this is true...just trying to makes a point). It seems like some people imply that if one stops being gay they will stop being a child molestor, animal molestor...etc. It seems the only common thing among the people described in post 1 is that they are all crazy. :)",

   "Matthew that sort of talk doesn't help us. It hurts us!\n \n \n Martin Luther King said it best:\n To retaliate in kind would do nothing but intensify the existence of hate in the universe. Along the way of life, someone must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate. This can only be done by projecting the ethic of love to the center of our lives.\n\n The above post is why I tend to actually take joebrummer seriously while some of your others...not so much :)\n \n I don't know why that \"guy adams\" person decides he can speak about a whole sector or people. By saying \"gay have sex with small children\" the word \"all\" is implied...you alone disprove that right away. While his and my moral code do call certain things you may do \"wrong\" Guy is simply being a hypocrite when making emails like he does...he is doing just as much (if not more) wrong than you (with regards to the moral code we have that is). I don't think Guy realizes that God sees all sin the same including his bigoted (and yes...you can use that word here) remarks. A teenager that is having sex with his girlfriend (prior to marriage) would be just as bad in God's eyes as a person engaging in homosexual acts....yet gays do all these terrible things because of their sin but no other sin causes this? \n \n And on the other side, some on this forum (like Guy) think their is some kind of \"War\" going on. Extreme thinking like this is no better than the thinking of Guy Adams. In fact you can thank those kinda people for me and many others becoming less willing to listen.",

It works! I can provide you with ample evidence of that. I can also tell you that the religious right's position on homosexuality is getting weaker by the day. The louder they get the worse Americans think they look. If we start responding with the same anger, bitterness and violence that they throw at us, do you think the public support will continue?\n \n Martin Luther King said it best when he said that injustice is like a boil that needs sunlight to heal. The more you cover it up, the more it festers and infects. The more we take these anti-gay extremists and put them into the sunlight of justice the more the wounds will heal. People see them for who they really are. It is seen that they are good at quoting the scripture but not good at living the scripture, but if that is to work for us, we must walk the walk. \n \n If we claim to be loving everyday people, then we need to walk the walk.\n If we claim to be full of love, then we need to walk the walk.\n \n Gandhi walked to the salt mines to protest in nonviolence the salt tax. 450 million Indians followed him. Why? Nonviolence\n \n Martin Luther King organzied the Bus Boycotts of 1955 where no blacks would ride the bus. Thousands followed that message, why? Nonviolence.\n \n It works! There will be no camps, because we will have stop the hate rhetoric at is heart. We will have put it into the sunlight of justice. We need justice, not more violence. At some point in time someone needs the morality and the courage to stop the cycle of hate. To throw it back at them only keeps their defenses and sheilds up and with that they will only spread more hate. They respond with a bitter taste because we gave them a bitter taste. Nonviolence seeks to win them over, not win against them.\n \n Booker T Washington said: Let no man bring you so low as to make you hate them. \n \n I ask you to do that, let no anti-gay person bring you so low that you hate them, since History has shown us love can change the world.",
