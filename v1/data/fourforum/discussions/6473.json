   "Before you say this is gonna be just like all the other topics read this..\n \n T.o.C.\n -Macro Evo.\n -Micro Evo.\n -Adaption\n \n Now there is differential evidence in all three main points... i will speak about all three in this topic... \n \n --<~Macro Evolution~<--\n This is one of the most hilarious things that Charles Darwin has said. But he does have a point.. why are there so many similarities between Certain species especially; Human's vs. Apes; well if his statements that he made as a reason to these differences were true we would have gorrilas and such still walking out of the jungle. This isn't true... this has been tried to be proven correct so many times its redicoulus.\n \n --<~Micro Evolution~<--\n This is a true thing that Happens Every day. Disease for say causes Micro Evo. to happen. Micro evolution happens every so often in each race... as they experience the life of the 21st Century there will be many changes. such things as our lungs will start to better them selves against the polutants in the air.. and so on so forth... \n \n --<~Adaption~<--\n My Favorite topic. This topic is about how species have evolved based on the environment... Similar to Micro evolution in some aspect but micro evolution has to do more with genetics. Adaption happens not necisarily on a Daily, Monthly, or Yearly basis but it does happen and its hard to predict when but why is an easy answer... it has to do with environment.. think back 1,000,000 years ago, Technology back then was never thought of never thought to have been life was life you lived and hunted on the land and moved to stay alive.. Now im not sure exactly the supposive species of human and when they existed but i do believe that these species evolved.. the more they moved the easier life became and adaption happend. The young grew up in the harsh terrain and when they learned to walk they got stronger and built there muscles up and there bone structure over the years changed... untill 2,000 years ago when life was harsh but in many aspects simple.. communication over the years developed... and the human race evolved up to its current day form.. now i cant exactly my self a 14 almost 15 year old tell you exactly when and what changes happend and or why but they happend... a change of adaption in the 20th Century was the ribs.. if you take a poll of the whole world you may be supprised to see that some people may have 12 ribs while others may have 13 ribs...\n \n Also think of genetic mutation based on gases.. this might explain what happended when the world was formed.. this is not meant to be critizized or anything but... when the gasses and everything on the earth started to settle the gasses joined together and mutations of cells and atoms and gasses started to combine... the first living thing might have been a creature so simple meant to feed off of the toxic gasses and when it reproduced.. unknown of how the off spring might have been different than their adults and then trees might have been formed from carbon and other gasses. All that is known that this happens today... when we dropped the bomb on japan there was mutations in the human beings just by splitting certain atoms we cause such and explosive and toxic gas that changed all the living things around it... this may have happened earlier and elements might have been formed by heat and other electro magnetic forces in the planet we now know as earth... \n \n now im not saying that my evidence is truth and or fact but i used my current knowledge only. i didn't use anyother topics on here or any website to come up with my opinion so dont ask for exact evidence please...",

   "Many small evolutionary steps add up to large evolutionary differences. Once you accept that evolution can occur in small ways, it logically follows that given sufficient time, differences in different populations will eventually be immense.\n \n Creationists typically avoid this conclusion by refusing to define macroevolution, or defining it and then redefining it when it suits them. They may first say that macroevolution is when a species evolves into a different species (and species is again poorly defined), and when this is demonstrated, they demand evidence something has evolved from one \"kind\" into another, a \"kind\" being completely undefined.\n \n Basically they want to see a monkey evolve into a dinosaur. Scientists will agree this has not occurred, and is unlikely to in future, but so what? Monkeys turning into dinosaurs, or chickens into pigs is not what any theory of evolution claims in the first place.",

   "First things first,your understanding of microevolution is somewhat flawed. Nothing \"adapts to\" biologically, it can't. However, tiny changes happen in our genomes, and the results, while mostly harmful (cancers, genetic defects, people born without an anus,...) sometimes mean that one in a million is actually better - accidentally immune to a new disease, has more skin between the fingers and can thus swim better,...\n \n Humanity is a bad example for physical evolution. We have practically eliminated it, as we face no pressures. Take people who are born with webbed fingers. In theory, they should prosper in maritime environments. In practice, we consider them freaks. Now, imagine that as part of the global warming, a whole community gets flooded and a great deal of the people die - here, the mutants' increased survivability against strong currents, and the ability to hunt better suddenly outweigh the previous disadvantages - inability to hold agricultural implements properly or type fast.\n \n BTW, humans are evolving socially, though. People with better people skills are better at getting girls, smarter people get richer and attract trophy wives, etc. Oh, some change may be for the bad - our fascination with slimness goes for people who store less fat from food (insofar as biology is concerned), which is a bad thing come famine.",

This isn't true... this has been tried to be proven correct so many times its redicoulus.\n \n \n I want to comment on this post from Zephyr. First of all, there are four important clues about our ape ancestry that come from comparing the genomes of chimpanzees & humans:\n 1) now that that the chimp genome has been sequenced, it is a fact that 96% of their genes are identical to ours.\n 2) chimps share the same ERVs (Endigenous Retro-Viruses) in their genomes as we do, in exactly the same position as they are in us, alluding to the same common ancestors who had originally contracted these viral infections.\n 3) The GULO gene for endogenous synthesis of vitamin C is inactivated in both the chimp & human, but it is active in nearly every non-primate mammal.\n 4) the human genome has 23 pairs of chromosomes, instead of the 24 pair found in all the great apes, because two of the ape chromosomes have fused, as evidenced by the presence of repeating segments of their telomeres (ends of chromosomes) where they were attached to eachother.\n \n The fossil record is much more involved than I have space to discuss, and the main sequence from Australopithecines to Homo habilis to Homo erectus to Homo sapiens is familiar enough to most people on these forums. There is no serious doubt that Australopithecines were fully erect and could walk bipedally, as evidenced by a very human-like pelvis, femur (thigh bone), knee joint and foot (without an opposing big toe). This first step toward humanity @ 4 million years ago is well documented with dozens of specimens. Hundreds of other specimens document the gradual transition toward a more human upper torso and skull over the next 4 million years. I know of only two well respected anatomists that the creationists trot out to dispute these claims about Australopithecines - Solly Zuckerman & Charles Oxnard - and they are still evolutionists despite their dissenting views.",

   "\"Macroevolution\" and \"microevolution\" are real terms that are used, or have been used, in evolutionary biology. As I recall, the first term used was macroevolution and it was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1940. He used it in reference to his hypothesis of species formation. Goldschmidt thought that species formed in a single step by one large mutation. The hypothesis is sometimes known as the hopeful monster theory. However, genetic studies have shown that Goldschmidt was wrong. Speciation by means of the accumulation of small genetic differences has been observed.\n \n Now that Goldschmidt's hypothesis has been rejected the terms are still used from time to time. Futuyma uses the word infrequently, mostly in discussion of the history of evolutionary theory. In the introduction to Part II of Evolutionary Biology: Third Edition he tells us that the next 4 chapters deal with the history of macroevolution. He defines it as the origin of higher taxa, and of their characteristics and distribution, throughout the long history of life. But in those 4 chapters, Futuyma doesn't even use the word macroevolution.\n \n He returns to macroevolution in Part V, where he again defines it in almost the exact words as above. The title of Part V is Macroevolution: Evolution above the Species Level.\n \n So yes, the two words are legitimate biological terms. However, they actually aren't used very much in practice. Biologists usually just talk about evolution and by context they know whether macro or microevolution are being discussed.\n \n Creationists like to pretend that macroevolution is somewhat like Goldschmidt's hypothesis, a cat giving birth to a dog or a gorilla becoming a man. It's really a bit of a straw man from creationists. The intelligent creationists know it and don't care if they make the ignorant creationists look like fools. It comes from arguing about evolution without learning what it is.",

   "Pandion wrote:\n \"Macroevolution\" and \"microevolution\" are real terms that are used, or have been used, in evolutionary biology. As I recall, the first term used was macroevolution and it was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1940. He used it in reference to his hypothesis of species formation. Goldschmidt thought that species formed in a single step by one large mutation. The hypothesis is sometimes known as the hopeful monster theory. However, genetic studies have shown that Goldschmidt was wrong. Speciation by means of the accumulation of small genetic differences has been observed.\n \n \n Walking-fish:\n I still see creationists obfuscating the issue by equating Goldschmidt's \"hopeful monster\" idea with macroevolution, in general, and with Stephen J Gould's punctuated equilibrium more specifically. Every creationist on the debate forums uses that argument, with no exceptions that I've seen. They will constantly post the same quote by Gould, about a mutation in developmental genes causing the first 2 pharyngeal arches to move forward to be exapted as jaws in the first fish with jaws. Then they'll predicably jump to the conclusion that \"punk eek\" is all about a bird hatching from a reptile egg.",

   "Walking-fish:\n I've noticed how creationists \"move the goal-posts\" considering how observed speciation events cross the threshold between microevolution & macroevolution. Even their notion of \"biblical kinds\" has been moving up to higher taxons from the species to the family level. It reminds me of people retreating to higher ground as flood water continues to rise.\n\n \n They've even reached Orders. A short while ago on another board I pointed out to a creationist that Noah would have had to accommodate some 800 000 pairs of beetles on the ark. No, he replied, just one pair: they would then give rise to the rest of the beetle 'kind'. \"After all,\" he said, \"a beetle is a beetle.\"\n \n This is where the sheer biological ignorance of creationists comes into play. A corn weevil is far more anatomically and physiologically different from, say, a great diving beetle than a cat is from a dog; but my creo friend was perfectly happy to have the former pair descend (in super-fast time) from a common ancestral pair, whereas he'd sooner have died than admit that possibility for the other two.",

   "This is indeed the real problem with creationists using the term \"macro evolution\". They claim that macro evolution has never occured as no new species has ever being observed. Point out that new species have been observed forming and they then insist they aren't real new species, or that they really meant no species can turn into another \"kind\" and that that is what macro evolution really means.\n\n \n Yes its this approach that they roll out when discussing the continuity of the fossil record, they just insist every fossil species is a distinct \"kind\" regardless of its similarity to other specimens. The same dismissal is used on transitional forms as they are all distinct \"kinds\" as well.",

The same dismissal is used on transitional forms as they are all distinct \"kinds\" as well.\n\n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n My favorite example of this is with the hominid lineage. They have to make a determination between which ones are apes and which are human. Australopithecines are definitely on the ape side, as they trot out Solly Zuckerman & Charles Oxnard to downplay the part about being bipedal. And Homo erectus is too human to be an ape so they make up stories about how it would go unoticed on a subway (maybe on halloween where the lighting is bad). But the big stumbling block for them is Homo habilis, which is the perfect connecting link between the other two. The only argument I've heard is that it is a \"junk taxon\", because they haven't been able to dismiss it any other way. \n \n Now it looks like they're going to have another dilemna on their hands as more therapod dinosaurs are being found with feathers. It seems that God is inordinately fond of beetles and dinosaurs with feathers.",

We are just as closely related to a chimp as a house cat is to a lion.\n\n \n And in fact, we are far more related to chimps than mice are to rats.\n \n \nAt the DNA level, the human and chimpanzee genomes are almost 99% identical at the DNA bases where the two genomes align to each other. By taking into account the insertions and deletions that have occurred in each species since their divergence from a common ancestor ~5 to 6 million years ago, they still share 96% of their sequence. At the protein level, 29% of proteins have the identical sequence and the average protein has accumulated just one human-specific amino-acid change. [\"In fact, the typical human protein has accumulated just one unique change since chimpanzees and humans diverged from a common ancestor about 6 million years ago.\"] To put this into perspective, the number of genetic differences between human and chimpanzee is approximately 10 times less than the number of differences found between the previously sequenced genomes of mouse and rat. The results provide a strong support for Darwin's 1871 conclusion that humanity's closest relatives are the African apes; it is an example of a testable prediction about evolution - made even before the discovery of DNA's role in heredity - that is confirmed by experiment. \n (old emphasis added, Backgrounder: Comparison of Human and Chimp Genomes Reveals Striking Similarities and Differences, last updated (at time of quote extraction): August 30, 2005, \n http://www.broad.mit.edu/news/links/chimp-backgrounder.html NOTE: The one inserted sentence comes from this page's \"sister page\", http://www.broad.mit.edu/cgi-bin/news/display_news.cgi?id=161) \n",
