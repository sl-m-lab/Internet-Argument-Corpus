   "I'm wondering how the California amendment will affect those gay marriages that occurred between the time the judge rewrote the law and the amendment prohibited the marriages. Are those people married or not?\n\n \n In typical fashion, since the vote didn't go the way the gay alliance wanted, they are rejecting the results and claiming the initiative was unconstitutional. The only outcome they will accept is they outcome they want. These people are so duplicitous they will claim fraud even when their preferred candidate wins the election. http://www.mercurynews.com/samesexmarriage/ci_10901475\n California voters approve constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, opponents refuse to concede defeat\n \n By Mike Swift\n Mercury News\n Article Launched: 11/04/2008 10:24:36 PM PST\n \n Click photo to enlarge\n Brenda Haag, of San Jose, and fellow Proposition 8 opponents watch the results of the possible passing of Proposition 8, which would ban the right of same-sex couples to marry, at Crema Cafe in San Jose on Tuesday.\n \n BART extension falling short of needed two-thirds majority; mail-in ballots must still be counted\n Few problems reported in area despite record turnout\n After an intense campaign that cost more than $75 million, California's voters have approved a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, dealing a huge blow to the gay rights movement and setting the stage for another round of court battles over the volatile issue.\n Opponents this morning refused to concede the outcome, saying there may be as many as four million uncounted ballots.\n \"We are not in a position to call this. Really this is just fundamental,'' said Kate Kendell, executive director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights. \"We really need to wait until there is something authoritative issued by the Secretary of State's office. Until that happens, we do not feel it is appropriate for us to make our own call, absent the counting of millions of ballots.''\n While the Yes on 8 campaign claimed victory just before midnight, the numbers continued to play out in their favor this morning. Still, advocates of same-sex marriage had clung to hopes that a surge of support from uncounted votes could still overcome the ban.\n But this morning, with 95 percent of precincts reporting, the measure passed with 52 percent in favor, and 47.9 percent opposed. There are an untold number of absentee and provisional ballots left to be counted, according to the Associated Press, but it will be hard to overcome the 5 percent margin. The San Francisco City Attorney's office says he plans to file the legal challenge in the California Supreme Court to\n Advertisement\n challenge the validity of the measure. Also, the first lesbian couple to be married in Los Angeles County after the Supreme Court threw out the gay marriage ban plans to announce a lawsuit arguing that the proposition is unconstitutional.\n \"I think the story is that a strong majority of Californians support traditional marriage and they want to see it protected,\" said Frank Schubert, manager of the Yes on 8 campaign. \"I think the story is we ran a far better campaign than the other side. I think we had 100,000 people that gave of their resources and their time.\"\n The measure trims the number of states in which gays and lesbians can legally marry from three to two. But in striking the most populous and culturally influential state from that list, social conservatives and religious leaders have scored a much broader victory, likely limiting for years the hopes of gay rights leaders to allow same-sex couples to marry across the United States.\n For same-sex marriage supporters, it was a bitter loss, after major polls had consistently shown the measure losing through the fall.\n In San Jose, Ronni Pahl, a member of one of the first two same-sex couples married in Santa Clara County, watched the returns\n Video: Historic day\n \n with her wife, Hannah, and son Isaiah with a potent mix of emotion.\n \"It's bittersweet right now because we just watched the first African-American president elected. We were watching it with our African-American son, there were tears coming out of our eyes, and we went to look at what's happening at 8,\" Pahl said. \"We're speechless right now.\"\n In Santa Clara County, Proposition 8 was soundly defeated, losing by a 10 percent margin. The measure also trailed in Alameda, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, as well as in San Francisco.\n But as election evening wore on, that opposition was overwhelmed by more conservative areas of the state, particularly in the inland counties. The same-sex marriage ban had attracted more than 60 percent of the vote in Riverside County, and two-thirds of the vote in San Joaquin County, with more than half of precincts reporting in those counties.\n And despite the decisive win of Democratic nominee Barack Obama, in California and the rest of the country, polls were wrong in another way: They had predicted that the tide of Obama voters would block Proposition 8 from passing. But even in Santa Clara County, Obama captured a much higher share of the vote than the proportion who voted against Proposition 8.\n Schubert said the Yes on 8 campaign never trusted the polls.\n \"We've always felt that if we were tied going into Election Day, or a few points behind, we were going to win,\" he said. The decision \"is something that I think will reverberate across the nation and around the world.\"\n A constitutional bans on same-sex marriage was also approved in Florida - a state also won by Obama - and in Arizona. But for the gay rights leaders, this loss in California was more painful, because it marked the first time that voters rejected same-sex marriage in a state where it was already legal.\n While the new constitutional ban goes into effect immediately, it's less clear what the effect will be on same-sex couples who married from June 16 through Tuesday. While Attorney General Jerry Brown has said he does not believe Proposition 8 is retroactive, that issue is likely to wind up back in the courts, as well as an anticipated challenge to whether it is constitutional for California to revive its ban on same-sex marriage.\n The race began to tighten when the Yes on 8 campaign began running ads that suggested that churches could lose their tax-exempt status if clergy refused to do gay weddings and that second-graders would be taught about gay marriage.\n The figurehead of those ads: San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, proclaiming in a speech that gay marriage was now legal in California \"whether you like it or not.\"\n Yes on 8 supporters were feeling confident Tuesday night, even as the polls began to close.\n \"The momentum has really been with us,\" said Chip White, the press secretary for the Yes on 8 campaign. \"The trend has been in our direction ever since we went with that Gavin Newsom ad on Sept. 29.\"\n David McCuan, a political-science professor at Sonoma State University, said the move to victory for the Yes on 8 campaign might have begun here, when a campaign pushing for passage of an initiative began to behave like a classic \"No\" campaign - by injecting doubt about the effect of a proposed \"change\" into the minds of voters.\n Because gay marriage was so new in California, it allowed Yes on 8 campaign manager Frank Schubert to operate as if what was technically the status quo was actually a proposed change, and trying to inject doubt into the minds of voters about that \"change.\"\n Schubert \"essentially ran a No side campaign on the Yes side of this ballot measure and that has made it more sophisticated and less faith-based message,\" McCuan said.\n Given Obama's victory, \"it's a stunning, stinging defeat,\" McCuan said. \"This is a Democratic blue wave and standing out in one of the bluest of the blue states is this huge red result.\"\n Note the bolded for the best answer to your question that currently exists.",

   "For the life of me, I don't understand how a \"simple majority\" can justify a CONSTITUTIONAL amendment.\n\n \n My understanding is that they have to have a great many signatures to begin with to do it though. Then the vote is majority-vote. The voting is only part of the process.\n \n I also can't help but wonder if you'd be complaining so much about this 'simple majority' thing if it was 51% passing an amendment that FAVORED gay marriage.\n \n I don't see how this plan to get SCOTUS to strike this down is anything other that a hail mary pass, to say the least. Curious, but where do the rules say it has to be a 2/3rds vote, and if that's the case why has everyone been going on the understanding that it has to be a majority vote? Everyone's been wrong about that this whole time??? And you can't change the rules of how an amendment is created every time one is created that half-or-so of the people don't like. They might even rule in such a way, but not make it retroactive, effectively making it harder so on FUTURE attempts to amend the constitution and therefore make it harder to OVERTURN by the same process. If gay rights groups in CA were smart, they'd wait about trying to get a court to say the amendment requires a higher percentage of votes, at least until they try to reverse the process.\n \n \nFurthermore, as usual your analysis is ridiculously limited.\n Arizona and Arkansas, two states with anti-gay measures, voted for McCain electorally.\n Florida voted for Obama by a margin of 51%. If we go with some easy/sleazy assumptions for quick math, that means that if about 2% of those voting for Obama decided they didn't want gay marriage, then the anti-gay marriage initiative would pass.\n\n \n And your analysis is flat out lacking. What everyone else seems to realize is that the reason Obama won is because of FAR higher turnout, many by African American voters. (Who more tend to be ... taa daa! ... Democrats!) There is definitely a considerable discrepancy in Obama supporters and gay marriage supporters. Of that, there can be no doubt.\n \n And your anaysis of the FL situation is completely removed from reality. FL requires a vote of over 60% for an amendment to pass. It wouldn't pass at 59%, let alone 50. So not only do you demonstrate a lack of even knowing what was needed there, it doesn't even fit as an apt comparison.\n \n \nAnd amusingly enough, you who claim you don't have any interest in changing the outcome spend soooo much time posting on these threads...\n Perhaps that's another claim that's just false in your opinion?\n\n \n Who said I have no interest in changing the outcome? I think it's ridiculous when states ban gay marriage. The CA one was a colossal waste of 80 something million dollars if you include both sides, from what I've read. While that's chump change in terms of all the money in celebrity Hollywood, imagine how much that money would have helped people that really need it.

   "An interesting article on one of the ballot initiatives--the CA one.\n \n A symbolic low point for the gay side came on Oct. 13, when the Sacramento Bee ran a remarkable story about Rick and Pam Patterson, a Mormon couple of modest means - he drives a 10-year-old Honda Civic, she raises their five boys - who had withdrawn $50,000 from their savings account and given it to the pro-8 campaign. \"It was a decision we made very prayerfully,\" Pam Patterson, 48, told the Bee's Jennifer Garza. \"Was it an easy decision? No. But it was a clear decision, one that had so much potential to benefit our children and their children.\"\n \n You could argue that marriage equality has little to do with children, but Patterson seemed to speak to Californians' inchoate phobias about gays and kids. On the Friday before the Bee story appeared, a group of San Francisco first-graders was taken to city hall to see their lesbian teacher marry her partner. Apparently the field trip was a parent's idea - not the teacher's - but the optics of the event were terrible for the gay side. It seemed like so much indoctrination.\n \n That news came around the same time the pro-amendment forces were running a devastating ad showing a self-satisfied San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom shouting wild-eyed at a rally that same-sex marriage was inevitable \"whether you like it or not.\" The announcer then said darkly, \"It's no longer about tolerance. Acceptance of gay marriage is now mandatory.\" Many fence sitters were turned off by Newsom's arrogance; blogger Andrew Sullivan attributed mid-October polls against the gay side to the \"Newsom effect.\"\n \n Gays came back in some polls, but they couldn't pull out a win. Part of the reason is that Obama inspired unprecedented numbers of African Americans to vote. Polls show that black voters are more likely to attend church than whites and less likely to be comfortable with equality for gay people. According to CNN, African Americans voted against marriage equality by a wide margin, 69% to 31%. High turnout of African Americans in Florida probably help explain that state's lopsided vote to ban same-sex weddings.\"\n \n More at Why Gay Marriage Was Defeated in California - Yahoo! News",

Democrats!) There is definitely a considerable discrepancy in Obama supporters and gay marriage supporters.

This favorably distinguishes them from Republicans.\n\n \n \n No.. you are actually right, the DNC couln't be more rank and defiled. There are many pro-life and and anti-gay agenda democrat legislators so don't resting on laurels you don't have - those people you can reach across the isle and work with, the others... no, you have to put them down squarely where they are.",

   "I was quite surprised it passed.\n That is an oddly presumptive comment... how do you come to that conclusion?\n \n Because Californians for the most part are fairly liberal on social issues, the thing was that Hispanic and Black communities along with major contribution by the Mormon church made it a lot bigger issue.\n \n Quote:\n I never though Californians would approve it so easily.\n Again, how so? We know how we got here... we sex is a choice even if straight, so why the hanging lip?\n \n Sex is a choice, sexual orientation is not.\n \n Quote:\n It's an unfortunate setback for gays and lesbians,\n It is a clear line drawn by voters of California regardless of politics... most homosexuals aren't even concerned with it... only this delusional bunch to which don't deserve the time of day.\n \n I live in California and you can pretty much propose any useless drivel for a ballot initiative as long as you get the signatures. In a sense it has it's negatives and positives..in this case IMHO, it was a negative.\n \n Quote:\n but nevertheless I have faith our Justice system will deem it unconstitutional,\n Boy, that's an arrogant but glowingly ignorant statement... how do you come to the conclusion that deviant behavior somehow deserves constitutional protections? But even more idiotic... where is it constitutional? you make an unjustified claim... bring evidence.\n \n Deviant behavior? The state brought this on themselves when they accepted marriage. If they do that then it should be available to any consenting adults that want to get married. Not so long ago interracial marriage was banned, this is no different. The majority oppressing a minority based on sexual orientation..sounds like discrimination to me.\n \n Quote:\n because it really is.\n Our laws don't protect your feelings...\n \n It's not about feelings it's about privileges and rights.\n \n \n Quote:\n Oh well, let's hope the courts settle this. Equal rights and privileges for EVERYONE!\n If your argument was valid.. the courts would never have to intervene, it is because people plainly see homosexuality for what it is - that you have no argument. You do not have a civil right to be gay... it is not a fundamental liberty our US Constitution charges a value for. Liberal endorse fairness and equality... for the wrong things. Life isn't fair... or Constitution doesn't guarantee fairness, and it never morally equivocates blatantly immoral behavior as anything socially beneficial... it draws clear lines between between life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness... not lifestyle, [civil] liberties and the pursuit of fun. Get that straight buddy... this is a subject that shoul dhave never been on the table in the first place.\n \n If you believe that then please show viable evidence that homosexuality is a choice. You talk to about emotions and what not, but you are basing your beliefs on religious beliefs of what marriage is. That in itself violates the Constitution. Being gay or lesbian is not a lifestyle, get that over your head already. Having sex with a ton of women and drinking all the time is a lifestyle. Like I said since the state recognizes marriage it is only right any consenting adult gets that same privilege. \n __________________",

All presidential elections show a significantly higher black vote support for Democrats than Republicans. \n\n \n \n Give it a rest... if you rely on factcheck... for information gathering, you both need help. The question was never about how many black voters affiliated with what interest, it was what the basis of their motivations for making the social issues choices made, Sigma's subterfuge was irrelevant as no one asked that question - the point was how could he justify rank conjectue and unbased opinion from a view point he is clueless to... that rendered his view as clearly intellectually dishonest.\n \n But sense you need a little guidance here:\n \n Word Around the Net: CONSERVATIVE MINORITY\n \n Blacks could tilt state vote on gay marriage ban, analysts say : State News : TCPalm\n \n Also:\n \n \nABSTRACT\n Objective. Much is known about voting behavior generally; less is known about voting behavior of African Americans in particular due in part to the overwhelming support of black voters for Democratic candidates. However, some argue that black conservatism on social issues could lead to more Republican voting.\n \n Methods. We test this question with a set of data on black voting behavior in a 2004 congressional race where two black candidates ran against each other. We thus hold race of candidate constant and look at the influence of social issues and party identification on black vote choice.\n \n Results. We find evidence to suggest that evangelicalism and support for the war in Iraq is related to being Republican, but that Democratic Party identification plays the dominant role in black voter decision making.\n \n Conclusions. Black conservatism on at least certain social issues is real and has the potential to influence vote choice, but the influence of Democratic Party allegiance is still a very powerful cue for black voters.\n \n - Newport University: The Wiley Journal\n \n \n\n \n \n The \"ample facts\" you thought you bought... is nothing more than bring a knife to a gun fight as they are not germane to the topic I directed my comments toward - both of you two need lots, and lots of help.",
