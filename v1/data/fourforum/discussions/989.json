Since the Germans had the world's first cruise missile (V-1) and ICBM (V-2), it would've been a matter of time before they had a nuclear weapon to place on these. Nevermind the Horten brother's flying-wing design that would've flown non-stop to New York to drop an atomic bomb at an altitude too great for any American fighter at the time.

I was pointing out what the downfall of the Nazis was, if they had not been too hasty then this world would be a very different place.\n\n \n Right. I agree with your premise. The Germans made a few critical mistakes that cost them dearly. Attacking Russia was one of them and not crushing the British right away was the other. Oh, and let us not forget that Germany declared war on the U.S. after Pearl Harbor! BIG MISTAKE! Avoiding that would've bought time for them as well.\n \n The Luftwaffe was almost entirely to blame for it's failure to win the Battle of Britain. Goering was an idiot. He was a 'yes man' to Hitler. One of the reasons why the Germans never inflicted the amount of destruction necessary to defeat Britain was that their failure to build 4-engine heavy bombers like the allies. Goering once said in a conversation that 'Hitler only cared about how many bombers were being built, not how many engines they had'. That was a mistake and they probably realized that when hundreds of B-17s, B-24s, Lancasters, etc. began raining down tons of bombs almost daily upon them!\n \n If Britain could've been defeated from the start, then Russia would've been in serious trouble. The Russian's strength was in numbers. Did you ever see 'Enemy at the gate'? That wouldn't have made a very good recruiting tool for the Russians! If you ever read anything about their advance into Poland, you'd know that they weren't the good guys either. They were the lesser of two evils. We should've turned Patton loose on them after the fall of Berlin. \n \n With Britain out of the way, the Germans could've increased their technological advantage over the allies that could or would have resulted in their victory in Europe and set the stage for their battle with the U.S., which may or may not have negotiated some sort of settlement or peace. Especially, had German bombers bombed New York.\n \n In the end, it was lucky for us that Hitler was insane (if you call that lucky) and his opponents failed to kill him with that bomb.",

   "Let's talk about this from a \"German point of view\":\n \n In my eyes, the Russians won the war (at least in the European theatre). Why?\n Negative. The Germans were fighting a two front war, the Russians were not.\n 1. The paid the highest price in blood from all fighting nations. Russia lost something like 75% + from a ENTIRE generation defending their home-land against the agressors.\n Correct. They were poorly led, at first. And the Russian leaders were willing to use as many troops as took regardless of the losses. A U.S. commander would've been court martialed had they followed the same doctrine. Did you ever see 'Enemy at the gate'? It was nice of those Russian officers to shoot you dead should you take cover, return or seek medical attention for combat injuries.\n 2. The Russians contributed most troops and manpower to the war cause, with no regard for the lives of their own people (that's what you'll have to do in a war, let's face it).\n Again, the Russians had no concern for the safety or lives of their troops, they were expendable. The Russians were able to sustain the enormous losses and the Germans were not. Sheer numbers, not military genius, is what gave the Russians the edge. Nevermind the fact that the Germans were also fighting the British and Americans on the other side.\n 3. The Russians fought the hardest. Once the Allies in the West started invading France, the Russians still fought the best of the best of Germany's army while low grade conscripts or less experienced and less battle hardened trops fought in the west.\n That's totally opinionated. Is that a fact? Have you ever heard of Captain Michael Wittman? Touted as the best tank commander of WWII and most decorated tanker ace of the war, Wittman had 141 tank and 132 anti-tank victories most of which were on the Eastern Front. However, his most famous engagement occurred in 1944 at Villers Bocage. Wittman's company of 6 Tiger's attacked a British column comprised of vehicles from the 22nd Armored Brigade. One Tiger broke down, but they still managed to destroy 4 Sherman Firefly's, 20 Cromwell's, 3 Stuart's, 3 M4 Sherman OP's, 14 Half-track's, 16 Bren Carrier's and 2 6 pdr anti-tank gun's. The British advance was stopped cold and the Germans held the town for another two months. Now, he doesn't sound like a conscript to me. Why would the greatest tank ace of WWII be moved from the Russian front to Normandy? Sorry, bud.. you need to crack open a history book or two. The Germans only resorted to 'conscripts' towards the very end. The Russians didn't 'fight the hardest', they just overwhelmed the Germans with sheer numbers.\n 4. Russia was directly threatened, while evreyone else had some water between them and the Wehrmacht - without the channel, the UK would be speaking German by now - without the Atlantic the US would be speaking German by now.\n So? The Russians still benefited from an endless supply chain from the U.S. and the Western Front. Had Britain been invaded, as initially planned, those supplies would have been in serious jeopardy. Both Britain and Russia benefited from U.S. aid to be certain. The U.S. benefited from not having it's industry bombed. But to say that having the Atlantic between us was the ONLY reason why we're not speaking German is not only ridiculous, but unprovable.\n The Russians fought the hardest and most bloody battles, they were the ones assaulting Berlin, they were the one heroically defending their home lands and people - despite all odds (don't forget, they didn't fight some rag-tag army, we're talking about the Wehrmacht - one of the most successful armies in history next to the Roman Legions and the army of Alexander the Great) and won.\n The Russian battles were 'bloody' because they sacrificed men and equipment recklessly because they had the numbers to sustain such a strategy. The same quality troops fought on both fronts, you again fail to prove any of your assertions. I would add that the Russian army was nowhere close to the quality of the German army. Nor did they single-handedly defeat one of the greatest armys in world history. Had there been NO Western Front, the outcome would have been decidedly different. \n Sure, they needed some equipment here and there, but they still did most of the fighting. At least in the European theatre, the Russians won the war.\n Your argument should be that the Russians stupidity and recklessness made 'aces' of several German personalities. I already cited Captain Wittman, but did you know that the greatest aerial ace of military history is also a German with most of his 352 victories coming from combat on the Eastern Front? That would be Erich Hartmann who would later fly on the Western Front in JV-44 flying the Me-262 with the other top German aces. The Russians did not 'win the war' all by themselves. That's ridiculous and totally false. \n \n - Dwight\n\n \n I suggest you try reading, 'A Genius For War: The German Army And General Staff, 1807 - 1945'.",

   "\n Negative. The Germans were fighting a two front war, the Russians were not.\n \n\n \n And your point is? emoticon_confused \n \n \n\n Correct. They were poorly led, at first. And the Russian leaders were willing to use as many troops as took regardless of the losses.\n\n \n So did the Germans and a lot of armies did so too. In war soldiers die. The Russians had no other chance, they HAD TO fight with everything they got while others were more reluctant. It doesn't change a dime about the fact the Russians fought pretty hard with great bravery and the will to sacrifce what is necessary. We shouldn't forget they fought to DEFEND their home land - this justifies ANY means.\n \n \nA U.S. commander would've been court martialed had they followed the same doctrine. Did you ever see 'Enemy at the gate'? It was nice of those Russian officers to shoot you dead should you take cover, return or seek medical attention for combat injuries.\n \n\n \n Claiming a point of argument from a Hollywood flick is not a valid argument. The Russians pressed their troops pretty hard, so what? A good officer has to do so. It's only a legend the Russians executed everyone who \"took cover\" or \"fell back to get medical treatment\". Officers threatening troops is pretty common, even Erwin Rommel did so in WWI SEVERAL TIMES by his own account. I wouldn't be suprised to be threatened by my own NCO ina combat situation and to be honest, I'd do so myself.\n \n \n\n Again, the Russians had no concern for the safety or lives of their troops, they were expendable. The Russians were able to sustain the enormous losses and the Germans were not. Sheer numbers, not military genius, is what gave the Russians the edge. Nevermind the fact that the Germans were also fighting the British and Americans on the other side.\n\n \n And your point is? This doesn't change a dime (again) on my argument.\n \n \n\n That's totally opinionated. Is that a fact? [snip] Sorry, bud.. you need to crack open a history book or two. The Germans only resorted to 'conscripts' towards the very end. The Russians didn't 'fight the hardest', they just overwhelmed the Germans with sheer numbers.\n\n \n Well, my grand father, my mothers three uncles all have been CONSCRIPTED into the Wehrmacht in 1939 and sent off to Poland - but I guess when you say Germany didn't use conscription at this time your right and my family histroy has to be wrong... Germany ALWAYS used conscription, heck, we even do so today. The Russians had the full attention of the entire Wehrmacht for a few years - they DID fight the most experienced and battle hardened troops Germany could muster at this time - troops who fought in Northern Africa, Poland, France and Scandinavia had been sent to Russia.\n \n Even as the Allied forces invaded into France, more new troops had been sent against the Russians than against the Allied invasion. The Russian advance was always rated the bigger threat by the German Command which is a fact. The rebels who tried to assassinate Hitler in 1944 planned to arrange a cease fire in the west in order to sent everything which was left against the Russians in the hope to stop their advance. A lot of people knew what has happened in Western Russia once the Wehrmacht passed through and everyone knew a lot of Russians had quite a bone to pick with the Germans and they're in for some revenge once they come to Germany.\n \n \n\n But to say that having the Atlantic between us was the ONLY reason why we're not speaking German is not only ridiculous, but unprovable.\n\n \n I guess if the US with the same military capabilities like in 1939 would have shared a border with Germany there would have been no way to stop them [the Germans] from invading AND winning. You shouldn't forget the kill : casualtiy ratio the Wehrmacht had. This was 6:1 to 4:1. In the [hypothetical] scenario of a WWII German army having the chance to invade the US, the battle would have been pretty... one sided to say at last.\n \n \n\n The Russian battles were 'bloody' because they sacrificed men and equipment recklessly because they had the numbers to sustain such a strategy.\n\n \n And the will to do so.\n \n \nI would add that the Russian army was nowhere close to the quality of the German army.\n\n \n I never said the opposite.\n \n \nNor did they single-handedly defeat one of the greatest armys in world history.\n\n \n Well, they only eliminated several German armies and pushed them back out of their homeland into the enemies homeland. I think we can call this \"defeat the greatest army in world history\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n\n Had there been NO Western Front, the outcome would have been decidedly different. \n \n\n \n Yes, but there was a western front and the Russians still fought the hardest. They had support, but still THEY did the most of the fighting and for quite a long time they also had to fight without too much support or no support at all.\n \n They've been involved in the war from the very early beginning, fought a lot of battles and their resilliance, bravery and will to sacrifice has brought defeat to Germany. Would the Russians have fallen, the war - at least in Europe - would have been lost by the Allies. The Russians will to sacrifice lots of men, blood and material ensured the Allies had a fighting chance once the US, Canadian and British (and all those I now forgot) troops have been able to invade France.\n \n \n\n The Russians did not 'win the war' all by themselves. That's ridiculous and totally false. \n\n \n As you might notice once you read my post again and carefully, I said the Russians (to sum it up in a dew words) contributed the most to the Allied victory in Europe. They did NOT win the war by themselves, but they contributed the most to that victory - and that's why I say, they won the war [in the Europena theatre]. Oh, and please stop posting thos tiresome facts on some \"military ace\". That's only a thing for military hsitory affictionados and doesn't add to much to the topic.\n \n \n\n This is like saying the Iraqis did the best fighting in the second gulf war because they lost the most people. I'm of the opinion that a lower body count does not necessarily mean you did less to affect the outcome of the war.\n\n \n Turning my words in my mouth is surely a great way to make a point... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n\n In German propaganda terms it was a fight of the invincible German army against the Russians who were just a smaller form of life for straight Nazis.\n So in the end the mighty German army got beaten by farmers and peasants.\n So the psychological effect isn't that unimportant imho.\n\n \n Yeah, exactly.\n \n - Dwight",

   "So far I have found little historical evidence of the NKVD machine gunning retreating troops. if you have other sources, I'd love to see them. Commissars were (untill mid 42) empowered to do anything they felt nescesary to enforce discipline.\n \n However, the NKVD were never given the same privileges, and primarily served to gather up stragglers and rally routed troops.\n \n \n Good German troops DID fight the western allies, the battle of the Bulge is pretty decent proof of that, where the Germans threw (or sacrificed) the best their army had to give at the moment.\n However, most of the troops near theD day areas were Ost Frivillige, people who were more or (often) less volunteering to fight in the German army, as well as recently formed \"peoples grenadiers\" that had little experience. There were exceptions of course, but it was the norm more than the exception.\n \n \n To be really honest, I dont think a US military presence in 1940 would have mattered. Having the US arm itself that early would have shortened the war for certain, maybe ending it as soon as 43, but before US war entry, their army was nowhere near a position where it could fight, let alone perform aggressive action. \n Poor armour, little training, barely enough service rifles to go around.\n \n it takes time to gear up an aarmy of that size and magnitude.\n \n If USA had entered the war in 1940, they would have geared up much faster, and could propably have been fighting at full strength around early 42. \n \n \n \n This is of course all speculation, and there seems to be two schools of thought today. Either you believe that USA was vital, or that they were not. \n The truth, most likely, is that none of the \"big three\" could have been left out, if the allies were still to win the war.\n \n \n Cheers!",

   "My 22 cents:\n \n The war was won by the Allies as a whole. If it had not been for each's contribution the conflict would have lasted longer.\n \n I have to say about about the Eastern Front as the conflict was on a scale and intensity of its own.\n \n The war in the east bled germany white. 90% of Herr (Army) casualties occured in the battles of the Eastern Front. The Russians paid a very heavy price for this achievement- their military and civilian casualties were appalling (20 million dead in total out of 58 million or so in the whole war).\n \n Incidents such as Stalingrad inflicted the sort of losses the Germans were just unable to replace- for example the Luftwaffe's transport pool was devastated by the losses it sustained in the doomed attempt to keep the \"Kessel\" supplied November 1941 - January 1942. After their earlier heavy losses in the Crete campagin it was finished as the world class arm that had entered the war.\n \n With regards to the US involvement (as that is the topic) it was essential in allowing the Soviet military machine to gear up to an offensive tempo that began a trend of continual retreat for the Germans from mid 1943 (Kursk, the last real German offensive action) until the fall of Berlin in May 1945.\n \n It seems unlikely that the USSR would have ever fallen under Germany's assault and that it was only a matter of time until its huge industrial and human resources could be brought to bear.

If America started the war the same time as the Brits and such, we prob would not have lost France(WWI), making it easier to attack Germany.\n\n \n Speculation based on what? Were you ready for war in 1939? Not only were you not in a military or economic way, but you weren't in a moral way - large portions of the US still isolationist - recall \"America First\"?\n \n So such speculation is rather pointless. What we do know is that the 'bastion of democracy' stood by as Britain and France crumbled. You didn't enter the war until Japan attacked, and even then, waited till Germany declared war on you until you too were at war with such an evil empire.",

I believe that numerically, they had less tanks than UK/France, but the western allies had the idea that tanks should support infantry, whereas the Germans had the idea that infantry should support tanks.\n Thus the allies would scatter their tank forces amongst their infantry, whereas the Germans concentrated theirs into tank divisions, corps, and so on.\n For the most part German tanks were better than all of the ally's tanks (except for the Russians; who produced the outstanding T-34 et al).\n \n The US, from what I recall, failed to deliver a single 'great' tank. The Sherman was mainly designed to support infanty and the edge the allies had over tanks came from air-power... which brings me to look at the US air power in 1939. Your most outstanding fighter air-craft such as the P-51 Mustang was developed (with a comining of it with the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine) much later on.\n \n This in no way is meant to diminish the outstanding effort of the US.

Whilst they did lose carrier forces at Coral Sea, the Japanese sent only four carriers to Midway, not because that's all they had left, but because they dispersed their carrier fleet around because the USA was not their only enemy. \n \"The Imperial Japanese Navy lost over 300 pilots and four of its largest aircraft carriers in a battle which lasted only two days.\"\n http://www.combinedfleet.com/ijnaf.htm\n That is, of all their carrier force, four of them were lost. That means not all of their carrier force. But more specifically they had..\n \" Its naval aviation corps, consisting of 10 (major) aircraft carriers...\"\n http://www.combinedfleet.com/kaigun.htm\n The main carriers were:\n The Kaga, completed in 1928\n Akagi in 1927\n Ryujo: 1931\n Soryu: 1937\n Hiryu: 1939\n Shokaku: 1941 and Zuikaku: 1941\n Taiyo: 1941 (and its sister ships Unyo: 1942 and Chuyo: 1942)\n Hiyo: 1942 and Junyo: 1942\n follow links from http://www.combinedfleet.com/cv.htm\n \n The very real reason they dispersed them was because\n a) they wanted to draw attention away from their main target (Midway), with feints against secondary targets, such as Alaska\n and\n b) to engage other enemy fleets/protect their holdings from said fleets.\n \nSo you're saying that America was lucky.

Japan would have been defeated by new American construction. It may have taken longer, but they would have been defeated.\n\n Who knows what a defeat at Midway might have meant; with the whole US west-coast exposed, you might have sued for peace. You recognise 'the panic' of late 1941, and you still had a large pro-appeasement lobby-group.\n \nJust another correction: the B-36 had its first flight in 1946.\n\n \nA large number of atomic bombs wouldn't have been available till 1948 anyway.\n\n Then why bring up the B-36? You could easily have said the B-29 which we know was in WWII use, and used for the A-bomb.\n \nSince the UK wouldn't have been available as an aircraft carrier, however, work on the B-36 would have began much earlier and its early teething problems would likely have been fixed in time.\n\n Not just that.

   "You had British troops in Canada, and they've had two wars against you. When America has been weak, you've allowed foreign troops into the Americas.\n\n \n Actually, Britain had only been lightly garrisoning Canada since the Civil War, knowing that trying to defend it would have been useless if the US decided to invade. This impulse was further strengthened by steadily improving US-UK relations. Furthermore, both wars occurred over a century ago.\n \n Germany, on the other hand, was openly expansionist. \n \n \nYou're leaping all over the place, chronologically speaking. When did Canada get this guarantee? Remember, I've been talking about a hypothesis in 1940 of the allies giving up the fight.\n\n \n In 1938. The proclamation said that \"the United States would not stand idly by\" if Canada were threatened. From that point on, Canada has had the formal protection of the United States.\n \n \nThen, yes, it was the point you were making. You said, twice now, that they sent their entire carrier force (which would be part of 'their whole fleet').\n They didn't send their whole fleet, and they didn't send all their carrier force.\n \n That's only half true. Whilst they did lose carrier forces at Coral Sea, the Japanese sent only four carriers to Midway, not because that's all they had left, but because they dispersed their carrier fleet around because the USA was not their only enemy. \n \"The Imperial Japanese Navy lost over 300 pilots and four of its largest aircraft carriers in a battle which lasted only two days.\"\n http://www.combinedfleet.com/ijnaf.htm\n That is, of all their carrier force, four of them were lost. That means not all of their carrier force. But more specifically they had..\n \" Its naval aviation corps, consisting of 10 (major) aircraft carriers...\"\n http://www.combinedfleet.com/kaigun.htm\n The main carriers were:\n The Kaga, completed in 1928\n Akagi in 1927\n Ryujo: 1931\n Soryu: 1937\n Hiryu: 1939\n Shokaku: 1941 and Zuikaku: 1941\n Taiyo: 1941 (and its sister ships Unyo: 1942 and Chuyo: 1942)\n Hiyo: 1942 and Junyo: 1942\n follow links from http://www.combinedfleet.com/cv.htm\n\n \n Unyo and Chuyo weren't completed in time for the Midway operation. Meanwhile, the Taiyo was a light carrier, capable of carrying less than 30 aircraft and wouldn't have made much of a difference in the battle. I believe it was in dry dock during the Midway operation. Ryujo and Junyo took part in the operation against the Aleutian Islands. With their slow speeds, the Hiyo-class carriers weren't suited to the operation at Midway. They would have significantly slowed Nagumo's force, a force that would need speed to be able to hit both Midway and the American carriers. The Hiyo wasn't commissioned until July of 1942 anyway. Shokaku and Zuikaku were, as I said, crippled at Coral Sea. Thus, the vessels of the Japanese carrier fleet either took part in Midway or were unavailable. The four fleet carriers were destroyed, the other carriers that participated were either auxiliary units or light carriers. \n \n \nThe very real reason they dispersed them was because\n a) they wanted to draw attention away from their main target (Midway), with feints against secondary targets, such as Alaska\n and\n b) to engage other enemy fleets/protect their holdings from said fleets.\n \n As stated above, this is only part of the matter. The other consideration is that you did not need to face alone their entire carrier force.\n\n \n As I said, the bulk of the Japanese fleet took part in the Midway operation. The ships that did not participate were light carriers or unavailable at the time. From Jack Greene's The Midway Campaign, \"Japan was using all but two fleet carriers [which were under repair], five heavy cruisers, and ten light cruisers of their major combat ships.\" The Japanese were not defending their frontier; they were engaging in an all out attack against the Americans.\n \n As for the first issue, combining their force into one unit, yes, the Japanese could have done so. But the idea of concentrating the fleet into one unit never came up; it was never a serious matter of discussion. Separating the fleet into a number of smaller units was a trademark of Japanese operations and would be seen time and time again. This point, I contend, was not luck but rather Japanese tactical doctrine. \n \n \nWho knows what a defeat at Midway might have meant; with the whole US west-coast exposed, you might have sued for peace. You recognise 'the panic' of late 1941, and you still had a large pro-appeasement lobby-group.\n\n \n The US isolationist faction was not an appeasement faction. They didn't want to appease aggressive foreign powers; they wanted to ignore them because they \"knew\" that the dictators could not hurt them. Pearl Harbor and Operation Drumbeat (German attacks on American coastal shipping) showed them otherwise. \n \n Also, the US would have been left with Saratoga and Wasp, as well as Ranger if things became real desparate. Within a year, the US would have two Essex-class carriers and four Independence-class light carriers available. \n \n \nThen why bring up the B-36? You could easily have said the B-29 which we know was in WWII use, and used for the A-bomb.\n\n \n Unlike the B-29, the B-36 could have bombed Germany from the US. Work began in 1940, when it was believed that Britain would fall. Once it was clear that the UK would hold out, planning concentrated on the B-29 and B-24. Here, the Liberators and Superfortresses would die stillborn and only a small force of B-17's would be constructed. When the B-36 became operational, not only would it be able to hit Germany from bases in the US, it would have a higher ceiling than most German fighters. If the bombers were equipped with atomic weapons, the force would only need one raid to cripple the enemy.\n \n \nNot just that. The UK supplied you with de-coding technology from Bletchley Park that helped you prosecute the war. Had the Brits been out of the war, you'd not have been so quick to decipher German codes.\n\n \n The US wouldn't have need to be so quick to decifer the codes. The US wouldn't be mobilized for a few years, there would be few convoys to protect, so U-Boats wouldn't be a problem, Germany couldn't attack the US, so codes for the Luftwaffe would not be needed.\n \n \nI find it hard to believe either the USSR or the USA could have won the war alone.\n\n \n Well, as I said, I believe otherwise.",

If the bombers were equipped with atomic weapons, the force would only need one raid to cripple the enemy..\n\n \n I seriously doubt the ability of the B-36 to carry raids out as you describe; here is why:\n \n No bomber employed in a strategic role has ever had immunity from interception. I don't see the B-36 being any different to this rule. If we care to speculate an in-service date for the type in the above scenario, it would not be before mid 1944 at the earliest. Given another half year to work out the technical difficulties of such a complex airplane and assemble a large enough force to be effective and significant combat operations are unlikely before early 1945.\n \n At this time Germany would have been in possession of fighters quite capable of effecting an interception at the operational altitudes the B-36 operated at (which was no more than 42500 feet/13000 metres on the B model). An actual example of such a fighter that was produced is the Ta-152H-1. In this scenario we can assume that Germany would have devoted greater resources to high altitude fighter design and manufacture, so there would have been other types available as well.\n \n With the abscence of fighter escorts on such missions, the B-36's would have been extremely vunerable as they spent hours over hostile airspace. Damage that might have allowed the plane to return to base in a shorter range mission would have proved fatal over the long return leg over the Atlantic. I can only imagine losses would have been at a similiar unsustainable rate to those the 8th AAF suffered in mid-late 1943.\n \n Finally with regards to the atom bomb, I don't see how a raid you envisioned could be reliably executed. Without air superiority, the aircraft would have been very vunerable and a loss would have been disasterous, particularly if the atomic weapon fell into enemy hands. Also, with Britain out of the war, the Manhattan project's progress would have been curtailed- probably by at least a year, so bombs would not have been available in number (in the tens) until early 1947. At this point we can only guess what the strategic situation in Europe may have been.",

Not Ryujo.\n\n \n My apologies if I was unclear, but I wasn't saying Ryujo was a sister of the Junyo, just that her small aircraft capacity precluded her from taking a major role in te operation.\n \n \nA few things need sorting out...\n This statement of yours, though detailed is superflous to your defence of your erroneous statement (below). The fact is the Japanese did not have all their carrier fleet at midway, and thus this negates your statement...\n\n \n \nYou call the non-participating carriers 'light-carriers' etc. Had they been at Midway your own forces would have been badly handled; your own light/escort carriers were able to fight against the Japanese in one phase of the Battle of Letye Gulf.. \n \n \n If by light carriers you mean the escort carriers of the Admiral Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet (the 'Taffy' forces), then, no, they did not effectively fight against the Japanese battleline. The escorting destroyers managed to do damage well out of proportion of their size and the escort carriers did launch attacks, but the Japanese battleships remained intact. Had it not been for the fact that the Japanese admiral lost his nerve and retreated, the entire force of escort carriers would have been destroyed. \n \n If, on the other hand, you are referring the the Independence-class light carriers that were a part of Halsey's 3rd Fleet, then, yes, they did participate in raids against the approaching Japanese fleet and did damage. They were, however, supported by 8 Essex-class fleet carriers.\n \n \nYou also miss a vital point, the loss at Coral Sea itself was partly because the Japanese weren't just at war with the US, and had to spread their forces around. \n \n \n Now that, I admit, is a good point. Without Australia in the war, there would be no attack on Port Morseby. There likely wouldn't be attacks on Johnston or Baker Islands, since the Japanese wouldn't need to cut the supply lines to Australia, meaning they had no real target except Midway. Thus, all six fleet carriers could partake in the operation. At the same time, however, the US would also have Lexington and Yorktown would be a little more stable. \n \n \nThey were never, despite your statement above, able to concentrate all their carriers. I accept that another reason the Japanese did not have as many carriers at Midway was because they thought the US had lost another carrier at Coral Sea, but the very victory (in strategic terms at Coral Sea; which was vital to the victory at Midway) was itself a product of Japanese needs being spread over a large part of the world against many enemies... thus the Japanese were NOT able to concentrate all their carriers against you at any given time/place.\n\n \n The Japanese concentrated their available fleet at Midway. The number of American carriers remaining had no bearing on the amount of forces they committed. The Saratoga and Wasp were in the process of joining the Pacific Fleet (had the Japanese waited something like two weeks to attack Midway, the Americans would have had five fleet carriers, compared to the four Japanese fleet carriers). Part of this operation was the Aleutian invasion. It was intended as a diversion and was thus an integral portion of the Midway operation. The Japanese needed carriers with this force to strengthen its appearance as a major operation. The Japanese also needed the carrier Zuiho to defend the invasion force. If the transports were sunk, then the threat to Midway ended. Sure, the carriers could bombard the island, but the American carrier fleet wouldn't respond, since the Japanese couldn't do anything more substantial. \n \n Now, assuming Coral Sea doesn't happen, the Japanese Kido Butai at Midway will have two more fleet carriers, while the US will have one more fleet carrier. Again, the Japanese will launch half their aircraft at Midway. The attack will cause damage, but most likely, there will still be a call for a second wave. Since Yorktown would have left Pearl at the same time as her two sisters, the Japanese scout doesn't spot anything. Nagumo, therefore, launches his second strike against Midway. There's no reason to believe that the American strike would be more concentrated, so the torpedo bombers are still devastated, but the Japanese CAP is still at sea level. I imagine that Nagumo, when he realizes that he's now being attacked by carrier borne aircraft, will start to rearm the survivors of the first strike with anti-shipping weapons (armor piercing bombs and torpedoes) while launching fast carrier-borne scout planes. This happens at 0920. Thus, when the dive bombers arrive at 1002, the Japanese hangers will still have bombs and fuel lines scattered everywhere (contrary to popular belief, these explosive elements were not on the flight deck, rather, American bombs penetrated to the hangers below, where the fuel and bombs were located after the hasty rearmament). The Hornet's dive bombers will still probably miss the target, but let's assume the Lexington's strike finds the target. The dive bombers attack, there are more carriers but more Americans aircraft here. Say three carriers (Akagi, Kaga, and Soryu) go down. Nagumo will probably survive but won't be able to assume effective control with his flagship dying. So, his subordinate, Admiral Yamaguchi readies his three remaining carriers for a strike. By 1100, I imagine that the Japanese scouts would find the American force and Yamaguchi would launch his strike after recovering the survivors of the second attack on Midway. The Japanese would have more aircraft than in the attack against Yorktown in our battle of Midway, but the Americans would have more fighter protection and the Japanese aircraft would have sustained damage from the Midway strike. Still, the Americans take hits. Lexington, with her large size, would have attracted the bulk of the strike and she would be heavily damaged or sunk. Let's also have the Yorktown take a few bomb hits, but they're repairable. Once hasty repairs are concluded on Yorktown, Admiral Fletcher launches everything he has left at the Japanese fleet has Yamaguichi prepares his next stike. The two attacks cross in midair. The Americans manage to destroy Hiryu and damage Shokaku. In the meantime, the Japanese finish off Yorktown and put a torpedo in Hornet, which survives. With only the Zuikake able to launch and recover aircraft, the Japanese withdraw, not knowing that Admiral Fletcher was about to issue the same order. Thus, each side retreats with mixed feelings, having taken heavy losses but done horrific damage to the other side. Saratoga arrives off Midway a few days later, ensuring that the island will hold. Hornet is laid up for a few weeks, under repair.\n \n That's how I envision a Midway without Coral Sea. I see no reason for the Japanese to concentrate their force, something which goes completely against their operation doctrine. Certain aspects are questionable, the Americans escaping detection, the rearmament of the first strike still adding some fires (though not as severe in our version of the battle), etc.\n \n \nThus when you talk of two carriers being crippled;\n Shokaku was not so badly done by because it took part in two further battles in 1942\n http://www.japan-101.com/history/japanese_aircraft_carrier_shokak.htm\n Zuikaku took part in actions against Ceylon in 1942\n http://www.angelfire.com/ia/totalwar/ijnZuikaku.html\n It again is a refusal to acknowledge that they had to be used elsewhere in the world.\n\n \n Why did I deny that the two Shokaku-class carriers were unable to participate in further battles in 1942? They weren't able to participate in Midway because of damage received at Coral Sea, which I've said repeatedly. The Ceylon operation, by the way, occurred in April, before the battles at Coral Sea and Midway.\n \n \nTotal list of Japanese carriers, all classes.\n Name / Launch Date / Fate \n Wakamiya 12th January 1905 Carried seaplanes until 1920 when she carried Sopwith Pups.

I'd like you to put forward an hypothesis where-by the US was able to circumvent Enigma, without an actual machine to help; which was the only way the Brits were able to do it.\n\n \n The British broke Naval Enigma by capturing a German sub. The US managed to capture a German U-Boat as well, specifically training for the task. It wasn't vital, so it wasn't done until (I think). Assuming the US needs German codes, they'll capture one earlier. \n \n The US, when faced with German codes, took a different approach than the British or Poles (who made the first breakthroughs in cracking Enigma). Their Allies took a mathematical approach. The Americans, used brute force, building massive decoding machines. With the advent of the five rotar Enigmas, the effectiveness of the Polish copy of the machine rapidly declined. Here, the American system proved effective.",

   "I ran out of time before, so I want to finish my Midway hypothetical.\n \n I'm going to assume the opposite here that Japan scores a decisive victory. Scouts discover the four American carriers on the morning of the fourth of June, before the second strike against Midway is launched. Nagumo rearms his aircraft and and stages an attack against the Americans. He'll probably be able to send about 100 aircraft. At Coral Sea, 60 Japanese aircraft sunk Lexington and heavily damaged Yorktown. The Americans will have more fighter cover, but their bombers will be on the deck preparing to launch their own strike against the Japanese. So, Lexington goes down along with Hornet. The American strike manages to sink Kaga, but the second Japanese wave sinks Enterprise and Fletcher in the Yorktown retreats, leaving Midway to the Japanese.\n \n What happens now? Japan is only fighting the US and China, so it can't go south against the British and Dutch Empires. The Aleutians are to the north, but there's not much there. An invasion of Hawaii would be extremely difficult and the US has three carriers and a large air group stationed there. Nimitz can also bring his battleships to bear here; in the fleet actions, he didn't have enough tankers to refuel them, but it won't be a concern in a Hawaiian invasion. Hawaii also has a large garrison. At the same time, without US oil imports and without oil from the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese are looking at a major crisis. They need the US to come to terms NOW. So, the Japanese fleet sorties to try to cut off the convoys going to Hawaii. The island chain is heavily dependant on imports and if the convoys can be defeated, the garrison will starve, possibly forcing the Americans to come to the peace table.\n \n A series of sea battles around Hawaii are fought. Japanese battleships raid convoys and the Americans proceed to add battleships (South Daktoa- and North Carolina-class) to the escorts. Individual Japanese carrier divisions launch air attacks (with Akagi matched with Ryujo) and Admiral Halsey combines his carriers into a large three-carrier division. The two Shokakou-class carriers are lost in a battle with Halsey, but manage to take Saratoga with them, while Wasp is lost to a submarine. For several weeks, Yorktown is the sole American carrier guarding the approaches to Hawaii and the Japanese try to finish her off, but fail. In November, the Yorktown is reinforced by Ranger and the new light carrier Independence. The obsolete American battleline even sorties for a time, but after Maryland and Pennsylvania are lost to an air raid, they return to Hawaii. Ranger is left in Pearl Harbor, as Halsey realizes its too slow to be used in major fleet actions. By the end of the year, Hawaii is at the brink of starvation.\n \n Then, the tide begins to turn. Halsey is reinforced by two new carriers, Essex and Princeton. The fleet carrier Lexington II and two light carriers, Bellau Wood and Cowpens can be expected by June. The Japanese, in contrast, are running out of fuel and have to cut down on their forces raiding around Hawaii. \n \n Halsey, instead of waiting for overwhelming reinforcements, attacks immediately. Aerial recon from Hawaii spots a pair of Japanese battleships with a light carrier escort. Yorktown and Independence sortie and send the carrier and a battleship to the bottom of the ocean. Admiral Yamaguichi's nearby Hiryu and Soryu engage the two American carriers, but find themselves ambushed by the Essex and Princeton, which they had not known were in Hawaii. At the cost of Independence, two more fleet carriers are sunk. \n \n This is the end of the Battle of Hawaii. The Japanese don't have the fuel to continue operations though they still outnumber the Americans in ships. Slowly, the United States pushes through the Marianas and Marshall Islands, moving steadily east. A few carrier engagements are fought where it becomes clear that the Japanese cannot match American numerical superiority. The Imperial Navy watches helplessly as island after island falls, culminating with the reconquest of the Phillipines and the capture of Formosa and Okinawa by the end of 1945. Soon after, mushroom clouds appear over Japanese cities and the war ends, with the surrender documents signed on the flight deck of the Yorktown, which survived every major fleet action of the war.\n \n A Japanese victory at Midway in the event of a war solely between the US and Japan would mean little. The Japanese wouldn't have the capacity to invade Hawaii and a blockade like I envisioned would greatly reduce its fuel stores. The battle would become desparate by the end of 1942 but, in my opinion, new construction would manage to keep just enough supplies flowing. Even if Hawaii falls, it merely delays the inevitable, giving the Japanese a little more time before the US destroys them.",

   "I seriously doubt the ability of the B-36 to carry raids out as you describe; here is why:\n \n No bomber employed in a strategic role has ever had immunity from interception. I don't see the B-36 being any different to this rule. If we care to speculate an in-service date for the type in the above scenario, it would not be before mid 1944 at the earliest. Given another half year to work out the technical difficulties of such a complex airplane and assemble a large enough force to be effective and significant combat operations are unlikely before early 1945.\n \n At this time Germany would have been in possession of fighters quite capable of effecting an interception at the operational altitudes the B-36 operated at (which was no more than 42500 feet/13000 metres on the B model). An actual example of such a fighter that was produced is the Ta-152H-1. In this scenario we can assume that Germany would have devoted greater resources to high altitude fighter design and manufacture, so there would have been other types available as well.\n \n With the abscence of fighter escorts on such missions, the B-36's would have been extremely vunerable as they spent hours over hostile airspace. Damage that might have allowed the plane to return to base in a shorter range mission would have proved fatal over the long return leg over the Atlantic. I can only imagine losses would have been at a similiar unsustainable rate to those the 8th AAF suffered in mid-late 1943.\n \n Finally with regards to the atom bomb, I don't see how a raid you envisioned could be reliably executed. Without air superiority, the aircraft would have been very vunerable and a loss would have been disasterous, particularly if the atomic weapon fell into enemy hands. Also, with Britain out of the war, the Manhattan project's progress would have been curtailed- probably by at least a year, so bombs would not have been available in number (in the tens) until early 1947. At this point we can only guess what the strategic situation in Europe may have been.\n\n \n The way I see the scenario, Germany won't concentrate much production on high-altitude fighters. The Luftwaffe was largely a tactical air force, with heavy bombers coming at a distant second. Take, for example, the FW-190. The FW-190A was an excellent mid-to-low level inteceptor, one of the best of the war. It was poorly suited to higher altitudes. It was only when the need arose, when American bombers began their attacks, that the high altitude FW-190D9 was developed. Without the threat of American bombers, the 190D's and the Ta-152's won't be developed in large numbers.\n \n The way I envision the aerial raid, it's not a large number of attacks against single cities, its a few attacks at each city at the same time. Hit the Third Reich with a bunch of nukes at once and completely cripple their ability to wage war. The Americans should know that they'll only get one shot at it. The Germans were greatly in error regarding their atomic program, thinking it would be too heavy for aircraft. Heisenberg either sabotaged the project or failed completely on it. So the idea of a nuclear attack will be far from their minds.\n \n If the Germans are building a number of high altitude fighters, then the US will probably divert their attention. From bases in the Middle East and Africa, first B-17's then the early model B-36's will stage raids on the Ploesti oil fields and similar targets. This should send German interceptors to the Balkans. France and Germany will be completely ignored, attempting to lull the Germans into a false sense of security. When the attack is made in '47 or '48, the B-36's should be able to avoid major German fighter concentrations. There is the possibility of long-range escort from fighters launched from carriers sent to the French coast on the eve of the attack, but it would probably mean sacrificing a large part of the American fast carrier task force.\n \n This scenario, naturally, rests on a number of assumptions. Would the US be able to adopt such a policy? It would require a great deal of forethought, trying to hide the capabilities of the B-36. It would also likely rest on the successful completion of the B-36C, since the 'B' version might not have the capabilities for the operation. It would require the US to assemble a vast store of atomic bombs, rather than detonate a few trying to get Germany to surrender. Once Germany knew the capability of the B-36 and the atomic bomb, any future raid would be very dangerous, if not suicidal. I believe such a policy would be possible, considering the fact that the Americans were able and willing to leave Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and a few other Japanese cities untouched as a possible atomic bomb target.\n \n If the atomic raid proves impossible, then the only available option is an invasion of Europe. Here, the Americans would likely be equipped with Pershings rather than Shermans, while the Germans would probably have a larger force of MkIV's and fewer Tigers and Panthers. The Shermans, however, were a match for the MkIV's, so even if the Pershings are not available, the US Army will do better in armored warfare. The US would mobilize far more than the 90 divisions of our WWII, instead going with a 200+ division army of the Victory Program. \n \n The first leg of the invasion would be the seizure of North Africa from Vichy France. With the Wehrmacht not occupied in Russia, we'll see a large battle in the Algerian desert. The US will need to gain control of the Med, so Spain will be attacked (assuming they side with German). The US will just take Gibralter and the surrounding area, just enough to get convoys into the Med. From there, after the US gets control of North Africa, there will be a long build up period before the attack against Europe itself. The invasion will probably occur in southern France and will cut off Spain from Germany. Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica will be seized. Italy will stay holed up in the pennisula. \n \n Without going into detail, I'd say that from here, the US would be able to liberate Europe. Germany would be forced to garrison the continent against the Soviet Union and other potential American threats. There won't be unconditional surrender here, however, so maybe a coup takes out Hitler as the Americans approach the Rhine and Germany stays together, though it gives up Austria, Czechoslovakia, and its other conquests. Fascist dictators in Spain, Italy, and Eastern Europe remain in power. The US doesn't have the energy or the inclination to end it. There will be no wide relevation of the Holocaust until decades later, as military dictatorship of Germany ends. The army will end the Holocaust, but they won't allow evidence to escape. \n \n America will have sustained massive loses. Culturally, it will be more like Europe in the modern day in OTL though a certain reverence for the military will remain. Americans will believe that had they maintained a strong military, Germany's rise would have been prevented. Europe will remain divided and hostile. The Soviet Union may gobble up bits of Eastern Europe but not as much as in OTL. A very hypothetical scenario, but the likely result of just a US-Germany war.",

   "If by light carriers you mean the escort carriers of the Admiral Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet (the 'Taffy' forces), then, no, they did not effectively fight against the Japanese battleline.

The machines only needed to dedicate 60% of their time breaking the Naval Engima; they were free to spend the rest of their time assisting the British in breaking Army and Air Force Enigma.\n \n Prior to their entry into the war, the US spent little time with Enigma. It was difficult to intercept signals a continent away and Japan was given priority. For Britain, the situation was the opposite. Thus, the US broke MAGIC and JN-25, while the British failed. The US and the UK realized the situation and the US provided the UK with Japanese codes, while the UK gave the US ULTRA.\n \n \nQuestion: Which U-Boat did the Americans capture for the purposes of gaining the Enigma device? Are you referring to U-505?\n\n \n The US never tried to capture a U-Boat to gain an Enigma. They did capture U-505, largely for prestige reasons. The fact that they managed to capture a U-Boat, however, shows that the Americans could seize them if necessary and could conceivably capture an Enigma like the British did with U-100.\n \n \nAn invasion of Hawaii was not necessary. Assuming that the Japanese had won, they'd have been able to return to Hawaii and finish strikes against the oil depots (which they'd not attacked), and other targets of opportunity. \n\n \n There would be a period of time before the Japanese would be able to launch another strike at Hawaii; attacking immediately after Midway would have been impossible. By the time any strike would be possible, Saratoga and Wasp would have arrived. By Midway, the US already had four B-17 Bombardment Groups in Hawaii. Along with PBY's, they could patrol the waters around Hawaii and would likely find the Japanese strike force. There would be no surprise like Pearl Harbor. \n \n The Japanese would be able to muster five fleet carriers (if we continue with the scenario where one is lost at Midway). They would face the Army Air Corps fighters as well as three American carrier air groups. A successful attack on the oil depots would have been difficult at best. \n \n Nonetheless, let's assume the attack succeeds. The Pacific Fleet then retreats to California. Supply operations for Hawaii suddenly become much more difficult. The US are, in the end, left with only rifles and artillery to defend the island, aircraft and armor having become much more difficult to maintain. Let's say that the Japanese are able to muster the shipping to invade Hawaii and the Army agrees to release the troops. Let's say the island falls. Then, a year later, the US Navy is rebuilt and Hawaii is retaken as Japan runs out of fuel, lacking US imports or supplies of their own. Japan lasts longer, but is defeated in the end. Nothing changes.\n \n \nThe threat alone to the US West coast would have brought out many appeasers.\n\n \n Once again, you're mistaken in your understanding of American isolationism. The isolationists were appeasers in the sense that they believe that the could ignore German fascism and Japanese militarism. Yes, some admired German fascism but no one except some Japanese-Americans admired Japanese militarism. There would be no negociation with the Japanese. \n \n \nAnd we know how well capital ships go against air attack. The US could have produced as many South Dakota-like ships it wanted. Not only would they have been sunk from the air attacks, they'd have been hamstrung had the Japanese attacked the oil refineries, that they'd have been free to do after a US loss at Midway\n\n \n The battleships are their to defend the convoys against Japanese battleship/battlecruiser raiders as British battleships defended convoys after Scharnhorst and Gniesenieu devastated a British convoy.\n \n US escort carriers are there to defend the convoys. They would be able to stay with the convoys and could carry about two dozen fighters each.\n \n \nHold on a moment, what are these carriers?\n\n \n Yorktown, Saratoga, and Wasp. Independence, Essex, Princeton, Cowpens, and Bon Homme Richard (in OTL it was Yorktown II, what I called Lexington II) would arrive within a year.\n \n \nYou again make massive assumptions here as to what constitutes a target. The Japanese need not have invaded (see above). You also assume to understand US resolve to prosecute a war in the light of a real threat to an exposed US West Coast. We know for a fact that just the Pearl Harbor attack alone caused massive panic. A further attack on Pearl Harbor/the destruction of the US Carrier fleet would have caused even bigger panic.\n\n \n What would that panic accomplish? Nothing. If there was a war in Europe, then it would hamper Allied operations, but in a Japan-US war, then the delay wouldn't help the Japanese much. Japan could not win a war with the US unless the American public got disenheartened, something that wouldn't happen here. Yes, in the first half of 1942, before Midway and with the eastern seaboard alight with the flames of sinking tankers, many Americans did think that they could lose the war, but it did not inspire them to seek peace.",

Likewise they captured a spy-trawler which gave them the code-wheel settings for another limited time period.\n The ultimate breaking of Enigma was from having the machine, seeing how it worked, and having the intuitive people such as Turing, at Bletchley Park, where they cobbled together one of the first computers to run through the various possible combinations of the Enigma machine; again having the machine was vital.\n And of course the US needed the codes. \n \nThe British also captured Enigma machines, specifically from U-100 in May 1941.\n\n A few points here...\n a) your statement about the capture (in a pervious post) was erroneous. They needed the machine to do so.\n b) the Brits had the machine in 1939, vital to this was that the Germans didn't know about them having it\n c) the U-100 was able to furnish 'enigma material' and this was done before the US entered the war.\n d) the U-100 was detected by Type 286 radar, RADAR itself was a British invention, (so recall the hypothesis about Britain not being in the war); you're left with the USA getting a machine (by itself), detecting a U-boat (without RADAR, which they'd have to develop, by themselves), decoding the codes (again, having to get a book with the code-wheel settings is important, though not essential), and then inventing an electronic computrer (by themselves) in order to sift through the various combinations Enigma provies; noting that the German Naval Enigma had even more combination possibilities than the Enigmas of the German Army or Air Force. And recall point c) that this is still before the US entered the war. So, if you're taking out of the equation all the allies; as it's your contention that the USA could have won alone, then just to get Enigma, you're going to have to\n a) invent radar and/or ASDIC\n b) detect a U-boat\n c) force it to the surfuce\n d) retrieve a working machine\n e) get it back to a group of people who have the potential to crack it (you've got no Turing, who's a Brit)\n f) actually solve the codes\n g) employ the information without the Germans being aware of it\n and that's just after being made aware of ENIGMA in the first place, you'd have to find that out too!\n \nYou miss the point again. The US were able to know how the machine worked. And it was the Brits who came up with the computer first.\n See Worlds first electronic computer\n http://www.picotech.com/applications/colossus.html\n You can't divorce the facts that\n a) the Brits showed you how it worked\n b) showed you how to decode it...using computers. \n\n \nThe US broke Naval Enigma codes without the use of computers, specifically with their four-rotor bombe's. The machines only needed to dedicate 60% of their time breaking the Naval Engima; they were free to spend the rest of their time assisting the British in breaking Army and Air Force Enigma.\n\n You're again mixing up your hypothetical with known facts from what actually happened\n I suggest you read\n http://www.nsa.gov/publications/publi00016.cfm\n Which is an American source. You will note that several co-operative efforts were made. This is a known fact. The Enigma materials gained from a sinking U-boat, by the Brits was a vital part. Your hypothetical of the US going it alone needs to be thought about... you'd have to remove a lot of factors that were significant.\n \nPrior to their entry into the war, the US spent little time with Enigma.\n\n Yes, indeed. Because they didn't know about it until the Brits let them in. And the Brits didn't do this until you two were allies.\n \nIt was difficult to intercept signals a continent away and Japan was given priority. For Britain, the situation was the opposite. Thus, the US broke MAGIC and JN-25, while the British failed. The US and the UK realized the situation and the US provided the UK with Japanese codes, while the UK gave the US ULTRA.\n\n I don't deny that the US helped the Brits. That's not my contention. It's yours that the USA could have successfully prosecuted the war by themselves.\n \n Question: Which U-Boat did the Americans capture for the purposes of gaining the Enigma device? Are you referring to U-505? \n\n \nThe US never tried to capture a U-Boat to gain an Enigma. They did capture U-505, largely for prestige reasons. The fact that they managed to capture a U-Boat, however, shows that the Americans could seize them if necessary and could conceivably capture an Enigma like the British did with U-100.\n\n This then undermines your hypthetical. The US just accidentally got U-505 (late in the war). As stated earlier, you'd have to know that the Germans were using this machine first.\n \nAn invasion of Hawaii was not necessary. Assuming that the Japanese had won, they'd have been able to return to Hawaii and finish strikes against the oil depots (which they'd not attacked), and other targets of opportunity. \n\n \nThere would be a period of time before the Japanese would be able to launch another strike at Hawaii; attacking immediately after Midway would have been impossible. By the time any strike would be possible, Saratoga and Wasp would have arrived.\n\n Again you're missing the point. You hypothetical involves the US alone. And you've already lost Midway. The Japanese have lost how many carriers - and you've got two in the Pacific?\n \nBy Midway, the US already had four B-17 Bombardment Groups in Hawaii. Along with PBY's, they could patrol the waters around Hawaii and would likely find the Japanese strike force. There would be no surprise like Pearl Harbor. \n\n Suprise need not be necessary, with a concentration of their carriers on Peal Harbor, they'd have over-whelmed you.\n \nThe Japanese would be able to muster five fleet carriers (if we continue with the scenario where one is lost at Midway). They would face the Army Air Corps fighters as well as three American carrier air groups.\n\n Consisting of what type of plane? The same that was brushed aside at Midway - the Midway based planes were decimated. And what's the 'third' naval air group, as you've only got Wasp and Saratoga, and that's assuming that they're in the right place, and not protecting the US west coast.\n \nA successful attack on the oil depots would have been difficult at best.\n\n Only assuming that your carriers are there, that you achieve some kind of local air victory with out-classed planes.\n \nNonetheless, let's assume the attack succeeds. The Pacific Fleet then retreats to California. Supply operations for Hawaii suddenly become much more difficult. The US are, in the end, left with only rifles and artillery to defend the island, aircraft and armor having become much more difficult to maintain. Let's say that the Japanese are able to muster the shipping to invade Hawaii and the Army agrees to release the troops. Let's say the island falls. Then, a year later, the US Navy is rebuilt and Hawaii is retaken as Japan runs out of fuel, lacking US imports or supplies of their own. Japan lasts longer, but is defeated in the end. Nothing changes.\n\n That's assuming that you're still willing to prosecute the war, because in the mean-time, as you are building your superiority, the west coast is laid bare and the threat, even if it doesn't eventuate, leads to a rise in appeasement - and don't forget, in the Atlantic, you're facing Germany alone too (because your hypothetical has removed all your western allies, too)\n \n The threat alone to the US West coast would have brought out many appeasers.\n\n \nOnce again, you're mistaken in your understanding of American isolationism. The isolationists were appeasers in the sense that they believe that the could ignore German fascism and Japanese militarism. Yes, some admired German fascism but no one except some Japanese-Americans admired Japanese militarism. There would be no negociation with the Japanese. \n\n But you're not just facing Japan.\n \nAnd we know how well capital ships go against air attack. The US could have produced as many South Dakota-like ships it wanted. Not only would they have been sunk from the air attacks, they'd have been hamstrung had the Japanese attacked the oil refineries, that they'd have been free to do after a US loss at Midway \n\n \nThe battleships are their to defend the convoys against Japanese battleship/battlecruiser raiders as British battleships defended convoys after Scharnhorst and Gniesenieu devastated a British convoy.\n\n Superfluous, the Brits lost because of no air-cover. You'd have to sail your battleships a lot further to get to vital Japanese convoys.\n \nUS escort carriers are there to defend the convoys. They would be able to stay with the convoys and could carry about two dozen fighters each.\n\n Ah, so we do recognise the import of escort-carriers. Tell me though, where did these come from?\n \nHold on a moment, what are these carriers? \n\n \nYorktown, Saratoga, and Wasp. Independence, Essex, Princeton, Cowpens, and Bon Homme Richard (in OTL it was Yorktown II, what I called Lexington II) would arrive within a year.\n\n But you've already lost several at Midway. You'd have to have some in the Atlantic to face Germany there. Recall how successful German U-boats were in your own coastal waters at the beginning of the war.\n \nYou again make massive assumptions here as to what constitutes a target. The Japanese need not have invaded (see above). You also assume to understand US resolve to prosecute a war in the light of a real threat to an exposed US West Coast. We know for a fact that just the Pearl Harbor attack alone caused massive panic. A further attack on Pearl Harbor/the destruction of the US Carrier fleet would have caused even bigger panic.\n\n \nWhat would that panic accomplish? Nothing. If there was a war in Europe, then it would hamper Allied operations, but in a Japan-US war, then the delay wouldn't help the Japanese much. Japan could not win a war with the US unless the American public got disenheartened, something that wouldn't happen here. Yes, in the first half of 1942, before Midway and with the eastern seaboard alight with the flames of sinking tankers, many Americans did think that they could lose the war, but it did not inspire them to seek peace.\n\n We're not just dealing with a US-Japan war. It was your contention that the USA could win THE WAR alone, and that involves Germany and other axis powers too.",

I don't deny that the US contributed highly to WWII. I've never made that my argument. I am saying that the US couldn't go it alone, and in order to demonstrate this, we must remove all allied influence from the US war program.\n We know that the Brits had a part to play in making the P-51 great. This is a known.\n The US may well have come up with it, by themselves. This is an unknown. Considering that the US had the opportunity to gage planes in action from the experience of the Brits, the US had an advantage in plane designing prior to their entry into the war. This is a known. Had Britain signed a peace with Germany at the fall of France, the US would not have had the input from the Brits in air-design, either directly, as in the application of the Rolls-Royce engine, or indirectly through the US observing air-battles over Britain.\n As with the Enigma codes the US may have been able to break them, but this would have been harder without Britain who\n a) had an actual machine\n b) applied to solving it much longer\n c) had gained access to books with code-wheel settings (itself a by-product of the Royal Navy using radar to find the surfaced subs)\n d) the invention of the world's first electronic computer.\n The Corsair (F-4) is one of my favourite planes, from when I used to watch the TV series \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073961/)\n However,\n \"It was the British who finally worked out a method of landing the Corsair on their carriers in spite of the visibility problems caused by the long nose.\"\n http://www.aviation-history.com/vought/f4u.html\n The F6F Hellcat didn't enter service until 1943, given Acesand8s hypothetical that you're facing the war alone, it is difficult to see this happening; removed from real history.\n \n \nAnother instance is the jet plane.

   "The P-47 wasn't, from recollection as manoeuvrable\n\n \n At high altitude (say 25,000ft plus) its large wing area gave it better manoeuvrability than just about any other single seat fighter of WW2.

   "Yes, and the point is they were able to do so, by themselves. You forget that your proposal was that they (escort-carriers) would add little or nothing to a main carrier force.\n\n \n Escort carriers wouldn't add anything to a fast carrier task force. They were too slow (only 18 knots). They could only carry two dozen planes (at most). They were lighly armed and lightly armored. \n \n They were well-suited to an ASW and invasion-support role. An escort carrier with a fighter squadron was an invaluable source of protection against enemy air raids. \n \n \nA few points here...\n a) your statement about the capture (in a pervious post) was erroneous. They needed the machine to do so.\n b) the Brits had the machine in 1939, vital to this was that the Germans didn't know about them having it\n c) the U-100 was able to furnish 'enigma material' and this was done before the US entered the war.\n d) the U-100 was detected by Type 286 radar, RADAR itself was a British invention, (so recall the hypothesis about Britain not being in the war); you're left with the USA getting a machine (by itself), detecting a U-boat (without RADAR, which they'd have to develop, by themselves), decoding the codes (again, having to get a book with the code-wheel settings is important, though not essential), and then inventing an electronic computrer (by themselves) in order to sift through the various combinations Enigma provies; noting that the German Naval Enigma had even more combination possibilities than the Enigmas of the German Army or Air Force. And recall point c) that this is still before the US entered the war. So, if you're taking out of the equation all the allies; as it's your contention that the USA could have won alone, then just to get Enigma, you're going to have to\n a) invent radar and/or ASDIC\n b) detect a U-boat\n c) force it to the surfuce\n d) retrieve a working machine\n e) get it back to a group of people who have the potential to crack it (you've got no Turing, who's a Brit)\n f) actually solve the codes\n g) employ the information without the Germans being aware of it\n and that's just after being made aware of ENIGMA in the first place, you'd have to find that out too!\n\n \n The US developed radar and ASDIC (we called it sonar) independently. Joint US-UK tech teams increased the effectiveness of radar, but the US developed it without the help of the UK. The US had active sonar systems by 1918.\n \n Additionally, unlike the UK, the US would have time on its side. It could choose when and where to engage the Germans since the Germans could do little to harm the US. There would be no trans-Atlantic convoys. Without those convoys, Germany wouldn't have built a large sub force, perhaps it wouldn't have the Type IX, which had the capability to reach the US. \n \n Finally, U-110 did in fact furnish an Enigma.\n \n \nIt was only rarely, very, very rarely, the Bletchley acquired actual lists of the keys being used by the Germans - as happened when U-110 was captured off Greenland on 8 May 1941 with the intact treasure-trove of her Enigma machine and the relevant documents.\n\n \n \nMeanwhile, the telegraphist in the party [aboard U-110], Allen O. Long, went to the radio room...and there Long saw as well a device that looked like a typewriter...Long pressed the keys. But the result seemed \"peculiar\" - pressing an 'a' did not light up an A on the illuminated panel...It was bolted to the table. Long unscrewed the bolts by hand and passed the machine out of the submarine.\n\n \n Now, I'll admit that my knowledge of Enigma is fragmented and their are parts of the machine that I don't understand. But, from what I've read, it sounds like the British captured an Enigma machine from the wreck of U-110.\n \n \nYou're again mixing up your hypothetical with known facts from what actually happened\n I suggest you read\n http://www.nsa.gov/publications/publi00016.cfm\n Which is an American source. You will note that several co-operative efforts were made. This is a known fact. The Enigma materials gained from a sinking U-boat, by the Brits was a vital part. Your hypothetical of the US going it alone needs to be thought about... you'd have to remove a lot of factors that were significant.\n\n \n Yes, I've read the site before. The fact that the US and UK cooperated on a number of projects does not mean they were unable to develop them individually. \n \n \nYes, indeed. Because they didn't know about it until the Brits let them in. And the Brits didn't do this until you two were allies.\n\n \n First, yes, the US knew about Enigma they just didn't put any effort into cracking it for the reasons I mentioned earlier. And, no, the exchange was done before December 1941. \n \n \nI don't deny that the US helped the Brits. That's not my contention. It's yours that the USA could have successfully prosecuted the war by themselves.\n\n \n Which you have done nothing to disprove. Your whole argument that the US would be unable to win the war is that it couldn't break Enigma, ignoring the fact that most experts agree that ULTRA shortened the war; it did not win it.\n \n \nThis then undermines your hypthetical. The US just accidentally got U-505 (late in the war). As stated earlier, you'd have to know that the Germans were using this machine first.\n\n \n There was nothing accidental about the capture of U-505. HK Group 22.3 set out to purposely trying to capture a German sub and specifically trained for the mission, much the same way the British specifically sought out German weather ships. The technology used to capture this sub was available since the beginning of the war, so nothing precludes it capture at an earlier date.\n \n \nConsisting of what type of plane? The same that was brushed aside at Midway - the Midway based planes were decimated. And what's the 'third' naval air group, as you've only got Wasp and Saratoga, and that's assuming that they're in the right place, and not protecting the US west coast.\n\n \n The aircraft at Midway were primarily Brewster Buffaloes. Hawaii would have had far more Wildcats as well as P-40's and other army aircraft, which were far less obsolete than the Buffaloes. By the end of the year, the modern P-38's would be available for action. The first Corsair squadrons would be available in February 1943. \n \n At Midway, the Americans defending the island were outnumbered 4:1. Assuming the six fleet carriers participated in the attack, they could throw 360 aircraft at Hawaii. This, of course, assumes that none are left behind, which is unlikely. B-17's and PBY's would likely spot the Japanese before they launched their attack (or at the very least, Nagumo would know a sighting was imminent) forcing the Japanese to leave some fighters behind as a CAP. At Midway, Nagumo only had 24 fighters for a CAP, but he didn't think an American carrier force was in the area. Thus, the Japanese air patrol here would be, in my opinion, at least 40 aircraft. So, 80 fighters remain to escort the 240 bombers. During the Midway attack, there were 36 fighters with 72 bombers. In a Hawaii attack, however, the US would be able to muster over 200 fighters (100 fighter active June 1st, 100+ more inbound by that date, almost 90 naval fighters also present) in comparison to only 25 at Midway. The Japanese fighters would be outnumbered and would take heavy losses. \n \n \nSuperfluous, the Brits lost because of no air-cover. You'd have to sail your battleships a lot further to get to vital Japanese convoys.\n\n \n What? I was talking about the twins destruction of a British convoy in March 1941. Assuming a convoy is roughly handled by a Kongo or a Nagoto, the US adds battleships to its escort force, much as the British increased battleship protection of their convoys after the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau's actions. And where am I talking about hitting Japanese convoys? The Japanese are hitting American convoys heading for Hawaii.\n \n \nAh, so we do recognise the import of escort-carriers. Tell me though, where did these come from?\n\n \n Where have I refused to recognize the importance of escort carriers? I said that their worthless in fleet actions. If you want to build an escort carrier with sufficient armor and speed, you might as well build a light carrier. In their designated role as convoy escorts, they worked well, as in the role of invasion support. \n \n The escort carriers come from American yards; a half dozen were ready by June 1942.\n \n \nThat's assuming that you're still willing to prosecute the war, because in the mean-time, as you are building your superiority, the west coast is laid bare and the threat, even if it doesn't eventuate, leads to a rise in appeasement - and don't forget, in the Atlantic, you're facing Germany alone too (because your hypothetical has removed all your western allies, too)\n \n But you're not just facing Japan.\n \n But you've already lost several at Midway. You'd have to have some in the Atlantic to face Germany there. Recall how successful German U-boats were in your own coastal waters at the beginning of the war.\n \n We're not just dealing with a US-Japan war. It was your contention that the USA could win THE WAR alone, and that involves Germany and other axis powers too.\n\n \n Alright, I think some of our disagreement arises from this point. As a said originally, I thought the US or USSR could have beaten Germany on their own. You brought up Japan and I argued that the US could have beat them without Allied help as well. I didn't know you we're bring the two together.\n \n But, I'll think it through anyway. The US would undoubtably go with the Victory Program, planning for 215 divisions, 61 of them armored. The war against Japan would be strictly defensive and, here at least, King would not be able to convince Roosevelt to commence offensive actions in the Pacific. This, actually, would probably be for the best for the US, as Japan would run out of oil within a few years at most (and that's assuming Germany shares their synthetic oil technology, which they didn't do until 1945 in OTL). With war against Germany, transferring Wasp to the Pacific would be impossible without the Royal Navy, so the ability to sustain Hawaii with convoys would be far more difficult. The US would also need to keep a couple North Carolina's or South Dakota's in the Atlantic to defend against forays by Tirpitz and/or the twins. Thus, Hawaii would almost certainly be isolated, possibly taken (if we assume that there's no war against China). The Japanese army will have 55 divisions available, not the ten in OTL (I'll let them have the divisions raised specifically for war against China). Shipping would be difficult, but not as necessary since the Japanese won't have to sustain bases throughout the Pacific. Carrier raids against the West Coast might occur, but I think Yamamoto would curtail such activities, as they would waste precious fuel for little to no gain.\n \n In late 1943/early 1944, the US would probably hit French North Africa. (I'll give German all their territory as of June 21st, 1941, with Britain agreeing to a negociated peace and Stalin/Hitler deciding not to attack Hitler/Stalin.) The US would have more time to lay the diplomatic framework of a peaceful transfer of power to the Free French. Without DeGaulle, it would be easier to work with Giraud. Unlike in OTL, however, the US would land only in Morocco, passage through the Straits of Gibralter would be impossible. So, even if the French join the Americans, its farther to Tunisia so battle with the Germans is joined in the middle of Algeria. German armored formations would be quite different here than in OTL. They'd have more medium tanks and there would be no Panther-like heavy tank, since there's no exposure to the T-34. The Sherman, therefore, will be far more competitive. The Americans will do better here than in OTL North African campaign, because with no British support they won't copy the British air control method to the tactical level and their will be more time for the reorganization of the armored corps (initially, American armored divisions were too tank heavy and too infantry light). The Americans will concentrate their forces in North Africa, as will the Germans. With Japanese operations curtailed in the Pacific, most of the B-17's will be transferred to the Altantic and will start hitting low key targets in southern France (probably occupied after the American invasion of North Africa) and Italy. The Americans will slowly push across Algeria and into Tunisia where increasing reinforcements will stop them.\n \n There will be several important differences between this world and OTL WWII. First, there is no total war economy in Germany. The fighting until the landing in North Africa will be decidely low key; even then, the fighting won't reach anything near the levels of the Russian Front. So, Germany will continue its high production rate of consumer goods. Furthermore, there will be no rationalization of German production. The Germans will continue in their inefficient production methods: dozens of different types of trucks, engines, tanks, etc. Though there will be more tanks and mechanized units, there will be more supply difficulties. \n \n In contrast, the US will likely follow a similar rearmament schedule. Operation Drumbeat will likely last longer, slowing down rearmament, but once the threat is removed, production will rapidly increase. As in OTL, US productive capacity will double. I imagine with a large army, this is going to take longer, but the US won't have to produce any Lend Lease. They cancel each other out to a degree, though I'm not sure what that level is. There is one important difference in American policy: there's no unconditional surrender. While Morgenthau will probably still introduce his plan, it will be scoffed at rather quickly. \n \n In the Pacific, Japan will be on the ropes. In mid-1944, the reconstructed American navy will either retake Hawaii (or if it's only been isolated) rebuild the base there. The Japanese fleet will respond and we'll have the first major fleet action since Midway. While the Japanese airmen will have been strained by fuel shortages and flying obsolete aircraft, the Americans will be well-trained and confident in their F6 Hellcats. This battle would likely be a victory for the Americans. \n \n At this point, there may be an opportunity for a negotiated peace with Japan. Japan will have to give up its American possessions, though the Americans might agree to accelerate the independence and 'neutralization' of the Phillipines to save face for the Japanese. The Army wouldn't oppose the peace much, as they are looking towards the Soviet Union and China, seeing nothing for themselves in the fight against the US. The Navy would know it's in desparate straits and Yamamoto would probably still be alive pushing for some sort of peace before the fleet that won at Hawaii turned its sights further west. So, but early autumn 1944, there is peace between the US and Japan. \n \n In November 1944, the election occurs. I'd imagine FDR would win, as the war wouldn't have had too much of an impact on the Americans people (relatively low casualties by this point). The economy would be booming from war production and Japan would have been knocked out of the war, returning all its captured American possessions. Roosevelt would die within a few months, replaced by his VP, say Truman.\n \n With \"victory\" in the Pacific, the US can turn its full attention against Germany. A large part of the fleet and the Pacific Air Force will move to the Atlantic. Spain, still devasted by civil war and three years of drought (1942-1944), will distance itself from Germany, permitting the US to cross through the Straits of Gibralter (the US wouldn't pass earlier, fearing a Spanish Declaration of War at the wrong moment). American submarines, denied a role in the war against Japan, will begin attacking German convoys to North Africa. By summer 1945, Tunisia falls with most of the German African Army surrendering. \n \n Now, Germany wakes up. We get Goebbels 'Do you want total war?' speech, Speer appointed as production manager, complete war footing, etc. After Libya falls, the US fights it out with the Luftwaffe for control of the air in the central Med. The USN complicates the task by launched carrier raids against the German-occupied French coast, forcing the Germans to station aircraft there. The next few months are going to be bloody for the Army Air Corps but the US has numbers on its side, having been producing 50,000 or more aircraft a year since 1942, compared to half that total for its opponents combined.\n \n In early 1945, with air superiority, the US invades Sicily. The new German heavy tanks and SPAT guns hurt American armor, but there's a lot of it. The island falls eventually. When Italy begins to quietly discuss an ante bellum peace with the US, Germany stomps down on it, hard. The US will be contained just north of Rome. Sardinia and Corsica will be taken after the fighting stalls. \n \n In 1946, the big offensive arrives, the one the US has been waiting for for 5 years. After feinting towards Greece and the Balkans, American forces land in southern France. For several months, both sides will sustain OTL Soviet-Front style losses. American Pershings will match German heavy tanks (call them Jaguars), though medium tanks (MKIVs and Shermans) will make up the bulk of either force. Jets will make their first appearance on both sides, though, again, prop planes will remain the dominate force on either side, at least for the next year. Germany will unlease its V weapons, having wasted a large amount of economic resources on a missile to hit the US, only to concentrate on the V-1 and V-2's when the US actually lands. A number are shot at Marseille, causing moderate damage. \n \n Truman, however, is in the middle of dilemma. He has a half-dozen atomic weapons on hand (with another coming every 6 weeks) but he wanted to wait until the new B-36C's are ready to deliver them. With the capacity to overfly most German aircraft, it would be ideal for the task. The B-29's and early model B-36's are vulnerable to interception. With heavy casaulties in southern France and a public rapidly tiring of the war, Truman authorizes the use of three of the weapons.\n \n On the night of September 1st 1946, nine American aircraft launch from bases in southern Italy. Hundreds of other aircraft launch on similar bases, believing they are participating in another night strategic bombing mission. En route to the target, Frankfurt, the nine bombers withdraw, citing engine trouble. Each trio overflies a German city: Munich, Nuremberg, and Stuttgart. German night fighters are busy engaging the Frankfurt raid, so the nine bombers encounter little resistance. At the same time, each center bomber releases an atomic device and three German cities explode in mushroom clouds. The next day, Truman announces to the world what happened, which German physicists soon confirm. Hitler says the German people will resist to the end. He authorizes the execution of every American POW and the use of gas on the front lines. He orders Heisenburg to build a nuclear bomb, even if it is a Jewish science. Heisenburg says it will take several years but Hitler says Germany will hold out that long. The German generals look at one another and Hitler is removed from power. \n \n A brief civil war erupts between the Wehrmacht and the SS, with the army winning in the end. Rundestedt becomes head of Germany, leading a military government. He approaches Truman with a peace offer: ante bellum peace with Germany controlling Germany proper, Austria, the modern-day Czech Republic, and the Polish Corridor. Truman responds in the negative, giving Germany the Polish Corridor and Germany proper only. The other nations of Europe are to be established to their pre-war status. Rundestedt agrees and the war is over.\n \n In a war against Germany and Japan, the US cannot force unconditional surrender. Facing American nuclear weapons, heavy casualties, and the Red Army ready to strike, Germany will agree to peace. Japan will start looking towards China, but will find itself with an America armed with nuclear weapons and a large fleet. The US will negotiate bases from the Philippines (a violation of the Japanese-American treaty) but Japan won't be able to do anything about it. The US will return to isolationism, thoroughly dissatisfied with the conclusion of the war. Germany is dominate in Europe; if the had the willpower, it could have maintained the independence of the small Eastern European countries post-1946, but it didn't want to become involved, so they will become German satrapies, arrayed against possible Soviet expansion. Eventually the fascist/militarist regimes in Europe and Japan will collapse, but no one, especially not the US, will assume the place of global hegemon. \n \n So, it's US victory in a sense. It's no where near the victory of OTL WWII or even WWI. The US knew it couldn't force further German concession (they'd ram every bomber they saw if needed). Fascism remains and Europe is liberated in name only. The Holocaust will end with the fall of Hitler, but it will be hushed up. It will exist as horrifying rumors until German militarism collapses and the records are released. In any event, it would be a much worse world. Great Britain would probably try to hold onto its colonies (India, Malaya) with much more force without the losses of the Second World War. Europe would be a police state, except for some pockets like France (who could maintain independence in the face of Germany) and Scandanavia. If the Soviets do tangle with Germany, the US won't get involved. So, millions will die and either Soviet Communism or German militarism will dominate at a high cost to the people.",

XIV as the best.\n \n Soviet tests would have rated the P-51 as less than stellar as well because it would not meet all their performance testing requirements which placed an emphasis on low-mid altitude performance. They prefered the P-39 and its derivative the P-63.\n \n \nBy 1944, the U.S. P-51 Mustang used the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and six .50 caliber machine guns to become the best fighter in the WWII.\n\n \n Six M2 Browning machine guns was an average fighter armament by late war standards- nothing outstanding there.\n \n \n\"The day I saw Mustangs over Berlin, I knew the jig was up.\"\n - Hermann Goering\n\n \n Yes one of the many famous quotes by Goering. As I said earlier the P-51 was exceptional for its range.\n \n \nBut the P-51 would have been nothing without the British designed Merlin engine It's gun-sight was British on later models...\n \"The P-51D/K introduced the K-14 computing gyro gunsight, based on a British design.

By the time the Ferranti derived K-14 was introduced in March 1944 the P-51 had already been quite effective with a standard reflector sight. By this time the Luftwaffe's fighter arm in the west was already seriously weakened by previous attrition and in terminal decline.\n \n \nIt's hood was also influenced by the Brits\n \"This is me on the wing of my P-51B, Roscoe II recently modified by installing a Malcolm Hood, a British design that replaced the original canopy.

It would in fact be more logical for the US to stay out of the war, as Russia would, until actually attacked.\n\n \n The main strategic objective of Germany in WW2 was the conquest of the Soviet Union. This is a vital point if you are to understand the reasons why WW2 happened. Thus we cannot remove full Soviet participation from this discussion. As I cannot see Japan's decision to start a Pacific war being changed by the defeat of Britain (actually, they would have been encouraged), Germany would have still been drawn into war with the US due to their obligations under the The Tripartite Axis treaty.",
