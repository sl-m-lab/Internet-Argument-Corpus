Followed by several other empires experiencing economic failures. More recently the English Empire when US industrialization and a couple of world wars ended her reign of global economic dominance. The USSR's economic demise wasn't all that long ago, with unaffordable military capability contributing to that economic failure still rotting away in abandoned military facilities. \n \n That China continues to supply somewhat finite natural resources for its future growth requirements without military aggression by using market agreements and infrastructure aid says a great deal about viability of the USD and its decline as the global reserve currency. While the US has its public and squandering of national wealth focused on the immediacy of combating self-inflicted terrorism to drive GDP, China continues to invest in the future.\n \n Our (US) political 'guidance' with absolute fiscal irresponsibility at public and personal levels offers some truly rough patches for US youth and its future.",

   "While few people go beyond the shortages of fossil fuels and environmental desirability in their quest for alternative energy, financial cost is still the determining factor. \n \n Europe is far ahead of the US in wind power, primarily because the pump price of gasoline, heating oil, natural gas and nuclear power is heavily subsidized with tax benefits to producers by the the US government. We're (US) paying high prices; the generally ignorant public only sees and cares about what actually goes on their credit cards. \n \n In the end, money will make energy decisions, based on cost per energy unit.
