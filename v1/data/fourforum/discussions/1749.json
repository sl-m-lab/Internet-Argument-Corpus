   "This was sent to me in an e-mail forward quite awhile ago-- I do not know the original author. If anyone knows who is the original author of this hilarious but true account, please post it here so that they may be properly credited for their work.\n \n Ok, folks. Here is how Christianity appears to those of us who have a problem with it. I encourage you to read the whole thing, no matter your beliefs. You might learn something:\n ===================================================================== This morning There was a knock at my door. When I answered the door I found a well groomed, nicely dressed couple. The man spoke first:\n \n John: \"Hi! I'm John, and this is Mary.\" \n \n Mary: Hi! We're here to invite you to come kiss Hank's a$$ with us.\" \n \n Me: \"Pardon me?! What are you talking about? Who's Hank, and why would I want to kiss His a$$?\"\n \n John: \"If you kiss Hank's a$$, He'll give you a million dollars; and if you don't, He'll kick the @#$% out of you.\"\n \n Me: \"What? Is this some sort of bizarre mob shake-down?\" \n \n John: \"Hank is a billionaire philanthropists. Hank built this town. Hank owns this town. He can do whatever he wants, and what He wants is to give you a million dollars, but He can't until you kiss his a$$.\" \n \n Me: \"That doesn't make any sense. Why...\" \n \n Mary: \"Who are you to question Hank's gift? Don't you want a million dollars? Isn't it worth a little kiss on the a$$?\" \n \n Me: \"Well maybe, if it's legit, but...\" \n \n John: \"Then come kiss Hank's a$$ with us.\" \n \n Me: \"Do you kiss Hank's a$$ often?\" \n \n Mary: \"Oh yes, all the time...\" \n \n Me: \"And has He given you a million dollars?\" \n \n John: \"Well no. You don't actually get the money until you leave town.\" \n \n Me: \"So why don't you just leave town now?\" \n \n Mary: \"You can't leave until Hank tells you to, or you don't get the money, and He kicks the @#$% out of you.\"\n \n Me: \"Do you know anyone who kissed Hank's a$$, left town, and got the million dollars?\"\n \n John: \"My mother kissed Hank's a$$ for years. She left town last year, and I'm sure she got the money.\"\n \n Me: \"Haven't you talked to her since then?\" \n \n John: \"Of course not, Hank doesn't allow it.\" \n \n Me: \"So what makes you think He'll actually give you the money if you've never talked to anyone who got the money?\" \n \n Mary: \"Well, he gives you a little bit before you leave. Maybe you'll get a raise, maybe you'll win a small lotto, maybe you'll just find a twenty-dollar bill on the street.\"\n \n Me: \"What's that got to do with Hank?\" \n \n John: \"Hank has certain 'connections.'\" \n \n Me: \"I'm sorry, but this sounds like some sort of bizarre con game.\" \n \n John: \"But it's a million dollars, can you really take the chance? And remember, if you don't kiss Hank's a$$ He'll kick the @#$% of you.\" \n \n Me: \"Maybe if I could see Hank, talk to Him, get the details straight from him...\"\n \n Mary: \"No one sees Hank, no one talks to Hank.\" \n \n Me: \"Then how do you kiss His a$$?\" \n \n John: \"Sometimes we just blow Him a kiss, and think of His a$$. Other times we kiss Karl's a$$, and he pa$$es it on.\" \n \n Me: \"Who's Karl?\" \n \n Mary: \"A friend of ours. He's the one who taught us all about kissing Hank's a$$. All we had to do was take him out to dinner a few times.\" \n \n Me: \"And you just took his word for it when he said there was a Hank, that Hank wanted you to kiss His a$$, and that Hank would reward you?\" \n \n John: \"Oh no! Karl has a letter he got from Hank years ago explaining the whole thing. Here's a copy; see for yourself.\" \n \n From the desk of Karl \n 1. Kiss Hank's a$$ and He'll give you a million dollars when you leave town.\n 2. Use alcohol in moderation.\n 3. Kick the @#$% out of people who aren't like you.\n 4. Eat right.\n 5. Hank dictated this list Himself.\n 6. The moon is made of green cheese.\n 7. Everything Hank says is right.\n 8. Wash your hands after going to the bathroom.\n 9. Don't use alcohol.\n 10. Eat your wieners on buns, no condiments.\n 11. Kiss Hank's a$$ or He'll kick the @#$% out of you. \n \n Me: \"This appears to be written on Karl's letterhead.\" \n \n Mary: \"Hank didn't have any paper.\" \n \n Me: \"I have a hunch that if we checked we'd find this is Karl's handwriting.\"\n \n John: \"Of course, Hank dictated it.\" \n \n Me: \"I thought you said no one gets to see Hank?\" \n \n Mary: \"Not now, but years ago He would talk to some people.\" \n \n Me: \"I thought you said He was a philanthropist. What sort of philanthropist kicks the @#$% out of people just because they're different?\"\n \n Mary: \"It's what Hank wants, and Hank's always right.\" \n \n Me: \"How do you figure that?\" \n \n Mary: \"Item 7 says 'Everything Hank says is right.' That's good enough for me!\"\n \n Me: \"Maybe your friend Karl just made the whole thing up.\" \n \n John: \"No way! Item 5 says 'Hank dictated this list himself.' Besides, item 2 says 'Use alcohol in moderation,' Item 4 says 'Eat right,' and item 8 says 'Wash your hands after going to the bathroom.' Everyone knows those things are right, so the rest must be true, too.\"\n \n Me: \"But 9 says 'Don't use alcohol.' which doesn't quite go with item 2, and 6 says 'The moon is made of green cheese,' which is just plain wrong.\"\n \n John: \"There's no contradiction between 9 and 2, 9 just clarifies 2. As far as 6 goes, you've never been to the moon, so you can't say for sure.\"\n \n Me: \"Scientists have pretty firmly established that the moon is made of rock...\"\n \n Mary: \"But they don't know if the rock came from the Earth, or from out of space, so it could just as easily be green cheese.\" \n \n Me: \"I'm not really an expert, but I think the theory that the Moon was somehow 'captured' by the Earth has been discounted*. Besides, not knowing where the rock came from doesn't make it cheese.\" \n \n John: \"Ha! You just admitted that scientists make mistakes, but we know Hank is always right!\"\n \n Me: \"We do?\" \n \n Mary: \"Of course we do, Item 5 says so.\" \n \n Me: \"You're saying Hank's always right because the list says so, the list is right because Hank dictated it, and we know that Hank dictated it because the list says so. That's circular logic, no different than saying 'Hank's right because He says He's right.'\" \n \n John: \"Now you're getting it! It's so rewarding to see someone come around to Hank's way of thinking.\"\n \n Me: \"But...oh, never mind. What's the deal with wieners?\" \n \n Mary: She blushes. \n \n John: \"Wieners, in buns, no condiments. It's Hank's way. Anything else is wrong.\"\n \n Me: \"What if I don't have a bun?\" \n \n John: \"No bun, no wiener. A wiener without a bun is wrong.\" \n \n Me: \"No relish? No Mustard?\" \n \n Mary: She looks positively stricken. \n \n John: He's shouting. \"There's no need for such language! Condiments of any kind are wrong!\"\n \n Me: \"So a big pile of sauerkraut with some wieners chopped up in it would be out of the question?\"\n \n Mary: Sticks her fingers in her ears.\"I am not listening to this. La la la, la la, la la la.\"\n \n John: \"That's disgusting. Only some sort of evil deviant would eat that...\"\n \n Me: \"It's good! I eat it all the time.\" \n \n Mary: She faints. \n \n John: He catches Mary. \"Well, if I'd known you were one of those I wouldn't have wasted my time. When Hank kicks the @#$% out of you I'll be there, counting my money and laughing. I'll kiss Hank's a$$ for you, you bunless cut-wienered kraut-eater.\"\n \n With this, John dragged Mary to their waiting car, and drives off.",

   "\"Yeah, its sorta like that.\"\n \n Okay with out getting side tracked since I am not an OEM \"christian\" it is hard to realate. I mean our religion says, \n \n Us: Hey the Devil (ruler of world) gives every one gifts and perpetual fungasmic orgies. Nothing bad will happen to you unless you decide serve God. Then all bets are off. Now you will be perescuted because the Devil wants you (servant of God) to be mesribal. God one day will get tired of seeing the XXXX beat out of us and will kill everyone else (with his bloodthristy minions and weapons of mass destruction). So when do you want to start your bible study?\n \n You: You mean the Devil rules the world, and he give you gifts?\n \n Us: Yeah but only till you die.\n \n You: Then what?\n \n Us: Umm... Nothing.\n \n You: So you are saying that I can serve the devil and have nothing to lose while basking in pre-apocalyptic bliss.\n \n Us: Yeah but.. thats not the point. I mean God has cool weapons and stuff and a newsletter and superpowers and minions. Oh and will lets you loot the corpses. And live in the houses he doesn't ... um blow up. Oh yeah you get immortality.\n \n You: Immortality. Cool.\n \n Us: No its not. Shh... Don't play it up! If God finds out you are only being persecuted for immortality he'll kill you!\n \n You: Your God doesn't sound nice.\n \n Us: Thats because you don't understand him like we do.\n \n You: Okay how is he nicer than Satan Claus. Giver of gifts.\n \n Us: Because he says so. Look do you want immortality, and looting or not?",

   "LOL.\n I'm assuming your non-christian.\n Here's another I heard about some really strange belief;\n \n Richard: Hi, I come to buy a new house.\n Estate agent: Ah good we have just the one for someone of your intellect.\n Richard: What do you mean?\n Estate agent; don't ask too many questions! This isn't the place.\n Richard; Ok.\n Estate agent; Ah, here's just the thing for you, \n Richard; I'm confused!!!!!!!!!\n Estate agent; Look at this beautiful house it has air conditioning, perfect measurements, food for free, fuel everywhere, it's yours for a price!\n Richard; what's the price?\n Estate agent; well all you have to do is not ask where it came from. And listen to my one and only explanation for it otherwise all your neighbours will think your stupid. \n Richard; I think they all ready do.\n Estate agent; Why, have you questioned me?\n Richard; not really I just asked about the foundations of the house your trying to sell to me.\n Estate agent; and.\n Richard; well the thing is they told me that there weren't any, which although being extremely dumb strikes me as rather odd.\n Estate agent; don't be even more stupid then you already are you're an embarrassment to human society, of course a house doesn't need solid foundation.\n Richard; once again I'm confused (SURPRISE, SURPRISE) \n Estate agent; Let me explain. I believe the earth made itself and then the first living cell somehow managed to build itself out of non-living matter, something that I cannot explain (Foundation). Now I know that all the life you see around you evolved through a theory that is absolute truth, and fully explainable if only you would sit down and listen to me and not question my conclusion (House). So what is your problem boy? If a belief doesn't need a foundation then neither does a house. TWIRP.\n Richard; that sound really cool (for want of a bigger word), the only thing is you haven't told me about the foundations properly! I'm scared your house might fall down, you really clever man. \n Estate agent; Fool.\n Richard; Look! Sir. People can see that your house has no foundation they're laughing at you. Why doesn't your house have a foundation?\n Estate; :xcensored \n Richard; Is it because you don't know how to build one sir? Surly there must be someone that knows how to build one? Err, hum, wonder who that could be? LOL.\n \n You cannot possibly expect a person that can question you to buy your flawed house of evolution when you have no knowledge of how solid the foundations are.\n \n All the best. Richard.",
