   "The public officers in Washington assure us that the situation in Iraq is stable. Well, they are somewhat correct. They only omit that the situation is stable but severe and it doesn't seem to be any better in nearest future. Combat activity of armed opposition units and extremist groups remains very high. Every day Iraqi insurgents commit up to 100 terrorist acts and assaults on US fortified areas, motorcades, garrisons of foreign and Iraqi forces, municipal facilities and religious sites. Every-day losses of Multi-national forces raised up to 17, Iraqi forces up to 65. In addition to this, military experts agreed that all assaults are of harmonious nature which proves them to be guided from a single center. \n \n Of course, hostage taking of foreigners is still frequent in Iraq as well as sabotage acts against Iraqi fuel and energy facilities which inflicts vast economic losses to the country. Infrastructure facilities, transport links and everything that makes Multi-national forces difficult to fight stay in the interest area of terrorists. \n \n To make it short, the Second Iraq War is far from ending. No one knows how many more people will die there.",
