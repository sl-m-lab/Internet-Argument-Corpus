   "Britain's drug and gun culture 'as bad as U.S. crime show The Wire' say Tories | Mail Online\n \n \nA collapse of 'civilised life' has allowed a brutal drug and gun crime culture like that of the U.S. TV show The Wire to flourish on the streets of Britain, the Tories will warn today.\n \n Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling will blame Labour for standing by while 'urban war' breaks out in parts of the country.\n \n Carrying weapons is becoming the norm, violence is 'routine' and families are terrorised by gangs, he will say.\n \n Mr Grayling will blame family breakdown, fuelled by the 'devaluing of marriage' under Labour, and a benefits culture that allows many to 'sit at home'.\n \n Gun crime is up by more than half and there are more than 100 serious knife crimes each day, with fatal stabbings having reached the highest level on record.\n \n 'The culture of violence that was a feature of U.S. cities a generation ago is now a feature of British cities,' Mr Grayling will say.\n \n 'It's the world of the award-winning drama series The Wire. It's a horrendous portrayal of the collapse of civilised life and of human despair.'\n \n The hit TV series tracks the nightmare of gangs and organised crime in inner city West Baltimore and the futile efforts of police to deal with it.\n \n The series, launched on cable channel HBO in 2002, and showing here on BBC2, has been lauded by critics for its incredibly bleak - and realistic - portrayal of life on the streets, where drugs, violence and revenge killings are commonplace.\n \n Pledging a zero tolerance approach if the Tories are elected, Mr Grayling will\n \n say that any unlawful act including minor acts of vandalism should have 'clear consequences'.\n \n He will promise to stop those found with knives being let off with a caution, saying the presumption should be that they will face a custodial sentence.\n \n Cautions and light sentences in cases of violent attacks are also 'wholly wrong', Mr Grayling will say.\n \n He will highlight new figures suggesting that the problem of drugs and crime has increased dramatically in virtually every one of Britain's most deprived\n \n communities. Of the top 25 most deprived local authorities, 22 have reported drug offences increasing in the past five years.\n \n In some areas the increase in drug crime has been massive. In Salford, offences are up 300 per cent and in Hackney more than 200 per cent.\n \n Mr Grayling will speak of a 'shocking and enlightening' evening a few weeks ago on the beat with the police team in Manchester's Moss Side that works to tackle gang crime.\n \n 'What was going on there at the time was nothing short of an urban war,' he will say. 'Whichever way you look, the evidence is clear. Under this Government, the poorest in our society have be left to beenar the brunt of our social failures.\n \n 'The deep-rooted culture of drugs and crime that was once a feature of fictional programmes like The Wire is now a reality on many of our streets.'\n \n Mr Grayling will accuse the Government of creating a 'downward spiral' in poor communities, in which deprivation and crime repeat themselves for generations. 'Family breakdown has reached a scale where many young people grow up with no vestige of stability in their lives, and no concept of a family-focused upbringing.\n \n 'They are exposed to drugs and alcohol at a ludicrously young age. They have no one to tell them right from wrong.'\n",

   "\u0095 \u0095 \u0095 \u0095\n Praise for City Journal.\n \n Claire Berlinski\n The Dark Figure of British Crime\n Despite government reassurances, Britons feel under siege-with good reason.\n Rising youth crime, which official statistics haven't even measured, has contributed to public fear.\n Simon Wheatley/Magnum Photos\n Rising youth crime, which official statistics haven't even measured, has contributed to public fear.\n \n Just before midnight on January 12, 2006, Tom ap Rhys Pryce, a 31-year-old lawyer, left a London party and telephoned his fianc\u00e9e to say that he was on his way home. He emerged from the tube station at Kensal Green about 20 minutes later and began walking toward their apartment. That was when two teenage gang members attacked him. Donnel Carty kicked Pryce in the back, sending him flying to the ground, and Delano Brown kicked him in the face. When Pryce tried to defend himself, the attackers stabbed him in the legs, hands, face, and heart. Then they took his cell phone and public-transportation pass, the only valuables in his possession, and ran off, leaving him dying on the ground. The paramedics who strove unsuccessfully to revive him found his wedding vows strewn on the pavement.\n \n The British press, particularly the tabloid press, carries stories like this nearly every day-lurid accounts of drunken vandals, teenage murderers, child abuse, knifings, and gang violence. \"After bingeing on lager, vodka and cocaine, twisted Jobson launched a frenzied attack, stabbing Samantha TEN times with an eight-inch blade,\" the Sun reported this past November 26. drunken yob who left teenager with part of his skull missing after party attack gets just one year's detention, cried the Daily Mail on the same day-about a different incident. Collectively, these reports paint a portrait of a nation terrorized by vomit-spewing, tattooed thugs. And according to polls, British citizens also consider crime an exceedingly grave problem.\n \n But here the British government is strikingly at odds with both the press and popular opinion. Supported by Britain's most prominent criminologists, the government insists that the country has, in fact, been experiencing the longest period of falling crime since record-keeping began. Indeed, it says, the rapid and sustained rise in crime that began in Britain in the late 1950s has been entirely reversed: crime reached a peak in 1995 but has since dropped by 48 percent. Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has declared herself \"extremely pleased\" by the dramatic improvement in public safety.\n \n Someone in this story is wrong. But who? Have the British people succumbed to mass hysteria? Or is the government's methodology flawed?\n \n One shouldn't discount the possibility of mass hysteria. Such things happen. At various points in history, large numbers of people have convinced themselves that they faced a witchcraft epidemic, a Martian invasion, or a high risk of date rape on an American college campus (see \"The Campus Rape Myth,\" Winter 2008).\n \n Defenders of Britain's official statistics commonly say that public worry about crime constitutes just this kind of hysteria-and that it's the media's fault. \"Great lies, bold, bare-faced and unapologetic, are relayed every day by every orifice of the media in ways that would make Kim Jong-il proud,\" writes Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee. In her view, the press is peddling these lies to discredit the Labour Party, in power since 1997, and to boost the fortunes of the Tories. But the idea of a media conspiracy is inconsistent with the evidence: Technicolor headlines are by no means confined to the anti-Labour press. Toynbee's own Labour-boosting newspaper, for example, regularly relays from its own august orifices such headlines as: i was drunk. the blade went straight into his eyeball.\n \n Government officials are generally too sober to peddle such conspiracy theories but tend nonetheless to blame the press for the public's alarm. Crime sells papers, they say. But any journalist knows what's wrong with this argument. You cannot sell a story that no one will believe. If stories of crime seemed radically unconfirmed by anything in readers' experience, no newspaper could print them, over and over and over, and hope to stay in business. Even if I could find the odd sad-eyed, swollen-bellied, malnourished American child, I couldn't make a living by writing story after story warning that Americans are eating too little. So why would the media be able to generate hysteria about rising crime when, if the government is right, the rising British crime rate is as mythical as the American malnourishment crisis?\n \n Another standard explanation for Britons' crime worries looks not to the media but to psychology. As criminologist Richard Garside puts it: \"It is a criminological commonplace that crime anxieties are in truth anxieties about a broader range of issues, from whether you can trust your neighbors to whether your children will get ahead in life; from whether your job is secure to whether you'll be stuck next to a leering sexist on the 7.32 am out of Basingstoke.\" This may be a criminological commonplace, but it is not a self-evident truth. No reasonably perceptive observer of human nature would deny that people often displace their anxieties-but generally, they displace them for a reason. It seems rash to embrace Garside's conclusion unless we are sure that the government's crime figures are robust.\n \n But it is hard to be sure, for here is another, less advertised, criminological commonplace: criminologists do not know how to calculate the crime rate with precision.\n \n The problem was first described in the 1830s by Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian mathematician and sociologist and the founder of modern scientific statistics. The real crime rate, which he called the \"dark figure of crime,\" could not be revealed by official statistics, he argued: \"Our observations can only refer to a certain number of known and tried offenders out of the unknown sum total of crimes committed. Since this sum total of crimes committed will probably ever continue unknown, all the reasoning of which it is the basis will be more or less defective.\" The problem has plagued criminology for nearly two centuries.\n \n To understand why the dark figure of crime escapes exact measurement, realize that for a crime to be officially recorded, three things must happen: someone must be aware that a crime has been committed; someone must report that crime; and the police must accept that a law has been violated. But each link in the chain is easily broken. People may be unaware that a crime has been committed because they view it as normal or trivial behavior: in some neighborhoods, it would seem perfectly natural to settle a dispute with a good brawl, while in others, this would be seen as assault. Other crimes may go unrecognized because the victims are unaware that they have been victimized-either because of the nature of the crime, such as fraud, or because the victims are drunk, mentally ill, or otherwise incapable of understanding what has happened.\n \n Even when victims recognize that a crime has been committed, they may not report it. Think of children, or of immigrants who don't speak the language well enough to explain what happened to them. Rapes can go unreported because the victims are ashamed. So-called victimless crimes involving sex and drugs also go unreported, of course, because the criminals have no motivation to inform the police that they are hiring prostitutes or shooting up. Crimes can also go unreported because victims fear reprisals. Above all, crimes can go unreported because victims feel no confidence in the police and see reporting a crime as pointless.\n \n Even if a crime is reported, it will not necessarily be added to the official statistics. The police may conclude, for example, that there is insufficient evidence to believe the report. Moreover, poorly performing police departments have an incentive to stop recording crimes: it makes them look more successful than they are. For these reasons and many more, criminologists commonly posit that the dark figure of crime is far larger than the official figure-perhaps by as much as an order of magnitude. And there is good reason to believe that in Britain, the dark figure is unusually high.\n \n The British government derives its rosy estimates of the falling crime rate from two separate sets of statistics. The first, Police Recorded Crime, does indeed show a recent fall in the total number of crimes recorded in England and Wales-from 6.01 million in 2004 to 4.95 million in 2008. But the long-term trend is quite different. It shows just 2.69 million crimes recorded in 1980, a number that rose steadily until 1992, when it reached 5.59 million. After a decline in the nineties, it began rising again, until 2004, when it hit that all-time high of just over 6 million. While the recent drop to 4.95 million may be welcome, it is still high by anyone's standards: to find the last year that the British police recorded fewer than that, you have to go back to 1999.\n \n Defenders of the statistics counter that changes in crime-counting rules kicked in during 1998, pushing the number of recorded crimes up. Perhaps-but that doesn't account for the even grimmer picture painted by police records of violent crime. Sure enough, when the rules changed in 1998, the total number of violent crimes recorded jumped from 231,000 to 503,000. But then, even after the switch, it continued to rise sharply, hitting a peak of 1.06 million in 2006. That number has since declined only slightly: in 2008, the number of police-recorded violent crimes stood at 961,000. When it comes to violence, in other words, Police Recorded Crime actually confirms the public's general view.\n \n Further, the recent decline to 4.95 million total crimes recorded could well mean that the public has lost faith in the criminal-justice system and no longer believes that reporting crimes will result in the punishment of the perpetrators. Support for this hypothesis comes from a British Federation of Small Businesses poll indicating that 60 percent of businesses in London had been victims of crime in the past year. But proprietors reported to the police only half of the burglaries, vehicle thefts, and assaults that they suffered-and not a single case of arson. They didn't think that the offenders would be caught and punished, they explained. Going to the police just wasn't worth their time.\n \n A typical comment on the website of the Daily Mail makes the same point: \"A few years back I saw someone slash 4 tyres on a car. I did not report it to the police. I am a female, living alone in a rather isolated location. I knew that tyre slashing would probably warrant no more than the police having a word with the perpetrator and leaving it at that, maybe a fine, while the perpetrator would most likely have taken a more robust approach to me.\" Another writer to the website says: \"I had my car broken into in the Palmers Green area of London. I called the police to obtain a 'crime number' but was asked to call back a week later as they were inundated with such requests. When my car was broken into again the following year I didn't bother reporting it.\" If this attitude is widespread enough, the dark figure of crime fades to black.\n \n Police-recorded crime statistics are an imperfect guide for another reason. Perhaps the number of muggings in a particular district really has gone down. But could it be because citizens no longer venture out of their homes at night for fear of being mugged? If someone needs to restrict his activities more severely and purchase more elaborate security equipment just to be as safe as he was ten years ago, his sense that crime is rising may be more significant than the bare fact that crime is falling. Even the murder rate may not be a particularly sound measure of criminality, because advances in medical technology have ensured that more victims of attempted murder survive.\n \n Recognizing the limitations of police crime figures, governments have begun to supplement them with a second kind of statistic, the victimization survey-a poll that asks whether respondents have been the victims of crime. British government officials are fond of saying that the rigor of the British Crime Survey (BCS), an annual poll of about 50,000 homeowners in England and Wales, ensures that British crime statistics are the world's most reliable. The BCS suggests that the dark figure of crime is extremely high: last year, for example, it indicated that some 10 million crimes had been committed, far more than the police-recorded 4.95 million. Still, the government points triumphantly to the 16-18 million annual crimes that the BCS indicated in the mid-1990s. Since then, officials say, the figures have come down steadily.\n \n But the BCS suffers from shortcomings, too. Crime sampling is a classic problem in epidemiology and resembles, in many respects, efforts to track the spread of HIV. You won't necessarily gain a useful sense of the percentage of the population that, say, shares needles by calling 100 households at random and asking whether the respondents have recently shared a needle, for the people most likely to share needles are those least likely to have a household. Similarly, victims of crime are more likely than average members of society to be poor, homeless, mentally ill, or distrustful of officious bureaucrats who call to ask complicated, intrusive questions. Indeed, those most fearful of crime are those least likely to open their doors to pollsters. Criminologist Marian Fitzgerald argues that the survey doesn't capture the extent of violent crime in Britain because of information-gathering problems: \"The people who are most at risk of crime and serious violent crime are young men in inner cities. For the last decade social surveys have found it difficult to get into these areas.\" And even if you can locate crime victims and ask them questions, they are likelier than average members of society to lie when they answer-since they are likelier, by the mere fact of being victims, to be related to criminals or otherwise associated with them.\n \n Note, too, that the BCS polls homeowners, not renters. This immediately skews the results by deflecting attention from poorer neighborhoods, which are the areas likely to have the highest crime rates. And the pollsters have only been sampling children under 16 since January 2009, so crimes against youths haven't been recorded. If you read the British press, you will see that youth crime is what has the public most concerned. A 2007 Freedom of Information request to Britain's police forces found that 40 percent of all muggings were committed by kids under 16, many doubtless against other children. In January 2008, the Daily Telegraph obtained figures from the Ministry of Justice indicating that in the three years prior, violent crime committed by youths, measured by convictions in court and the issuance of formal police warnings, had increased by 37 percent; robberies committed by youths had risen by 43 percent. Of course, a rise in convictions does not necessarily indicate a rise in crime; it may indicate instead that the government is cracking down on crime, and indeed this is how the government explains these figures. But it is suggestive that there has been no commensurate rise in adult convictions and warnings. The most plausible explanation for this is that the government has been cracking down on youth crime disproportionately because it is rising disproportionately.\n \n Nor does the BCS poll the victims of sex crimes, drug crimes, crimes against commercial premises, or (obviously) murder. In 2003, David Green of the think tank Civitas attempted to calculate the number of crimes in some of those missing categories. The BCS that year estimated that about 13 million crimes had been committed, but using the Home Office's seldom-publicized estimates of police underrecording of significant crimes, Green concluded that the true number was nearly twice that.\n \n The BCS has other weaknesses. If a respondent claims to have been the victim of a particular crime more than five times in the past year, the pollsters are instructed to enter the number as five. For instance, if a homeowner in a high-crime area reports that feral youths vandalize his property every week, his report will enter the database as five crimes, not 52. In 2007, researchers Graham Farrell and Ken Pease concluded that if one refrained from \"truncating the long statistical 'tail' of victimization,\" the overall number of BCS crimes would be at least 3 million higher.\n \n Are the revised crime estimates significant? It is \"true but trivial,\" says Mike Hough, a criminologist at King's College London who has helped design the BCS since it began in 1981, that if you include all crimes, \"an astronomical amount of crime is committed.\" Surely nobody is really in a panic about petty crimes, he adds. But not all the repeat crime is petty: according to Farrell and Pease's study, if calculated correctly, violent crime would be 82 percent higher. The BCS figures, on their own terms, show substantial drops since 1995 in \"acquaintance\" and \"domestic\" violence, but \"stranger\" violence and muggings-the kind of violent crime that really terrifies people-remain at their extraordinarily high mid-nineties levels.\n \n And an astronomical number of petty crimes is far from a trivial problem. As New Yorkers remember all too clearly, a city suffering from rampant vandalism, shoplifting, petty theft, commercial fraud, drug dealing, and public streetwalking is a low, vulgar, ugly, dishonest, and menacing place to live. Might this ambient climate explain the British public's concern about crime? It's more plausible than positing a media conspiracy to dupe a nation of credulous hysterics.\n \n As for the downward trend in the BCS, as with Police Recorded Crime, it may reflect a real shift-in this case, a drop in victimization among homeowners who have grown cautious and more aware of crime-while completely missing a huge spike in youth crime and repeat crime in certain disorderly urban areas. Victimization studies also show that the crime rate in Britain is far higher than in most other European countries. Comparative analyses show England and Wales at the very top of the European crime leagues-and well above the U.S. as well.\n \n Upon close inspection, the official crime statistics hardly suggest that the concerns of the public and press should be dismissed. I propose a counterhypothesis: the media's treatment of crime, while obviously no perfect measurement, may well be a better guide to what's really happening in Britain, or at least an equally valid one. The media, unlike the government, are responding in real time to market demand. The market in Britain for stories about ultraviolent juvenile delinquents is insatiable; perhaps the people who buy these newspapers are, in effect, responding to a better-designed survey than criminologists have been able yet to construct.\n \n Why might Britain be suffering such high levels of crime? It isn't hard to guess. Officials at every level of the British criminal-justice system-detectives, judges, prison officials, probation officers-complain that too few criminals are caught and that those who are caught rarely receive sentences that will function as a deterrent. Lack of resources and a massive bureaucracy hamper police efforts: the average time to process an arrest in London is over ten hours, and the number of forms that must be filled out averages about 35, according to various analyses. Home Office figures released in 2007 show that police officers in England and Wales spend only about 13 percent of their time on patrol-and 20 percent on paperwork.\n \n One London cop in the Criminal Investigation Division blames the police's ineffectiveness on the unintended effects of community policing. \"There was a perception that there weren't enough beat cops-people who knew the local area,\" he remembers, which led to sending extra cops to problem spots. \"But in practice, they ended up going to community meetings and liaison. They're not actually dealing with minor crimes. If they were answering emergency calls and dealing with minor crimes instead of doing community liaison, that would indeed take a huge load off the system, but they're not. So in practice, what this means is that when I started working as a police officer, there were 25 people on staff answering 999 calls\"-the British equivalent of 911. \"Now there are 15.\"\n \n Perhaps as a consequence, more than two-thirds of burglaries reported to the London police are never investigated, according to police figures released under the Freedom of Information Act and obtained by the Daily Telegraph. Under 10 percent result in an arrest. And even if an arrest leads to a conviction, it's unlikely to include real punishment. The London policeman adds that it's common for a burglar to be arrested 30 times a year, taken to court 20 times a year, and punished with nothing more than a fine-\"which is meaningless, because they can't pay. There's no chance that with minor-level crimes you'll go to prison.\" A London magistrate clarifies: \"It's not that they can't pay, it's that they won't-and the system doesn't push the point.\" Theodore Dalrymple, a contributing editor of City Journal and a former prison doctor, tells me that he recently met a burglar on his 57th conviction. The burglar was fined 50 pounds, to be paid in five-pound installments-considerably less than someone in a legitimate business, making a comparable amount of money, would pay in taxes.\n \n Juvenile criminals can be particularly confident that if they commit a crime, it is unlikely to carry any serious consequences. During the seventies and eighties, the government passed legislation making it much harder to impose long custodial sentences on minors. The London policeman mentions a schoolgirl in his borough who was recently arrested and found guilty of committing \"grievous bodily harm\"-which means that \"bones were broken, someone's life was seriously affected; usually GBH implies surgical follow-up.\" She received a 12-month supervision order. \"Essentially, just reporting in for a year. Kids see this and say, 'What the hell, what can you do to me?' \"\n Joyriders celebrate after burning a stolen car in Sheffield's Manor Estate, which has one of the highest crime rates in Europe.\n \n Also during the seventies and eighties, the government introduced new forms of noncustodial sentencing, including community service and early-release schemes even for career criminals. In 2008, figures from the Ministry of Justice indicated that some 5,000 criminals who had already served more than ten jail sentences had received noncustodial sentences. Not surprisingly, a third of prosecutions in London collapse because witnesses won't testify: they know all too well that even if convicted, the criminals will be walking the streets terrifyingly soon.\n \n The situation in Britain, then, resembles that of 1980s New York, whose crime problems were routinely called insoluble. What the British government fails to understand is that the majority of serious crimes are committed by a small cadre of criminals, who are also, disproportionately, the authors of minor crimes. If you lock these criminals up-reliably, and for a long time-crime will drop precipitously. The reason Broken Windows policing works is not that it is inherently important to jail every petty thug who breaks a window; it is that the window-breakers tend to be muggers, rapists, burglars, and murderers as well. If you get them off the streets, the rate of serious crime will fall. To dismiss as \"true but trivial\" the finding that \"an astronomical amount of crime is committed\" in Britain is only half right. The British people know this full well, even if their government does not.",

   "Denied:1up! Software ()\n \n \nYou cannot legally buy a handgun in Chicago, yet the city is the nation's most murderous city.\n \n You can own one, but only if you've owned it since before 1982, and it's registered every year with the Chicago Police Department. Gun-control advocates and gun-rights advocates don't - or can't - agree on how a city with a handgun ban can lead the nation in murders. To proponents of owning guns, it means the ban doesn't work.\n \n \"Laws are only for law-abiding citizens anyway,\" said John Riggio, owner of Chuck's Gun Shop and Pistol Range in Riverdale. \"Criminals, by definition, don't follow the law.\"\n \n But to proponents of regulating guns, it means the ban isn't big enough.\n \n \"Gun control opponents like to look at Chicago and say, 'They have a handgun ban and look at all their murders,' but I think, frankly, that's ignorant,\" said Thomas Mennard, executive director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence. \"They're not taking into account that you can get handguns just outside of Chicago.\"\n \n Indiana Avenue cuts straight south from the Calumet Water Reclamation Plant into Riverdale, past a row of boarded-up and abandoned buildings. At 143rd Street, on the right, sits Chuck's Gun Shop, one of the closest places to legally buy a handgun outside Chicago's city limits.\n \n A trip to Chuck's on a recent weekday morning saw nearly 30 patrons walking through the door in the span of an hour. They were there for guns. Trade-in, apply for, shop or rent - it's all available at Chuck's. In 2006 Chuck's won the Dealer Recruiter of the Year Award from the National Rifle Association for getting the most patrons to join the association.\n \n Employees wear handguns in hip holsters, and before they'll let customers see or touch anything, they ask to see their Firearm Owner's Identification card. According to Illinois law, anyone who owns or wants to own a firearm must apply for a \"gun card,\" as the FOID is commonly known. Once approved, there's a 72-hour waiting period from the time you buy a handgun to the time you can pick it up.\n \n You can buy as many guns as you want at once, but at Chuck's you can only take possession of one every 31 days - a Riverdale law. Most of the customers are blue collar, Riggio said, and most of his business is in handgun sales. But he doubts there is any relationship between guns and gun violence.\n \n \"I would think there's no relationship at all,\" Riggio said. \"Ever seen a gun shoot by itself? I haven't.\"\n \n Riggio declined to provide shop sales figures and demurred when asked whether the Chicago handgun ban has any effect on his business.\n \n \"I don't know if it has an effect one way or another,\" Riggio said. \"I just follow the law.\"\n \n Chicago passed its handgun ban on April 9, 1982. In the wake of a 2008 Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, its legality is being challenged. After the Supreme Court decided that a federal district could not prohibit handguns, the NRA and the Illinois State Rifle Association challenged the Chicago ban. A circuit court judge dismissed the suit but it is currently on appeal before the 7th Circuit.\n \n Jennifer Hoyle, director of public affairs for the city's law department, stressed that until the courts say otherwise, the city's handgun ban will remain in effect.\n \n \"There have been no changes and it is still being enforced,\" she said.\n \n Currently, several hand-gun bills are under consideration in the state legislature. One, for instance, mandates background checks in private gun sales, which currently don't require them. Another prohibits sales of multiple handguns to one person within a 30-day period. A third bans assault weapons altogether.\n \n The Chicago-based Joyce Foundation, which lists gun violence as one of its six priority issues, chooses not to take sides in the debate over gun control.\n \n \"What we are in favor of,\" spokesman Charlie Boesel said, \"is a reduction in gun violence.\"\n \n The foundation offers grant money to groups looking to study the problem or with ideas on how to address it.\n \n \"We are very concerned about gun violence in Chicago,\" Nina Vinik, the Joyce Foundation gun violence senior program officer, said. \"We're based here so it's a hometown issue for us.\"\n \n Analyzing the gun issue\n \n According to a study released in the spring by the University of Chicago Crime Lab, and funded by the Joyce Foundation, gun violence costs Chicago taxpayers $2.5 billion a year, the equivalent of $2,500 per household. That's aside from the emotional costs that victims and their families must bear.\n \n The study also found that, too often, programs addressing gun violence lack the kind measured analysis needed by policymakers and expected by the medical community.\n \n \"One of the frustrating things is that the criminal justice system has for many, many years been trying programs to address gun violence, but when you go ask them what works and for whom, there's very little data,\" said Harold Pollack, co-director of the Crime Lab and a public health researcher who worked on the study.\n \n There's no shortage of people working on the problem, and the Crime Lab offers anyone with an idea the chance to get it rigorously tested.

Michael Pfleger, pastor at Saint Sabina's Catholic Church in Chicago's Auburn Gresham neighborhood, organizes gun drives and runs the Do You Care? intervention program to teach young people ways to resolve conflicts nonviolently.\n \n He sees the problem as largely a cultural one.\n \n \"Kids are armed with guns because it has become part of the wardrobe in America,\" Pfleger said. \"I've never been at a high school in the last year and asked if they needed to get a gun, [or] whether they knew where to get one and not had at least 75 percent of the student body raise their hand.\"\n \n Pfleger maintained that the challenge is to create an atmosphere in cities that doesn't tolerate gun shootings.\n \n \"You shoot one of our children, we're going to put a bounty on your head,\" he said.\n \n Law enforcement has its own ways of approaching gun violence. Last weekend, the city hosted its annual summer gun turn-in program. Former Chicago police officer and Cook County state's attorney John Armellino also suggested that crime is linked with financial destitution.\n \n \"Crime is really a function of economics. It is a function of poverty,\" he said. \"Turf wars are fights over money. Whoever's got the more lucrative corner to sell drugs is going to protect it.\"\n \n The majority of guns used in crimes in Chicago come from Illinois, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Both the mayor's office of criminal justice and the Chicago Police Department mentioned community policing as among the most important methods of combating gun violence. Sgt. John Delgado, a team leader of the Chicago Police Department's Community Alternative Policing Strategy (CAPS), agreed.\n \n \"In my experience, the most organized communities have the best ability to change things,\" he said. \"My job is to make criminals uncomfortable. If the neighborhood is well-lit and clean, and if people look out for each other and take pride in their property, the likelihood of criminals getting a foothold is greatly diminished.\n \n But, Delgado warned: \"If the neighborhood doesn't care, nothing's going to change.\"\n",
