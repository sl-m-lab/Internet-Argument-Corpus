   "Hi folks! Long time no \"See!\" \n \n I know I've been silent for a really long time, but life sometimes gets in the way. (You all know how that goes)\n \n Anyway, here's the deal.\n \n My partner and I fell on really hard financial times recently and we've moved from our beloved Illinois home to Pennsylvania to be closer to her parents. Both for financial reasons and because her parents are getting older and she wants to be there for them. Ok, I finally agreed but only if she \"came out\" to her father. Well that went well enough...but here's the rub. Ever since we moved out here, we took a 50% cut in combined income. My partner lost her employer benefits because her new employer is too small a company to offer any group benefits at all. Luckily my new employer does cover domestic partners so I've been paying through the nose for her medical insurance because it puts me into a higher tax bracket. \n Now her father has offered to purchase a new vehicle for us because the one we had was more expensive to maintain than it was worth. Problem. \n Because he's the one financing the vehicle he HAS to carry insurance on the vehicle or legally it's an illegal straw purchase. Ok, so he carries insurance for himself and adds my partner/his daughter. \n Problem...I'm not covered and therefore not allowed to drive the vehicle that I would in al actuality be the primary driver of. His insurance won't cover me because I'm not a \"family\" member. \n Now I know I can actually get my own policy but my partner is convinced (by her ill-informed and spiteful father) that we can't carry a second policy on the same vehicle. But this means yet another bill and more of a financial burden than we bargained for. \n Once again the law is stacked against us.\n \n I'm beyond furious! \n We have built a life together, raised a child together, been each other's support for over 12 years...but it just seems that for every hurdle we overcome another five pop up in its place.\n :xbanghead",

   "I have to say, it has been a long time for me as well. I just happen to click on this category because it is in my bookmarks and I am procrastinating doing some writing. Funny we should both click in at the same time after so long. Nice to hear from you.\n \n For starters, it sounds, and I am guessing like you are mad as hell. I also hear you may be frustrated by the lack of choices and even a bit scared as to how you can make all this work with less resources than you had. I would also take a guess you are feeling tired as I hear you say it has been on thing after another and I would bet you would value some rest from all this. Correct me if I have not understood what you are going through as I am only guessing for the sake of providing empathy!\n \n As for the insurance thing, switch insurance companies. Many insurance companies will write a policy for the whole group of you. It isn't that uncommon anymore. Even if he is the owner of the car, it can be insured by other with his bank as the pay off. That is how insurance would work for a leased car. Liberty Mutual is pretty good with these issues and so is met life. I would look for a new insurance agent.",
