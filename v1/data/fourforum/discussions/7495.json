   "Views on this film?\n \n Here's why I hate it: http://www.michaelmoore.com/books-films/f911reader/index.php?id=16\n \n \n FAHRENHEIT 9/11: \"Maybe Mr. Bush was wondering why he had cut terrorism funding from the FBI.\" \n \n * \"This question of resources will also come up in the commission's questioning of Attorney General John Ashcroft, who was brand-new on the job in the fall of 2001 and on September 10th cut the FBI's request for new counterterrorism money by 12 percent.\" John Dimsdale, \"Former FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General John Ashcroft to appear before 9/11 commission tomorrow,\" NPR Radio: Marketplace, April 12, 2004. See also, 2001 budget documents including Attorney General John Ashcroft FY 2003 budget request to Office of Management and Budget, September 10, 2001, showing $65 million offset in the FBI budget for counter-terrorism equipment grants:\n\n This couldn't have prevented 9/11 though.\n \n \n FAHRENHEIT 9/11: The security briefing that was given to him on August 6, 2001, said that Osama bin Laden was planning to attack America by hijacking airplanes. \n \n * August 6, 2001 Presidential Daily Brief (PDB): \"Al-Qa'ida members -- including some who are US citizens -- have resided in or traveled to the US for years, and the group apparently maintains a support structure that could aid attacks. Two al-Qa'ida members found guilty in the conspiracy to bomb our Embassies in East Africa were US citizens, and a senior EIJ member lived in California in the mid-1990s. A clandestine source said in 1998 that a Bin Ladin cell in New York was recruiting Muslim-American youth for attacks. We have not been able to corroborate some of the more sensational threat reporting, such as that from a ... (redacted portion) ... service in 1998 saying that Bin Ladin wanted to hijack a US aircraft to gain the release of 'Blind Shaykh' 'Umar 'Abd al-Rahman and other US-held extremists.  Nevertheless, FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.\" August 6, 2001, Bin Ladin Determined to Strike Inside US, http://www.cnn.com/2004/images/\n 04/10/whitehouse.pdf\n \n * \"The Aug. 6, 2001, document, known as the President's Daily Brief, has been the focus of intense scrutiny because it reported that bin Laden advocated airplane hijackings, that al-Qaida supporters were in the United States and that the group was planning attacks here.\" Clarke J. Scott, \"Clarke Gave Warning on Sept. 4, 2001; Testimony Includes Apology to Families of Sept. 11 Victims, Associated Press, March 25, 2004.\n\n So they had a single-source report that AQ might have done something that they then didn't do. They knew AQ were planning an attack, as I presume they always are.\n \n \n FAHRENHEIT 9/11: \"Was it the guy my daddy's friends delivered a lot of weapons to?\" \n\n Why is what daddy Bush did related to what mini Bush does?\n \n For the record, I was against the war and I don't like Bush and was against the war. I still think Fahrenheit 9/11 is utter rubbish.\n \n -Wez",

If Bush can't get OSB, Saddam seems like a great new guy to attack.\n \n \nthese 2 sentences are 2 lies. the identity of the enemy was and is clear, except to those who have rejected facts. iraq isnt an alternative enemy. ive shown you how this statement is totally absurd and should never ever be repeated\n\n \"AQ\" is not a clear enemy though. It operates in lots of countries and who is and isn't part of AQ is at best, vague.

   "does this justify not pursuing al qaeda?\n\n You said \"there is no dispute\" that AQ committed the London/Madrid bombings, or words to that effect. I proved this to be wrong. Unless you disagree with the above statement (ie, I countered your claim and proved it to be false) we can move on from the point.\n \n \nthen the fact stands that bush is raking in huge profits from this war. like it or not, its a fact\n\n Haven't said anything that disagrees with this statement. You wanted me to provide evidence for something I didn't claim. \n \n \nhe doesnt have to mention who else is profiting from this war. the fact stands that bush and the bin ladens together are profiting from this war. like it or not, its a fact\n\n This goes back a bit. I said I didn't like the film because I felt it was a way for Moore to shamelessly spread his anti-Bush political beliefs. I've not called him a liar, nor disputed the truth of the facts he presents. I do take beef that he doesn't always give an even presentation of the facts, something you should do in a documentary. Giving only one side of the facts is, imo, bending the truth.\n \n \nthen accept the fact that bush and his saudi buddies and the bin ladens are profiting fom this war. why is the truth a problem?\n\n Changing the argument. Again. I've never denied that Bush+Saudi buddies benefited so don't need to comment on this. Can you find a quote I asked for in my last post? \n \n \nyes it is. dont you see this as a good reason to strongly oppose bush's action, like what moore did?\n\n I've said this all along. I oppose Bush. I oppose the war. You wanted a reason for the war, I gave you one. I don't think that the reason I gave is a good reason to go to war, but I do believe it is the reason we went to war. I also oppose Moore because I believe he tries to make Bush look worse than I believe he is (which is an achievement in itself) using under-hand means.\n \nwhat would you consider coming out in the open? and how do you know he isnt out in the open where he is?\n\n I'd consider going on live TV, staying in very public places and generally parading around as going in the open. I'm he'd love to do this because it would be a slap in Bush's face, but I believe he's not doing this because he fears for his security. \n \n \nits not amusing. it hurts me to have to call you that. even though youre not an american, you uphold the ignorant american viewpoint. i should have said that instead of personally attacking you. as for \"mission accomplished\", those were george bush's words nearly a year ago\n\n I think an outsider would find it quite funny that you call me an ignorant American when it's fairly obvious I'm not American. Somewhat ironic.;). Onto the main point: I don't uphold the viewpoint you seem to believe I do, as I don't believe the mission's been accomplished. Nor do I think we should be in Iraq. What \"Ignorant American viewpoint\" am I holding, seeing as I don't believe the mission's been accomplished and I don't believe we should be in Iraq? Please elaborate on what this \"viewpoint\" is.\n (The quote I asked for would also be appreciated, because if you don't produce it, it looks like you're putting words into my mouth... again- the first time was with me apparently throwing out evidence).\n \ndo we know how much funds bin laden had left? do we know what percentage of funding we cut off? unless we do these are baseless assumptions you are pinning your hopes on\n\n http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/22/1093113053054.html?from=storylhs AQ funding apparently down, but effect is limited.\n \n \nclinton had obviously been funding anti-terrorism taskforces more than bush had been, since bush cut the funds that had been set since the clinton administration. it stands to reason that under the bush administration, there were less funds for anti-terrorism than under clinton. its something worth pointing out\n\n Bush cut funding the day before 9/11 and then boosted them significantly after 9/11. http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/terr03p.htm\n \n Overall, it looks like Bush is now spending more on counter-terrorism than just about anyone else. Moore doesn't make a big deal of this. Instead, he concentrates on Bush cutting funds just before 9/11, which lets face it, would have had no impact on 9/11 happening or not happening. This is a clear example of Moore selecting facts he likes (Bush cutting counter-terrorism funds by around 12%) and not commenting much, if at all, on facts he doesn't like (Bush increasing counter-terrorism funds by far more than he cut them, soon after 9/11). I'm not calling Moore a liar; he should be to clever for that. What I am saying, is he cherry picks evidence to give a distorted view of things. In a documentary film, this should not happen. As such I don't like his film.\n \n -Wez",

   "Michael Moore is Independent, not a Democrat. When Fahrenheit 9/11 was made and put together, there wasn't a sure fire democrat canadite anyway. Also, the main thing was why not to vote for Bush. It's being argued that Moore portrays Bush as a bad person to persuade the viewers to vote against Bush while not commenting on other parties and that this is a required element for a documentary. Has anyone seen the movie \"Super Size Me\"? That was a documentary about why not to eat a McDonald's. To prove his point, the guy only ate at McDonald's. He didn't try to make McDonald's look bad by going into Burger King to eat. He made McDonald's look bad by going into McDonald's to eat. (Granted, that guy didn't really need to do research to prove that McDonald's disgusting.)\n \n Also, at the same time, another main point of the movie was fear. (Which is actually a big part of Michael Moore documentaries is the effect fear has on people.) After 9/11, people's fear ran ammuck and they didn't know what to do to stay safe. Do they go about with their normal everyday activities or do they run and hide or buy a gun? Bush used our fear to help support his indevors into Iraq.\n \n Then it had to do with the poverty level in the US (especially in his home town of Flint, Michagan.) The question was brought up what kind of America are the troops fighting for. Also the fact that Bush is a ham for the Super Rich. So much so that he practically goes ga-ga over them.\n \n It also took a look at the governent and how Congress was ran. My favorite part was when he got on an ice cream truck and read the :xcensored Patriot Act allowed over the loud speakers in Washington D.C. By the way, Congress never even looked at that bill before signing it (like I bet they also did the same to the :xcensored Your Child's Education, or rather No Child Left Behind.)",

Turned up this company Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group is a multinational conglomerate that invests in heavily government regulated industries like telecommunications, health care, and particularly defense. Both George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush worked for the Carlyle Group, the same company that counted the bin Laden family among its investors. \n \n The Carlyle Group was holding its annual investor conference on the morning of September 11th in the Ritz Carlton hotel in Washington, DC. At that meeting were all of the Carlyle regulars: James Baker likely, John Major, definitely George H.W. Bush though he left the morning of September 11th. Shapfi (sp) bin Laden, who is Osama bin Laden's half brother, um, and was in town to look after his family's investments in the Carlyle Group -- all of them together in one room watching as the um, the planes hit the towers. And then in fact the bin Laden family was invested in one of their defense funds which, ironically, meant as the United States started increasing its defense spending, um, the bin Laden family stood to gain from those investments through the Carlyle Group.\n \n NARRATOR: Of all the weapons companies it owned, the Carlyle Group was in essence the 11th largest defense contractor in the United States. It owned United Defense, makers of the Bradley Armored Fighting Vehicle. September 11th guaranteed that United Defense was going to have a very good year.\n \n Just six weeks after 9/11, Carlyle filed to take United Defense public, and in December, made a one day profit of $237 million dollars. But sadly, with so much attention focused on the bin Laden family being important Carlyle investors, the bin Ladens eventually had to withdraw. Bush's dad though stayed on as senior advisor to Carlyle's Asia board for another two years.\n\n it so happened that on the day of the attack, the carlyle group was holding its annual investors conference. would you have liked a list of everybody in attendance? then, 6 weeks later, united defense went public, and investments of 237mil poured in. would you like a list of the public stockholders that invested?\n \n \nI would have to watch it again to pick up on some other things I felt were being presented unevenly.\ngood idea\n \n \nI think the funds increase should have been mentioned. If Moore mentions Bush decreases funds he should mention that almost immediately afterwards, Bush then greatly increased funds.\n\n did you miss what i just said? why applaud bush for suddenly being more keen about anti-terrorism after the nation was attacked? if bush got a report in august that bin laden was planning to attack america by hijacking planes, wouldnt then be a good time to restrict weapons such as box-cutters from getting on planes? now that it is too late, we have severe rstrictions about metal objects getting on planes. even the metal rib in high-heeled shoes are considered a potential weapon. this is all 9 stitches too late. bush deserves no praise for that, imo\n \n with all the increase in anti-terrorism funding, bush still went ahead and sent our soldiers into iraq to wage war, a war that you yourself admitted we had no legitamate reason to be in. this is much more relevant to the movie than the bush increasing anti-terrorism funding after the attacks hd been carried out, in my opinion\n -Wez[/QUOTE]",

However, I agree the Iraq war should be given more attention that increasing terrorism funds. I also think a significant increase in counter-terrorism funds should be given as much if not more attention than a significantly smaller decrease in counter-terrorism funds, 1 day before 9/11.\n \n -Wez",

All the film did was make Bush look worse than he is imo, which is an achievement in itself. \n\n here you go again. this not a noteworthy achievement. and it was not worth mentioning in the film at the time the film was made. \n \n bush has sent over 200,000 soldiers into iraq to kill iraqis and capture saddam under the pretense of a war on teror, while the fact is that we are not pursuing bin laden or the other actual terrorists, and saddam and iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. by bush increasing anti-terrorist funds (by how much, and manifested how?) after the terrorists attacked us, and after other attrocities were done by the administration, he doesnt deserve kudos for it\n \n we could talk about a lot of other \"good things\" bush had done in his administration, or a lot of \"bad things\" the democrats or clinton had done, but none of it would be relevant to the movie\n \n \nIf Bush is so bad, then Moore really shouldn't need to twist facts to portray Bush as even worse.\n\n twist the facts how? how can facts be twisted. its either true or false. what facts were twisted?\n \n \nI suppose if you judge the film in terms of propaganda, it's fairly good, but if you want to judge it as a documentary, which is how it was marketed, there are some serious flaws in it.\n\n flaws like what? which of the facts in the movie were false? either that,or properly define \"twisted facts\" because its a term you keep bringing up that doesnt make a lot of sense to me",

   "Rather than go through every point, nearly all of which seem to revolve around my claims that Moore twists facts, I'll try and demonstrate how Moore twists facts.\n \n I originally said: \"\"Bush cut funding the day before 9/11 and then boosted them significantly after 9/11. http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/terr03p.htm\n \n Overall, it looks like Bush is now spending more on counter-terrorism than just about anyone else. Moore doesn't make a big deal of this. Instead, he concentrates on Bush cutting funds just before 9/11, which lets face it, would have had no impact on 9/11 happening or not happening. This is a clear example of Moore selecting facts he likes (Bush cutting counter-terrorism funds by around 12%) and not commenting much, if at all, on facts he doesn't like (Bush increasing counter-terrorism funds by far more than he cut them, soon after 9/11). I'm not calling Moore a liar; he should be too clever for that. What I am saying, is he cherry picks evidence to give a distorted view of things. In a documentary film, this should not happen. As such I don't like his film.\"\n \n You said the increase wasn't really relevant enough to mention. Of course Bush should increase funding after the attacks. But we don't know what Bush's anti-terrorism funding was before 9/10. Say Bush increased terrorist funding by 200% on 9/9 and then decreased counter-terrorism funding by 10% on 10/9. Would that make him lax? No, of course not. Likewise, if he increases counter-terrorism funding after 9/11, does this make him lax on counter-terrorism? No, it shows how he now views terrorism as a more serious threat than before.\n \n Moore isolates one instance of Bush decreasing counter-terrorism funding, but doesn't mention Bushes counter-terrorism funding over a longer time-scale. Why not? Presumably because it would show an increase in Bush's counter-terrorism funding, which would make Bush look 'not-quite-so-bad'. As such, Moore prefers to concentrate on isolated incidents without looking at long term trends.\n \n -Wez",
