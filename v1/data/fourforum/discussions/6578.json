I'll give you this; I'm glad to see the great strides in racial equality. But, I cannot and will not accept the culture as it is today.\n\n \n OK, abortion is a tricky one as some people (I assume you are a pro-lifer) see it as straight murder, whereas people like myself see it as part of the liberation of the female half of humanity. Not much point discussing that.\n \n Where exactly is your proof that \"crime, drug abuse, murder etc\" (love the 'etc') have increased since the 60s? People have been doing these things ever since we came down from the trees (sorry, out of the Garden), most of the increase in these interlinked phenomena has happened since we started concentrating our populations in cities; drug abuse, crime and murder are inextricably linked to poverty, not social liberation (or however you want to define the numerous civil rights movements of the late C20th).\n \n On the subject of \"lack of respect for authority\", I believe that this is due to a combination of the extreme inequality generated by free-market capitalism and the vastly increased availability of information to the general public: Not only are people aware that they live in poverty compared to, say, the people a few streets away, they are also aware that their leaders are a bunch of lying, self-interested opportunists. This does not make them happy.\n \n Sexual promiscuity and immorality. I assume that these two are one and the same to you, unless you would like to define what you believe to be immorality (along with the other terms I would like you define, see my last post). Well, sorry matey but sexual promiscuity was inevitable as soon as decent contraception was invented. It's pretty natural for us to want a lot of sexual partners before we settle down to have children (I know I do) and the issue of divorce is linked to this: A lot of people get married and find out many years later that they regret it, who are we to say they can't get divorced and find happiness with someone else?\n \n You may not like the way culture has changed, but what can you do about it? If serious promiscuity and a lack of long-term monogamy become the norm in Western society, then that is the way it is. I believe it's bound to happen in a society like ours where we are so secure in the basic needs of life that we are free to experiment with getting as much pleasure as we can as often as possible!\n \n Sex is brilliant.",

This is what I believe, and I will defend your right to be as homophobic and ignorant as you like in your speech and action.\n \n So you can see the issue is not a matter of \"political correctness\" vs \"traditionalists\", there is an issue of \"freedom of speech and actions\" vs \"government control\", with two flavours of government control to choose from.",

   "Liberal Fundamentalism / Political Correctness\n \n \n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists were the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love\", illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat, and tears and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt.\n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice were foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong\", \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than it \"feels good, so let's do it\". The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their carnal minds was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values.\n \n One of the most revered mantras of the liberal fundamentalists is \"equality\". The net effect of this experiment was to elevate women via the degradation of men; promote racial equality by instituting racial-based preferences and reverse-discrimination; engender class warfare against people of means via the redistribution of wealth (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than rely on one's own personal initiative and work ethic); and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, and other corrupt lifestyles) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance\". However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a corrupted partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom\", liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses which are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools, embrace a de-facto litmus test against possible pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, seek to squelch religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws, and generally engage in a whole range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values.\n \n Liberal fundamentalism undermines the basic effectiveness of the government, legislatures, and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent.
