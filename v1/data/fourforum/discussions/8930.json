   "How would you like to die in this way?:\n \n September 24, 2006\n Op-Ed Columnist\n Prudence's Struggle Ends \n By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF\n YOKADOUMA, Cameroon\n As Prudence Lemokouno lay on a hospital bed here, spitting blood, her breath coming in terrible rattles, it was obvious that what was killing her wasn't so much complications in pregnancy as the casual disregard for women like her across much of the developing world.\n \n Neither Western donor countries like the U.S. nor poor recipients like Cameroon care much about Africans who are poor, rural and female, and so half a million such women die each year around the world in pregnancy. It's not biology that kills them so much as neglect.\n \n I began Prudence's story in my column last Sunday, and for a while I thought I would have a happy ending.\n \n Prudence, 24, was from a small village and already had three small children. As she was in labor to deliver her fourth, an untrained midwife didn't realize she had a cervical blockage and sat on Prudence's stomach to force the baby out - but instead her uterus ruptured and the fetus died.\n \n Prudence's family carried her to the hospital on a motorcycle, but once she was there the doctor, Pascal Pipi, demanded $100 for a Caesarian to remove the fetus. The fetus was decomposing inside her, and an infection was raging in her abdomen - but her family had total savings of only $20, so she lay down in the maternity ward and began to die.\n \n I arrived the next day, interviewed Dr. Pipi about maternal mortality - and found Prudence fading away in the next room. Dr. Pipi said she needed a blood transfusion before the operation could begin, so a Times colleague, Naka Nathaniel, and I donated blood (yes, the needles were sterile) and cash. \n \n The transfusion helped Prudence, and she grew strong enough to reach out her hand and respond to people around her. Dr. Pipi said the operation would begin promptly, and Prudence's family was ecstatic. But as we waited in the hospital lobby, Dr. Pipi sneaked out the back door of the hospital and went home for the night. \n \n It wasn't just the doctor who failed Prudence, but the entire system. He did operate the next morning, but by then the infection had spread further - and the hospital had no powerful antibiotics. Prudence's breathing grew strained, as her stomach ballooned with the infection and the bag of urine from her catheter overflowed. The nurses couldn't be bothered with a poor villager like her.\n \n That night she began vomiting and spitting blood. She slipped into a coma, and a towel beside her head grew soggy with blood and vomit. On Tuesday afternoon, she finally passed away.\n \n Intellectually, I knew that women in Africa had a 1-in-20 lifetime risk of dying in childbirth. But it was wrenching to see this young mother of three fade and die so needlessly.\n \n There's no doubt that if men were dying at this rate, poor and rich countries alike would make the issue a priority, but the problem seems invisible, like the victims.\n \n The U.N. Population Fund has a maternal health program in some Cameroon hospitals that might have saved Prudence's life, but it doesn't operate in this region. And it's difficult to expand, because President Bush has cut U.S. funding for the population fund - even for African programs - because of false allegations that it supports abortions in China. \n \n That's shameful. Two women have tried to recoup American honor by starting a group, 34 Million Friends of U.N.F.P.A., to make up the shortfall with private donations.\n \n (I discuss some of the groups active in this area at nytimes.com/ontheground, and I'll also have a link to video of Prudence.)\n \n Neither left nor right has focused adequately on maternal health. And abortion politics have distracted all sides from what is really essential: a major aid campaign to improve midwifery, prenatal care and emergency obstetric services in poor countries. We know exactly how to save the lives of women like Prudence, partly because a few countries like Sri Lanka and Honduras have led the way in slashing maternal mortality.\n \n Lynn Freedman, head of the Averting Maternal Death and Disability program at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University (www.amdd.hs.columbia.edu), notes that we could provide all effective interventions for maternal and newborn health to 95 percent of the world's population for an additional $9 billion per year.\n \n Sure, that's a lot. But think of Prudence and women like her dying in childbirth at a rate of one a minute - and after all, the world spends $40 billion a year on pet food.",

   "Your 'arguments', steeeeve, and those of any other pro-lifer that I have encountered are no mare than simple assertions of a taken-for-granted point. That point being that the unborn are human beings equal to any other human being and that abortion is killing that person, just like any other murder.\n \n I have stated several times and in several threads a different point of view, and asked questions about these taken-for-granted points, and am yet to get a satisfying response.\n \n I see the problem with the pro-life position to be rooted in two essential confusions. The first being that life must start at one particular point, and the second being that there is no real qualitative difference between the way abortion causes death and the way that murder causes death.\n \n I don't see any reason to believe that life begins at any one particular point, nothing in nature works that way. The most popular point of beginning seems to be conception. The pro lifers seem to feel very righteous and enlightened in their understanding that the unborn, at this point, are physically no more different from a baby, than a baby is from an adult. I can appreciate that, I think it's a pretty interesting and valid point. I don't understand why, though, somebody who is capable of understanding that, cant see that the egg or the sperm before conception share that same degree of difference to the same material post conception. Personally, I see the development of a human being to be, like any other natural development, something that takes place with no particular clearly definable beginning. At what point did the Grand Canyon start? Things don't necessarily have a clearly defined beginning. Our lives are continued from those of our parents. We create ourselves every day by nourishing our bodies with food, and everything that we can use to create a new life comes from this same nourishment, from food. We were all various food products once until our parents used their bodies to transform us into a moving living construction of matter. And then we continue and maintain our construction by nourishing ourselves. Witch brings me to my next point.\n \n Abortion is qualitatively different from murder in that murder is actively destroying an other construction of moving living matter, while abortion is ceasing to construct moving living matter that you are yourself constructing. Once you understand that a life doesn't being at any particular imitate moment, you can begin to understand the idea the development of a new life is the process of developing something to the point that it can begin to develop itself on its own. At what point this happens is also much undefined. An apple can not, on its own, develop into an adult human being, this is obvious. With the help of somebody, it may become part of such a development. So, if a woman's body, by accident or by design, begins to construct a new life, her decision to have an abortion is not a murder because she is not forcibly destroying another life's ability to continue itself, instead, all she is doing is casing to construct this thing herself. It will die because it can not live on its own, not because she killed it.",

   "Both sides are geared at \"Saving lives\". Pro-Choice are geared at saving women's lives, and pro life people are geared at saving cells, ok fine, \"unborn's\" lives. And PL's have already framed Pro Choice and given them a bad name. So, it P1sses us off a little.\n \n If a woman has an abortion, why is that your problem. Keep your hands of her eggs, its none of your buisness.\n\n \n You could ask that same question about a woman killing her child after it's been born. We don't base laws and morality merely on whether or not it's a private issue or not.

Eggs are pre-fertilization, and if you can show me a case where people are trying to take away women's eggs, please do so.\n \n You say pro-lifers have given choicers a bad name in calling them pro-choice, but I've never run into any choicer who minds being called pro-choice. Most wear that term willingly. What would be offensive would be to call them \"anti-life\" as you have called lifers \"anti-choice.\" It seems to me one of the biggest problems with the abortion debate is emotionally charged rhetoric that serves no good purpose--your demand of people keeping their hands off womens' eggs is a good example. It's not only biologically completely innacurate, it's a misrepresentation of the pro-life movement as well.

Jurisdictions that have made late-term abortions illegal have done son despite the pro-choice movement, not because of them. So in terms of legal opposition, your point doesn't apply a whole lot, IMO.\n\n Roe vs. Wade - the bastion of abortion rights - allows for abortion to be made illegal during the third trimester and, indeed, it is illegal or extremely restricted in the great majority of states. As things stand, the amount of abortions performed in the third trimester is miniscule. Quoting from Fox News: http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,880,00.html\n \nOf the 1.6 million abortions performed in the U.S. each year, 91 percent are performed during the first trimester (12 or fewer weeks' gestation); 9 percent are performed in the second trimester (24 or fewer weeks' gestation); and only about 100 are performed in the third trimester (more than 24 weeks' gestation), approximately .01 percent of all abortions performed. \n\n All this means that third trimester abortions are already, for the most part, illegal in nearly all states. My understanding of the political efforts of pro-choice groups is that by far their main role has been to prevent abortion in general (i.e. all trimesters) from becoming illegal in many states by supporting pro-choice politicians, supporting legislation to protect abortion clinics and doctors, having petitions signed against legistlation strongly restricting abortion, etc. I have not heard of major efforts where pro-choice organizations are trying to make third trimester abortions fully legal and free in those great majority of states where third trimester abortions are mainly illegal. However, I might simply not be familiar. Have you heard of such efforts? If so, please provide links.",

   "Steeeeve and Jyoshu:\n I'm a bit confused about your claim that Casey vs PP forced abortion to be legal for the third trimester. From a quick Google search on Casey vs PP, I came up with this as the conclusion (from http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/306/):\n \nConclusion \n In a bitter, 5-to-4 decision, the Court again reaffirmed Roe, but it upheld most of the Pennsylvania provisions. For the first time, the justices imposed a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The new standard asks whether a state abortion regulation has the purpose or effect of imposing an \"undue burden,\" which is defined as a \"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\" Under this standard, the only provision to fail the undue-burden test was the husband notification requirement. The opinion for the Court was unique: It was crafted and authored by three justices. \n\n As I read this, it means that one cannot easily restrict abortions *before viability*. Since I understand third trimester fetuses to be viable, how does this apply?\n \n On the main subject, I would agree that there are many pro-choice people who believe that abortion should be fully available for all trimesters (10% of Americans, based on that Poll I quoted), but those are the minority. As for those pro-choice groups that prevent certain third trimester restrictions from being passed, I have heard of two motivations:\n 1) The restrictions often do not allow for certain generally accepted exceptions such as sufficient exceptions for a woman's life or health.\n 2) A fear of a slippery slope - \"Give an inch, they'll take a mile\" - which, I agree, is a less justifeable though simultaneously politically understandable reason.",

Most wear that term willingly. What would be offensive would be to call them \"anti-life\" as you have called lifers \"anti-choice.\" It seems to me one of the biggest problems with the abortion debate is emotionally charged rhetoric that serves no good purpose--your demand of people keeping their hands off womens' eggs is a good example. It's not only biologically completely innacurate, it's a misrepresentation of the pro-life movement as well.

If continous then abortion is without a debt the killing of a human. If you pick a point where a new human being is established you get conception. If you decide what is a person worth living (ANother Opinion's argument) than you pick sometime between day 0 and 6 months normally.\n \n As to the second point. I think there are many ways to cause death. If you poison someone it will probably take longer than shooting someone in the head while they sleep.\n There is a point where the Grand Canyon started...you may not be able to know it or you may be hard to find but there is a point.

   "speaking of unanswered questions....\n \n \nYour 'arguments', steeeeve, and those of any other pro-lifer that I have encountered are no mare than simple assertions of a taken-for-granted point. That point being that the unborn are human beings equal to any other human being and that abortion is killing that person, just like any other murder.\n \n I have stated several times and in several threads a different point of view, and asked questions about these taken-for-granted points, and am yet to get a satisfying response.\n \n I see the problem with the pro-life position to be rooted in two essential confusions. The first being that life must start at one particular point, and the second being that there is no real qualitative difference between the way abortion causes death and the way that murder causes death.\n \n I don't see any reason to believe that life begins at any one particular point, nothing in nature works that way. The most popular point of beginning seems to be conception. The pro lifers seem to feel very righteous and enlightened in their understanding that the unborn, at this point, are physically no more different from a baby, than a baby is from an adult. I can appreciate that, I think it's a pretty interesting and valid point. I don't understand why, though, somebody who is capable of understanding that, cant see that the egg or the sperm before conception share that same degree of difference to the same material post conception. Personally, I see the development of a human being to be, like any other natural development, something that takes place with no particular clearly definable beginning. At what point did the Grand Canyon start? Things don't necessarily have a clearly defined beginning. Our lives are continued from those of our parents. We create ourselves every day by nourishing our bodies with food, and everything that we can use to create a new life comes from this same nourishment, from food. We were all various food products once until our parents used their bodies to transform us into a moving living construction of matter. And then we continue and maintain our construction by nourishing ourselves. Witch brings me to my next point.\n \n Abortion is qualitatively different from murder in that murder is actively destroying an other construction of moving living matter, while abortion is ceasing to construct moving living matter that you are yourself constructing. Once you understand that a life doesn't being at any particular imitate moment, you can begin to understand the idea the development of a new life is the process of developing something to the point that it can begin to develop itself on its own. At what point this happens is also much undefined. An apple can not, on its own, develop into an adult human being, this is obvious. With the help of somebody, it may become part of such a development. So, if a woman's body, by accident or by design, begins to construct a new life, her decision to have an abortion is not a murder because she is not forcibly destroying another life's ability to continue itself, instead, all she is doing is casing to construct this thing herself. It will die because it can not live on its own, not because she killed it.\n",

There's no evidence in the article that Prudence even wanted an abortion, or that if she had, that she wouldn't have been allowed to get one. It mentions the family not having the money to pay for the removal of a dead fetus, but that's not the abortion issue. It seems to me that the problem here is mainly the fact that overall medical care in 3rd world countries is generally pretty bad compared to the U.S. and other more developed nations. So on that, of course I agree with you that it would be better if they had better overall medical care and didn't use midwives. Why on earth would I not agree with you here???

   "I wouldn't want to die in ANY manner. But what does this have to do with abortion? The reason I didn't reply (and probably the same with Steeeeve) is that the article is not even about abortion. There's no evidence in the article that Prudence even wanted an abortion, or that if she had, that she wouldn't have been allowed to get one. It mentions the family not having the money to pay for the removal of a dead fetus, but that's not the abortion issue. It seems to me that the problem here is mainly the fact that overall medical care in 3rd world countries is generally pretty bad compared to the U.S. and other more developed nations. So on that, of course I agree with you that it would be better if they had better overall medical care and didn't use midwives. Why on earth would I not agree with you here??? This has nothing to do with a woman choosing to kill her living unborn baby. We have no idea if this woman wanted an abortion. Furthermore, it seems the topic of the article is more about the inequality between men and women in the African country where it took place, rather than about abortion specifically.\nPrudence's death is directly related to the abortion issue because Bush has drastically cut U.S. funding for international maternal healthcare, using the excuse that he might be paying for abortions. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, seems to have a hissyfity every time the term \"reproductive healthcare\" is mentioned. Prudence died because women are still considered dirt throughout the world, most especially by religions and rightwing Republican terrorists.",

You still have no idea what the \"anti-choice\" position is about and that is why your argument always fails\n\n \n I understand that the position is commonly called \"Pro-life.\" However, pro-life should not just concern abortion.

As of yet, I've never seen a Pro-life rally against obesity -- which kills more than any abortion clinic. It truly is \"Anti-Abortion\" and some can argue that it is \"Anti-Choice.\" The reason it's not call anti-anything is because the prefix \"anti\" implies a negative, and all of our connotations make it a bad thing. No one wants to be anti-choice.\n And seriously, other than people who directly profit from it, who is \"pro-death?\"\n \n As for the original post, it seems that story is more about some African women not knowing how to deliver babies, or prevent them.",

The terms \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice\" are typically understood in the context of the abortion debate, and my opinion is that most people understand that. This is why opposition to things like embryonic stem cell usage is usually referred to as being by \"conservatives\", not usually \"pro-lifers.\" If pro-lifers are going to judged by the fact their identifying term happens to sound broader than the context it's used in, then to be fair we should be judging pro-choicers the same way, but choice rallies are usually about the choice for abortion.",

Whether or not this was the case for the woman that Simone referred to is not clearly proven but I think it is an obvious point that health care funds save lives and their withdrawal prevents certain lives from being saved.\n \n That is an unintended consequence of the Bush policy of linking the funding with his anti-abortion stance, where his actions were meant to satisfy the pro-life views of his base constituency. One has to face the responsibility for un-intended consequences as well as for the intended ones. \n \n However, I would add the point that, if the withdrawn funds were then channeled into other health care funding within the same region, then the net effect would have potentially been to keep the same level of non-abortion related health care while reducing abortion-related health care. Then, there would have been fewer un-intended consequences of people dying from lack of health care. I don't think that was the case.",

You guys can run the most vicious TV commercials, magazine ads, and preach about it all you want. But, you CAN NOT LEGISLATE IT INTO LAW, as it is completely unconstitutional and violates women's civil liberties. What a women does with her body is NOT your concern, so you should stay out of it.
