   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/07/politics/07nsa.html\n \n January 7, 2006\n Basis for Spying in U.S. Is Doubted \n By ERIC LICHTBLAU and SCOTT SHANE\n WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 - President Bush's rationale for eavesdropping on Americans without warrants rests on questionable legal ground, and Congress does not appear to have given him the authority to order the surveillance, said a Congressional analysis released Friday.\n \n The analysis, by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress, was the first official assessment of a question that has gripped Washington for three weeks: Did Mr. Bush act within the law when he ordered the National Security Agency, the country's most secretive spy agency, to eavesdrop on some Americans?\n \n The report, requested by several members of Congress, reached no bottom-line conclusions on the legality of the program, in part because it said so many details remained classified. But it raised numerous doubts about the power to bypass Congress in ordering such operations, saying the legal rationale \"does not seem to be as well grounded\" as the administration's lawyers have argued.\n \n The administration quickly disputed several conclusions in the report.\n \n The report was particularly critical of a central administration justification for the program, that Congress had effectively approved such eavesdropping soon after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by authorizing \"all necessary and appropriate force\" against the terrorist groups responsible. Congress \"does not appear to have authorized or acquiesced in such surveillance,\" the report said, adding that the administration reading of some provisions of federal wiretap law could render them \"meaningless.\" \n \n The president acknowledged last month that he had given the security agency the power to eavesdrop on the international telephone and e-mail communications of Americans and others in the United States without a warrant if they were suspected of ties to Al Qaeda.\n \n The Justice Department is investigating the disclosure of the program, first reported in The New York Times. With Congressional hearings expected this month, the Congressional research report intensified debate on the program. Administration lawyers quickly responded that Mr. Bush had acted within his constitutional and statutory powers. \n \n \"The president has made clear that he will use his constitutional and statutory authorities to protect the American people from further terrorist attacks,\" said Brian Roehrkasse, a Justice Department spokesman, adding that the program represented \"a critical tool in the war on terror that saves lives and protects civil liberties at the same time.\"\n \n Many Democrats and some Republicans pointed to the findings as perhaps the strongest indication that Mr. Bush might have exceeded his authority in fighting terrorism. \n \n Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, who leads the House Democratic Policy Committee, said the report \"raises serious questions about the president's legal authority to conduct domestic spying.\" \n \n Mr. Miller said the justifications for the program were unacceptable.\n \n Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the report made \"absolutely clear that the legal authorities advanced by the president in justifying domestic surveillance are on very shaky ground.\"\n \n Thomas H. Kean, a Republican who was chairman of the Sept. 11 commission, weighed in for the first time in the debate. Mr. Kean said he counted himself among those who doubted the legality of the program. He said in an interview that the administration did not inform his commission about the program and that he wished it had.\n \n The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which Congress passed in 1978 after widespread abuses by intelligence agencies, created a system for court-ordered wiretaps for terrorism and espionage suspects. That system \"gives very broad powers to the president and, except in very rare circumstances, in my view ought to be used,\" Mr. Kean said.\n \n \"We live by a system of checks and balances,\" he said. \"And I think we ought to continue to live by a system of checks and balances.\"\n \n One reason the administration has cited for not seeking to change the intelligence law and obtain specific approvals for eavesdropping was that it might \"tip off\" terrorists to the program. The Congressional research service found that unconvincing.\n \n \"No legal precedent appears to have been presented,\" the study said, \"that would support the president's authority to bypass the statutory route when legislation is required\" simply because of secrecy.\n \n Opinions on domestic spying have largely broken down, though not exclusively, along partisan lines, causing splits between the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.\n \n The analyses of the Congressional Research Service, part of the Library of Congress created in 1914, are generally seen as objective and without partisan taint, said Eleanor Hill, staff director of the Congressional inquiry on the Sept. 11 attacks.\n \n Because of its importance, the report was repeatedly reviewed by senior staff members at the research service for accuracy and bias before its release, officials there said. \n \n Some Democrats say the administration bypassed the authority of Congress in ordering the eavesdropping. One congressman said he was actively misled. In a letter released Friday, Representative Rush D. Holt, a New Jersey Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, complained to the N.S.A. over what he described as deception by its director, Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander of the Army.\n \n Mr. Holt, a physicist who has worked as an arms control specialist at the State Department, visited the agency on Dec. 6 for a briefing by General Alexander and agency lawyers about protecting Americans' privacy. The officials assured him, Mr. Holt said, that the agency singled out Americans for eavesdropping only under warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n \n After the program was disclosed, Mr. Holt wrote a blistering letter to General Alexander, expressing \"considerable anger\" over being misled. An agency spokesman, Don Weber, declined to comment on the letter.",

   "Nonsense. From The Wisdom in Wiretaps:\nThe Bush Administration's use of warrantless wiretaps in the war on terrorism continues to generate controversy, and Congress is planning hearings. Some of the loopier elements of the Democratic Party have even suggested the wiretaps are grounds for impeachment. But the more we learn about the practice, the clearer it is that the White House has been right to employ and defend it.\n \n The issue is not about circumventing normal civilian Constitutional protections, after all. The debate concerns surveillance for military purposes during wartime. No one would suggest the President must get a warrant to listen to terrorist communications on the battlefield in Iraq or Afghanistan. But what the critics are really insisting on here is that the President get a warrant the minute a terrorist communicates with an associate who may be inside in the U.S. That's a loophole only a terrorist could love.\n \n To the extent the President's critics are motivated by anything other than partisanship, their confusion seems to involve a 1978 law called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. FISA provides a mechanism by which the executive can conduct warrant-approved surveillance under certain circumstances. But FISA covers only a limited number of intelligence-gathering scenarios. And no Administration--Democrat or Republican--has recognized FISA as a binding limit on executive power.\n \n Jimmy Carter's Attorney General, Griffin Bell, emphasized when FISA passed that the law \"does not take away the power of the President under the Constitution.\" And in the 1980 case of United States v. Truong, the Carter Administration successfully argued the government's authority to have conducted entirely domestic, warrantless wiretaps of a U.S. citizen and a Vietnamese citizen who had been passing intelligence to the North Vietnamese during the 1970s Paris peace talks.\n \n In 1994, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick also asserted an \"inherent authority\" not just to warrantless electronic surveillance but to \"warrantless physical searches,\" too. The close associate of Hillary Rodham Clinton told Congress that much intelligence gathering couldn't be conducted within the limits placed on normal criminal investigations--even if you wanted to for the sake of appearances. For example, she added, \"it is usually impossible to describe the object of the search in advance with sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of the criminal law.\"\n \n Some critics have argued that the surveillance now at issue could have been conducted within the confines of FISA. But that doesn't appear to be true. FISA warrants are similar to criminal warrants in that they require a showing of \"probable cause\"--cause, that is, to believe the subject is an \"agent of a foreign power.\" But if the desired object of surveillance is a phone number found on 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's computer, you may not even know the identity of its owner and you can't show probable cause.\n \n (snip)\nThis is war, not a criminal investigation.",

The author seems to be more concerned about being a cheerleader for Bush than presenting the truth. For example, right at the beginning the author alledges that FISA would require Bush to get a warrant before he could tap any conversations.\n \"But what the critics are really insisting on here is that the President get a warrant the minute a terrorist communicates with an associate who may be inside in the U.S. \"\n That's simply not the fact, and indicates that the author is not interested in presenting a truthful case. FISA allows retroactive warrants, and I suspect the author knows this. Whenever someone starts the lies in the second paragraph, I find it hard to give much credence to anything else they feel like saying. If anyone cares to do the research to try to back up any of the claims made, I'd be curious to see the results. But I'm not going to put in the effort to debunk this fluff piece.",

To use your example, the Taliban in Afghanistan were harboring Bin Laden. We demanded that they turn him over, or we would declare war. They refused, we invaded.

Milulski, Tom Daschle, & John Kerry among others on October 9, 1998 \n \n \"This December will mark three years since United Nations inspectors last visited Iraq. There is no doubt that since that time, Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer- range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.\" -- From a December 6, 2001 letter signed by Bob Graham, Joe Lieberman, Harold Ford, & Tom Lantos among others \n \n \"Whereas Iraq has consistently breached its cease-fire agreement between Iraq and the United States, entered into on March 3, 1991, by failing to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction program, and refusing to permit monitoring and verification by United Nations inspections; Whereas Iraq has developed weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological capabilities, and has made positive progress toward developing nuclear weapons capabilities\" -- From a joint resolution submitted by Tom Harkin and Arlen Specter on July 18, 2002 \n \n \"Saddam's goal ... is to achieve the lifting of U.N. sanctions while retaining and enhancing Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. We cannot, we must not and we will not let him succeed.\" -- Madeline Albright, 1998 \n \n \"(Saddam) will rebuild his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and some day, some way, I am certain he will use that arsenal again, as he has 10 times since 1983\" -- National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, Feb 18, 1998 \n \n \"Iraq made commitments after the Gulf War to completely dismantle all weapons of mass destruction, and unfortunately, Iraq has not lived up to its agreement.\" -- Barbara Boxer, November 8, 2002 \n \n \"The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retained some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capability. Intelligence reports also indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons, but has not yet achieved nuclear capability.\" -- Robert Byrd, October 2002 \n \n \"There's no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat... Yes, he has chemical and biological weapons. He's had those for a long time. But the United States right now is on a very much different defensive posture than we were before September 11th of 2001... He is, as far as we know, actively pursuing nuclear capabilities, though he doesn't have nuclear warheads yet. If he were to acquire nuclear weapons, I think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we.\" -- Wesley Clark on September 26, 2002 \n \n \"What is at stake is how to answer the potential threat Iraq represents with the risk of proliferation of WMD. Baghdad's regime did use such weapons in the past. Today, a number of evidences may lead to think that, over the past four years, in the absence of international inspectors, this country has continued armament programs.\" -- Jacques Chirac, October 16, 2002 \n \n \"The community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat Iraq poses now: a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them or provide them to terrorists. If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow.\" -- Bill Clinton in 1998 \n \n \"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.\" -- Hillary Clinton, October 10, 2002 \n \n \"I am absolutely convinced that there are weapons...I saw evidence back in 1998 when we would see the inspectors being barred from gaining entry into a warehouse for three hours with trucks rolling up and then moving those trucks out.\" -- Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Cohen in April of 2003 \n \n \"Iraq is not the only nation in the world to possess weapons of mass destruction, but it is the only nation with a leader who has used them against his own people.\" -- Tom Daschle in 1998 \n \n \"Saddam Hussein's regime represents a grave threat to America and our allies, including our vital ally, Israel. For more than two decades, Saddam Hussein has sought weapons of mass destruction through every available means. We know that he has chemical and biological weapons. He has already used them against his neighbors and his own people, and is trying to build more. We know that he is doing everything he can to build nuclear weapons, and we know that each day he gets closer to achieving that goal.\" -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"The debate over Iraq is not about politics. It is about national security. It should be clear that our national security requires Congress to send a clear message to Iraq and the world: America is united in its determination to eliminate forever the threat of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\" -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"I share the administration's goals in dealing with Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Dick Gephardt in September of 2002 \n \n \"Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.\" -- Al Gore, 2002 \n \n \"We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Bob Graham, December 2002 \n \n \"Saddam Hussein is not the only deranged dictator who is willing to deprive his people in order to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Jim Jeffords, October 8, 2002 \n \n \"We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Ted Kennedy, September 27, 2002 \n \n \"There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime is a serious danger, that he is a tyrant, and that his pursuit of lethal weapons of mass destruction cannot be tolerated. He must be disarmed.\" -- Ted Kennedy, Sept 27, 2002 \n \n \"I will be voting to give the president of the United States the authority to use force - if necessary - to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\" -- John F. Kerry, Oct 2002 \n \n \"The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us since the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know after Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that he has continued to build those weapons. He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, allowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on weapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation.\" -- John Kerry, October 9, 2002 \n \n \"(W)e need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime. We all know the litany of his offenses. He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. ...And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction. That is why the world, through the United Nations Security Council, has spoken with one voice, demanding that Iraq disclose its weapons programs and disarm. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but it is not new. It has been with us since the end of the Persian Gulf War.\" -- John Kerry, Jan 23, 2003 \n \n \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandates of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.\" -- Carl Levin, Sept 19, 2002 \n \n \"Every day Saddam remains in power with chemical weapons, biological weapons, and the development of nuclear weapons is a day of danger for the United States.\" -- Joe Lieberman, August, 2002\n \n \"Over the years, Iraq has worked to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. During 1991 - 1994, despite Iraq's denials, U.N. inspectors discovered and dismantled a large network of nuclear facilities that Iraq was using to develop nuclear weapons. Various reports indicate that Iraq is still actively pursuing nuclear weapons capability. There is no reason to think otherwise. Beyond nuclear weapons, Iraq has actively pursued biological and chemical weapons.U.N. inspectors have said that Iraq's claims about biological weapons is neither credible nor verifiable. In 1986, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran, and later, against its own Kurdish population. While weapons inspections have been successful in the past, there have been no inspections since the end of 1998. There can be no doubt that Iraq has continued to pursue its goal of obtaining weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Patty Murray, October 9, 2002 \n \n \"As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations. Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.\" -- Nancy Pelosi, December 16, 1998 \n \n \"Even today, Iraq is not nearly disarmed. Based on highly credible intelligence, UNSCOM [the U.N. weapons inspectors] suspects that Iraq still has biological agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, and clostridium perfringens in sufficient quantity to fill several dozen bombs and ballistic missile warheads, as well as the means to continue manufacturing these deadly agents. Iraq probably retains several tons of the highly toxic VX substance, as well as sarin nerve gas and mustard gas. This agent is stored in artillery shells, bombs, and ballistic missile warheads. And Iraq retains significant dual-use industrial infrastructure that can be used to rapidly reconstitute large-scale chemical weapons production.\" -- Ex-Un Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter in 1998 \n \n \"There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years. And that may happen sooner if he can obtain access to enriched uranium from foreign sources -- something that is not that difficult in the current world. We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.\" -- John Rockefeller, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"Saddam's existing biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose a very real threat to America, now. Saddam has used chemical weapons before, both against Iraq's enemies and against his own people. He is working to develop delivery systems like missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that could bring these deadly weapons against U.S. forces and U.S. facilities in the Middle East.\" -- John Rockefeller, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"Whether one agrees or disagrees with the Administration's policy towards Iraq, I don't think there can be any question about Saddam's conduct. He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do. He lies and cheats; he snubs the mandate and authority of international weapons inspectors; and he games the system to keep buying time against enforcement of the just and legitimate demands of the United Nations, the Security Council, the United States and our allies. Those are simply the facts.\" -- Henry Waxman, Oct 10, 2002",

   "Which is to say, you've got nothing.\n \n You have no denials from Bush, you have no denials from anyone. You are possibly the only person out there who doesn't know that Bush spied on American citizens.\n\n \n \n \n \n And you have just been diagnosed with foot in mouth disease:\n \n \n \n \n From the speech:\n \n \n So, consistent with U.S. law and the Constitution, I authorized the interception of international communications of people with known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations. This program is carefully reviewed approximately every 45 days to ensure it is being used properly. Leaders in the United States Congress have been briefed more than a dozen times on this program. And it has been effective in disrupting the enemy, while safeguarding our civil liberties. \n \n This program has targeted those with known links to al Qaeda. I've reauthorized this program more than 30 times since the September the 11th attacks, and I intend to do so for so long as our nation is -- for so long as the nation faces the continuing threat of an enemy that wants to kill American citizens. \n \n \n \n I see NO WHERE WERE IT SAYS US CITIZENS DO YOU?!?!?!?\n \n \n \n Here is some more interesting #### from the speech:\n \n Q It was, why did you skip the basic safeguards of asking courts for permission for the intercepts? \n \n THE PRESIDENT: First of all, I -- right after September the 11th, I knew we were fighting a different kind of war. And so I asked people in my administration to analyze how best for me and our government to do the job people expect us to do, which is to detect and prevent a possible attack. That's what the American people want. We looked at the possible scenarios. And the people responsible for helping us protect and defend came forth with the current program, because it enables us to move faster and quicker. And that's important. We've got to be fast on our feet, quick to detect and prevent. \n \n We use FISA still -- you're referring to the FISA court in your question -- of course, we use FISAs. But FISA is for long-term monitoring. What is needed in order to protect the American people is the ability to move quickly to detect. \n \n Now, having suggested this idea, I then, obviously, went to the question, is it legal to do so? I am -- I swore to uphold the laws. Do I have the legal authority to do this? And the answer is, absolutely. As I mentioned in my remarks, the legal authority is derived from the Constitution, as well as the authorization of force by the United States Congress. \n \n \n \n \n Meat\n \n \n Q -- why, in the four years since 9/11, has your administration not sought to get changes in the law instead of bypassing it, as some of your critics have said? \n \n THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. First, I want to make clear to the people listening that this program is limited in nature to those that are known al Qaeda ties and/or affiliates. That's important. So it's a program that's limited, and you brought up something that I want to stress, and that is, is that these calls are not intercepted within the country. They are from outside the country to in the country, or vice versa. So in other words, this is not a -- if you're calling from Houston to L.A., that call is not monitored. And if there was ever any need to monitor, there would be a process to do that. \n \n \n That means COURT ORDER for US citizens\n \n \n \n \n And the potatoes\n \n \n \n Q Thank you, Mr. President. You say you have an obligation to protect us. Then why not monitor those calls between Houston and L.A.? If the threat is so great, and you use the same logic, why not monitor those calls? Americans thought they weren't being spied on in calls overseas -- why not within the country, if the threat is so great? \n \n THE PRESIDENT: We will, under current law, if we have to. We will monitor those calls. And that's why there is a FISA law. We will apply for the right to do so. And there's a difference -- let me finish -- there is a difference between detecting so we can prevent, and monitoring. And it's important to know the distinction between the two. \n \n Q But preventing is one thing, and you said the FISA laws essentially don't work because of the speed in monitoring calls overseas. \n \n THE PRESIDENT: I said we use the FISA courts to monitor calls. It's a very important tool, and we do use it. I just want to make sure we've got all tools at our disposal. This is an enemy which is quick and it's lethal. And sometimes we have to move very, very quickly. But if there is a need, based upon evidence, we will take that evidence to a court, in order to be able to monitor calls within the United States. \n \n \n I think this scandal is now officially......

   "Sorry to have to expose your out of context prevarication like that.... emoticon_xhoho\n\n \n Nice cut and paste, but I refuted all that before. But just for you, I'll do it again.\n \n First off, including the rest of the interview fails to refute my point. He was asked if we would spy on local American calls like he has with international calls with Americans, and he said he would if he had to. That's a confession, and you haven't shown otherwise. You haven't shown anywhere where Bush has said he hasn't spied on Americans. You've done nothing to back up this notion of yours. \n \n \n Now for the rest of your quotes:\n \n First block: Summary; Bush says what he has done is legal. No surprises there. Note that there are no cliams that he isn't spying, just that he's allowed to.\n \n Second block: Q: Why skip the safeguards?\n A: We use them sometimes, but sometimes we had to act quickly.\n \n This is simply garbage. FISA allows you to get warrants 3 days after the fact.\n And please note, he doesn't deny going around FISA.\n \n \n \"Meat\": I have no idea why you thought of this as meat\n Q: Why didn't you change the law instead of breaking it?\n A: We only do so if we think there are terrorists from out of the country involved.\n \n When asked if he's bypassing the law, he doesn't deny it. And he does not say that he isn't spying on US citizens, he says he isn't spying on citizens talking to citizens, yet. A citizen talking to a \"suspect\" from out of the country is fair game, according to Bush. However, the law says differently.\n \n \"potatos\": Q: Why not spy on local american calls?\n A: We will if we have to. Then we might use FISA\n Q: Isn't speed still an issue?\n A: We may use FISA. We may do something else. We'll use whatever tool we need.\n \n In other words, if the law gets in the way again, he'll ignore it again.\n \n \n Multiple times he's accused of spying on Americans, and he repeatedly says \"As long as they're talking to oversees terrorists, we'll keep doing it.\" Who do you think is in on these converstaions? Who do you think is being called, here in the US? Are you seriously suggesting that when a call from a terrorist is detected they check the incoming number, check their database, find out if the recipient is a US citizen, and only monitor if they can confirm that he isn't? Is that the scenario you're imagining here?",

   "\n Nice cut and paste, but I refuted all that before. But just for you, I'll do it again.\n \n\n \n Yes I cut and pasted it from the last thread where YOU and every lib ignored it. Whats your point boy? I cut and paste. You lose an argument so you or your ilk start another EXACT thread on it hoping the truth would go away.\n \n \n\n First off, including the rest of the interview fails to refute my point. He was asked if we would spy on local American calls like he has with international calls with Americans, and he said he would if he had to. That's a confession, and you haven't shown otherwise. You haven't shown anywhere where Bush has said he hasn't spied on Americans. You've done nothing to back up this notion of yours. \n \n\n \n If he had to \"WITHIN THE LAW\" which means court order. I do not understand how you constantly fail in understanding basic English... If he is NOT using court orders for haji and tellls the reporter babe \" if you're calling from Houston to L.A., that call is not monitored. And if there was ever any need to monitor, there would be a process to do that. \"\n \n \n The Proccess he is refering to is a court order. How do we know this? Because he is spying on Haji without one. So the proccess would have to be a legal one which under our Constitution requires a warrant.\n \n BTW The Constitution does not apply to non Americans... You do know that right?\n \n \n \n\n Now for the rest of your quotes\"\n \n First block: Summary; Bush says what he has done is legal. No surprises there. Note that there are no cliams that he isn't spying, just that he's allowed to.\n \n\n \n He is. Haji wants to cut your head off. Congress gave him the powers to kill them.. That includes wiretapps.\n \n \n\n Second block: Q: Why skip the safeguards?\n A: We use them sometimes, but sometimes we had to act quickly.\n \n This is simply garbage. FISA allows you to get warrants 3 days after the fact.\n \n\n \n 3 freakin days? You give haji 3 days after a communication and a bunch of VX and he can kill thousands before you can say \"WARRANT\"..\n \n So you are for flooding the court and legal system during a time of war to make sure we are \"legally\" spying on haji? jeesh.\n \n Just because they haven't killed anyone you know does not mean that there is not an enemy that wants to kill you, infidel. Peace be upon you.\n \n \n\n \"Meat\": I have no idea why you thought of this as meat\n Q: Why didn't you change the law instead of breaking it?\n A: We only do so if we think there are terrorists from out of the country involved.\n \n\n \n \n And so... You want to make public law on how we spy on our enemies? Stick to shoots and ladders your not up to the level of domestic security yet son.\n \n \n\n When asked if he's bypassing the law, he doesn't deny it. And he does not say that he isn't spying on US citizens, he says he isn't spying on citizens talking to citizens, yet. A citizen talking to a \"suspect\" from out of the country is fair game.\n \n\n \n \n No YOU keep saying citizens he is saying people within the US. THat could mean illegals, non-resident aliens, anyone. Thats Why I demand that you show me some evidence of an American citizen spied on by this nonsense instead of you making stuff up and trying to pass it off as fact.....\n \n You hurt the real concerns by this nonsense.\n \n \n\n \"potatos\"\n\n \n \n I am sorry I was mistaking you for someone who would get the joke.... Hence the quotes and the italics... Sorry for my error in judgment.....\n \n \n \n Peace be upon you.",

   "Man... I am disapointed... Usually you at least have some sort of facts straight.... \n \n \n Carnivore collected packets. Yours, mine, and anyone elses.... It sniffed out \"keywords\" based on the FBI's word list and tagged and intercepted electronic comm based on this.,\n\n \n You are confusing Echelon and Carnivor. Echelon looked for Keywords. Carnivore was just a packet snffer that looked for packets with certain routing information (packets that were either going to or coming from the suspects computer...after they got a warrant). \n \n Specifically, it looked at the source port and destination port. It captured certain packets based on the source and destination ports, and then used the information in the sequence number to re-assemble the message, surfing activity, or whatever. \n \n It was similar to looking at the fornt of an envelope at the post office if you had a warrant to search a persons mail, and it required an extensive judicial review (over and above a standard warrant request) to even turn the thing on.\n \n \nWhile the program was funded under Bush sr. (By a Democrat Congress) its a moot point. The point being that if you and Kronass are so up in arms about bush hunting haji where were you two when Klinton TRIPLED the budget and expanded the scope of Carnivore in the newer system called \"Omnivore\".\n\n \n Omnivore came BEFORE Carnivore and worked by downloading and reassembling EVERY Email message that passed through, then deleting the ones that were not related to the recipients that was the target of the investigation. The potential for abuse was huge, and omnivore was limited SOLEY to Email.\n \n In 1997 the FBI replaced Omnivore with the DragonWare suite. The dragonware Suite is composed of 3 parts:\n \n Carnivore\n Packeteer\n Coolminer\n \n Carnivore is a packet sniffer. Packeteer was the program that re-assembled the packets into a cohesive message (packets on their own are worthless bits of data) and Coolminer was a program for extrapolating the data in the messages.\n \n This came AFTER Omnivore. Omnivore was so named because it \"ate\" everything. Carnivore was kind of a play on that because it did not \"eat\" everything, it was selective.\n \n Clinton did not TRIPLE the budget for Carnivore. The program was funded under the Bush Administration for development (democratic congress my XXX. Bush refused to sign ANYTHING unless his domestic surveilance bill was passed). \n \n What happened under the Clinton administration was they funded Carnivores (actually the DragonWare Suite) DEPLOYMENT, and it was the republican congress that did it. Remember....Budget battles, government shut down because the president and congress could not agree on a budget? Carnivore was one of the major sticking points. \n \n \n \nWhile the program was funded under Bush sr. (By a Democrat Congress) its a moot point. The point being that if you and Kronass are so up in arms about bush hunting haji where were you two when Klinton TRIPLED the budget and expanded the scope of Carnivore in the newer system called \"Omnivore\".\n\n \n I was at an EFF conference, pssing a petition to stop Carnivores deployment (because Carnivore replaced Omnivore, not the other way around). After it became apparent that carnivore was going into use regardless, I started working with some other programmers on packet spoofing and floating point encryption algorithms that would make the sytem useless. I think that the collaberative effort paid off. There is now open source, 512 or 1024 bit encryption available that renders your Email unreadable to even the NSA. \n \n Not only did more powerful encryption come out, new floating point public key encryption came out of the effort. The best example is probably IDEA encryption, a floating point public key setup that, when used properly, would require several hundred thousand supercomputers working in tandem to break it. Also from the cumulativfe efforts of the computing comunity came single use encryption schemes, similar to the one off pads of WW2.

I don't care if they are calling themselved \"democrats\", \"republicans\", \"communists\", \"socialists\" or \"choir boys\", a fascist ####### by any othr name is still a fascist #######. \n \n \nWhat you libs are accusing Bush of is small potatoes compared to what Klinton did.\n\n \n You are 110% WRONG here. What bush has done is, IMO more than justification enough to have him tried and executed for treason. He has done more to destroy the freedom and rigths of Americans than any president that I can remember.\n \n And I think we have pretty much established that YOU are the one taking the liberal view here.\n \n \nEchelon was a project of Reagan to spy on the commies.... Guess who expanded it to domestic use. (allegedly)..... Klinton.\n\n \n Nobody. Echelon was shut down at the end of the Reagan administration because of the use of encrypted sattelite burt for overseas communication. Echelon was not technologically advanced enough to keep up. It was MUCH cheaper for communicaitons providers to route international calls through a sattelite relay, and the most efficient way to do it was coded bursts. Echelon relied hubs on the International calling cable loops. \n \n \nAnd as of yet you can not provide me one American Citizen targeted in the wiretaps.\n\n \n \n As Kronos has repetitively documented. The NSA leak said Americans were tapped. Bush has admitted that Americans were tapped, and that he intends to continue tapping. The fact that individual names are not available is just your childish attempt at denial of the facts that have been continuosly laid bare for your inspection.",

   "Mainly because the Dems might want to use those powers if they get into power.\nIt's already been done. Even the home of Aldrich Ames was searched without a warrant. Whether or not it was legal to do so has never been tested in court because Ames pled out, but the fact remains that he was searched and tapped without a warrant and no one raised an objection.\n \n \nThat last part is simply incorrect. The president doesn't get to decide that such and such a law infringes on his powers, so he'll just ignore it. If such a law does exist than there are legal means to get it overturned. Until the law is overturned, it must be followed. Bush has had years to have any concerns he might have had addressed. Clearly he had no interest in doing so.\nActually, the president is under no obligation to respect a law which interferes with his Constitutional powers and there is court precedent to support his actions. If you take the trouble to listen to the public Senate hearings which the AG has promised, you'll have a lot more facts at hand when you try to make your argument.\n \n Our national history is full of examples where, in times of national crisis, the president has taken some pretty dodgy actions which would be unacceptable in peacetime, of which the best known are probably the Civil War, WWI and WWII. We've also had some pretty scary situations since then: in the mid-to-late fifties, SAC General Curtis LeMay was sending US bombers over Soviet territory (to test their detection capability) on his own initiative, without the consent or knowledge of President Eisenhower; in the early sixties, John Kennedy granted altogether too much independence to his murderous s.o.b. brother who tried to have Castro assassinated; and of course there have been many claims and many novels of CIA wet operations on foreign soil. None of these types of activities have been banned by Congress, because Congress doesn't have the Constitutional authority to restrict the President's action - there is a reason that the prohibition against assassinating foreign leaders is founded on executive orders rather than Congressional statute. \n \n What we have done is require that any such questionable activity be personally authorized by the sitting President, and it is the President - the only politician elected by the whole country - who must decide whether to seek permission or forgiveness. As Harry Truman put it, \"The buck stops here.\"",

IT was noted, however, that laws and policies could be put in place that would liit or direct this power. FISA was born. It gives the executive branch the power to conduct surveilance without the difficulties that can arise form going through the regular court system. \n \n It is that whole \"balance of power\" thing. The president has the power to execute the surveilance, but only under the guidleins set by congress, and with the blessing ( a warrnat) of the judicial branch.\n \n What Bush ahs essentially done is exceeded his constitutional powers.

For Islam to rule everywhere.\n\n \n If that was the case, there would be a lot more dead Americans. We know for a FACT that Al Queda has had the opportunity to purchase ex soviet nukes. We know for a fact that hudreds of thousands of people cross our borders every week by the truckload without any kind of inspection. If the goal was truly just to have americans dead, they would be dead and there is nothign anybody could do to stop it, regardless of what kid of constitutional shredding you want to do. America is just too big and our borders are too open. \n \n If you look at Bin Ladens history, he knows damn well how to destroy a superpower, becuase we taught him. He and his fellow Islamic fundamentalists had more to do with the downfall of the soviet union than any other factor. The key to doing so is two fold....drain their treasury and show the world they CAN be resisted.

Both Ford and GM ;pst market share last year, depsite theri give away incentive programs, and they expect to loose market share for the forseeable future.\n \n Yea, they are in great shape.\n \n \n \nThe housing market was bound to level off and even go down some; it's been flying for months--has nothing to do with the Bush administration. Yes, energy prices are up. That's the one thing you've said that's pertinent. But it doesn't take into account that natural gas prices are inflated because of a natural disaster.\n\n \n Less than 5% of the cost if natural gas is related to the hurricane. Energy prices are up because the dollar is down, and because of an uncertain situation in the ME. We are running a HUGE trade deficit, a HUGE budget deficit, and our bonds are paying more than CANADAS becuase investors are uncertain about our future and are demanding greater returns to finance our massive debt. \n \n As far as housing prices go, looking at past pricing patterns and relationships to market fundamentals, you should probably look for that \"slight decline\" to be a return to 1996 prices, and that is if we do not see the massive overcorrection that has gone with EVERY real estate bubble in history. \n \n The level of debt as a percent of after-tax income is the highest ever measured in our history. Mortgage and consumer debt is now 115% of after-tax income, twice the level of 30 years ago. The debt-service ratio (the percent of after-tax income that goes to pay off debts) is at an all-time high of 13.6%. \n \n Are these things Bushs fault? Of course not. How hard the landign will be, though, will be dirrectly linked to how he responds to these problems, and blowing a trillion dollars on the invasion, occupation, and rebuilding of a second tier nation that was no threat to the US was a damn fine way to ensure that the landing will be a hard one. \n \n Do you realize that we have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs in the last 5 years, and based soley on what has ALREADY been annpounced for this year, we wil loose over a million more in teh first half of the year?\n \n Our economy is in deep ####, and Bushs deficit spending is not only making things worse, but he is selling our children into indentured servitude.",

They didn't even need their own explosives for 9/11. If Al Queda's main goal was to cost the US money, they wouldn't have attacked the USS Cole or attacked buildings. The WTC was perhaps the highest profile buildings in the country. They wanted to stick it to us and take out as many as they could, pure and simple and they did.

We know for a fact that hudreds of thousands of people cross our borders every week by the truckload without any kind of inspection.\n\n \n There HAVE been attempts to make a lot more dead Americans. They've been foiled. I don't think it's a fact that Al Queda has been able to buy nukes. But even if it were, having a nuke alone doesn't do didly squat--it has to be handled, transported, there has to be a launch facility or vehicle, a tracking system, etc. A warhead attack involves a whole lot more than just the warhead. And hundreds of thousands of people are not coming in every week. Think about that statement for minute. The population of the US is just at 300 million. At the rate you claim (lets say, 200,000 a week--on the low end of your claim) our population would be up 10 million every year. If we take your claim on the high end, and say 800,000 every week, we'd be looking at a population increase of over 41 million a year! Sorry . . . ain't happening. If it were, it would be very, very obvious. Your numbers are wildly exagerrated.\n \n \nIf you look at Bin Ladens history, he knows damn well how to destroy a superpower, becuase we taught him.

The key to doing so is two fold....drain their treasury and show the world they CAN be resisted.

Both Ford and GM ;pst market share last year, depsite theri give away incentive programs, and they expect to loose market share for the forseeable future.\n\n \n The problems in the automotive industry are indicative of the automotive industry, not necessarily the whole economy. There are other industries that are doing fine.\n \n \nLess than 5% of the cost if natural gas is related to the hurricane. \n\n \n Riiiight.

There's no such thing as \"legally, it's constitutional.\" Either it's constitutional or not, regardless of whether it happens to be legal at the time.\n\n \n Not true. The courts decide what is constitutional and what is not. As long as they give it the thumbs up, it is constitutional. \n \n \n \nOne shouldn't need a diploma to be trained. I think this idea that soldiers have to have a certain level of education to be trained is ridiculous. Becoming a soldier IS getting training.\n\n \n Yes, and people who cannot make it through high school, or who have not managed to learn how to read in 18 years are certainly the most trainable guys out there. \n \n \n \nno they aren't--it was only the cost of plane tickets and some training on the front end. They didn't even need their own explosives for 9/11. If Al Queda's main goal was to cost the US money, they wouldn't have attacked the USS Cole or attacked buildings. The WTC was perhaps the highest profile buildings in the country. They wanted to stick it to us and take out as many as they could, pure and simple and they did. Also, remember that the WTC were not the only targets that day--the Capitol and probably the White House were on the list as well. It's not about money. It's about destroying America and wiping us off the face of the planet.\n\n \n \n they sent 13 men to flight school, paid for fairly lavish lifestyles for them for 2 years, and paid travel expenses. The cost of the attack for BL is estimated at $500,000.00. That is nothing if you are the US government and can just screw the public out of more money. For a privately funded non profit entity that is a sizable chunk of change. \n \n The WTC was a high profile target that would motivate the US to action. AQ knrew we could not actually beat them, just spend a fortune trying.\n \n \nWell if the best you can do is attack the messenger rather than the message and immediately resort to character assasination, it's a sure sign you don't know what to do with the content of the article. Regardless of who reported it, the Pentagon report is still there.\n\n \n And per my links and quotes has already been discredited BY THE PENTAGON. The guy is a worthelss slimeball liar. Only an idiot would still buy into his garbage, which has been thoroughly discredited on multiple occasions. Some people you know are lying because their lips move.\n \n \n \nThere HAVE been attempts to make a lot more dead Americans. They've been foiled. I don't think it's a fact that Al Queda has been able to buy nukes. But even if it were, having a nuke alone doesn't do didly squat--it has to be handled, transported, there has to be a launch facility or vehicle, a tracking system, etc. A warhead attack involves a whole lot more than just the warhead. And hundreds of thousands of people are not coming in every week. Think about that statement for minute. The population of the US is just at 300 million. At the rate you claim (lets say, 200,000 a week--on the low end of your claim) our population would be up 10 million every year. If we take your claim on the high end, and say 800,000 every week, we'd be looking at a population increase of over 41 million a year! Sorry . . . ain't happening. If it were, it would be very, very obvious. Your numbers are wildly exagerrated.\n\n \n \n No, a warhead attack can include just the warhead. You can use a minivan as a delivery ystem. They don't have to launch ICBMS. Drive to city, detonate warhead. Your \"tracking system\" are your eyes in such a scenario. This isn't the 1950s, when nukes were radioactive and required special vehicles, etc... Shielding is better. Now you can pass a radiation detector over a nuclear wrhead and it does nto go off reliably. You can carry the things with your bare hands, and most weigh less than 800 LBS. \n \n You are assuming that all those people are staying. According to the US border patrol, up to 90,000 illegals cross the border form mexico each week for short term work (less than 2 months). Up to 15,000 cross ilegally EVERY DAY becuase their full time jobs are here in the US. \n \n Face it, our borders are porous. Have you ever seen the US/mexico border in Arizona or New Mexico? It is a barbed wire fence with nobody patrolling it. \n \n \nAfganistan did not sink the USSR. Anymore than Vietnam sunk the U.S.\n\n \n You need to bone up on your gistory. I would suggest reading kissinger and baker.\n \n \n \nThe problems in the automotive industry are indicative of the automotive industry, not necessarily the whole economy. There are other industries that are doing fine.\n\n \n \n Name them\n \n \n \nRiiiight. You aren't taking into account the fact that refineries were down. The Gulf provides 19.2% of the nations natural gas supply. 88% of the natural gas supply was cut due to the hurricane. When the price shoots up after a natural disaster then settles back down to normal levels afterwards, it's the disaster. Katrina caused around a 50% jump in prices.\n\n \n We are back at \"normal\" levels. Katrina caused a temporary disruption. Output in other parts of the country picked up to take up the slack and it has been a warm winter, reducing demand. In fact, suppliers are cutting back production because we have such a glut they are runnign out of storage capacity.\n \n \n \nOil, yes. Or rather, it's part of the reason. In the real world, a variety of things contribute to the problem.\n\n \n Name them. Demand is at an all time high. Like NG, we have a glut of oil. OPEC countries are no longer able to meet their production quotas because they have run out of places to put the stuff. \n \n \n \n \nDeficits are NOT the end of the world, and certainly not a sole barometer of the economy's health--they are basically a way to buy time. In the 90s the deficit got paid off quicky during a time of economic boom. And we got spoiled during that spike of the 90s. What we're experiencing now is closer to the median level of an economy--the 70s was a time where it got way below the median level.\n\n \n first, a deficit is not something that you \"pay off\". Your deficit is how far you are operating in the red...how much you have to borrow to squeek by, or how much more you are importing than exporting. We did balance the budget in the 90's, which means we did not operate at a deficit. We still had a big, huge, honkin national debt that we paid off les than 1% of as a result of our boom.\n \n Bad news. We are still in the boom from the 90's. When the .com market crashed, the fed decided that rather than letting the US take the hit, they would pump cash into the system in the form of low interest rates and \n decreased fraction reserve requirements. They essentially printed money to make up for the dot com market crash.\n \n Housing started departign from fundamentals in about 1995. This was largely the result of the excess \"wealth\" created by the tech bubble. It continued to build as the the \"wealth\" did. When the tech market crashed, and the fed decided that the best way to deal with it was to completley crash interest rates and create huge amounts of de facto money, that money had to go somewhere, and it went into high end goods. The housing market took off with the influx of cash and cheap money (low interest rates). Housing is not the only thing that threw fundamentals to the wind. The used vehicle market is also running about 40% hotter than history tells us it should. \n \n Even worse than that, when the dot com crash occured, people looked for safer investment,s and they RAN to the real estate markets. XXXXXX swaggering around going \"real estate is a good investment...after all, they are not making it anymore\" and the number went up. IT was not long before the same XXXXXX who built and lost their butts on the dot com bubble started hearing and believeing th same stupid rhetoric when it came to housing \"have to buy buy buy now before it is too late\" and \"it is a new economy, the old models are obsolete...it does not matter what the fundamentals are\".\n \n Now we are in DEEP doo doo. We shipped a HUGE amount of the money from the dot cm crash overseas to pay for hondas and toyotas and chinese toys and electronics. Then we took what was left, plus some, and built a huge shining real estate bubble. It is really not a new bubble, it is just the dot com bubble moved over the real estate market and all grown up.\n \n Don't get me wrong, I would love to see the bublle last. I got my house appraised for insurance purposes last month at it appraised at $2.8 million dollars. Not bad for something that cost me $900 thousands to build in 1999-2000. Do I really think my house is worth that much? YEA, RIGHT. BUT, a lot of Americans DO believe int eh value of their houses, and have mortgaged themselves to the hilt to buy them, or pulled all the equity out of them to buy junk and take vacations.\n \n My point here is that this IS the boom. 80% of our GDP is made up of consumer spending. Our interst rates are so low that we are having to raise them just to combat inflation based on increases in energy costs. Can you imagine what the bust following the boom is going to be like????",

   "An impact? An impact will not set of a nuclear weapon. All modern nukes, including Soviet era nukes, are implosion type warheads. They utilize a perfectly spherical plutonium core with perfectly spherical explosive shell around it. To detonate, all teh explosives go off simultaneously (and pico seconds count here). This compresses the plutonium to critical mass.\n \n The other type of Nuclear weapon fro the cold war era is a gun type assembly. In this unit, two subcritical masses are arranged ad deiffernt ends of a firing tube with high explosives mounted behind one or both. To detonate,t he explosives are activated, which drives the two subcritical masses together at nearly the speed of light. This is how the bomb we dropped on hiroshima worked. It is not a very efficient design so it is no longer used.\n \n \"Quite an impact\" would not set either off. It would diasble them. With the implosion type, it would damage the explosive shell, leading to an asymetrical explosion when the device detonated resulting in a boom from the explosion, but the plutonium would fail to reach critical mass. On the Gun type setup, it would almost certainly damage the firing tube, which would cause mis alingment (whicc must be maintained within less than i thousandth of an inch). Same result. Boom when the explosives go off then no nuclear detonation.\n \n \n Soviet era nukes use a KRV-77 detonation system. Included in the system is a manual detonation control system comrpised of a keypad, an LCD display, and a dual key safety lockout. Detonation is achieved by turning both safety keys, inputting a 17-24 digit code, and either activating an integral timing circuit, an immedite detonation, or through use of a remote detonation trigger (which simply requires that a signal line be closed). The entire system is cast in a seamless titanium case using a process pioneered in the 1980s. The entire thing is actually encased in the titanium, so once it is set no amount of prying can open it up to disarm. Disarming the system requires that 2 sets of pass codes, both 17 digits long, be entered. The first passcode is the arming code.\n \n Do you know ANYHTING about what you babble about, or is your whole world comprised of ignorant misconceptions? There is kind of a \"Nuclear weapons for dummies\" at http://www.fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm \n\n \n I think it is safe to say that both of you are not Nuclear experts. emoticon_xdonno\n It's like you are getting the information from the movie \"The Peacemaker\"",

A satchel charge strapped to the top will take about just about any of them and while there is a good likelihood of residual radiation (due to the fissile material being obliterated), the warhead will NOT detonate.\n \n It is one of those laws of physics things. In order for that warhead to detonate, you MUST cause the fissile material to reach critical mass. It absolutely MUST happen. In order for a sphere of plutonium to reach critical mass, it MUST be equally compressed. The force of the explosion absolutely MUST be equal at all points of the sphere. The ONLY way you can achieve this is with a closely controlled detonation. If ONE cell misfires by more than a pico second, it will not work.\n \n If you don't have a satchel charge, removing the shielding around the core and beating on it with a sledgehammer or other heavy, blunt object is recomended.\n \n Nuclear wapons are incredibly simple to disarm if you don't mid destroying the weapon.

The constitution TRUMPS the courts--until it gets to SCOTUS, who is expected to make the final ruling. But even then SCOTUS can overturn itself. If invasion or privacy as a concept is unconstitutional, then writing it into law is unconstitutional. Just the fact its law alone doesn't make it constitutional.\nVery true. A good example is the Oregon case, decided yesterday, claiming the AG does not have the authority to determine \"medical necessity\" against the will of the people in the state. This comes seven months after five of the six justices voted to overturn the California medical marijuana law on the grounds that the AG does have that authority. But that's a topic for a different thread...",

First, there is the tension between the Government's legitimate national security interests and the protection of privacy interests and First Amendment rights.\n \n Second, there is the tension between two political branches, the Legislative and the Executive. These branches have never quite achieved a meeting of the minds regarding their respective powers of intelligence collecting and its regulation. Historically, Presidents have asserted broad executive authority for conducting intelligence surveillance, thereby resisting attempts by Congress to impose restrictions.\n \n It is well-established by the Supreme Court that Congress has the power to regulate domestic surveillance, however the Court has not yet ruled on the extent to which Congress can act in matters of foreign intelligence gathering. That's why the ACLU and the Center for Constitutional Rights are in the federal courts suing Bush and challenging the NSA's surveillance of U.S. persons without court order. Until the matter is resolved in court, the belief that Bush broke the law remains no more than an opinion, Washington experts notwithstanding. \n \n Considering the importance of the case, I would anticipate that it will eventually reach the Supremes. I would further hope that the High Court rules that the Congressional requirement for judicial oversight of electronic surveillance of U.S. persons is in fact constitutional.

   "If the FISA rules are that relaxed anyway, then it shouldn't matter much that he didn't go by the book.\nSure it matters. If FISA is determined to be constitutional law, then The Executive should abide by the law, at the very least as a matter of principle. More important, in the absence of judicial review and legislative regulation, the checks and balances inherent in our system of government are substantially eroded. Indeed, past abuses of Executive authority is what prompted FISA in the first place.\n \n Regarding FISA, it was the stated intention of Congress to circumscribe any inherent presidential authority so that that FISA would be the exclusive mechanism for the conduct of electronic surveillance, though Congress did acknowledge that the Supreme Court might reach a different conclusion.\n \n Consider the FISA Annual Report to Congress for 2004, the most recent year available. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court received 1758 applications for electronic surveillance and physical search. The Court approved 1754 applications. The Court did not deny, in whole or in part, any application submitted by the Government.\n \n With that in mind, the Bush administration's decision to bypass judicial oversight is reasonable cause for concern.",

I should have posted the question as \"Do you find it interesting that no one with any legal, political, or moral credibility has come forth to demand suspension of the program?\" Neither the ACLU or the CCR qualify.\n \n The court suits will be dismissed, of course. Neither party has the standing to sue because neither party has any evidence they've been harmed. Interestingly, the Wall Street Journal today points out that the case could not proceed even if they could show they were subjects of the eavesdropping, because of something called the Totten doctrine. That was an 1875 case involving a Civil War spy for Lincoln and says a lawsuit can't proceed if it would inevitably lead to the disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters.\n \n \nMy rationale, just to be clear, is that FISA is the law, and no one gets to break the law.\nSometimes you have to push the envelope and bear the consequences, just to make sure justice is done and a bad law gets changed.

Victoria Toensing writes in the WSJ today that \nEven if time were not an issue, any emergency FISA application must still establish the required probable cause within 72 hours of placing the tap. So al Qaeda agent A is captured in Afghanistan and has agent B's number in his cell phone, which is monitored by NSA overseas. Agent B makes two or three calls every day to agent C, who flies to New York. That chain of facts, without further evidence, does not establish probable cause for a court to believe that C is an agent of a foreign power with information about terrorism. Yet. post 9/11, do the critics want NSA to cease monitoring agent C just because he landed on American soil?\n\n The core of our disagreement seems to be which set of standards to apply. You are trying to use the standards of civil law, which are intended to prosecute a guilty party after a crime has been committed. Most of us prefer to use the more relaxed standards that apply during warfare, which are intended to prevent the attack - we would rather be protected than avenged.",

First, none of us are privy to all the facts, since much remains classified, so speculative opinions are not compelling at this stage of discovery.\n \n Second, there is ample case history for the courts to consider in regard to constitutional law as well as statutory law. I have no proficiency in legal matters, but even a layman's view of the arguments presented is sufficient to appreciate the complexities of the lawsuit.\n \n For example, during the congressional discussion of the FISA statutory law, both bodies of Congress acknowledged that the Supreme Court could reach a different conclusion than the legislative intent that FISA be the exclusive mechanism for the conduct of electronic surveillance. If even Congress can recognize that the courts have yet to answer the question of whether FISA allows room for NSA surveillance outside its strictures, then perhaps we should do the same. In addition to FISA, other statutory laws bear significantly on this case.\n \n As if the ambiguities in statutory law aren't enough to make a layman's head spin, there are also questions in constitutional law that the courts must discern regarding separation of powers. Congress' powers in Article I of the Constitution do not expressly include the collection of foreign intelligence. Nor is such collection mentioned in Article II as the President's responsibility. Hence, a tension arises between the two branches, with both asserting their respective power, yet yielding ultimately to the Supreme Court as the final arbiter.\n \n At this point I still think it's premature to assume that the Court's final ruling is a bygone conclusion. Supreme Court rulings can be surprising, evidenced by the decision several months ago on eminent domain.\n \n More relevant are Court decisions involving secrecy issues. For example, Cheney v. District Court, in which the activities of the Energy Task Force remain classified to this day, despite a lower court ruling four years ago that the Government make full disclosure.\n \n Though the framers of the Constitution considered it of upmost importance to limit the power of any single branch of government, the Court's interpretation of 'separation of powers' has sometimes had the effect of placing the executive branch outside of effective congressional or judicial oversight. Supreme Court decisions aren't infallible and are sometimes misguided, despite their binding nature.",

   "Careful of the semantics there. Determining if someone has broken the law is not required for someone to have broken the law. And the lawsuit the ACLU has filed isn't intended to prove guilt, it's just meant to force Bush to follow FISA.\nYou speak in generalities about breaking the law: \"If a person has broken the law then they've broken the law, even if they haven't been caught, or the crime even detected.\" I agree with your statement, as in running a red light is still breaking the law, even if a cop doesn't ticket me. However, I wasn't speaking in general terms but specifically to the case at hand, as shown in the excerpt you quoted: \"On the contrary, a court ruling is required to determine if Bush broke the law.\" I stand by that statement for now, though I acknowledge your broader point that a court verdict is not a requisite for a law to have been broken.\n \n I see you recognize the ACLU court challenge is not about guilt or innocence. Just to be clear, I never mentioned guilt. It was you that introduced the notion of 'guilt'--first in Msg 71: \"I will grant that Bush isn't technically guilty until found so by a jury, but it's still the case that he's broken federal law\", and repeated in Msg 146. \n \n \n \nI think your calls for patience are misplaced. For good or ill, the only way to get things done in politics is to make alot of noise.\nPerhaps what's misplaced is the certainty of your assertion that Bush broke the law. Such readiness to render judgment outside the court venue makes your rhetoric about 'shredding the constitution' ring ever more hollow.\n \n One can argue reasonably that it's frustrating to endure the often glacial pace of court proceedings, but that does not justify ignoring the rules for the administration of law. Your rush to extradjudicial judgment in order \"to get things done\" is, ironically, not unlike the allegations made against Bush himself, who argues that extrajudicial wiretaps are necessary in order 'to get things done' in the global war on terror.\n \n \n \nIt seems clear to me that Bush has broken the law, and that something should be done about it. If people just sit quietly and wait for the wheels of justice to turn, nothing will get done.\nSomething is being done. You're aware of the lawsuits filed in federal court, so to argue that people are sitting quietly is to intentionally misconstrue the developments of the past month since the NYT broke the story on the NSA's warrantless wiretapping. Since the squeaky wheel gets the grease, I think people should scream all they want. My objection is with impatience being used as a pretext to disallowing the parties their right to resolve the dispute in court. I invite you to explain what you would do different.",

   "The court suits will be dismissed, of course. Neither party has the standing to sue because neither party has any evidence they've been harmed.\n'Dismissed, of course'? But of course only time will tell. If your sole basis for presuming dismissal rests with the argument that neither party can show harm, then surely the case will proceed.\n \n Even someone like myself can hurdle that barrier. The only thing required is to have a harmed person sign on to the lawsuit. Yes, I know it's brilliant, but I can't accept a fee. Just consider my work pro bono. No doubt someone like Iyman Faris will do, since he's not only a U.S. citizen but also a named target of the NSA's secret warrantless wiretap program. Yes, I'm sure Iyman will be delighted to accommodate the civil rights attorneys and constitutional scholars who are suing the president.\n \n \n \nInterestingly, the Wall Street Journal today points out that the case could not proceed even if they could show they were subjects of the eavesdropping, because of something called the Totten doctrine. That was an 1875 case involving a Civil War spy for Lincoln and says a lawsuit can't proceed if it would inevitably lead to the disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters.\nThat's not what it says, considering the complete omission of the fact that Totten v. United States concerns breach of contract. The case involved the estate of an individual who performed secret services for Lincoln during the Civil War. The court dismissed the plaintiff's postwar suit for breach of contract. The service stipulated by the contract was a secret service; the information sought was to be obtained clandestinely, and was to be communicated privately; the employment and the service were to be equally concealed. Both employer and agent must have understood that the lips of the other were to be for ever sealed respecting the relation of either to the matter.\n \n Over the years other court rulings affirmed Totten as it applies to breach of contract disputes arising from espionage services performed pursuant to a secret contract. Basically, Totten prevents individuals who have performed espionage services for the United States and have legitimate claims against the Government from even having their claims heard in a U.S. court. Perhaps you can expand on why the WSJ finds this relevant to the current lawsuit.\n \n Here's a link from the DOJ website to a merits of recent case concerning Totten. Note again that the case concerns contract law. The question presented is whether Totten bars a district court from considering respondents' due process and tort claims that the CIA wrongfully refused to keep its alleged promise to provide life-time financial assistance in exchange for alleged espionage services.\n \n Turning again to the lawsuit filed this week, I don't expect dismissal. I welcome the opportunity for the courts to clarify the legality of the NSA surveillance and to rule on the extent that FISA is meant to cover it, prohibit it, or exempt it.",

   "It is the lack of attacks since 9/11 that is the primary indication of their plan. we have not even had a suicide bombing in the US. Israel is a police state, and they have them routinely. We have already agreed that our borders pretty much work on the honor system. Unlike other countries where explosives have to be smuggled or made, in the US you can buy them over the counter, and they are cheap. \n \n So we know they have the means and the opportunity to carry out such an attack, yet they don't. Why not?\n\n \n I think you greatly underestimate and give too little credit to the U.S. preventive measures. I think a more likely case is that it's a lot harder to pull that off in the U.S. than you realize. A lot of the bombings in Israel is by Palestinians who move in and out of Israel fairly freely and easily; that's a much, much different situation than we have here. Whether you realize it or not, airports are a LOT more tight than they were before Sept. 2001, and terrorists from the ME have to fly in or come by ship. And while the US airports are very tight, Mexican airports are, in many ways, even HARDER to get through because they don't give a damn about conducting racial profiling--they do it freely without fear of political fallout. I've seen it with my own eyes.\n \n And no, you can't buy C4 over the counter here. You COULD buy materials to, say, make a fertilizer bomb, but people get suspicious pretty easily when you buy the ingredients together.

As cynical as you are of America, I expect you to disagree, but that's my opinion.\n \n And, AQ people HAVE been captured here plotting to do some pretty nasty things. So it's not like they've been just sitting over there inactive trying to watch our treasury get low.\n \n \nI am not saying this was a bad thing to do, but pointing ot a security alert about a non verifiable threat 4 years ago as proof of anything is just sad.\n\n \n YOU used water supply and the fact it hasn't been hit as proof that AQ isn't out to kill Americans. I showed you proof (that came from MSNBC News) that they WERE out to target our water supply. There's nothing \"non-verifiable\" about it. When you find water supply system plans and blueprints on a AQ operative's computer, it's obvious what's going on, and the FBI did the right thing by making that public so water treatment plants could step up security.",

IMO, Ms. Toensing's argument may be regarded as an opening maneuver to help shape the battlefield and bolster the current public opinion which favors the eavesdropping under more relaxed requirements than the court's definition of probable cause.\n \n FindLaw has an interesting historical discussion of Fourth Amendment issues here, although it is well loaded with the usual obscure (to me) legalisms. The one important point that is missing is any reference to wartime conditions - the citations all seem to deal with domestic and cold war situations, rather than the situation we now face. The evolution of legal thinking from Olmstead in 1928 (which allowed warrantless wiretaps) through the later decisions makes interesting reading, almost like a slide show of the law trying to keep up with technological advances.

It will be interesting to see if the court draws a distinction between subversive activities which are domestically inspired (like Tim McVeigh) and those which are inspired by a wartime enemy (like the Germans in WWII, or the Truong case). Our laws are markedly different in dealing with domestic criminal activities, for which we have a large body of civil and criminal law, and wartime activities against another nation-state, which are governed by treaty and otherwise pretty much left to the discretion of our president. The terrorism situation we now face doesn't fall neatly into either category, and the direction of the court decisions will probably depend on who the justices consider to be the greater potential enemy: the US government, or the terrorists.\n \n BTW, thank you for an interesting and rational discussion.",

Currently, it is far too easy for would-be terrorists and criminals to obtain explosive materials. Although permits are required for interstate purchases of explosives, there are no current uniform national limitations on the purchase of explosives within a single state by a resident of that State. As a result, a patchwork quilt of State regulations covers the intrastate purchase of explosive materials. In some States, anyone can walk into a hardware store and buy plastique explosives or a box of dynamite. No background check is conducted, and no effort is made to check whether the purchaser knows how to properly use this deadly material. In at least 12 States, there are little to no restrictions on the intrastate purchase of explosives. \n\n \n http://www.house.gov/sensenbrenner/pr20021114.html\n \n \n\"This is a high-risk loophole that needs to be closed before explosives get into the wrong hands,\" Kohl said. \"Today, it is easier for a felon to get TNT than it is for a person to get a driver's license or a fishing permit.\" \n\n \n \n In 2002 we passed the \"safe explosives act of 2002\", which theoretically requires explosives purchasers to pass a background check and have a federal permit. In the real world, far too many people have requested permits, so the ATF has ruled that you can go ahead and fill out your permit applicaiton, and take a copy of it with you to the explosives dealer (or fax it)\n and you can still buy your explosives, even though the background check has not been done.",

Does the President really have the authority to ignore any law that he decides infringes on his powers, without review? Seems unlikely to me.\nI found much of the document too weighty to digest. You may have captured the gist of it, though from the president's perspective he's not ignoring the law but in compliance. Also, when you say \"without review,\" be mindful of the fact that when the respective powers of the Congress and the Executive collide, the Supreme Court retains the power to review presidential assertions of authority, if the Court so chooses to involve itself.\n \n In the document that Gonzalez delivered to Congress yesterday, the conclusion is brief:\n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the President-in light of the broad authority to use military force in response to the attacks of September 11th and to prevent further catastrophic attack expressly conferred on the President by the Constitution and confirmed and supplemented by Congress in the AUMF-has legal authority to authorize the NSA to conduct the signal intelligence activities he has described. Those activities are authorized by the Constitution and by statute, and they violate neither FISA nor the Fourth Amendment.\nWhat I find noteworthy here is the president's reliance, in part, on the AUMF, the joint resolution that Congress approved just one week after 9/11.\n \n Clearly, the Constitution intends a careful balance of power to protect against abuses. While the president's authority to wage war is unmistakably clear, the mere mention of the AUMF suggests to me that even the Executive, despite its posturing, recognizes that its powers are in fact limited and balanced by the authority given to Congress. In other words, the will and intent of Congress remains an important factor especially in regard to how the war on terror is conducted on U.S. soil.\n \n With that in mind, the president's reliance on the AUMF deserves special scrutiny, since the resolution followed in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. Due the resolution's timing, one might reasonably presume that the Congressional intent was to authorize the president's use of military force against those specific persons or entities that planned, committed, or aided the attacks on the WTC and the Pentagon. Extrapolating beyond that becomes questionable. Certainly there is no explicit language in the AUMF that addresses the NSA activities Bush authorized. \n \n Since the Constitution's framework is intended to ensure that no one branch of government can operate in a vacuum, and given Congress' concern with encroachment on its powers by the Executive, it is evident the president cannot simply ignore the law and do as he wishes. You have heard it said, 'No one is above the law.' The constitutional function of the courts is to exercise judicial review. Let's hope they wield that power wisely.",

   "Our laws are markedly different in dealing with domestic criminal activities, for which we have a large body of civil and criminal law, and wartime activities against another nation-state, which are governed by treaty and otherwise pretty much left to the discretion of our president. The terrorism situation we now face doesn't fall neatly into either category, and the direction of the court decisions will probably depend on who the justices consider to be the greater potential enemy: the US government, or the terrorists.\nWell said. I appreciate your cogent analysis of the problem, as well as the FindLaw reference on the history of the Fourth Amendment as applicable to electronic surveillance.",

You have heard it said, 'No one is above the law.' The constitutional function of the courts is to exercise judicial review. Let's hope they wield that power wisely.\nI can't argue with that. \n \n Now to the NSA case: Bush has apparently kept the the heads of the Senate and House intelligence committees, and the chief judge of the FISA court, apprised of his activities. None of them, to my knowledge, have claimed he is abusing his authority or otherwise infringing on the rights of innocent citizens. Is that sufficient oversight to prevent abuse, given the sensitive nature of the operations? Or must we delay implementation of the operations while we turn this into a political circus and publicly discuss ways for the terrorists to exploit our security weaknesses?\n \n The last time we had this problem was when Jamie Gorelick's Wall kept the FBI from notifying the CIA of foreigners who wanted to learn how to fly planes, but weren't interested in learning how to land them. Personally I would hate to see that mistake repeated so soon, and I'm willing to give the president the benefit of the doubt until such time as an innocent person can show that he/she has been harmed by the security measures.",

You advocate reversing that status, which I consider repressive government, based on a rationalization to break current law while seeking unachievable personal safety in an unconventional war. It will make for an interesting SCOTUS ruling if grasping at straws is deemed constitutional in the, pardon my cynicism, 'War on Terror'.",
