Since he didn't explicitly advise a coup, and didn't direct the innuendo at any particular individuals, even were someone to do something horrifically stupid, he'd deny any responsibility for contributing to it. Whatever influence he has is indirect.\n \n Like when Ann Coulter parodied abortion providers who refer to abortion as a \"procedure\" by saying that someone should \"perform a procedure with a rifle\" on one of them.

But it's hard to consider constant political commentary nothing more than entertainment. You don't get invited to speak at conservative events or named an honorary member of the GOP's congressional class of '94 just because you're entertaining. It's because you are influencing the views of a whole lot of people.\n \n I mean, when he calls Sotomayor an activist judge or a reverse racist, people listen. Unfortunately, most people who listen to him aren't going to go out and check the facts of her judicial record to see if there's any merit to such charges (there isn't), and Rush sure isn't going to encourage them to do otherwise.\n \n Such \"hyperbole\" may make his show \"interesting,\" and it may help him sell his product.

But of course, posters here don't have millions of listeners.\n \n \nNo reason to call the guy bad for democracy.\n\n \n Except that, again, the man has millions of listeners, whom he actively misinforms.

But the entire problem with niche-marketed infotainment is that you now have entire broadcast and publishing networks that cater to single ideologies. Someone who listens to Limbaugh and Hannity on the radio, watches O'Reilly and Beck on TV, and reads the occasional book by Coulter or Goldberg, but refuses to pay attention to \"mainstream media\" because it's \"biased\" -- and I know people like this -- is not taking information and ideas and opinions from a broad range of sources. From multiple sources? Sure. But not from a wide range.\n \n In fairness, the same could certainly be said of liberals who watch Olbermann and Maddow, visit Huffington Post and Daily Kos online, and watch Michael Moore documentaries, if they don't investigate the other side for themselves. And I know people like this, too.\n \n I think the problem is, as I said, niche-marketing of information, typically masquerading as \"entertainment.\" Does what they say conflict with what you want to hear? Then turn 'em off. Why, after all, should your view be challenged? That attitude, to which all sorts of \"news\" outlets now cater, is the root of the problem.\n \n \nIf you took everything Obama said as gold...\n\n \n For what it's worth, I don't.

And anything that makes some portion of the public less interested in becoming informed is even worse.\nWhat do you propose be done about it? Censor him? \n \n \nTrue. But the entire problem with niche-marketed infotainment is that you now have entire broadcast and publishing networks that cater to single ideologies. Someone who listens to Limbaugh and Hannity on the radio, watches O'Reilly and Beck on TV, and reads the occasional book by Coulter or Goldberg, but refuses to pay attention to \"mainstream media\" because it's \"biased\" -- and I know people like this -- is not taking information and ideas and opinions from a broad range of sources. From multiple sources? Sure. But not from a wide range.\n \n In fairness, the same could certainly be said of liberals who watch Olbermann and Maddow, visit Huffington Post and Daily Kos online, and watch Michael Moore documentaries, if they don't investigate the other side for themselves.
