   "Hey all,\n \n I'm intrigued to see what the general opinion of my future will be, as regards to the afterlife. I am assuming that I am wrong, that God does in fact exist and he assigns people to the afterlife.\n \n I was never baptised, whilst my parents are both roughly Church of England they believed that I should make my own choice as to my religion of choice. I have attended some C of E sermons in my childhood, but decided it wasn't for me and stopped attending. I have also dabbled slightly in Paganism, but also don't find it really for me. I consider my self a very strong atheist. I've committed all of the seven deadly sins, have enjoyed committing them and am unrepentant. In fact I've committed and enjoyed just about every sin that is actually legal, including blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, the sin which apparently can never be forgiven.\n \n That said, I'd hope I am a 'good' person. I try not to harm others, and am truly sorry for hurt I have caused people. I took my job in the belief that I could make a difference for people. I give to charity and do volunteer work.\n \n So am I hellbound? If heaven were ever to become a democracy what would my fate be?",

   "Phunting, I have often times asked myself the same questions as you are asking. I am not all that religious in that I don't believe more than a few words of the Bible and am therefore unable to believe that the Christian version of God exists. Infact I've gone out of my way to prove to people that the Bible has logical and provable flaws in it in order to save them from having to waste their own time being a Christian. I've done none of this in order to hurt people and have infact felt as if I was being helpful. I believe religion is a waste of time and that anyone who spends as much time studying the logic of it as they do going to church they will also realize it makes no good sense at all. Therefore the only conclusion that I can draw is that God either is nothing like what the Bible depicts him as or he doesn't exist.\n \n Assuming I'm also wrong and that God does exist as he does in the Bible we are both toast. God can preach in the Bible all he wants about forgiveness but he is not going to forgive anyone for the mistake of not believing in him during our mortal lives. This concept in itself shows a distinct lack of logic in God and his purpose for man which is pretty sad for an all-knowing and all-powerful creature.\n \n But anyways I'd say that logic is correct and we will all either die and our afterlife will be nothing similar to the Christian one in which case the outcome is unpredictable or there will just be no afterlife at all.",

Nobody comes to the Father but by Me.\" Notice He doesn't say I am one of the ways, He says \"I am The  way.\"\n I do not believe that any human can repent your sins as they too are sinners and in need of God's forgivness. Blasphemy can be forgiven if you mean it and ask Jesus to forgive you. There is no point in saying \"Yeah, sure. God I mean it, I am sorry\" if you don't mean it. He knows how you really feel. The good news is that Jesus died for your sins on the cross and He rose from the dead to take away the devil's most powerful tool - death. If you believe in Jesus and trust and love Him with all of your life, you will recieve eternal life with Him in Heaven, other wise, the outlook might not be so bright. You will, if you choose to reject God, be thrown into the pit of burning sulfur where you will be in pain everyday for all eternity. I don't know about you, but I perfer to be in Heaven, wouldn't you?\n \n I've always been in the Salvation Army so I guess I can't really put myself in your shoes. I could not say that you are going to Hell, because I am not God, I will also be judged by what I have done on my limited time here on Earth.

But outside the city are the perverts and those who practice magic, the immoral and the murderers, those who worship idols and those who are liars both in words and deeds.\" \n \n Anyone can be forgived, including you. I would hate to come to our creator and say \"I'm sorry that I didn't believe in you on Earth.......\" Basically, follow Jesus and love and trust Him with all your heart, mind and soul and you will be in Glory with Him at the end of time (if atheism is wrong). Of course, repent from your sins to the LORD Jesus Christ and enjoy an eternity with God where \"the wolf and the lamb will lie down together\".

In fact I've committed and enjoyed just about every sin that is actually legal, including blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, the sin which apparently can never be forgiven.\n \n That said, I'd hope I am a 'good' person. I try not to harm others, and am truly sorry for hurt I have caused people.  I took my job in the belief that I could make a difference for people. I give to charity and do volunteer work.\n \n Envy, Sloth, Gluttony, Wrath, Pride, Lust, Greed.\n \n All of these I do and enjoy without repentance. If one leads me to do something I regret then I regret it because of the consequence, not the motivation. As far as I am concerned these are all basic human desires that Christianity cleverly makes it's followers feel guilty of. Eternal guilt makes it much easier to impose eternal servitude on.\n \n I quite agree, if you really have done something wrong then you should actually address the issue rather than just alleviating the guilt. If you haven't then why should you feel guilty for something that wasn't wrong just because God says so?\n\n \n You commit all of the seven deadly sins and you enjoy committing them and you are unrepentant. Yet you try not to harm others and you are truly sorry for the hurt you have caused people??? How can you do both?\n \n It seems, despite your protests (against yourself), that you do believe in right and wrong...in the fact that wrong actions can hurt others...and in the idea of repentance.\n \n Where do you get your ideas of right and wrong?\n \n On your statement that one should address the issue rather than just alleviate the guilt of a wrong action...how does this sound as a formula for making right the wrong one has committed? One should acknowledge his sin, make reparation, and amend his way of life so that the wrong is hopefully avoided in the future. Would this be an acceptable approach for you?\n \n \nAgain I ask how fair is God if only those born into Christian society really have a chance for salvation?\n\n The Catholic Church does not teach that \"good\" people of other religions or of no religion cannot be saved. \n \n From the Catechism of the Catholic Church:\n \"Outside the Church there is no salvation\"\n \n 846 \n How are we to understand this affirmation, often repeated by the Church Fathers?335 Re-formulated positively, it means that all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body:\n \n Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.336\n \n 847 \n This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ and his Church:\n \n Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience-those too may achieve eternal salvation.337\n \n 848 \n \"Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who, through no fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel, to that faith without which it is impossible to please him, the Church still has the obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men.\"338",

You are absolutely right that Christianity has at times been an impediment to the advancement of science (even today I probably argue more with conservative, religious people about the role of genes in behavior than with anyone else), but I think it is no accident that modern science was developed and flourished in Christian countries. Christian culture, in contrast to other cultures, has always revered the individual and also emphasized a personal knowledge of eternal things. Consequently, there has been more individualism, more free thinking, more individual creativity, which has led to important events like the Renaissance, the birth of modern science, and to the institutionalization of the rational pursuit of truth (e.g. institutions of higher learning--at least they USED to be about this).",

I'll agree, nowadays Christianity is very charitable and does a lot of good work, but going back a thousand years, you don't have a leg to stand on.\n\n \n Your point is well taken, but let me make a couple points. First, a question. Why is it that most of all these great things you and I both admire--science, technology, emphasis on individual dignity and rights, etc.--why were so many of these things developed in Christendom? What was it about these countries, in contrast to the rest of the world, that was conducive to all these great discoveries? Was it an a random accident? Was it because these countries were white? It is not difficult to make a connection between cerrtain elements of Christianity and a worldview conducive to discovery. The elements of this worldview that come immediately to mind are the inherent value of the individual soul and its beauty; individuals discovering eternal things for themselves, apart from what authorities say; a sense of the orderliness of the universe under one God. I'm sure there are others, but it seems to me there existed with in Christianity, unlike other religions, seeds of what we admire--things admiration for individual creativity. The seeds developed and have come to take forms nowadays that we don't recognize as Chistianity, but the roots are there. I am not arguing Christianity is a necessary belief system in the background of the discoveries we've seen; for example, the Classic Greeks did it with their gods. But I still see a historical connection. There have been different streams of Christianity--you are identifying one stream; I am claiming there is another one, a positive one. \n \n Second point: think of some of these geniuses you might admire: Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Galileo, Newton, Darwin, whoever. By your thinking, we would expect these men to be atheists since Christianity kills discovery, yet were any not Christians? There was a strong stream of Christianity that opposed them, but there was another stream I think they fit into. If Christianity was a powerful stream against which they had to swim, why did the Newtons of the world not appear in China or India, for example, where Christianity was absent? \n \n I could also make the same kind of case for the roots of humanitarian thought, for classical liberal government, etc. but I'm already boring you folks.",

Look him up.He is the man that first came up with the ideas Galileo put forth. \n \n One thing interesting about that time was that Copernicus made the initial discoveries of heliocentric theory. He may have even been a priest but it is certain that he had a close relationship with the Church. He spoke about his theories to the pope and a cardinal encouraged him to publish them. He encountered opposition from Protestant biblicists. Galileo did not come until 70 years later. Why did the Church not persecute Copernicus as they supposedly did Galileo if they had such a hostility to science and felt threatened? Some say it was because Copernicus did not himself proclaim his ideas as dogma before they were proven. Galileo did, however, when there was still much to learn and prove.Galileo had a hostile relationship with the Church but it wasn't all the Church's fault. (Actually Galileo was wrong!)\n \n \nMost of the advances in fields such as astronomy were achieved by people who were outcast by the church. I'd go as far to say that Christianity has done it's best to stand in the way of nearly every single scientific and technological advancement made in the last thousand years.\n \n Can you tell us why you believe this?\n \n \n Hell, for some reason the Catholic church is still against contraception,\n\n For some very good reasons actually.\n \n \nHumanitarianism? Okay, humanitarianism...the Crusades? \n \n The Crusades were a response to Muslim aggression and if they hadn't occurred then you might be living in a Muslim world right now....and the oppression of Islam is not nearly as free as the liberation of Christianity.\n \n \nThe Inquisitions?\n\n Much of what is accepted as history on the Inquisitions is misconstrued.",

   "Phunting - you have not blasphemed the Holy Spirit, then. The only time that you can do that is when you personally know Him and then deny Him.\nI think it depends on your definition of knowing.\n \n This website is quite interesting, and examines the concept in the most rational way I have seen. Yet I draw your attention to:\n \n \n \nSo, if one knows the God of the Bible and the Holy Spirit of the Bible, and curses them, he has probably gone past the place of repentance (Cf. Heb. 6:7, 12:17). \n \n For a person who is worried about having done it, we may say with a fair degree of certainty, \"If you can repent of it, you have not done it.\" One may do many sins ignorantly, but one cannot actually curse or revile the Holy Spirit Himself accidentally and not know it!The very nature of the act and the Person makes it impossible. The difference in this and \"the sin unto death\" (1 John 1:16) is that any sin of which a person will not repent is a sin unto death. Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is a specific sin of which a person will not repent because his heart has become too hardened. The first has to do with the duration -- he will not repent as long as he lives. The second has to do with the nature of the sin itself -- he will not repent because before a person can blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, his heart must become so hard that he does not merely reject God in unbelief (he is simply a fool, Psalm 14:1) but, recognizing the nature of the Holy Spirit, curses or reviles Him. There was never any forgiveness of that either in Old or New Testament.\nNow firstly I have read the bible. I have read the bible a damn site more than most christians I know (present company excluded of course!), I do know the God of the bible and the holy spirit of the bible and yet stand by my beliefs and blasphemies. And secondly I am unrepentant, and am pretty sure I will remain unrepentant until death.\n \n Of course it could be argued that as I have never believed, then I cannot actually know the holy spirit. Possibly, but I have no doubt that should the God of the bible be revealed to me as true I would still reject him.\n \n I realise here I am acting as prosecutor here against my own salvation! But I'm just being honest.",

   "I am not saying that the following story is true or false, but that I was told this in first-person, by the man it happened to, whom I do know very well and that I consider to be a trustworthy individual:\n Harold was about 40 yrs old back then, in the fall of 1989. He always fished in the area known as Mercer Bayou in southern Arkansas since he was a child. He was never afraid to stay all night along the banks at any given time. After years of hearing about a large, hairy human-like creature that prowled the creek bottoms he laughed it off, declaring there was no such thing. One moonlit night in October, as he was running his trotlines, he felt a particularly hard pull on the line. Thinking it was a large catfish, he ran the line quickly to that drop. Once there he tugged on the line trying to pull it out of the water to no avail. As he sat back and got his breath, a large hairy creature burst to the surface and ripped the hook from its shoulder, letting out a blood-curdling scream.\n Harold couldn&#8217;t recall what happened next, but &#8220;found&#8221; himself at the door of a house a few miles away knocking on the door and yelling, not a thread of clothing wet.\n Now, what he saw, or if it really exists, is moot: The fact that he now believes it exists is the point.\n I know this analogy is farfetched, maybe even ridiculous, but the point is that we may hear and never believe, but once we see (either physically or spiritually) we do, or at least begin to believe.\n As far as the article (web page) you referred to, I agree with part of it, but not all of it, especially the part about &#8220;&#8230;God gives up on man.&#8221; Man can turn from God, but God will never turn from man.\n I have not always believed as I do today, but I can say, with confidence, that any person that knows God will love Him, unconditionally.

   "There would be no question of how much more we might know of ourselves if the \"church\" would not have destroyed valuable papers that were considered blasphemous. So many arguments are centered on earth-age, the timeline of man, etc., which I consider pointless, not only because of the evidence of an old earth, but because of what I have gleaned from the Bible. To blatantly say that because this certain scientific article or this particular passage of scripture states an action that took place and therefore it is true, without evidence, is foolishness.\n For example:\n (1) The dinosaur to bird discovery, which was later found to be a hoax. This made some creationists jump up and down like one-eye shortstops, proclaiming that that incident was the basis of all theories; nothing but lies.\n (2) Genesis 5:4 &#8211; &#8220;And there were giants on the earth in those days (the days of Noah), and also afterwards&#8230;&#8221; Those who refute the Bible love to quote this scripture, taking it at face value, stating that God lied when he said he destroyed all &#8220;life&#8221; on earth but Noah and his family.

But I must assert my usual disclaimer as I did last time. The best way to get to heaven is through Christianity (more specifically Catholicism), through Jesus as the Way, the Truth, and the Life. All will go before Jesus for judgment, Christian or not.",

   "I did a google search of top ten inventions of all time, and picked the first I could find, so I didn't hand pick it. The address is: http://library.thinkquest.org/J001725/openingpage.html?tqskip1=1&tqtime=0613\n \n The top ten was: laser, lightbulb/elec., airplane, printing press, automobile, telegraphy, radar, radio, penicillin, and microchip. Now how many of these were invented out in the 90% of the world that is non-European? But maybe the Arabs and Chinese actually discovered these, but the foaming-at-the-mouth Eurocentrics have perpetuated the Big Lie. Or even more likely, these choices have zero validity since the judges are incapable of appreciating anything beyond their own cultures. \n \n Of course other cultures have achievements, but it NEVER makes sense to talk about human beings with the logic that if you don't have a monopoly, you don't have a significant pattern. I random picked 10 inventions claimed to be the greatest, and as far as I can tell, ALL were invented by less than 10% of the world's population. God, I never made a claim about a monopoly but this evidence sounds like one. \n\n \n I think we need to separate advancements in the last 200 years, especially the last 50-100, (when the influence of the church was greatly reduced and the USA became the scientific focal point) from the centuries of advancement previously. Once the world became \"global\" and connected, things get a little hazier IMHO.\n \n \nForgive my smartassiness, but I am very frustrated that much of one's education today is learning a gushing generosity for other cultures, but absolute miserliness towards one's own.\n\n \n I'm by no means a \"foaming-at-the-mouth Eurocentric\" and it would seem to me that this is far more of a personal hot button/issue for you than it ever was a topic of concern for myself, or most people. It's only what you've read into, not what I've presented.\n \n I'm in no way trying to downplay the significance of European advancements, my only point here, was that Chrisitianity didn't have a monopoloy on technology or science. I find advancements and technology from non-European sources, especially from early civilizations through the middle ages, fascinating. I'm not a scholar on it by any means, but I try to learn as much as I can.\n \n Anyhoo, I think I'm done here, unless you can lead us on into new territory.\n \n Waxy",

As for what you will be judged on, I cannot fully be sure, but I would guess by your \"fruits,\" deeds. I would guess that you might also be judged on your pursuit of truth.",

If you read the earlier posts you would see this. The Catholic Church is actually more universal in its ideas of salvation than a lot of Christianity. We even believe non-Christians can get to heaven.\n \n As for Catholics believing that our religion is the best one that is true. But we do not believe it because the pope says so. We believe it because Jesus said so...Matthew 16:18.",

This list is a sample of the population of all inventions (I knew somebody was going to pick at me and call foul when I used the word exhaustive). If inventions were evenly distributed among all populations of the world, this list would have to be unimaginably biased to get a result of almost 90% of inventions in a region of maybe 10% of the world's population.
