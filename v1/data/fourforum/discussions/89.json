Interestingly, a progressive tax system was called for in the communist manifesto, where Marx recommended it as a key element for the existence of a communist state. Just as progressive taxes remain unfair, so are taxes which are design to be regressive.\n \n The most fair form of taxation is a 'head' tax, which is based entirely on the number of people within the household. Unfortunately for most people, this would require a considerable reduction in the social services.",

   "While I see a need for tax revune the progressive tax is unfair. If I make 10x what you do I should pay 10X the taxes, not 50x because I'm successful.\n \n People don't realize just what percentage of ALL tax revenue the top 5% pay (its something like 45% I think - correct me if I'm wrong). \n \n The downside is a flat tax would decimate the economy and the working class. With 45% of the revenue taken down to 5% that missing 40% would bankrupt the government (not that they print their own money and just run in the red). It would mean huge tax increases for the poor that would lead to even more homelessness and hunger.\n \n There are alot of dynamics involved. If you look at the poor they should help themselves first (not having kids they cant afford is a good start). The rich on the other hand have a humane duty to help (and they often don't).\n \n I'm a registered Republican who voted 70% democrat in our last election here in Arizona. I'm a member of the ACLU and am homosexual (and celebate for 8 years). I'm a devout Mormon and am in the process of adopting two wonderful boys who have been my foster children the last two years.\n \n I'm pretty \"middle of the road\".\n \n From my viewpoint while the tax isn't fair it isn't going to change anytime soon. With republicans yelling \"equity\" and democrats screaming \"tax cut for the rich\" people aren't looking at the RESULT. Take Bush's tax cut - I'll make alot of money on it (I own a small company and I own alot of stocks). Yet I feel its not responsible at this time. I'd rather see targeted tax cuts at the lower income WORKING man (like the $300 checks we all got two years ago). Face it, wealthy people know how to save money, its one of the reasons they're wealthy. If they get a huge dividend savings refund from Bush's tax plan they'll do just what I will - stick it in the bank.\n \n Lower income people will spend the money to pay bills, buy necessities, etc. I just feel a general rebate like the one two years ago would be more beneficial. I noticed the plan includes stuff for everyone BUT single people with no kids. This is what really ISN'T fair.\n \n Maybe when the economy finishes its climb THEN we can look at the tax code. Right now though it isn't realistic at all.\n \n AZwebDESIGNER\n \n azwebdesigner@yahoo.com",

   "Single people with no kids only have themselves to support. Do they need the tax cut more than couples with kids? \n \n Speeding up the increase in the child credit and phasing out the marriage penalty is a good thing to do...that'll save a family with two kids $1,000 in taxes with those two cuts alone. \n \n The dividend cut is a great idea. 1/3 of American households own stocks. No taxes on the dividends have many companies issuing dividends or moving them up even higher. The people that get those dividends are mostly senior citizens. Even Greenspan supports that cut!",

   "True Broker, they only have themselves to support. But is it fair that they pay an unfair share?\n \n Do the math a second - they pay the FULL SHARE of their income taxes without deductions. Yes someone who is married or has kids gets extra deductions. Because they DONT pay their share the single people basically make it up.\n \n Having kids is a personal decision and one of my biggest complaints about low income folk is DONT HAVE KIDS YOU CANT AFFORD. Basically that applies to EVERYONE.\n \n If your in favor of a flat tax broker - which you are from the looks of your posts - then you have to favor a TRUE flat tax without deductions right?\n \n If I make $100,000 a year with no kids and someone else makes that same amount with 4 kids we should still pay the same taxes. If they have kids thats their right and obligation. It isn't my responsibility to SUBSIDIZE the federal government because they DONT PAY their share because of all their deductions.\n \n AZwebDESIGNER",

   "So you favor a system that punishes people for working hard and suceeding? I started a small company seven years ago. Today I have 12 employees. I worked countless 15 hour days at the beginning. No weekends, 80 hour weeks every week, no vacations and no frills.\n \n Now I've arrived and I'm reaping the benefits of my hard work (I make good money). Yet I'm not really being rewarded. I've worked hard to suceed so I can be punished?\n \n Progressive tax isn't fair to those of us who have worked hard and sacrificed to make our lives better. It's not right to punish people for success. People spend years in college racking up tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt so they can get an entry level job somewhere. They work hard and sacrifice weekends, family and vacations to achieve and get ahead.\n \n Hopefully it all pays off with promotions and advancement and MORE MONEY. Then they can enjoy the benefits of all their labors. But only if they are taxed fairly.\n \n I've indicated the progressive tax is unfair and I've also stated its necessary AT THIS TIME with the economy like it is. In the future though when the economy turns around I would be in favor of a FAIR system.\n \n If I make 10x the money you do I pay 10x the taxes.\n \n Sounds fair huh?\n \n AZwebDESIGNER",
