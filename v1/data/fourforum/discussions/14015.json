   "This question has been asked since the Chilean Earth Quake so here's what NASA says happened after investigating the phenomenon. Here's an excerpt from the link: \n March 11, 2010: Pictures of widespread devastation leave no doubt: Last month's 8.8 magnitude earthquake in coastal Chile was extremely strong. Indeed, say NASA scientists, it might have shifted the axis of Earth itself.\n \n \"According to our calculations, the quake moved Earth's figure axis by about 3 inches (8 cm),\" says geophysicist Richard Gross of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n \n Right: A USGS map of the Chilean quake. [more] http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2010/images/figureaxis/map1.jpg \n \n If the Earth tilted over 3 inches, you probably think you would have noticed. But that's not how the \"figure axis\" works. \"The figure axis defines not how Earth is tilted, but rather how it is balanced,\" says Gross.\n \n Consider the following:\n \n Earth is not a perfect sphere. Continents and oceans are distributed unevenly around the planet. There's more land in the north, more water in the south, a great ocean in the west, and so on. As a result of these asymmetries, Earth slowly wobbles as it spins. The figure axis is Earth's axis of mass balance, and the spin axis wobbles around it.\n \n \"The Chilean quake shifted enough material to change the mass balance of our entire planet,\" Gross says.\n \n A shifting figure axis is nothing new. On its own, the figure axis moves about 10 centimeters per year as a result of \"Ice Age rebound.\" After the last great glacial period some 11,000 years ago, many heavy ice sheets disappeared. This unloaded the crust and mantle of the Earth, allowing the planet to relax or \"rebound\" back into a more spherical shape. The rebounding process is still underway and so the figure axis naturally moves.\n On Feb. 27, 2010, the Chilean quake may have moved the figure axis as much in a matter of minutes as it normally moves in a whole year. It was a truly seismic shift-no pun intended.\n \n So far, however, it's all calculation and speculation. \"We haven't actually measured the shift,\" says Gross. \"But I intend to give it a try.\"\n \n The key is GPS1. \"Using a global network of GPS receivers, we can monitor the rotation of Earth with high precision,\" he says. \"Changes in Earth's spin and the orientation of Earth's axes affect [the phase and timing of] signals we get from the satellites in Earth orbit.\"\n \n GPS is already used to monitor seasonal changes in Earth's spin. It turns out that tides, winds, ocean currents, and circulation patterns in Earth's molten core modulate Earth's rotation on a regular basis. For instance, a typical day in January is about 1 millisecond longer than a typical day in June. The roughly six-month variation is driven mainly by seasonal winds; there are also changes on time scales of weeks, years, decades and centuries.\n NASA - Did the Chilean Quake Shift Earth's Axis?",
