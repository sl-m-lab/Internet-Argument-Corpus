He is a worry for the entire international community,\" he added. 'Outrageous' Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, quoted by AFP agency, described the remarks as \"an outrageous gaffe, which I want to repudiate in the sharpest manner\". White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the Iranian leader's comments \"further underscore our concerns about the regime\". \"And it's all the more reason why it's so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons,\" he said. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said: \"I condemn [the comments] unreservedly. They have no place in civilised political debate.\" Mr Ahmadinejad's stance was also condemned by French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who were meeting in Berlin.

   "Iran's goal is to destroy Israel.\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4510922.stm\n\n \n This is irrelevant.\n \n \n \nDo they have just the right to develop nuclear power plants or do they have the right to develop nuclear bombs as well?\n\n \n They have the right to develop nuclear power, not nuclear weapons. That is the tricky part. Whent he NPT was signed, the two were easily discernable. Now they are not. \n \n \n \nI think it has been shown they are not really into peace...especially with Israel. \n\n \n The question is not whether they are into peace or not, the question is whether their nuke program is peaceful or not. How many countries has Iran invaded in the last 5 years? How about america? Whether a country is into peace or not is irrelevant. nearly 6 years ago Iran said they wanted to develop a nuclear power infrastructure due to peak oil concerns. The US pitched a hissy fit, so Iran went underground with their program (that and fear that the israelis wouldl bomb their facilities like they have in every other Arab nation that has tried to put up a nuclear power program...including the one in Iraq where an IAEA inspector was literally killed in the attack). \n \n \n...and they are rejecting inspections, just as Saddam did.\n \n No. What is reasonable is for Iran to allow inspectors to verify their construction goals by allowing inspections by a disinterested party. \n\n \n Currently there are no IAEA inspectors in Iran, though that is the IAEAs choice, not Irans. Iran recently passed a resolution that if they are referred tot he security council, they will kick the inspectors out. The IAEA apparently does not feel they need inspectors on site right now becuase they have Irans program under constant video surveilance. \n \n You may remember a little over a year ago there as something of a scandal because the head of the IAEA declared that they (the IAEA) had found no evidence that Iran was trying ot weaponize their program. \n \n http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/sanction/iran/2005/0216noarms.htm\n \n \nThe head of the U.N. agency responsible for investigating Iran's nuclear program said Tuesday that there had been no discoveries in the last six months to substantiate claims that the Islamic state is secretly working toward building a nuclear bomb. In a wide-ranging interview with four U.S. newspapers, Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency also described White House policies on Iran and North Korea as inconsistent. Without greater U.S. participation in diplomacy, ElBaradei said, confrontation could increase. \"North Korea and Iran are still the two 800-pound gorillas in the room and not much is happening,\" he said in his office overlooking Vienna\n\n \n This was the same guy who said that Bush was full of it regarding Iraqs WMDs. Teh bush administrations response to his declaration about Iran was to try to replace him.\n \n \nHis caution on Iran has led some Bush administration officials to suggest he is more interested in blocking U.S. policy than in stopping Iran. The White House wants him to step down when he finishes his second term this summer and has tried to find a candidate willing to challenge him. But a majority of countries on the IAEA board consider ElBaradei's leadership on Iran helpful and want him to take a third term. Despite the tensions with Washington, ElBaradei said professional relations with U.S. officials have been good. \"I would hope we would continue to cooperate no matter what,\" he said. ElBaradei was joined in the interview by top aides from the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada. \n\n \n \nDuring a two-year investigation, IAEA inspectors uncovered an 18-year-old nuclear program in Iran and chastised the country for failing to report the work and disclose its suppliers to the agency, as required under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Bush administration contends the program is designed to build nuclear weapons, but Iran says the goal is nuclear energy that will someday substitute for its oil and gas reserves. ElBaradei's last report on the status of the investigation in November said that Iran's cooperation had improved steadily and that most outstanding issues had been resolved. The investigation is continuing, and IAEA inspectors are awaiting results from samples taken recently at an Iranian military facility.\n\n \n Heres another one:\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/11/AR2005051102121_pf.html\n \n \nIran's main nuclear site was exposed by a dissident group in 2002, setting off an investigation now in its third year. The U.N. inspectors have said they have no proof that Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons. But the Bush administration has not accepted those findings.\n\n \n \n We are playing the same game we played with IRaq. The inspectors inspect and then come back and say \"there is nothing there\". Then the Us says \"look harder\". The inspectors keep chasing ghosts, never find anything, and the US keeps insisting it is there. Eventually, Iran will get tired of playing the game, just like Iraq did, and boot the inspectors out fo the country. \n \n Our latest \"evidence\" of their diaboliocal plot is the fact that somebody in the Iran nuclear agency has plans for a P2 centrifuge. Bad news. I have plans for a P2 centrifuge. My former company did a lot of contract work for JPL. They had a P2 centrifuge that they wanted modified and we made the parts. So what? P2 centrifuges are commercial items. You can linterally buy one over the phone with a credit card (use your american express....they cost about $10 million). The difference between a P1 centrifuge and a P2 centrifuge is that the P1 has an aluminum hub, while the P2 has a special steel hub so it can spin at higher speeds. In fact, you can cast a titanium hub for the P1 and rework the drive and you can sin it just as fast a a P2.\n \n My point is, the fact that somebody had plans for a P2 centrifuge means nothing at all, BUT, I fully expect to see George Bush standing on some stage at some point trying to justify an attack on IRan based on the fact that somebody there had plans for a commercially available, easily obtainable centrifuge. \n \n This is more BS, smoke, and mirrors, just like the Iraqi WMD threat. There is no proof that Iran is building a weapon, or evwen trying to build a weapon. teh inspectors on the ground certainly cannot find any. the us will keep spinning it to the ignorant American voters until they have everybody convinced that Iran is th biggest threat the Us has ever seen, then we will loose a war.",

It was not that long ago that Condi was in China giving speaches abotu how important it was that China not threaten the balance of power in Asia. To translate...She was saying that we want to ensure that the US and its allies always have military superiority int he region. I think if Iw as running the chinese government I would have had her tossed in the ocean and told her \"screw you, we will control what goes on in our back yard\".\n \n Just look at the nuclear talks with N Korea. All China has to do to get rid of those nukes is say \"get rid fo the nukes\" and it would be done. They won't do it, though. Can you say \"passive agressive\"?",

If the Germans had sent a strongly worded letter, or called a mid level bureaucrat to the table on this, there would be no story and no thread. That is not what has happened, though.

I would imagine that the mood at the white house is depressed this morning. I don't think there is any question that Bush has been chomping at the bit to go after Iran. That puts Russia, Pakistan, Syria, and Iraq in firm support of Iran on this one. Even if Russia and Pakistan refused to take an active role, instead just supplying equipment and support, the military option is really and truly off the table. Even if we managed a strike on their nuclear facilities, we could not do so without retaliation, and with the equipment and support that Russia and Pakistan can provide, that retaliation would be no laughing matter.",

You're amazement over the suggested admonishment seemed to be driven by the fact that it was precipitated by an offensive comment, from which I inferred that you think the Germans are being too sensitive.

   "Has anyone else detected a distinct lack of world support for the US position on Iran? Or Israel? Regardless of any issue? Even the UK's Blair seems to have lost his enthusiasm for bolstering US policy.\n\n \n Fallout from the Iraq fiasco. Only Americans, who never pay attention to anything, have apparently missed the fact that we are playing the same game with Iran that we did with Iraq regarding weapons inspections. The EU seems to be focusing on enrichment out of fear of future weapons use. Only the Us is trying to claim authoritatively that Iran is working on a weapons program right now. \n \n Additionally, it seems that the Iraq war has shown that the all powerful US military may not be as all powerful as was previously believed. Iraq seems to be about all we can handle. The spectre of an Iranian invasion is more than anybody wants to bite off, especially with Russian and Pakistani support for the Iranians.\n \n The time of the west ruling the world is coming to an end. Countries like Pakistan, India, and China are no longer content to be told what they can and can not have and what they can and cannot do in their own countries or for their own defense. They recognize that hwen US politicians speak of things like \"preserving the balance of power\" what they mean is \"continuing to ensure that the west always rules the world\". To non western nations, this is not anything to strive for.",
