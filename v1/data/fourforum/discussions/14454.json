   "As of February 2010 the United States Federal government was $12.4 trillion in debt.\n \n http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article1571.html\n \n By July 2007 State and local governments owed $2 trillion (and this would be around $5 trillion by now if state and local debt has increased by the same percentage as the federal debt has from July 2007 to now).\n \n Government in America at each level is allowed to rack up financial liabilities that a corporation is bound by law to count as current debt, but which state, local and federal governments don't count yet. Including what the federal government would owe in the future for things like Social Security and government pensions would put the federal debt somewhere around $60 trillion by July 2007. At the same time the average American household owed $112,043 in mortgage, credit card, auto loans and other consumer debt obligations.\n \n The American economy is hogtied by debt. Our economy cannot get out of recession, let alone grow, as long as Americans carry their current debt load. Other than declaring bankruptcy and allowing our creditors to seize our physical assets, the quickest way to reduce our debt is to inflate the money supply. Printing money would mean more money in circulation so more money would be available to pay off debt.\n \n But, paying off debts with inflated money means that debtors will not pay back as much as they borrowed since the money that was borrowed could buy more than the money that is paid back can because of inflation. Loaning a dollar that could buy an 8 ounce cup of coffee and getting paid a dollar that could only buy a 7 ounce cup of coffee means that the lender has lost money.\n \n Having lenders take a hit wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing since lenders that have offered easy credit for the past thirty years deserve some of the blame for the economic bubble that burst in 2008. Both lenders and borrowers were equally greedy. They fed off of each other and they took equal advantage of each other.\n \n However, I still have vivid memories of the Carter Administration. What had been an annual inflation rate averaging 6-8% or so under Nixon and Ford became a monthly inflation rate that was often measured in double-digits under Carter. Carter's economic fiasco was based on printing money (as opposed to the Reagan/Bush/Clinton/Bush/Obama economic fiasco that is based on borrowing). I fear inflation more than I fear any other disaster, natural or manmade short of a WMD attack. Intentionally inflating the money supply to pay off our debt could also increase consumer prices to the point that the economy would be just as bad off.\n \n As a conservative I support sound money, but more and more I worry about what our debt will do to our future. We are in a hard place and it will likely get harder no matter what we do or don't do. But if our future is to be destroyed, perhaps an inflationary money supply, that we may be able to recover from in time, will be better than being foreclosed on by the likes of the Red Chinese.\n \n Some options:\n \n 1. Establish a currency ratio by law so that the amount of physical money in circulation is based on the amount of gold and silver owned by the U.S. government, state and local governments, banks and private individuals (that is deposited in banks). This ratio would be set in a way to increase the amount of physical money in circulation, but money would not be redeemable in gold or silver. The government would not restrict the trading of gold and silver so investors would be allowed to bring in gold and silver from overseas and thus add to the money supply by having it converted into currency. Part of the gold and silver in the country would be held in reserve and would not be converted to circulating money except to insure bank accounts as the FDIC and FSLIC now do when banks and S&Ls go belly up.\n \n 2. Create a 5% federal income tax bracket for people who earn more than the federal poverty level income but don't earn enough to be subject to the existing lowest federal income tax bracket- spreading the federal tax burden more evenly would make people that don't have to pay for federal spending right now less likely to support deficit spending in the future while siphoning off some of the inflated money so it couldn't fuel consumer spending and consumer prices. In the long run I would support an amendment to the Constitution that would expressly regulate the government's power to tax (at the federal, state and local levels). I would exempt personal income from taxation, but I would tax wages and salaries with large personal exemptions (tax actors and ball players rather than teachers and waitresses). With the Amendment this 5% income tax bracket would become a 5% wage/salary bracket.\n \n 3. Impose a tax on households that own more than one automobile with a tax rate determined by the number of autos that the household owns and eliminate federal money for any state that does not raise its legal driving age to 18- reducing mobility will reduce consumer activity and thus lower consumer prices by restricting consumer demand.\n \n 4. Impose a surtax whenever both members of a married or cohabitating couple have an income (or wage/salary) tax liability and base this surtax on the number of children the couple has in their household in order to encourage single income households so we can reduce disposable income that would fuel demand for consumer goods, thus keeping consumer prices in check.\n \n 5. Impose a federal tax on consumer and corporate debt- to encourage people to use the inflated money supply to pay off their debts rather than fuel consumer spending.\n \n 6. Repudiate all international trade agreements and impose tariffs sufficient enough to re-establish America's manufacturing economy- this will help reduce our indebtedness to foreign countries (mainly the Red Chinese) while creating relatively high-paying jobs at home.\n \n 7. Reduce non-Social Security, non-national defense and non-Medicare welfare payments in order to reduce federal spending and reduce dependency on the federal government so more people become economic producers rather than just consumers.\n \n 8. Impose a tax on daycare provided to any child who lives in a two-income household- making it more expensive to have a second income will reduce incomes that can fuel non-essential consumer spending.\n \n 9. Require sufficient collateral for all loans and mortgages- at lest something over 100% of the amount borrowed so if the economy tanks creditors will still have a chance of selling the collateral and making back most of what they had loaned out.\n \n 10. Put limits on how often a piece of real estate can be mortgaged and how often a share of corporate stock can be sold to reduce speculation.\n \n 11. Use newly-printed money to fund public works programs (roads, bridges, schools etcetera) in order to create jobs rather than simply having the Federal Reserve distribute the money to commercial banks.\n \n 12. Implement item #10 by creating public-private partnerships in order to give Americans some reasonably safe investment options. Personally I would like to see 1/2 of the lanes in the federal interstate highway system turned over to a high speed railroad company and then expand the rail network to service every U.S. community that has 5,000 or more people. I also want to abolish the Federal Reserve and charter a new national bank patterned after the First and Second National Banks of the U.S.\n \n 13. Legally create economic triggers, such as food or energy prices, that would require the government to increase the amount of money in circulation (by changing the currency ratio from #1) to make sure that enough inflated currency is circulated to reduce debt while reducing the amount of money in circulation when necessary to prevent hyper-inflation such as what Weimar Germany saw in the early 1920s.\n \n 14. Once debt loads have been reduced by a pre-determined amount the government should replace the inflated currency with a new currency to reduce inflation and allow the economy to expand once again in real terms with some level of stability.\n \n 15. Replace the federal food stamp program with coupons that could only be used to buy specific foods to insure that food stamp recipients buy the right foods to maintain a nutritious diet. This way the availability of food stamps would not promote higher prices for all consumers.",

   "Too many ideas to address specifically, so I'll just comment generally.\n\n \n If you are not going to even read what I propose, how are you in any position to criticize what I propose? I address some of your concerns in my proposal.\n \n \nThe printing presses in the US are already running amok, there are several reasons why this doesn't show up in headline inflation rates;\n\n \n Not true. The Federal Reserve does inflate the money supply, but not the M1 money supply. The government is not printing money the way it did in the 1970s. But the FED does increase the money supply by creating demand deposits: A bank or other financial institution will sell corporate bonds to the FED. But the FED does not have enough cash on hand to pay for the bonds. So instead the FED sets up a bank account for the bond seller that the bond seller can write checks against and thereby transfer \"money\" to other bank accounts that checks can be written against. And then the bond seller buys back its bonds by doing the same thing- collecting \"money\" from bank accounts and transferring it to its account with the FED. No cash or coin or gold or silver actually changes hands. This money is represented only by accounting records and people's faith in the banking industry. This practice should stop because it can have lead to disastrous inflation.\n \n \n1) Domestic inflation is offset by rising productivity in BRIC countries, but primarily in China. From memory China's industrial production is still rising by about 15% per year. So while the supply of money goes up, so does the supply of goods. This is the single biggest thing masking the inflation already going on. If it were not for monetary inflation, consumers would be much better off with much lower prices. If the BRIC countries rising productivity slows, you will see quite dramatic consumer price inflation.\n\n \n I am not familiar with the term BRIC. However, the U.S. government's official inflation rate is not the real inflation rate mainly because the government does not include energy and food prices in its official calculation of inflation. The government has a financial interest in having a low official inflation rate because Social Security checks (and I think paychecks for federal employees) are based on the official inflation rate.\n \n Furthermore, China only produces economic goods in response to U.S. consumer demand. If Americans were to stop buying Chinese imports, China's economy would falter and the Chinese would no longer be able to buy U.S. debt. Of course American consumers are flat broke because American consumers are also American labor and American labor no longer produces much of anything. So American consumers purchase Chinese goods with IOUs, and the Chinese then use these IOUs to buy U.S. government bonds. The end result is an economy based almost totally on debt. The minute some creditor says they will no longer loan money the entire economy will collapse- just as it did in 1929. Before the Crash of '29 most of the money in the economy was debt- essentially IOUs that were traded like cash. When the credit dried up the economy collapsed and cash money became very scarce. The end of credit meant that the economy shrank down to a size that better represented the amount of cash and coin that actually existed.\n \n \n2) Inflation first has impact where the new money enters the economy. If the government printed money and handed it out to crack buyers, the price of crack would go up. Historically the money entered the real estate and stockmarkets via the banks, so it mostly hit house and stock prices until the crash. As for where its going now, it's hard to say, but that's the next bubble. Probably treasury bonds, since I can't see why any person who got their money from earnings or investment would possibly buy them. You tell me.\n\n \n First of all I haven't said one word about giving money to crack buyers. And you will note that I propose putting the new money in circulation by using it to pay for public works projects (which we need anyway). Increasing demand for roads and bridges and school buildings and nationwide high speed railroad will increase demand for construction materials- that can be produced in the U.S. This will create jobs in the U.S. rather than other countries. The extra money in circulation will be represented by tangible things, things that have economic value over and above the money used to pay for them.\n \n \nIf you've followed the above, you'll probably agree that jacking up tariffs is a horrendously bad idea.\n\n \n Jacking up tariffs is exactly what we need to do to get out of debt to China and re-establish this country's manufacturing economy.",

Supposedly unemployment benefits are based on how much a worker has paid.

Very few married women with young children have to work this day and age just to make ends meet. They work to buy luxuries. My mother once had a co-worker who husband made a good living as a landscaper and his parents were paying for their house. They had 2 children. But the woman worked so she could feed Junior name-brand deli lunchmeat ($8 a pound) and put him in private schools (when she made her learning disabled daughter go to public school). So most Americans do have a history of spending money improperly.\n \n \nWho has collateral worth more than their house other than their house?\n\n \n Ever heard of saving up for a down payment when you want to buy something you have to go into debt for? \n \n \nThis isn't a terrible idea but I would modify it to have high taxes on income for selling a non permanent residential home or selling your primary home within 3-5 years.\n\n \n Selling real estate after 3-5 years would mean investment income rather than income from speculation.

I am not aiming for Weimar Germany.\n \n \nNot sure this would do anything\n\n \n I only want short-term inflation for the sake of paying off debt. I don't want the economy to become permanently dependent on inflation.

I was referring to the time when the food stamp program was originally implemented. The federal government used to buy surplus food (things like milk and cheese and flour) and then stockpile some of it for fallout shelters while giving the rest away to the poor who could not afford to go to a grocery store. But then the government started giving away food stamps so more people could go to grocery stores and this extra demand raised consumer prices for everybody else.\n \n \nSo 5 new taxes on an already complicated tax system plus tariffs.\n\n \n Since when is life not complicated? \n \n \nI agree more taxes are need to balance the budget but you gotta reduce federal spending as well.\n\n \n I addressed this issue in my original post. \n \n \nNow if you are going to raise taxes you are better off simplifying the tax system.\n\n \n Again, the purpose of the new taxes is not always to raise revenue.",

   "M1 is only for the paper currency and coin that has been produced by the federal government. \n\n \n You are thinking of the M0. The M1 also includes electronic bank deposits e.g. in checking accounts and in on-demand savings accounts, I think that's where the confusion is. There is no M that estimates purely bank deposits, all Ms estimate coins and notes and most also additional things. Your point that the fed is not \"literally\" printing money and \"only\" creating it electronically is irrelevant, it makes absolutely no difference. The fact is that it is \"inflating\", whether by coinage or by electronic creation, so the idea that the US should start \"inflating\" is hardly a novel idea, it's already doing it, enormously.\n \n The WPI and CPI don't \"measure\" inflation, they measure the WPI and CPI. They do not measure the change in cost of consumer goods, in fact such a thing cannot be measured.

   "You are thinking of the M0. The M1 also includes electronic bank deposits e.g. in checking accounts and in on-demand savings accounts, I think that's where the confusion is.\n\n \n Macroeconomics, 16th edition by McConnel and Brue copyright 2005 by McGraw Hill does not mention M0, but it includes currency, coin and bank deposits with M1. The FED apparently does not compile data for any M0, and its definition of M1 is close to McConnell's FRB: H.6 Release--Money Stock and Debt Measures--July 15, 2010.\n \n I based my definition of M1 on what I remember from my high school economics course from 1984. However, (Money supply - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia) the definitions of the various money supplies vary from country to country so there is no standard. The FED's M1 is the closest I can get to a measure of physical money in circulation based on the data I can readily find.\n \n \nThere is no M that estimates purely bank deposits,\n\n \n I never said there was.\n \n \nYour point that the fed is not \"literally\" printing money and \"only\" creating it electronically is irrelevant, it makes absolutely no difference. \n\n \n It does make a difference in light of what I am proposing.\n \n \nThe fact is that it is \"inflating\", whether by coinage or by electronic creation, so the idea that the US should start \"inflating\" is hardly a novel idea, it's already doing it, enormously.\n\n \n The FED creates money by allowing banks and other financial institution to create debt. Without something physical that can be exchanged for goods and services money has no value. Trading one IOU for another IOU means that no one ever really expects either IOU to be paid off- there isn't enough money in circulation to pay off all of the public and private debt in this country. Inflating bank account records is not the same thing as inflating the money supply. IOUs are not legal tender.\n \n \nThe WPI and CPI don't \"measure\" inflation, they measure the WPI and CPI.\n\n \n Do you even know what inflation is? McConnel: \"Consumer Price Index An index that measures the prices of a fixed 'market basket' of some 300 goods and services bought by a 'typical' consumer\"; Inflation \"A rise in the general level of prices in an economy\"; Page 141, \"The main measure of inflation in the United States is the Consumer Price Index (CPI)...\".\n \n \nThey do not measure the change in cost of consumer goods, in fact such a thing cannot be measured.\n\n \n Since when?\n \n \nThe cost of consumer goods is affected by changes in consumer demand,\n\n \n As well as a change in the supply of raw materials and labor.\n \n \nYour ignorant scheme is to shut out the rest of the world with tariffs, and to simultaneously crank up the printing presses.\n\n \n The federal government is at least $12,000,000,000,000 in debt. Your share of this debt is around $40,000. So when do you intend to pay your part?

From 2006: \n Young Americans a giant influence on buying decisions: study - MarketWatch \"Younger Americans, those born from 1982 to 2000, have purchasing power of more than $200 billion a year, influencing as much as half of all spending in the economy, a new study shows.\" \n \n \nHow is killing consumer demand going to combat inflation again?\n\n \n You don't understand the laws of supply and demand?

Printing money will cause inflation so you must regulate consumer behavior to counter the inflationary effects of the extra money. I am aiming for a balance- expand the money supply enough to make it easier to pay off debt, but then regulate consumer behavior enough to keep that extra money from causing hyper-inflation.\n \n \nNo, I mean the encouraging single tax payers part. You want to encourage that to reduce disposable income. I'm not sure how that relates.\n\n \n The more you tax something the less of that something you will have. If most of a household's second income is taken in taxes, people would be less willing to have that second income.\n \n \nTrue, but that is an extreme. Clearly borrowing money is vital to economic growth.\n\n \n Then how much money should you borrow for the sake of being prosperous? What is the break-even point?\n \n \nhttp://www.gao.gov/financial/fy2009/09stmt.pdf\n\n \n Based on the data for 2009 the federal government spent $3434.7 billion. Reserving what is spent on Social Security, the Department of defense, Department of Homeland Security and the Railroad retirement board leaves $1919.8 billion in other departments and programs that can be cut out of the budget- or diverted towards paying the federal debt. So over 55% of the federal budget for 2009 goes more-or-less for non-essential functions. \n \n \nSo? She provided work for someone which is good, the name brand deli people are happy and have jobs, the private school teachers have jobs. I don't see the problem there.\n\n \n Her spending habits are part and parcel of why this country is in such an economic mess. She spends money without getting anything of any real value in return (Junior will always get hungry again when he is overweight already and his private school is an unaccredited Christian academy). If you are going to spend money just for the sake of creating jobs, isn't it better to create high-paying manufacturing or construction jobs rather than minimum wage retail clerk jobs?\n \n \nThere would be no down payment...you'd have to pay 100% right away according to you.\n\n \n Where and how did I say this? The more someone puts down on a house or car the less they have to borrow to buy it. Make a big enough down payment and the about of the debt will be less than the market value of whatever you are buying is. That way, if you default on the debt the creditor can sell what you went into debt to buy and make back the cost of the debt. The way it is now, many homeowners owe more in mortgage than their home is worth. And for a while many home loan companies were making 2nd mortgages worth more than the market value of the property. \n \n \nBut it also encourages increased pricing.\n\n \n Not as much as you'd get by selling the property after only a few months. The more mortgage payments someone knows they will have to make before they can sell a piece of property, then less likely they will want to speculate by buying property. This would reduce artificial demand- nobody could buy a house thinking they can sell it right away and make a profit. People would buy houses only when they want a long-term investment or a place to live.\n \n [quote]Because the price of a ticket would be prohibitive to most people and they would need a car anyway to get to work or the train station.\n \n How do you know what the price of a ticket would be?\n \n \nPersonally, I love trains and ride them often but they aren't cost effective.\n\n \n Mainly because the government subsidizes the personal automobile by building road.\n \n \nAlmost all your proposals here are giving the government the power to manipulate the value of money for political purposes.\n\n \n No, I am proposing that we give the government the power to regulate the value of money (really a power that Congress already has as per the U.S. Constitution), for economic reasons. I am proposing temporary measures to confront an extraordinary economic situation. \n \n \nWhy do you care what they eat?\n\n \n Ever heard of obesity? The #1 cause of death in the U.S. apart from old age and accident is heart disease, and by and large heart disease is a lifestyle disease caused in part by obesity. If we are going to make people dependent on the government for food, taxpayers are entitled to see to it that people eat a nutritious diet so they end up being a burden on the healthcare industry.\n \n \nDocumentation?\n\n \n Econ 101 the laws of supply and demand. You've obviously never waited in line at the grocery store being barely able to afford hamburger while people ahead of you are using food stamps to buy steak.\n \n \nwell, maybe it should be.\n\n \n My proposal would generate new revenue, but mainly in the form of printed money, although the tax on private debt could potentially generate large amounts of revenue. Using rough estimates we have 120 million households that have an average of $100,000 in debt for a total of $1.3 trillion in consumer debt. A yearly tax of only 2% a year on this debt would generate $240 billion. A tax of 10% on this debt would give $1.2 trillion in revenue.",

It was once a fundamental law of economics that you could not have high consumer prices and high unemployment at the same time. An economic recession would naturally reduce consumer demand which would lower consumer prices so you'd have a low inflation rate or even deflation (as we had during the Great Depression). But by the 1960s it was known that you could have both high consumer prices and high unemployment, so British politician Lain Macleod coined the term stagflation.\n \n In 1976 the Democrats came up with a measure of stagflation that they called the misery index, the sum of the inflation rate and the unemployment rate. The Democrats used the misery index successfully in Jimmy Carter's election campaign against incumbent Gerald Ford, whose average misery index was 14.93. But by the time Jimmy Carter was thrown out of the White House by Ronald Reagan the average misery index was 20.27.\n \n Since so much consumer spending over the past 30 years has been based on debt, the economy cannot expand until this debt is gone.

   "Virtually any way of paying off debt that is not inflation is better than paying it off with inflation. Inflation is the worst of all possible ways to raise money. It is also one of the most politically convenient, because much of the public doesn't understand it, and the higher prices can be blamed on private greed.\n\n \n By and large we paid off debt following the Crash of '29 by defaulting on it. The subsequent loss of credit took so much money out of the economy that we had deflation. Market prices for manufactured and agricultural products ended up being less than the cost of production. Thus unemployment went up and the result was the Great Depression. We are now so deep in debt (both public and private) that default is a very real possibility.\n \n \nYou can also stop referring to the \"Communist Chinese\", it isn't the 1970s anymore.\n\n \n Communist China is still officially a communist state, is it not?

Most of those lost jobs were high-wage positions in manufacturing industries. The loss of these jobs is just the most visible tip of NAFTA's impact on the U.S. economy. In fact, NAFTA has also contributed to rising income inequality, suppressed real wages for production workers, weakened workers' collective bargaining powers and ability to organize unions, and reduced fringe benefits.\n \n NAFTA is a free trade and investment agreement that provided investors with a unique set of guarantees designed to stimulate foreign direct investment and the movement of factories within the hemisphere, especially from the United States to Canada and Mexico. Furthermore, no protections were contained in the core of the agreement to maintain labor or environmental standards. As a result, NAFTA tilted the economic playing field in favor of investors, and against workers and the environment, resulting in a hemispheric \"race to the bottom\" in wages and environmental quality. \n\n The high price of &#8216;free&#8217; trade\n \n In the meantime, argue for passage of H.R. 4759, To provide for the withdrawal of the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement. \n \n My goodness!

   "The expression anecdotal evidence has two distinct meanings.\n \n (1) Evidence in the form of an anecdote or hearsay is called anecdotal if there is doubt about its veracity; the evidence itself is considered untrustworthy.\n \n (2) Evidence, which may itself be true and verifiable, used to deduce a conclusion which does not follow from it, usually by generalizing from an insufficient amount of evidence. For example \"my grandfather smoked like a chimney and died healthy in a car crash at the age of 99\" does not disprove the proposition that \"smoking markedly increases the probability of cancer and heart disease at a relatively early age\". In this case, the evidence may itself be true, but does not warrant the conclusion.\n \n In both cases the conclusion is unreliable; it may not be untrue, but it doesn't follow from the \"evidence\".\n \n Evidence can be anecdotal in both senses: \"Goat yogurt prolongs life: I heard that a man in a mountain village who ate only yogurt lived to 120.\"\n \n The term is often used in contrast to scientific evidence, such as evidence-based medicine, which are types of formal accounts. Some anecdotal evidence does not qualify as scientific evidence because its nature prevents it from being investigated using the scientific method. Misuse of anecdotal evidence is a logical fallacy and is sometimes informally referred to as the \"person who\" fallacy (\"I know a person who...\"; \"I know of a case where...\" etc. Compare with hasty generalization). Anecdotal evidence is not necessarily representative of a \"typical\" experience; statistical evidence can more accurately determine how typical something is.\n \n Anecdotal evidence is often unscientific or pseudoscientific because various forms of cognitive bias may affect the collection or presentation of evidence. For instance, someone who claims to have had an encounter with a supernatural being or alien may present a very vivid story, but this is not falsifiable. This phenomenon can also happen to large groups of people through subjective validation.\n \n Anecdotal evidence is also frequently misinterpreted via the availability heuristic, which leads to an overestimation of prevalence. Where a cause can be easily linked to an effect, people overestimate the likelihood of the cause having that effect (availability). In particular, vivid, emotionally-charged anecdotes seem more plausible, and are given greater weight. A related issue is that it is usually impossible to assess for every piece of anecdotal evidence, the rate of people not reporting that anecdotal evidence in the population.\n \n A common way anecdotal evidence becomes unscientific is through fallacious reasoning such as the Post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, the human tendency to assume that if one event happens after another, then the first must be the cause of the second. Another fallacy involves inductive reasoning. For instance, if an anecdote illustrates a desired conclusion rather than a logical conclusion, it is considered a faulty or hasty generalization.[9] For example, here is anecdotal evidence presented as proof of a desired conclusion:\n \n \"There's abundant proof that drinking water cures cancer. Just last week I read about a girl who was dying of cancer. After drinking water she was cured.\" \n Anecdotes like this do not prove anything.[10] In any case where some factor affects the probability of an outcome, rather than uniquely determining it, selected individual cases prove nothing; e.g. \"my grandfather smoked 40 a day until he died at 90\" and \"my sister never went near anyone who smoked but died of lung cancer\". Anecdotes often refer to the exception, rather than the rule: \"Anecdotes are useless precisely because they may point to idiosyncratic responses.\"[11] Even when many anecdotes are collected to prove a point, \"The plural of anecdote is not data.\" (Roger Brinner)\n \n It was more than twenty years ago that Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up first topped the charts. \"Never gonna say goodbye,\" he crooned in his surprisingly basso voice - and who knew how right he was.\n \n Today we're in a different century, a different millennium, a very different era than the one that first offered up twerpy, earnest, high-waistbanded Astley. But his song, and its video in particular, have found new life in the time of YouTube. Never Gonna Give You Up is at the centre of one of the internet's hottest memes - and if you haven't already fallen victim, it's only a matter of time.\n \n It's called the \"rick-roll\". You're innocently browsing an apparently useful website and see a link to something else that might be of interest, but when you click through to that destination you instead find yourself confronted with Astley's boyish smile, his manly croon, his awkward 1987 dance-moves.\n \n The link was a fake, a trap, a dummy with the nefarious purpose of... bringing you face-to-face with the ridiculous.\n \n As with so many stupid internet fads, the rick-roll trend had its start at 4chan, a message-board whose lunatic, juvenile community is at once brilliant, ridiculous and alarming. 4chan users had taken to \"duck-rolling\" each other - tricking one-another into viewing a video of a, er, duck with wheels. In the spring of 2007 some enterprising prodigy branched off from this into the rick-roll. And the rest is history.\n \n The internet began to swarm with rick-rollers - from Slashdot to the World of Warcraft, and certainly to Wikipedia. At YouTube, one posting of the video has had more than seven million views since last May; you can be assured that few of these were intentional. There are online databases of fake rick-roll URLs, and countless jokers have created sham web-browser plugins purporting to block rick-rolls while instead sending visitors to you-know-what.\n \n Of late, however, rick-rolling has begun to permeate the mainstream. It comes mostly courtesy of Anonymous, a diffuse group of hackers and activists who have declared war on the Church of Scientology in an initiative called Project Chanology. Organised without official leaders or hierarchy, Project Chanology manifests itself in Denial Of Service attacks against Scientologist websites, stupid YouTube videos, and in-person protests at Scientologist centres worldwide.\n \n At recent protests in New York, Washington, London and Seattle, masked protesters held up boomboxes and chanted the Stock Aitken Waterman lyrics which Astley made famous. \"Never gonna let you down!\" they roared, in a live rick-rolling of the Church of Scientology.\n \n Their cleverest move however is at AnonymousExposed.org, a website created this week that perfectly mimics the subtly different Anonymous-Exposed.org, created by Scientologists as an indictment of Anonymous' \"cyber-crimes\". Of course instead of showing an anti-Anonymous documentary, the mimic site displays - well, we'll let you have a guess.\n \n But the final word goes to Rick Astley himself. Click here to watch our exclusive interview with Astley. The singer, now 42, has forceful words for Anonymous, Scientologists, and all those who have prolonged the rick-roll phenomenon.",
