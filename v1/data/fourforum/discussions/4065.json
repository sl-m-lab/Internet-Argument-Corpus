That doesn't mean ALL men. I have no desire whatsoever for \"straight\" men. The sexual attraction is an outgrowth of the emotional attraction. That also does not mean that I dislike women; I simply have no emotional attraction toward them, and therefore, no sexual attraction either.\n \n It is possible for a person to be gay and never do anything with another male. It is also possible for a person to be straight and never do anything with a member of the opposite sex.\n \n It is quite common for person growing up to experiment with both sexes, male and female. Such experimentation does not necessarily mean an individual is of one sexuality or another. Tere is also \"bisexuality\" in which an individual is attracted to both sexes; equally or with a preference for one or the other.\n \n I know I am not really answering your questions. I don't think anyone else can either. That is why I recommend you do your own research. It is something you have to determine for yourself. You are the only one who knows what you feel in your heart.

   "Being gays isn't so much about who yu have sex with but to whom you have strong emotional ties. I was with a women for 7 years before I came out and we had sex (of course I was thinkning other things). Then i met this guy and that was that I realized that I wanted to be with him (I never actually told him or anyone else till years later). I came out when I was in my 20's and it was because I wanted emotional (not sexual) fulfillment in my relationship. That was something I couldn't get with a women. I just don't have those feelings.\n Do't know if that helped answer your questions, but the point is \n It is not who you want to have sex with, it is who you want as your romantic partner.

It was the Regan years and the age of \"ME\", where everyone was a cookie cutter copy of the next one...all the while claiming their indipendence and rebelion.

I was a dedicated wife and mother. \n \n Only much later after my marriage had ended (and NOT because of MY sexuality) did I allow myself to consciously ask myself what I was going to do about my feelings. I struggled with it for a long time before I realized that by accepting myself for who I really am would not be a terrible thing. \n Sometime and a few really awful dating experiences later I met and fell in love with the person I knew I would be spending the rest of my life with.

   "Psuedo science of conversion thearpy.. EX-gays.\n \n The promotion of reparative or conversion therapy goes beyond its obvious market of disaffected lesbian, gay and bisexual people. This campaign attempts to influence public opinion and justify anti-gay discrimination by inaccurately portraying homosexuality as a mental disorder and a social evil. Conversion therapy, then, is more than just a clinical issue. It figures prominently in the national debate over lesbian and gay civil rights.\n \n To show why conversion therapy should not influence the development of public policy, this analysis will address several issues: \n \n Conversion therapy is based on faulty assumptions. \n Homophobia leads some individuals to seek sexual orientation change. \n The mental health professions generally oppose conversion therapy. \n No reliable evidence supports the effectiveness of conversion treatments. \n Conversion therapy can be harmful. \n Conversion therapy adversely affects the public's views of lesbian, gay and bisexual people. \n The Faulty Theoretical Foundations of Conversion Therapy\n Psychology and psychiatry have no precedents for treating conditions that are not considered to be illnesses. Since 1973 homosexuality has been considered a normal variation of human sexuality. Proponents of conversion therapy disregard this view because of their mistaken belief that homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness only after lobbying from gay activists. The truth, however, rests in the science, or lack thereof, of the \"mental illness\" assumption of homosexuality. \n \n Homosexuality itself became a mental health diagnosis only as a reflection of prevailing social prejudice. This assumption was first questioned by Evelyn Hooker1 , who compared matched groups of homosexually- and heterosexually-identified men. She found that scores from psychological tests of the two groups were indistinguishable from one another. Since then, a substantial scientific literature has found no significant differences between homosexual and heterosexual subjects on measures of overall psychological functioning and mental and emotional well-being. The most comprehensive review of such studies was conducted by Gonsiorek, who also carefully analyzed studies purporting to demonstrate that homosexuality is a mental illness and found them to be rife with methodological problems.2 \n \n Conversion therapy is based upon the notion that homosexuality is a mental illness and/or a destructive element in society. Theorists such as Nicolosi and Socarides maintain that homosexuals suffer from an arrest of normal development3 . According to their theories, if the circumstances of childhood attachment can be reproduced in therapy, the patient will supposedly overcome his or her homosexuality. Such theories have been described for decades. They have never been empirically validated, however. The theories are concocted from the experiences of unhappy homosexual psychotherapy patients and bear little resemblance to the lives of most lesbian and gay people. \n \n Conversion Therapy's Track Record\n Conversion therapists have different views on what constitutes effective treatment. Religious groups often encourage celibacy for their \"ex-gay\" followers, so lack of sexual contact is construed as successful treatment. Most studies published in the mental health literature use heterosexual behavior as a treatment goal. Much of the effectiveness of conversion therapies is asserted in clients' testimonials or in articles in publications that do not meet accepted research standards. A careful analysis of other evidence of conversion therapy effectiveness fails to justify these recent claims\n \n The studies that have appeared in legitimate journals are generally quite old and share common methodological problems. Studies of conversion therapy are not based upon a random sample of homosexuals who are randomly assigned to different treatments and are then compared, but on a group of homosexuals who have sought treatment because they are unhappy with their sexual orientation. Furthermore, the studies all rely on clients' self-reported outcomes or on therapists' post-treatment evaluations. As a result, all conversion therapy studies are biased in favor of \"cures\" because clients of conversion therapy are likely to believe that homosexuality is an undesirable trait to admit and may feel pressure to tell their therapist that the treatment has been successful. Similarly, conversion therapists have an interest in finding that their treatments are successful \n \n Finally, it should be noted that almost all published research on conversion therapy deals with male homosexuals, not lesbians.? Presumably, this reflects a general devaluation of women in clinical research agendas, as well as a greater tolerance on the part of some heterosexual males for lesbians than for gay men.? Nevertheless, conversion therapists continue to apply their findings to women, even though their own studies do not support that extension.\n http://www.iglss.org/pubs/angles/angels_4-1_p1.html",

   "THE HARM OF CONVERSION THERAPY \n \n The studies cited above allege that a typical success rate for conversion therapies is about 30%.? Surprisingly, those researchers never question what might have happened to the other 70%.? The only comment that conversion therapists offer is that sexual orientation is difficult to change.21 ? All conversion therapy rests solidly on the assumption that homosexuality is in conflict with a fulfilling life, balancing out any risks from treatment in the eyes of those therapists. It is important to ask if these treatments might result in negative consequences, however. \n \n This author?s fifteen years of clinical experience with gay men who have gone through some form of conversion therapy suggests a wide variability in the way people are affected.? All of the following comments are based upon the author?s own clinical observations and numerous anecdotal reports which await confirmation in controlled studies. \n \n ??????????? Some--but not all--conversion therapy clients are harmed.? In particular, those who have undergone treatments such as electric shock or drugs inducing vomiting while homoerotic material is presented are likely to have been harmed the most.? Many such individuals seen in my practice? are not only tormented by an exacerbated level of shame but are physically rendered ?asexual?--not changed into heterosexuals, but no longer functioning as homosexuals either.\n \n ??????????? In recent years, however, refugees from such cruel therapies have become less common in this author?s practice as these treatments have fallen into disfavor.? At present, the majority of former conversion therapy clients, or ?ex-ex-gays?, as they are sometimes known, have gone through a religious, prayer-based program or a talk-oriented therapy of some sort.? Such individuals often experience continued depression over their homosexuality, compounded with a sense of shame over having failed at conversion therapy.? Further, they may have a psychologically debilitating sense of having lost those important life elements--family of origin, religious affiliation, social support--for which there was still some hope as long as the individual was trying to change.? Some former conversion therapy clients report extraordinary difficulties with interpersonal interactions, and particularly sexual intimacy, with same-sex partners.? \n \n http://www.iglss.org/pubs/angles/angels_4-1_p4.html",

Though I think what you are saying here is obvious; you are distinguishing between gay and straight people.\n \n \nHowever there are some people (a suprisingly good number of them) that have abandoned doing these things and have learned to move their 'nature' in a more typical direction as most of society goes. These are people some call 'ex-gay.' Sometimes they slip up and find themselves back in their old ways, but many of them have been quite successful based on their testimony.\n\n \n I will try to give this idea fair judgement, but we'll see. There are actually incredibly few ex-gays, and many of those people have no evidence of homosexual behavior before they became \"ex-gay\". Because of the number of people who want to prove that homosexuality can be changed, this evidence suggests that the testimony of ex-gays might often be fraud. The testimony is further put under suspicion because the techniques used to change a person's sexuality are kept a close secret. I can find no information which elaborates on what is done. I suspect, and I have no evidence for this except my knowledge of other sorts of psychology, that the method used is a sort of desensitization combining the Freudian technique of \"systematic desensitization\" with shock therapy. I imagine that the person is slowly introduced to something heterosexual combined with a positive message and something homosexual combined with a negative message. Of course, I don't think that negative message is actually a shock, as shock therapy would imply. This sort of technique would appear to be carving an unnatural sexual orientation into someone's mind were it made public, which may explain why it is not. I've considered going to one of these ex-gay institutes simply to satisfy my curiosity, but I think that act is too immoral for me to justify.\n \n On the other hand, it may be possible that sexual orientation can change naturally. If we assume it to be as genetic as the types of food we like, then it is only natural to believe that it can change. For example, when I was younger, I did not like oatmeal raisin cookies. Now I love them! I also didn't like vegetable on my pizza. Now I think vegetables are good on pizza. In the same way, I would expect that some people may be attracted to males for some of their life and females for another part. Though most foods that I liked as a child are foods that I still like, and in the same sense, I expect that most people will not experience a natural change in sexual orientation throughout their life. Is it possible to force me to dislike some foods that I like through a process of psychological desensitization and shock therapy? Sure! Though that is a psychological process very close to brainwashing.\n \n \nHowever, I think \"sexual orientation\" has become too big of a deal in these debates--it's an \"orientation\", meaning that is what one is 'oriented' toward, not necessarily unable to escape from.\n\n \n Sexual orientation is just a term. Whether sexual orientation is changable is not based on the definition of the smaller words in that term but on the reality of whether or not it can be changed.\n \n I must also point out that it may have been inappropriate to respond to the question of \"What is being gay?\" with \"It means you've suffered a cruel twist of fate, but it can be changed!\" However, this is a gay rights forum, so I can understand why you might be inclined to post such a thing.",

   "Leo,\n \n Here are some resources on sexuality that you may find useful or not. I would hope these answer your questions better than this from has......\n \n I THINK I MIGHT BE GAY. BUT WHAT IF I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE?\n \n THE SHORT ANSWER: You'll know when you know. It could take a while, and there's no need to rush.\n \n Some gay people say that, from the time they were very young - even just five or six - they \"felt different.\" They didn't share the grade-school crushes about which friends talked, or they had crushes on friends of their own sex-and no one seemed to be talking about that.\n \n Often, they say, it took a while to put a name to their feelings - to begin to think of themselves as gay, or lesbian, or bisexual. But when they started thinking in those words, it made sense - it fit with the feelings they'd had growing up.\n \n Many other people, though, don't begin to figure out their sexual orientation until they're teenagers or even adults - and it can be confusing.\n \n At some point, almost everybody gets a \"crush\" on someone of the same sex, like a great teacher or a friend's older sister or brother. Almost everybody's \"best friend\" is of the same sex. But none of that means you're gay.\n \n One or two sexual experiences with someone of the same sex may not mean you're gay, either - just as one or two sexual experiences with someone of the opposite sex may not mean you're straight. Many gay people have some sexual experiences with the opposite gender, and many straight people have some sexual experiences with their own gender.\n \n It's important to know, too, that you can be a virgin or not be sexually active and still know that you're gay. Your feelings and your emotional and physical attractions will help tell you who you are.\n \n Our sexuality develops over time. Only worry if you aren't sure. The teen years are a time of figuring out what works for you, and crushes and experimentation are often part of that. Over time, you'll find that you're drawn mostly to men or to women - or to both - and you'll know then. You don't have to label yourself today.\n \n If you think you're gay, lesbian, or bisexual, don't be afraid of it, and don't hide your feelings from yourself. All that does is keep you from figuring out your sexual identity - from figuring yourself out.\n \n http://www.outproud.org/brochure_be_yourself.html\n \n http://www.brainevent.com/be/AskExperts/relationships/20020808/index_html\n \n http://www.menshealth.co.uk/talk/thread.phtml/post678651/\n \n http://www.avert.org/hsexu2.htm\n \n \n I hope this is helpful in your quest for knowledge!\n \n \n Joe",
