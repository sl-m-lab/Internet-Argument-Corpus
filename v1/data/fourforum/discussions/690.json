Surely there are theists as well as atheists on here....\n \n \n Well.... Does a Bible scholar in training count?\n \n (My credentials are: I am currently studying at the University of North Florida as a philosophy/Ancient Near Eastern History major. I already have a degree in Motion Picture Production, and am changing careers. Following my B.A. work, I will be pursuing my M.A. in Ancient Literature, then a Doctorate in Cultural Anthropology focusing on religious issues in the area between Egypt and India. So THAT means I'm not the full expert yet...YET... but I am more than the educated layman.)\n \n Archeology is probably where the debate is. There is a popular notion that archeology has proved the Bible incorrect on many points. Both charletans like Acharya S and Freke & Gandy, and legitimate archeologists like Israel Finklestein have made such claims.\n \n But the truth is, in those areas where the Bible record CAN be checked it has been inerrantly accurate - in fact, in the case of the Book of Luke, it corrects geographic and event errors made by Herodotus, Josephus, and Julius Caesar.\n \n This has not stopped some unscrupulous \"scholars\" from doing what they can to discredit the Bible (it seems in a lot of cases scholars are no more able to view the Bible in an objective manner than anyone else). The best example of this was the various digs at the site of Jericho.\n \n When Garstang made his discoveries in the early part of the 20th Century they made a stir because he found the gates of Jericho had fallen outward towards the attackers who breeched the wall. This has not been recorded at any other walled city battle site anywhere in the world and fit the Biblical account to a T. Other details, such as what was done with grain stored there proved to be accurate as well. He dated the site based upon techniques common to his era; pottery, jewelry (particularly scarabs), etc. He dated the site to the time of the Biblical account. \n \n In the 1950's, Kathleen Kenyon came to Jericho and dug a new site on the opposite side from Garstang's original site. She reported her findings and redated the site much earlier than the Biblical accounts, pronounced Garstang was wrong, and anounced the Biblical account was a myth reported by the Israelites who had actually found the remains and took credit for the destruction of the city.\n \n Bryant Wood, an archeologist about to lead another dig at Jericho, in doing his preparatory work took a look at the information from Kenyon's dig and saw something strange - Kenyon's early notebooks found scarab jewelry, but her final report said she found none. He discovered that Kenyon actually threw away scarab jewelry, and threatened an archeologist on staff with academic censure if he turned her in for it. She falsified data that contradicted what she wanted to find - that the Bible was wrong. Coupled with the finds at Wood's dig, the date was reset again back to that in line with the Biblical account.\n \n That's when the you know what hit the fan. If Kenyon is our Natasha in this story, Israel Finklestein is our Boris Badinov. He spread rumors ranging from Wood's falsified finding new scarabs to Wood was gay. (What that had to do with anything ???) A French archeological team went back to the same site Kenyon dug from, AND DUG IN THE SAME HOLES KENYON DID, and reported Wood was incorrect in his findings. (HOW they expected to find anything redigging an already scoured excavation site is beyond me!) \n \n Still the damage has been done. Wood's work has been marginalized and the French team and Finklestein are the ones that get positive press both in peer reviews and popular press. And a lie is presented as fact.\n \n Now, before ANYONE starts -  YES, THERE ARE CHARLATANS AMONG THE SHEEP! People like Carl Baugh and the late Ron Wyatt... I don't even like mentioning their names they're that bad. And the less said about the bad Vegas magician Benny \"I'm blowing the Holy Spirit on you, but the spittle is an extra fee\" Hinn, the better. \n \n Academia is FILLED with running battles that make internet flame posts look like 1960's love-ins. Reputations are ruined on a regular basis when people cross dogmatic lines drawn in the textbooks. One such line is that the Bible is refuted as inaccurate - and those who have show that opinion is wrong, such as Bryant Wood suffer for it, as does the Truth.\n \n Peace, Tom",

   "Truth or Happiness\n \n A common question that relates somewhat to The Matrix. For example if you have seen the movie... Cipher was going to return to the Matrix because he couldn't stand living in the truth so he was going to return to a life of happiness (lies). \n Once a god is stated to exist by an indivisual (in most cases) the after effects include: set morals, right, wrong, heaven, hell, and an overall answer of why.\n Suddenly life has a reason that you know and (for some people) you have an eternal happiness awaiting you (that you dont deserve). \n Now when you state there is not a god you don't have: set morals, right, wrong, heaven, hell, or any answers of to why the world is what it is. The world around you becomes \"chaos' as interpretted by your own perception. \n Those who beleive in god state it is order.\n Those who do not state it is chaos perceived as order because thats how you perceive it.\n Although I don't think humanity will ever have a clear definite answer to whether or not there is a god this is besides the \"logical\" debate at hand.\n \n Many theists claim that the most logical answer is a scource for what is.\n Many atheists claim that the most logical answer to the \"idea' of god is that it has been fabricated by man as a reason for how and why. \n \n \"Everyday mircales\" is often used as a \"reason\" or valid proof of a supreme being. This is in fact not valid. For an everday miracle you have an everyday tradgedy. Some theists will go as far to say: \"Its the devils work\".\n \n A common problem I find with accepting a god is that even with the most clear human definition for one you still don't have a why. If there is a god, why would he do all of this? Why create a world with suffering? Some theists will say that he created man to be praised. \n Besides the fact that this is selfishness, why does he need praise. Is he perfect, but not so perfect that he likes to worshipped. \n (Just a few misconceptions and problems I've been having with that....

Charles Darwin studied Paley in his preparations to join the clergy of the Church of England as a country parson. One wonders if Darwin would have recognized the mechanism that gave the appearance of design in living things if he had not been well versed in Paley.\n \n On the other hand, Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) was a mathematician, when he chose to work at mathematics rather than religious exercises. Simply stated, Pascal's difficult text means that if you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist. God is the safe bet.\n \n The wager is actually the last of three arguments in his work Pens\u00e9es, each of which might be called a wager.

   "You sound as if i have no idea what i'm saying simply because i lack the motivation/effort to spell/typo check myself.\n\n No. You sound as if you have no idea of what you are saying simply because you don't seem to have any idea of what you are saying. I have pointed it out to you before. Your grasp of the topic seems weak even without taking into consideration your sloppy grammar and lazy efforts at spelling.\n \nif you have a problem with my ideas then point them out.\n\n I did. I pointed out that you said that Paley's watchmaker analogy was Pascal's wager and you seemed to take offense. It wasn't because you were sleepy that you made the mistake. It was because you are confused and don't know what you are talking about.\n \nIf your nit picking perfectionist (which you appear to be) go to the grammer debate forum and you can argue about important things like how to spell argue.\n\n As Broker said, if you don't express yourself well, you won't be understood. You express yourself badly, with bad grammar and bad spelling. As a result, your ideas don't seem connected and trying to decipher your grammar and spelling adds to the task. If you lack the attention to detail to make sure that your ideas are clear, expressed clearly, and spelled correctly, then you most likely lack the attention to detail to educate yourself suffiently to understand the topic. From many of your posts, that much is quite clear.\n \nyou sound almost biased to my ideas because you dont like my grammer.\n\n Not at all. Your ideas aren't all that deep and you are many times off the mark. You don't understand what you are talking about very well, is all.\n \nthe important thing here is the idea not the grammer.\n\n Perhaps. But that assumes that you have actuall expressed an idea worth the trouble. I haven't seen anything all that impressive yet. But of course that would imply that you have read all of my 250 or so posts on this board.\n \nyou must not travel much.\n\n I have no idea what that is supposed to mean or how it relates to the topic of your failure to speak without knowledge. But I'll tell you. I presume you have traveled extensively compared to my poor meanderings.\n \n I have lived in Washington, California, Montana, Olkahoma, Texas, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan and Massachusetts. I have driven from coast to coast three times and north to south twice. I have passed through every state in the Union with the exception of Vermont and Arkansas (and Alaska and Hawaii). I have traveled though the states of Mexico east of the Sierra Madre as far south as Mexico City. I have climbed the pyramids at Tula and Teotihuacan (the Pyramid of the Sun, the Pyramid of the Moon, and the Feathered Serpent Pyramid). I have walked the Avenida de los Muertos (Avenue of the Dead). I speak Spanish. I have also traveled in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario in Canada, and spent a year in northern Greenland.\n \n I'm sure that this doesn't measure up to your extensive travel. I haven't been to Europe but I plan to go this fall. But I am sure that this pales next to your globe circling - which explains why you apparently didn't have the time to learn your own language.\n \n But perhaps it is a bias on my part. Perhaps my years in academia as a student and as a teacher, where even the slightest technical error in a written paper was not tolerated nurtured this bias. Perhaps it comes from my years as a teacher where it was my job to teach my students how to think, find the information they needed and express it clearly. Perhaps it comes from my experience in business, where memos and emails are abundant and must be clear and clear, concise communication is of utmost importance. Where bad grammar or spelling will always be pointed out by someone. I admit and apologize for my bias, but I actually feel that English speakers should be able to speak English. Whatever point you are trying to make is lost when I have to jump back to the beginning of a sentence because you don't know the difference between \"your\" and \"you're\", \"to\" and \"too\", \"their\", \"there\" and \"they're\". It grates when you use the wrong tense. To be honest, I have known several non-native speakers of English from several countries who had a better command of English than you do. Nit picking? I guess. Or maybe they paid enough attention to learn English and felt that communication was important.\n \n Now, you didn't answer my question. Where are you studying evolution?\n \n Perhaps you could use some help if you are attempting to do this on your own. Some reading suggestions? You are probably on the right track but you are a bit agressive before you have an adequate foundation in the subject. It is a bit ridiculous to insult creationists (as you do) when you are wrong. It is ridiculous to insult me (as you try to do) when you are wrong. I suspect that you are younger than my children.",

I am now posting it here as an attempt to revive the debate\n ---\n \n Theist Argument:\n \n The typical theists classical argument for God is \"the complex design of the universe, humanity, and life in general\".\n \n With the beleif in God comes the beleif of creation and therefore the beleif in design. Are we people, animals, plants, earth all random results of un-understood chaos? Are all of science's laws such as gravity undesigned?\n \n -You, the theist, see complexity and ultimately design. \n \n The answer to this theist argument is simple. Complexity does not exist. Complexity is an adjective used to describe something from perspective. While from perspective (Element A) may be complex, the complexity of (Element A) is relative. What is complex to you, is not complex to another. Thus complexity does not truly exist in the outer world but rather in an indivisual's mind of perspective.\n \n The idea of design was created by people from people's perspective. \n \n The theist says: Look how well our enviroment suits us.\n \n It is not our enviornment that has come to suit us, but rather us (life) has come to suit the enviroment so that we may survive.\n \n \"Life finds a way\" - Unknown (Ian Malcom in Jurassic Park)",

   "To all non-believers,\n \n In his best-seller The Case for Christ, the legally trained investigative reporter Lee Strobel examined the claims of Christ, turning in the hard-won yet satisfying verdict that Jesus is the Son of God. Yet despite this historical evidence, many grapple with doubts and serious concerns about faith in God. As in a court of law, they want to shout, \"Objection!\" In The Case for Faith, Strobel confronts some of the most difficult objections to belief. He draws on questions he had when he was a skeptic, on the objections currently being raised by the most outspoken opponents of Christianity, and on the most troublesome barriers to faith in the hearts and minds of seekers and skeptics, including: \n -- If there is a loving God, why does this world groan under so much suffering and evil?\n -- If God really created the universe, why does science compel so many to conclude that evolution accounts for life?\n -- If God is the ultimate overseer of the church, why has it been rife with hypocrisy and brutality through the ages?\n -- If God is morally pure, how can he sanction the slaughter of children as the Old Testament asserts?\n -- If Jesus is the only way to heaven, then what about the millions of people who have never heard of him?\n Like The Case for Christ, Strobel's new book can be given with confidence to anyone we encounter who has sincere and serious concerns about faith. Solid, persuasive, engrossing, and smart, The Case for Faith will lead many seekers on the path to satisfying and life-changing answers.\n -emphasis mine-\n \n I will buy 5 of these books and give them away if you are really seeking for answers.",

   "Thank you AMD for addressing my thesis instead of my sub thesis. :-) \n \n \n You say it is humorous to assume something can come from nothing yet it isn't humorous that the creator came from nothing?\n\n \n Here's the thing; he didn't come from nothing. In his dimension, which is beyond our scientific understanding, nothing has to be created, it is already there. Our universe is based on everything being created. But in God's universe, there isn't the same definition of time as here, so he was never created, he always is. It's difficult for us to imagine a world where there is absolutely no time, and God never was created but always is, was, and will be.\n \n \n I find it interesting that perhaps the explosion from the Big Bang could have caused the beginning of time itself and that the universe could have operated in a different fashion before that time. This would explain why we cannot figure out what came first or how something got there.\n\n \n The problem is that this pre-big bang universe wouldn't be our universe because there isn't time. It would be a different universe altogether- a different dimension. You're obviously saying that this universe did have time before the big bang because if it didn't then it wouldn't end, but it obviously did end. If it didn't end then it still exists, then it wouldn't be our universe, would it? Hence, your theory is a very good one, but it simply does not work unless there is a God in the picture.\n \n I understand what I just said is very confusing. I simplified the paragraph several times.",

   "Robbie,\n \n \nI think it's interesting to argue that there is no such thing as complexity. But I don't think it refutes the argument. If there was a resemblance between the universe and life and things which we know are designed, more than one would expect randomly, then why shouldn't it be logical to believe that the universe and life were also designed? Unless there's no such thing as resemblance. Having seen the quality of your logic, I'm inclined to believe that this is what I call an 'escape' argument - that is, you've accepted it only because you want it to refute another one.\n\n \n Do you think as I do that the term complex is a relative adjective?\n \n Resemblance - The likeness or similar relation between two objects, persons or elements. (Agreed definition?)\n \n Excuse my ignorance but, I don't follow.\n \n What things do \"we know are designed\"?\n \n \n \n A) God is beyond our understanding, therefore we don't know if he needs to be created to exist. (yes, this could be considered an 'escape' argument)\n\n \n My obvious answer is that the origin of life is beyond our understanding and therefore we don't know if it needs to be created to exist. Isn't it just as logical. Presuming your answer is yes;\n Why does your previous \"point\" make it more logical to beleive God was not created and the universe was?\n \n \nB) Imagine that time is a line on a graph. Since God is outside of time, He covers the entire graph in all directions. The universe is inside of time and therefore, both time and the universe have a beginning. God goes in all directions to infinity, therefore he has no beginning. So he doesn't need to be created.\n\n \n How do you come to the conclusion that the universe is inside of time? What exactly does that mean? A line extends both \"forwards\" and \"backwards\" to infinity, a line doesn't have a beginning. The idea of a time without time is unimaginable.\n \n \n AMD,\n \n \nLogically we don't understand enough about the universe anyways to even pretend to know how it began. All we have at this time are theories based on little real evidence.\n\n \n I agree 100%.\n \n \n Parcum,\n \n Why do you continue to assume that the universe needs creating but God does not?\n Yes it is easy for you to continue to claim that God does not have to be created but what evidence do you have to base such a claim?\n \n I don't think that anyone has enough evidence or logic to point them to the correct idea of how life began.

Thats how time goes, you can't have negative time.\n \n I realize that I didn't present that analogy well. The universe is made of, I beleive, 9 dimensions. Length, width, height, time, plus others apparently found in black holes. The Big Bang theory says that, from a singularity which exploded, all these dimensions expanded. Time stopped expanding some time ago while 3 dimensional space is still expanding. Therefore, the universe and time are not different things. Time is a property of the universe. The point is that there was a time when all these dimensions didn't exist... unless the singularity existed forever. Yet, since the singularity must have had time and the other dimensions, unless the explosion did create time. It couldn't have existed forever. If it did exist forever, or for a long time, then it shouldn't have exploded after that. \n \n This is probably confusing since I was thinking by writing.

I'm not talking about time as in 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock, et cetera, I'm talking about real time; having a beginning and an end, having a half-way-through, the period when a flower grows from a seed to a full-bloomed flower is time. God isn't in the first, second, or third dimensions. We don't even know if God is in a 5th dimension, but that's not the dimension Im bringing. Everything you see on this earth, cars, machines- and even natural objects- stars, planets, even our own senses do not exist in heaven. Those are tangible things, things that are 3-dimensional and that we can feel, see, and touch. God's dimension is completely different. Do this: think about a completely different world where nothing in this world exists, but it is infinitely better. You can't think of it, because our minds are so used to this dimension, we have no idea what God's dimension is like.\n \n Now for the concept of time. Everything, in our universe, has a beginning and an end. A human is conceived; becomes a zygote; fetus; infant; toddler; child; adolescent; adult; senior, and eventually dies. Our continent is the same way; over time and earthquakes the continent begins to shift and sometimes sink into different positions. Our planet is the same. Some planets are old and die out in storms. Our sun is the same; it first is a nebula, then a young star, then a middle-aged star, then an old star, and then it dies. The same goes for our universe; we already know how it began, the big bang. But who created the big-bang and before? Who create before that? And before that? Our universe has to have a beginning; it couldn't have just popped out of nowhere. Something needed to create it. \n \n AMD brought up a very interesting point; couldn't there have been an era before the big bang where time doesn't exist, and God isn't it?\n \n The problem with this is that time defines our dimension, so that era of non-time would be a different dimension. With this said, first of all, that dimension had to have a creator. We can't simply say that some n-dimensional world created this one; it has to have some sort of creator, which you can believe is anything you want it to. Further, if this dimension has no time, then it didn't have a beginning or an end. If it didn't have a beginning or an end, then it still exists. Since it still exists, then this proves God's existence.",

He cannot be excited by anything since he has seen and done everything. Nothing will ever again surprise him or shock him. He will not be concerned by daily events here as he is already aware of what tomorrow will bring as well as a thousand years from now.

I'll get to the second part of this in a minute.\n \nAssuming the Big Bang was the beginning of the universe as we know it would it make any difference at all as it concerns the law of thermodynamics as to whether the universe did exist before time or not?\n\n What the second law of thermodynamics states, is, basically, entropy. It suggests that ordered energy in our Universe is decreasing. From this we can conclude that it has not been around for an infinite amount of time, since it would be in a state of Chaos, which it is not.\n \n Now, latest Scientific research suggests that time began when the universe began. I don't want to really get completely into this, but:\n \n Time is affected by mass, and Physics states that time was produced as a result of the creation of the Universe. This comes about from Einstein's E=Mc squared. Time is an effect from when energy is existent. Therefore, time exists when matter came into existence; time is often called the fourth dimension. God existed before the existence of matter, before the existence of time. You cannot describe God like this, it is even a mortal measurement to describe God as 'infinite', God is beyond infinity. :)\n \nYou are actually confusing yourself here. You are caught up in the in the box thinking of time suddenly by believing that God would have a beginning and an end if he did come from nothing. A beginning and an end only apply to thinks bound by time. Therefore God was created from nothing before time then technically he still has no beginning. The same would be true with the universe if it began before time.\n\n True. However, I'm still a little dubious about it. We'll arouse to some confusion, since \"created\" is also time-dependant. If you say, \"then I created the box\", of course, you are suggesting that things happened before the creation of the box. I find it far simpler to understand that God had no begining, and is therefore not 'created' from anything. I most definitely don't think that matter came into existence by itself.\n \nNo one ever said God was constrained by time although he seems to want to be at least as it pertains to human life on Earth.

You can claim that a purple unicorn created the world, but that makes the unicorn a God. \n \n \n Time is infinite. The clock will continue to spin and things will always continue to change. Time goes forever forwards and forever backwards.\n\n \n Time may be infinite, but our existence is not. Hence, our existence within time could not have simply appeared, it had to be created because we have time, and time involves creation.",

   "What the second law of thermodynamics states, is, basically, entropy. It suggests that ordered energy in our Universe is decreasing. From this we can conclude that it has not been around for an infinite amount of time, since it would be in a state of Chaos, which it is not.\n\n \n You have to take into consideration my question. I asked whether it would matter whether the universe existed before the beginning of time as it concerns the law of thermodynamics. A decreasing amount of energy over time means that time would have to had existed. If the universe had existed in a state where time did not play a factor how would the laws of thermodynamics be able to measure this event?\n \n \nTime is affected by mass, and Physics states that time was produced as a result of the creation of the Universe. This comes about from Einstein's E=Mc squared. Time is an effect from when energy is existent. Therefore, time exists when matter came into existence; time is often called the fourth dimension. God existed before the existence of matter, before the existence of time. You cannot describe God like this, it is even a mortal measurement to describe God as 'infinite', God is beyond infinity. :)\n\n \n An excellent argument. I have many ideas on this but don't have time to lay them out right now. I'll get back to you on this.\n \n \nTrue. However, I'm still a little dubious about it. We'll arouse to some confusion, since \"created\" is also time-dependant. If you say, \"then I created the box\", of course, you are suggesting that things happened before the creation of the box. I find it far simpler to understand that God had no begining, and is therefore not 'created' from anything. I most definitely don't think that matter came into existence by itself.\n\n \n Creation can occur outside of time though. Lets say that you could stop time and do whatever you wanted to while everything else was suspended in time. Then lets say that you created a pile of cans. Now lets assume time never again gets restarted. Did the pile of cans get created still? I would debate that they did get created even if time wasn't playing a factor in it. So I do think creation can happen outside of time.",

God existed before the existence of matter, before the existence of time. You cannot describe God like this, it is even a mortal measurement to describe God as 'infinite', God is beyond infinity. :)\n\n \n My first debate concerning this has to focus on what I suggested before and that is that before time physics could have been very different. E=MC^2 is based on the physics that exist today. Before there was a today or a tomorrow or a yesterday physics may not have been so simple or perhaps they could have been even more so. To believe that the physics of today are the same that existed before time is a reach.\n \n Just as infinity is a mortal measurement so is E=MC^2 and time. Assuming that there is a God we would have to consider that our understanding of his creation time would be limited and it would be entirely possible that he bent the rules of our current laws of physics in order to have the creation of the universe before the beginning of time. Assuming that there is no God then we have to accept that time is probably as complicated of a concept as we believe that God is. We are completely constrained by time and yet it is beyond our understanding as to how it got there or what it had to do with the universe's creation. Either way it is foolish to assume that we understand time and creation so well as to be able to detail how time began or how the universe first came into being.\n \n \nTime may be infinite, but our existence is not. Hence, our existence within time could not have simply appeared, it had to be created because we have time, and time involves creation.\n\n \n Time is infinite if you want to base it on our understanding of it. Nothing could happen before or after it therefore it would consume the sum total of everything that will ever happen.\n \n Our existance is infinite as well if you believe in God which I presume you do. We would exist as long as God does. So why are you suggesting that our existance is not infinite? If by chance you do believe we can exist forever then you have to also assume that it may be possible without a God.\n \n Even if you are correct that time is infinite and our existance is not I don't understand why you believe this means that time could not have simply appeared. Time did not simply appear anyways as long as you believe it is infinite. Time would have consumed everything from beginning to end and therefore would always have been there. Doesn't this have to be the case if time is infinite?\n \n Time does not involve creation. Creation can happen without time and time can happen without creation. For an example of both, what was God doing before time began? Certainly he created time. Therefore time was created before time showing that creation can happen without time. For the next example I simply ask that you provide a way that time creates anything? Time is a measuring stick, not a creator. Time is based on change and although this change can include creation and destruction it is not time is involved with the creation or destruction. Time only measures it.",

   "Dreamweaver,\n \n (Sorry all for the late response. I have been busy attempting to keep up my GPA)\n \n \n \nWhat do you want? Proof of the existence of God? What do you mean by proof? What do you mean by existence? Can you prove the existence of anything, letter lone God?\n\n \n My point was that its not up to me to show why the unicorn does not exist but rather who that says their is a unicorn that it does exist.\n Yes I can prove the existance of most anything.\n \n \nDefine unicorn. Is this unicorn all-powerful? What kind of unicorn are you thinking of? Surely, a supremely powerful being would have had to created the world.\n\n \n No the unicorn isn't all powerful. It has little elephant helpers. Together they created the world. See you have to understand the unicorn and its elephants are outside of time. They are in their own demension.\n \n \nWhat? Do you think that God is some type of \"thing\"? That He can be trotted out and shown around, and then we can all say, \"Oh, yes, God exists. I know because I saw Him yesterday\"? You think that God is some type of object; the supreme transcendental being is 'located' at some point?\n\n \n I'm saying that without any serious evidence that God is just a possibility.\n \n \nI hope you realise that that is outside of modern research, which suggests otherwise. Read some Stephen Hawking. He might be a fool, but he knows some stuff in Science.\n\n \n Of course time is infinite. Things will always continue to change and go forward in time. This will occur for eternity.\n \n \nObviously, we don't have tangible evidence for either side's to hold truth. Logic and the laws of science are our only evidential support. My reasoning is logical and scientific, that is my evidence.\n\n \n So then you do admit its just as plausible to beleive God created the world as a purple unicorn with the help of elephants created it?\n \n \nNot really. Our universal existence is in THIS universe, THIS dimension. God's is in another, and he has a different existence and dimension. Hence, our existence lies in this universe alone, and cannot be in another dimension. By saying our existence lies in a different dimension, then our existence is IN the other dimension, which means that we are all IN that dimension. But we're obviously in THIS dimension, and not another one.\n\n \n I'm speaking of existance as a concept. Not as a specific thought. Space exists. Demensions exist. Matter exists. Thoughts exist. Together they form the concept of existance.\n Existance (physical space) has existed infinitely... has it not?\n \n \nI'm speaking of God as the creator. You can claim that a purple unicorn created the world, but that makes the unicorn a God. \n\n \n True. So we are back to the debate of physical space existing on an infinitely on an infinite time line? \n \n \nTime may be infinite, but our existence is not. Hence, our existence within time could not have simply appeared, it had to be created because we have time, and time involves creation.\n\n \n Perhaps our existance evolved from some form or another of existance.

It's really shaking up my world, because all my life whenever I felt alone I would just think about how the Purple Unicorn loved me, and I felt better. Now I have to contemplate that maybe I am the source of my greatest power, and I don't really know if I'm all that powerful. *sigh* emoticon_cry \n \n So, about all these really fascinating discussions about time and matter, etc. \n \n First, about the Universe being finite/infinite- there is an interesting book called \"From Quarks to the Cosmos\" which discusses scientific relationships between particle physics and astronomy. I highly recommend it. At any rate, the smallest particles we are able to perceive at any given time in scientific development seem to always be made up of even smaller sub-particles, and it is unclear whether at any point this ends. The same seems to be true going the opposite way. \n \n It also seems that atoms are mostly made up of space, as you learn in basic sciences, all the mass of an atom is in it's nucleus, which is incredibly relatively small. I've seen it written in science books that if a footbal field were an atom, the nucleus would be equivalent in size to a single grain of rice floating in the middle of the football field.\n \n I just think this is interesting in relation to questions of space/time and life itself. Have you ever read the Dr Seuss book about the world of beings inside the snowflake?\n \n Getting back to what people are arguing about God's existence, I think the logical leaps people are jumping to need to be addressed.

   "Robbie,\n \n Sorry for not noticing your earlier reply.\n \n \nWe know that man-made things are designed. The idea is that if you reject complexity to mean anything, then look at the resemblance between things that were designed and the universe/life.\n\n \n Sorry a better term would be universal complexity or design. Yes we humans have taken our relative perspective on the universe and created things resembling that of the universe. \n \n \n \nBecause, using that arguement I could have two, so then I could be more logical by sheer numbers! I agree that it is equally valid to say that we don't understand origin.\n\n \n Alright\n \n \"How do you come to the conclusion that the universe is inside of time? What exactly does that mean? A line extends both \"forwards\" and \"backwards\" to infinity, a line doesn't have a beginning. The idea of a time without time is unimaginable.\"\n \n \nMy line started at a point and went one way! Thats how time goes, you can't have negative time.\n\n \n It is not a number line. Its all very nice to say thats just how it goes but I think of it differently. With that neither of our claims hold any ground.\n \n \nI realize that I didn't present that analogy well. The universe is made of, I beleive, 9 dimensions. Length, width, height, time, plus others apparently found in black holes. The Big Bang theory says that, from a singularity which exploded, all these dimensions expanded. Time stopped expanding some time ago while 3 dimensional space is still expanding. Therefore, the universe and time are not different things. Time is a property of the universe. The point is that there was a time when all these dimensions didn't exist... unless the singularity existed forever. Yet, since the singularity must have had time and the other dimensions, unless the explosion did create time. It couldn't have existed forever. If it did exist forever, or for a long time, then it shouldn't have exploded after that. \n \n \n First off I don't argue for the Big Bang theory to have created the existance. I can't really argue with this because the theory is a theory I am not well educted on.\n \n \nThis is probably confusing since I was thinking by writing. I would agree that you can't know for a fact whether there is a God. (until you die, I presume)\n\n \n Or if there is a God you are likely to know when you die but even then perhaps God has no intention of us having any kind of afterlife. Perhaps God created us but the idea of the afterlife is just a kind of human desire or hope.",

I've been questioning God's existence a lot to myself lately, and I'm having a lot of self-discrepancy.\n I'd truly like to believe there is an omnipotent molder of all things out there, but I'm ambiguous at present. I'm not even certain why I've been questioning God, or why I have this abrupt disbelief, but it's there for some reason.\n I've gone through these phases before. Where I've purged God or religion from my thought and sought to be independent and not live under the watchful and scrutinous eye of the creator, but I'll eventually switch back to believing in a God.\n Also, I think that definition was poorly-constructed, as even Gods are prone to making mistakes. The response directly prior to mine sums up my thoughts.\n \n Another thing I can't understand is why the writings on Jesus were so tardy and delayed. Wasn't the earliest one written 90-years after Christ died?\n And also, if Christ's disciples were Palestinian shouldn't the bible have been written in Aramiac and not Greek?\n And the correlation between Christ and Mithras and Dionysus(sp).\n A lot of religious questions that have gone unanswered and will go on because they are simply impossible to deny or affirm. It's not really so much my mind not wanting to assent to the possibility that an omniscent being exists, but there are so many follies and screw-ups in the holy books. I guess that's what really brings about my questioning. Plus I just really don't feel anything. Any incentive to believe in a God, any spirituality or holy feeling. Nothing I've witnessed, encountered or engaged in has been seemingly altered by a divine being, and I'll probably continue to be in denial until I can see some self-proof. :/",

   "Objection 1. It seems that God does not exist; because if one of two contraries be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed. But the word \"God\" means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore, God existed, there would be no evil discoverable; but there is evil in the world. Therefore God does not exist. \n \n Objection 2. Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence. \n \n On the contrary, It is said in the person of God: \"I am Who am.\" (Exodus 3:14) \n \n I answer that, The existence of God can be proved in five ways.  \n \n The first and more manifest way is the argument from motion. It is certain, and evident to our senses, that in the world some things are in motion. Now whatever is in motion is put in motion by another, for nothing can be in motion except it is in potentiality to that towards which it is in motion; whereas a thing moves inasmuch as it is in act. For motion is nothing else than the reduction of something from potentiality to actuality. But nothing can be reduced from potentiality to actuality, except by something in a state of actuality. Thus that which is actually hot, as fire, makes wood, which is potentially hot, to be actually hot, and thereby moves and changes it. Now it is not possible that the same thing should be at once in actuality and potentiality in the same respect, but only in different respects. For what is actually hot cannot simultaneously be potentially hot; but it is simultaneously potentially cold. It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e. that it should move itself. Therefore, whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another. If that by which it is put in motion be itself put in motion, then this also must needs be put in motion by another, and that by another again. But this cannot go on to infinity, because then there would be no first mover, and, consequently, no other mover; seeing that subsequent movers move only inasmuch as they are put in motion by the first mover; as the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand. Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion by no other; and this everyone understands to be God. \n \n The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes. There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to infinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause, whether the intermediate cause be several, or only one. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect. Therefore, if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor any intermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity, there will be no first efficient cause, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient causes; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit a first efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God. \n \n The third way is taken from possibility and necessity, and runs thus. We find in nature things that are possible to be and not to be, since they are found to be generated, and to corrupt, and consequently, they are possible to be and not to be. But it is impossible for these always to exist, for that which is possible not to be at some time is not. Therefore, if everything is possible not to be, then at one time there could have been nothing in existence. Now if this were true, even now there would be nothing in existence, because that which does not exist only begins to exist by something already existing. Therefore, if at one time nothing was in existence, it would have been impossible for anything to have begun to exist; and thus even now nothing would be in existence--which is absurd. Therefore, not all beings are merely possible, but there must exist something the existence of which is necessary. But every necessary thing either has its necessity caused by another, or not. Now it is impossible to go on to infinity in necessary things which have their necessity caused by another, as has been already proved in regard to efficient causes. Therefore we cannot but postulate the existence of some being having of itself its own necessity, and not receiving it from another, but rather causing in others their necessity. This all men speak of as God. \n \n The fourth way is taken from the gradation to be found in things. Among beings there are some more and some less good, true, noble and the like. But \"more\" and \"less\" are predicated of different things, according as they resemble in their different ways something which is the maximum, as a thing is said to be hotter according as it more nearly resembles that which is hottest; so that there is something which is truest, something best, something noblest and, consequently, something which is uttermost being; for those things that are greatest in truth are greatest in being, as it is written in Metaph. ii. Now the maximum in any genus is the cause of all in that genus; as fire, which is the maximum heat, is the cause of all hot things. Therefore there must also be something which is to all beings the cause of their being, goodness, and every other perfection; and this we call God. \n \n The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that things which lack intelligence, such as natural bodies, act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that not fortuitously, but designedly, do they achieve their end. Now whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is shot to its mark by the archer. Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God. \n \n Reply to Objection 1. As Augustine says (Enchiridion xi): \"Since God is the highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of evil.\" This is part of the infinite goodness of God, that He should allow evil to exist, and out of it produce good. \n \n Reply to Objection 2. Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.",

Is he truly a loving God, being that the malevolent God of the Old Testament and the 'loving' God od the New Testament are one and the same, and if He IS a loving God, then why does He find it necessary to put humanity through what He does? \n \n There is to be no salvation for those who refuse Him, even those of us who donate to Oxfam, do volunteer work, carry groceries for old ladies, and are kind to animals, which God apparently despises and sees as lowly creatures undeserving of any affection. We are not justified for entry into Heaven based on works alone; no matter how many lives we save as doctors or rescue workers, no matter what we do to free other human beings from inhumane conditions, if we do not accept that there is a God and the Jesus Christ is His son, we are not worhty of His eternal love. Only damnation.\n \n Furthermore, since God is not capable of being understood, how are we supposed to know what He wants? Repeatedly He has tested humanity, rewarding only those who accept His existence. This is love? As I've said before, if He really loved us, He would stay out of our lives. With these things in mind, why should we allow Him to be part of our lives and to succumb to his desire for servants and slaves?\n\n \n There is a major problem with your argument. You assume that YOU know better what love is than the one who created the lovers and the loved. If you know so much about loving people then surely you would be perfect. Are you?\n \n God is the one who defines love and defines the system. God will stay out of your life if you so choose. The consequences of your choice are set. You decide what you want. Trust the one who created everything or trust your fallible, foolish self. Have a nice day.",

   "No, all his works would not be perfect, but would be exactly the way he intended. This can include imperfections.\n\n \n So a perfect being can plan a work with imperfections? Looks like a contradiction in terms.",

   "It seems to me that He does care. He must have cared very much about us to send His son, and for His son to go through with it...\n \n Of course, that's the Christian perspective - we're talking about a generic God, right?\n \n It seems self-evident to me that a creator would want to create free beings capable of real love rather than mere robots. Do you agree?\n \n ps. I apologize for taking so long to answer, sometimes I need to think about things for a while.\n \n pps. ivadersb: I think you're right on with you're proofs of God.\n\n \n No, it is not evident to me that a creator would want free beings. I work with robots every day and the last thing you want is a free will robot. If we are designed by an omnipotent being to do what he wants, then we must be doing it right now.",
