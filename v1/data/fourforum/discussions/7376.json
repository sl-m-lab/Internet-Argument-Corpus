   "\n January 19, 2006\n Inquiry on Clinton Official Ends With Accusations of Cover-Up \n By DAVID JOHNSTON and NEIL A. LEWIS\n WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 - After the longest independent counsel investigation in history, the prosecutor in the case of former Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros is finally closing his operation with a scathing report accusing Clinton administration officials of thwarting an inquiry into whether Mr. Cisneros evaded paying income taxes.\n \n The legal inquiry by the prosecutor, David M. Barrett, lasted more than a decade, consumed some $21 million and came to be a symbol of the flawed effort to prosecute high-level corruption through the use of independent prosecutors. \n \n Mr. Barrett began his investigation with the narrower issue of whether Mr. Cisneros lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation when he was being considered for the cabinet position. He ended his inquiry accusing the Clinton administration of a possible cover-up. \n His report says Justice Department officials refused to grant him the broad jurisdiction he wanted; for example, Attorney General Janet Reno said he could look at only one tax year. And after Internal Revenue Service officials in Washington took a Cisneros investigation out of the hands of district-level officials in Texas, the agency deemed the evidence too weak to merit a criminal inquiry, a conclusion strongly disputed by one Texas investigator.\n \n Former officials of the Justice Department and the I.R.S. dismissed Mr. Barrett's conclusions in appendices attached to the report, saying the findings were the product of an inquiry that was incompetently managed from the start. \n \n After being indicted on 18 felony counts, Mr. Cisneros pleaded guilty in 1999 to a misdemeanor charge of lying to investigators. He was later pardoned by President Bill Clinton. http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/politics/19inquire.html?ei=5065&en=25e2d365821f3ec5&ex=1138338000&partner=MYWAY&pagewanted=print\n \n\n \n And to think that gullable liberals liked this crooked guy. emoticon_xdonno",

They suggested that the prosecutor had turned his disappointment in his inability to prove the obstruction allegations into unprovable theories.\n\n \n That would be Bushs justice department.\n \n \nRobert S. Litt, one of the Justice Department officials involved, wrote in a comment letter on May 31, 2005, that he was allowed to read only edited parts of the report but that he concluded that the report was \"a fitting conclusion to one of the most embarrassingly incompetent and wasteful episodes in the history of American law enforcement.\"\n\n \n Note the date\n \n This is just foolish.

   "No kidding. Blaming the Clinton administration for a cover up only works if you are not investigation 5 years into the next administration...Unless this is all part of an evil Bush/Clinton conspiracy. \n\n The plea bargain and pardon took place under Slick, Reno was Attorney General and blocked efforts to gather additional info in her inimitatable style of protecting Clinton's administration.\n Maybe this will help enlighten readers on what took place during the investigation.\n \n \n\n All of which inevitably raises the question of whether Barrett's work is worth the expense. What is he investigating? And why has he done it for so many years?\n \n The answers are cloaked in prosecutorial secrecy. But we know that Barrett, originally assigned to examine the Cisneros/Medlar payoffs, twice received permission from the panel to expand his investigation. By March 1997, Barrett was conducting - in the words of one of the judges overseeing independent counsels - \"an apparently wide-ranging probe of government officials who might, in [Barrett's] view, have sought to shield Mr. Cisneros.\"\n \n At issue, apparently, was the Internal Revenue Service and Cisneros's tax records. In October 2000, the Wall Street Journal reported that, as early as 1997, Barrett \"had wanted to look into allegations that Mr. Cisneros failed to report income from speeches. Investigators suspected that Mr. Cisneros had signed over checks from speaking engagements to his mistress.\" But the Clinton Justice Department moved in to limit Barrett's access to Cisneros's tax records.\n \n A legal fight ensued.\n \n And that's about all that has been reported. Nevertheless, from discussions with people who have some knowledge of the situation, a bit more can be said. It is true that Barrett's expanded investigation involved a look at the IRS and the Justice Department. Apparently, the office of independent counsel felt it had a serious and credible whistleblower with information about alleged efforts to protect Cisneros and other political figures - and to stymie the Barrett probe. What followed was essentially hand-to-hand combat between Barrett's office and the Clinton Justice Department, as Barrett sought more information and the department fought to keep it from him. That situation continued beyond the 2000 election, with Republicans in control of the Justice Department, until Barrett finally gave up.\n \n According to papers made public in March, Barrett told the court that his office had \"ceased all investigative and prosecutorial activities and does not intend to initiate any others.\" (He evidently made that decision sometime between last September and March, but exactly when is not clear.) Barrett further told the court that his primary remaining responsibility was writing the final report of his investigation.\n \n That report could be quite controversial. Some people familiar with the situation believe the Justice Department barred Barrett from investigating things that, in the words of one source, \"cried out to be investigated.\" This would include actions by the Justice Department itself - and the report may say so. \"The Department of Justice is incapable of investigating itself, and you can carve that in granite,\" says the source. (A current official at Justice insists, \"Nobody here was attempting to protect the Clinton administration from an investigation.\")\n \n It could be that Barrett was overreaching. Certainly one of the three federal judges who oversee his office has expressed serious reservations. In court papers filed in June 2001, Judge Richard Cudahy wrote that \"whether a cost-benefit analysis at this point would support Mr. Barrett's efforts is a question to which I have no answer.\" But Cudahy added that the judges could do almost nothing to stop Barrett. \"The [independent counsel] law literally construed may be that Mr. Barrett can go on forever,\" Cudahy wrote, \"so long as he claims or shows active grand jury activity, no matter how unpromising. Who is to contradict his evaluation that what he is doing is full of promise?\"\n http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york200510250904.asp\n \n",
