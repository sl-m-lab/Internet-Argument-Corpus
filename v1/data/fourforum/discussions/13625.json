   "Holder tells Senate committee Justice Department supports more 'gun control'\n \n \nIn unmistakably clear admissions before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Nov. 18, Attorney General Eric Holder signaled strong administration support for additional \"gun control\" edicts.\n \n Law Enforcement Alliance of America, the only national law enforcement organization to oppose Holder's confirmation, issued a press release warning:\n \n Drawing reasonable conclusions from what Holder publicly said, we now know:\n \n \u0095 Holder wants a national, permanent gun registration system administered by law enforcement. A registration of honest citizens that have cleared the federal background check for gun purchases with those records permanently retained by and shared among law enforcement.\n \n \u0095 Holder wants new federal authority to prohibit any person on the federal watch list (reported to be 400,000 names) from buying guns and supports confiscating guns from those on the list who possess them.\n \n I held off on bringing this release to the attention of Gun Rights Examiner readers because I wanted to corroborate the claims--which, unfortunately, the official transcript of Holder's prepared remarks, posted on the Justice Department website, do not.\n \n So I contacted LEAA and spoke last night with their Chief Operating Officer and national spokesman, Ted Deeds. He told me they were reporting on remarks made during questioning, and sent me a transcript of the appropriate segments of AG Holder's testimony:\n \n Why is it that when Dianne Feinstein says \"Excellent,\" the immediate image that comes to mind is a gleefully malevolent Montgomery Burns? And yes, I caught that this was supported by the Bush administration. Some of us were consistent in not giving him a pass when he was in power.\n \n Click here to watch Holder's morning session testimony for yourself on C-SPAN, noting the time relevant exchanges begin from the above embedded document.\n \n As we've discussed before, some of the opponents of repealing the Tiahrt amendment might surprise those who haven't been paying attention:\n \n [T]he Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) has always supported language protecting firearm trace data, now known as the Tiahrt Amendment...\n \n ATF itself has repeatedly gone to court to fight the release of its data, because the release can have a negative effect on its efforts to investigate illegal gun trafficking and threaten the safety of officers and witnesses.\n \n And as we've seen before, that \"no fly list\" nets some peculiar catches:\n \n U.S. Sen. Edward M. \"Ted\" Kennedy said yesterday that he was stopped and questioned at airports on the East Coast five times in March because his name appeared on the government's secret \"no-fly\" list.\n \n Besides which, our entire criminal justice system is supposed to be based on presumption of innocence. But let's explore the rationale of those who think differently: If denying gun purchases to people on government suspicion lists is \"good\" (an no one thinks this will be limited to Al-Qaeda and not include \"homegrown\" persons of interest, do they?), then disarming these suspects and taking away their existing arms must be \"better.\"\n \n How would the federal government do that without using registration lists to enable confiscation? You know, what prominent media voices sneer at and dismiss whenever the possibility of it is raised...\n \n And ask yourself why major \"Authorized Journalist\" outlets aren't reporting on this, and indeed, if you relied on some to answer if there is evidence the administration wants more gun control, their reply would be a scoffing \"Absolutely none whatsoever.\"\n \n Learn about LEAA:\n \n The Law Enforcement Alliance of America (LEAA) is the nation's largest non-profit, non-partisan coalition of law enforcement professionals, crime victims, and concerned citizens united for justice. With a major focus on public education, LEAA is dedicated to providing hard facts and real-world insights into the world of law enforcement and the battle against violent crime. LEAA fights at every level of government for legislation that reduces violent crime while preserving the rights of honest citizens, particularly the right of self-defense.\n",

   "Eric Holder.\n \n Rahm Emanuel.\n \n Michael Bloomberg.\n \n Thanks to these three individuals we have undeniable and irrefutable proof that what we've been saying for so long, is absolutely correct. Gun registration can, does, and will, lead to gun confiscation.\n \n Eric Holder is pushing for the licensing and registration of all guns and gun owners, requiring them to register with the government and obtain permits before they can own a gun. Holder also wants the government to maintain permanent lists of all gun owners.\n \n Rahm Emanuel is pushing for the names of hundreds of thousands of people on the \"no fly\" list and \"suspected terrorist\" list to be added to the NICS database, automatically denying potentially millions of people from legally being able to buy a gun, without the legal requirement of due process or trial by jury, simply because their name is being used by a terrorist and is on some secret government list.\n \n Michael Bloomberg is pushing for the government to forcibly confiscate the legally owned guns from everyone on the secret government lists that dictate who can't fly and who might be suspicious. No due process, no trial, no notification of any wrong doing. Just the federal agents showing up and executing a confiscation warrant and robbing you of your legal private property, and leaving you with no recourse.\n \n Thanks a lot you three. You've confirmed our warnings, what you claimed was just fear mongering. You've admitted outright that you want gun registration, and it's your intention to use said registration as a tool of confiscation.\n \n The battle is ours now!",

   "Apparently what you don't get is that the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land! As the President himself has said, \"The Constitution is a list of Negative Rights against the Government.\" An Appointed Attorney General has no authority to violate or make void any of the Constitution's protections. \n \n As Doc has pointed out, \"38 State Attorney Generals signed a brief in opposition to any gun control\" in agreement with us! That means NOT YOU! \n \n All the Anti-gun people do is Take, Take Take. So when does the taking stop? When is the Constitution and our Rights protected? \n \n   The Preamble to the Bill of Rights says \nTHE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution\n\n   The &#8220;Unregulated&#8221; Gun  \n &#8220;Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate guns&#8212;more than 88,000 words. Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n Allow me to remind everyone about all of the Federal gun laws passed during the 90's till now.\n 1.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers, \n 2.institution of the waiting period,\n 3. Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun.\n 4. The President's executive order stopping the importation of many guns,\n 5. Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business.\n 6. The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases. \n 7. Insta Check! \n 8. Additional disqualification's and changes to legal firearms purchases on form 4473, \n 9. The assault weapons ban. Sunsetted\n 10. The ten round magazine, Sunsetted\n 11 Lautenburg.\n 12. just recently the NICS improvement act!\n \n So who is being irresponsible here? Who is being piggish here? The truth is you are not supposed to have every law you want when the right is protected and recognized as Inalienable and a First Right by the Constitution! You are ONLY allowed the bare minimum! That is why 38 state attorney generals are with us? And Who ever heard of such a thing, ever before? They believe YOU are wrong!",
