   "A new study by the Pew Research Center finds that the GOP is alienating scientists to a startling degree.\n \n Only six percent of America's scientists identify themselves as Republicans; fifty-five percent call themselves Democrats. By comparison, 23 percent of the overall public considers itself Republican, while 35 percent say they're Democrats.\n \n The ideological discrepancies were similar. Nine percent of scientists said they were \"conservative\" while 52 percent described themselves as \"liberal,\" and 14 percent \"very liberal.\" The corresponding figures for the general public were 37, 20 and 5 percent.\n \n Among the general public, moderates and independents ranked higher than any party or ideology. But among scientists, there were considerably more Democrats (55%) than independents (32%) and Republicans (6%) put together. There were also more liberals (52%) than moderates (35%) and conservatives (9%) combined.\n \n \"These results were not a complete surprise,\" said Scott Keeter, Director of Survey Research at Pew, in an interview with the Huffington Post. He said they can be mostly attributed to \"the difference between Democratic and Republican parties with respect to issues.\"\n \n The wide ideological and partisan gap among scientists may have been exacerbated by the Bush administration, which often disputed broad scientific consensus on topics such as evolution and climate change.\n \n Keeter acknowledged this factor, but said that \"many of these disputes probably predate the Bush administration,\" noting that scientists have favored liberal views in numerous past studies.\n\n Only Six Percent Of Scientists Are Republicans: Pew Poll\n \n I'm not surprised either.",

Conservatives talk about how liberals push for high taxes, for expensive social programs, universal health coverage, lunches and breakfasts in the schools, income redistribution, affirmative action, reparations, a higher minimum wage, more generous foreign aid, multiculturalism, gay marriage, protecting endangered species, animal rights, enhancing entitlements, affirming prison rights, providing generous benefits for illegal immigrants, etc. etc. Then we can watch liberals like Ted Kennedy, Charles Schumer, Obama, Barbara Boxer, Nancy Pelosi, Robert Byrd, Joe Biden, etc. clearly endorse those things.

   "\n \nOne where the salaries of academics are far lower than those of scientists employed by the oil and pharmaceutical industries?\n\n [url=http://www.jupiterscientific.org/sciinfo/sciencesalaries.html]\n You appear to be out of touch with reality. the median salary of a full professor is higher than the majority of scientists working in industry and when you take into account their shorter work year and low pressure, it's certainly not a sacrifice.\n\n \n That doesn't really address the question. Comparing goelogist salaries with scientists employed in academics has little to nothing to do with salaray based on one's opinion of scientific theory. Geologists are not necessarily AGW deniers and scientists employed by a university do not necessarily subscribe to the view that AGW is man made. \n \n Want an example of how your theory is invalid? Let's look at how exactly AGW deniers are paid, shall we? \n \n http://thinkprogress.org/2007/02/01/oil-lobby-payments/\n \n \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the most authoritative group on global warming, will report on Friday that it is &#8220;very likely&#8221; that human activities were the main cause of warming in the past 50 years.\n \n Prominent global warming deniers, such as Rush Limbaugh and Sen. James Inhofe, have already been downplaying the report and contravening the science. But the Guardian reports that there is a more orchestrated movement going on below the radar to confound the public about the IPCC&#8217;s report.\n \n The oil lobby is so desperate to push back on the new climate change report that they have been offering to pay global warming skeptics to speak out:\n Scientists and economists have been offered $10,000 each by a lobby group funded by one of the world&#8217;s largest oil companies to undermine a major climate change report due to be published today.\n \n Letters sent by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), an ExxonMobil-funded thinktank with close links to the Bush administration, offered the payments for articles that emphasise the shortcomings of a report from the UN&#8217;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Travel expenses and additional payments were also offered.\n \n [...]\n \n The letters were sent by Kenneth Green, a visiting scholar at AEI, who confirmed that the organisation had approached scientists, economists and policy analysts to write articles for an independent review that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the IPCC report.\n\n AEI has received more than $1.6 million from ExxonMobil. The well-heeled oil lobby is a primary reason why doubt still exists in the general public about the cause of global warming.\n \n As Al Gore&#8217;s An Inconvenient Truth pointed out, despite the fact that no peer-reviewed scientific articles published in recent years express any doubt that climate change is happening, more than 50 percent of news media coverage of the issue includes the oil industry&#8217;s position on the subject.\n\n \n Interesting, don't you think? I'd love to \"earn\" $10,000 to write an article.\n \n Here's another example.\n \n http://dieoff.org/page82.htm\n \n \nBut while the skeptics portray themselves as besieged truth-seekers fending off irresponsible environmental doomsayers, their testimony in St. Paul and elsewhere revealed the source and scope of their funding for the first time. Michaels has received more than $115,000 over the last four years from coal and energy interests. World Climate Review, a quarterly he founded that routinely debunks climate concerns, was funded by Western Fuels. Over the last six years, either alone or with colleagues, Balling has received more than $200,000 from coal and oil interests in Great Britain, Germany, and elsewhere. Balling (along with Sherwood Idso) has also taken money from Cyprus Minerals, a mining company that has been a major funder of People for the West&#8212;a militantly anti-environmental \"Wise Use\" group. Lindzen, for his part, charges oil and coal interests $2,500 a day for his consulting services; his 1991 trip to testify before a Senate committee was paid for by Western Fuels, and a speech he wrote, entitled \"Global Warming: the Origin and Nature of Alleged Scientific Consensus,\" was underwritten by OPEC. Singer, who last winter proposed a $95,000 publicity project to \"stem the tide towards ever more onerous controls on energy use,\" has received consulting fees from Exxon, Shell, Unocal, ARCO, and Sun Oil, and has warned them that they face the same threat as the chemical firms that produced chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a class of chemicals found to be depleting atmospheric ozone. \"It took only five years to go from... a simple freeze of production [of CFCs],\" Singer has written, \". . . to the 1992 decision of a complete production phase-out&#8212;all on the basis of quite insubstantial science.\" [#2]\n\n \n There's gold in them thar' Think Tanks!!",

Thirdly, I've know idea how you draw that conclusion based on the data in the link.\n \n My experience from those working in academia is that if you choose to pursue a research career then you can expect several years of low pay on rolling monthly or yearly contracts before you get a sniff of a post as a lecturer, never mind a professorship, and I also know people who've gone into private work in the pharmaceutical industry getting paid GBP50k+ for a 6 month contract, straight off a masters course. Sure, that's an extreme example but people in academia accept lower pay in order to be able to pursue science, rather than merely what is profitable, for their own intellectual satisfaction and the benefit of others.",

   "First off, your link doesn't address whether the scientists are publicly or privately employed, and secondly comparing full professors (i.e. those at the top of their profession) with \"the majority\" of scientists, which presumably includes junior researchers, and post docs getting paid a pittance, is patently absurd. Thirdly, I've know idea how you draw that conclusion based on the data in the link.\n \n My experience from those working in academia is that if you choose to pursue a research career then you can expect several years of low pay on rolling monthly or yearly contracts before you get a sniff of a post as a lecturer, never mind a professorship, and I also know people who've gone into private work in the pharmaceutical industry getting paid GBP50k+ for a 6 month contract, straight off a masters course. Sure, that's an extreme example but people in academia accept lower pay in order to be able to pursue science, rather than merely what is profitable, for their own intellectual satisfaction and the benefit of others.\n\n \n I forgot that you're in the UK. Here in the states, our educators make good money. The average tenured teacher w/MA for k-12 in my district makes <$60k for 9 months work. \n The only \"poor\" educators that I know work in parochial schools and are typically not licensed.\n \n And here's a truism that has been relayed throughout the country.\n \"Those who can, DO. Those who can't, TEACH.\"\n Since we're not quite as socialist as your country, the best and the brightest here typically follow the benjamins. ;)\n What that means is that the talented technical folks generally go into industry and leave the Ivory Towers to be filled with those that can't take the pressure of having to produce day in and day out.",

These scientists, many of whom are current and former participants in the UN IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), criticized the climate claims made by the UN IPCC and former Vice President Al Gore. \n \n The new report issued by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's office of the GOP Ranking Member details the views of the scientists, the overwhelming majority of whom spoke out in 2007. \n \n Even some in the establishment media now appear to be taking notice of the growing number of skeptical scientists. In October, the Washington Post Staff Writer Juliet Eilperin conceded the obvious, writing that climate skeptics \"appear to be expanding rather than shrinking.\" Many scientists from around the world have dubbed 2007 as the year man-made global warming fears \"bite the dust.\" (LINK) In addition, many scientists who are also progressive environmentalists believe climate fear promotion has \"co-opted\" the green movement. (LINK) \n \n \n This blockbuster Senate report lists the scientists by name, country of residence, and academic/institutional affiliation. It also features their own words, biographies, and weblinks to their peer reviewed studies and original source materials as gathered from public statements, various news outlets, and websites in 2007. This new \"consensus busters\" report is poised to redefine the debate. \n \n Many of the scientists featured in this report consistently stated that numerous colleagues shared their views, but they will not speak out publicly for fear of retribution. Atmospheric scientist Dr. Nathan Paldor, Professor of Dynamical Meteorology and Physical Oceanography at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, author of almost 70 peer-reviewed studies, explains how many of his fellow scientists have been intimidated. \n \n \n .: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works :: Minority Page :. \n",

Obama fashions a government of many czars | U.S. | ReutersObama fashions a government of many czars\n Fri May 29, 2009 4:14pm EDT \n By Steve Holland - Analysis\n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Name a top issue and President Barack Obama has probably got a \"czar\" responsible for tackling it.\n \n A bank bailout czar? Herb Allison. Energy czar? Carol Browner.\n \n There's a drug czar, a U.S. border czar, an urban czar, a regulatory czar, a stimulus accountability czar, an Iran czar, a Middle East czar, and a czar for both Afghanistan and Pakistan, which in Washington-speak has been lumped together into a policy area called Af-Pak.\n \n There are upward of 20 such top officials, all with lengthy official titles but known in the media as czars, and next week there will be one more, when Obama appoints a czar for cyber-security who will be charged with improving the security of computer networks.\n \n \"In short, America's economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cyber-security,\" Obama said on Friday.\n \n Experts say Obama's reliance on czars can be helpful by focusing attention on a big issue and making someone responsible for it, but that it can also lead to turf fights and add another cumbersome bureaucratic layer.\n And even though this term was first used during the Reagan administration, a little research gives us the originator of the term and lo and behold, it was then Senator Joe Biden, the current vice president. Drug czar - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Drug Czar is an informal name for the person who directs drug-control policies in the United States. The 'czar' title was first used to refer to an appointed government official in a Time Magazine article in December 1973, referring to William E. Simon's appointment as the head of the Federal Energy Administration.[1] The 'drug czar' title was first published in a 1982 news story quoting Joe Biden by United Press International which reported that &#8220;Senators... voted 62-34 to establish a &#8216;drug czar&#8217; who would have overall responsibility for U.S. drug policy.&#8221;[2] Since then, several ad hoc executive positions in both the United States and United Kingdom have been established which have been subsequently referred to in this manner.\n \n On May 14, 2009, President Obama's new Drug Czar: Gil Kerlikowske, called for end to the 'War on Drugs'.[3]\n So, to summarize, the Czar label never was a creation of republicans at all. It was a Joe Biden creation and a Media promoted term originally. And only in this administration has it been adopted in the way we see it being used to centralize power and authority over specific issues.

   "\n So, to summarize, the Czar label never was a creation of republicans at all. It was a Joe Biden creation and a Media promoted term originally. And only in this administration has it been adopted in the way we see it being used to centralize power and authority over specific issues. Now apologize to rider and clean up your ghetto language for once in your life.\n\n \n Huh. \n \n http://firedoglake.com/2009/07/30/eric-cantor-all-of-george-w-bush%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98czars%E2%80%99-were-totally-fine-but-obama%E2%80%99s-really-XXXX-me-off/\n \n Looks to me like Bush had at least 18 Czars.

   "Yes, their assessments and analyses are distributed between governments. Intergovernmentally! You in turn have missed the references to science, scientific, and scientists. (thousands of them!) emoticon_xgood\n\n \n I apologize for the long delay. I missed this after returning from vacation.\n \n The IPCC is a UN GOVERNMENTALLY-populated organization. \n Here's a list of their participants from \"IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories\"\n http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gp/english/A4_Participants.pdf\n \n Note the number of non-scientists and career policy wonks that populate the list.\n \n Here's the description of the organization from its website.\n \"The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change is the leading body for the assessment of climate change, established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic consequences.\n \n \n \n The IPCC is a scientific body. It reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change. It does not conduct any research nor does it monitor climate related data or parameters. Thousands of scientists from all over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC on a voluntary basis. Review is an essential part of the IPCC process, to ensure an objective and complete assessment of current information. Differing viewpoints existing within the scientific community are reflected in the IPCC reports.\n \n \n The IPCC is an intergovernmental body, and it is open to all member countries of UN and WMO. Governments are involved in the IPCC work as they can participate in the review process and in the IPCC plenary sessions, where main decisions about the IPCC workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted, adopted and approved. The IPCC Bureau and Chairperson are also elected in the plenary sessions.\n \n Because of its scientific and intergovernmental nature, the IPCC embodies a unique opportunity to provide rigorous and balanced scientific information to decision makers. By endorsing the IPCC reports, governments acknowledge the authority of their scientific content. The work of the organization is therefore policy-relevant and yet policy-neutral, never policy-prescriptive.\n IPCC - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [/quote]\n \n How many scientific organizations are you a member of in which governments get \" participate in the review process and in the IPCC plenary sessions, where main decisions about the IPCC workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted, adopted and approved.\" ?\n \n I've never been involved in any scientific body that relied on governmental approval of articles, reports, etc.,",
