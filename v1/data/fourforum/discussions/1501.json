But let us remember that they are human. They have not been removed of their humanness this side of heaven. I simply state that as far as sin goes, you and I have been (past tense with future implications) cleansed of sin. That is the miracle of the cross and resurrection. The sacrifice of Jesus was acceptable. \n \n As for Mary, I stated that I found nothing biblical that showed that Mary was without sin. She at least was not born without sin. I have not considered the possibility that she was sanctified prior to her receiving Jesus into her womb. I will have to study on that point and consider it further. So, lets leave that part open for now.\n \n Also, I see no biblical basis for her assumption into heaven.",

I stated that I would consider it and get back to you. Not done yet.\n \n As for the biblical statement, I simply stated it as a fact and made no statement concerning tradition or anything to that effect. \n \n As I recall, I said Mary was special as were many others. I then said that you and I have also been sanctified by the blood of Christ. We also have a special call of God in our lives. God created each person uniquely and with a divine purpose. A DIVINE purpose. That is pretty special. Is Mary worthy of Honor, Yes. The same honor due montalban, No. Is Montalban due Honor, Yes. The same no, but honor none the less as you are a child of GOD. Remember John says, \"Behold what manner of Love the Father has given unto us that we should be called Children of God.\" The word behold means to look at this and consider it deeply. \n \n We are not worthy because of anything we have done, neither was Mary.

It couldn't have been.\n \n Thus the last words of the last gospel are the pointer back to tradition.\n \n I do believe the greatest handicap for accepting tradition, as faced by Protestants, is that once you open up to the possibility, then you'll probably need to abandon some Protestantism. Because, Tradition states that the Church was established by Christ, to act in His name.
