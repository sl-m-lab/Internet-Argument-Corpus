   "To all of you that thought I was nuts for saying that the whole Global Warming farce was nothing but an attempt to redistribute wealth from the haves to the have-nots, here's some more proof that I'm right.\n \n\n DECEMBER 17, 2009, 10:45 A.M. ET \n Clinton: U.S. Ready to Join Climate-Aid Fund \n By SPENCER SWARTZ and STEPHEN POWER \n COPENHAGEN -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday proposed that major economies including the U.S. come up with $100 billion a year over the next decade for developing nations to fight climate change, an eleventh hour effort to break an impasse here on climate-change talks.\n Arriving only hours earlier in the Danish capital, Mrs. Clinton said the plan -- which is dependent on reaching \"a strong accord\" by the end of the summit -- would entail public and private money, but declined to specify precisely how it would be divided or what would be the U.S share.\n Mrs. Clinton also emphasized that the US would not commit to the plan if all major economies don't commit to various provisions, including carbon-emission reductions that are verifiable and transparent.\n \"If there isn't a commitment for transparency of some sort, that would be a dealbreaker,\" she said to a packed hall of journalists.\n The U.S. proposal received a cautious greeting from other players at the summit. It was seen as an encouraging sign by the U.K. and some African nations that would benefit from the additional funding. But China, one of the most powerful players here, sounded a more dour note, with a spokesman for the Chinese delegation saying: \"At first glance, we don't see the U.S has made much progress in its commitments.\"\n Mrs. Clinton's announcement represents a major tactical shift by the Obama administration. Until now, the administration has declined to publicly specify how much money it thinks rich countries should have to commit to poor countries to help them fight climate change. Administration officials have at times said they don't want to prejudge the issue, because legislation that would help raise money for such a cause remains stuck in the U.S. Senate.\n Clinton: U.S. Ready to Join Climate-Aid Fund - WSJ.com \n\n \n The true global socialist agenda is finally being exposed. Under the guise of global climate change, our socialist Sec of State wants the US to give huge sums of money to the Third World every year for the next decade. Now tell me, if you were governing a country that had a million starving people in it and you were given $Billions, what would you do with the money? Build wind farms or feed the poor?emoticon_rolleyes",

Or we could spend it bailing out wasteful financial institutions that are \"too big to fail\". Or we could spend it on \"important groundbreaking healthcare legislation\" that still leaves millions without insurance and gives a big corporate BJ to the insurance industry. \n \n Point being JP, many people don't believe we need to be in Iraq/Afghanistan, many don't feel that we should have bailed out the banks and auto companies, many don't feel that the healthcare legislation is worth the paper it is printed on...but we spent BIG money on all of them, and will continue far into the future. \n \n Now I know you don't believe in AGW, but that's ok, I believe enough for the both of us. I also understand that given the rise of much of the third world nations, the pollution generated during the industrial revolution in the US is going to look like the good 'ole days. This pollution in turn is going to result in accelerated global warming, which in turn will lead to destruction of farm lands and agriculture, which as you may be able to surmise, leads to...millions more starving people.",

Either outcome is pretty unrealistic. The problems is it will likely just be more likely perks for El Presidente like beach villas and a new Rolls, and more income for said-countries quietly keeping the drug exports going and counter-revolutionaries equipped.\n\n \n They'll have to make at least a token effort to look like they aren't just squandering all of the money.
