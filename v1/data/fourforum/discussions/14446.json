   "The following timeline seems to suggest when the idea of Moral hazard (definition=occurs when a party insulated from risk may behave differently than it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk) was first introduced (& marketed & sold as sound economic theory) to the American people:\n \n \nThe S&L Crisis: A Chrono-Bibliography:\n \n 1966-1979 Market interest rates fluctuate with increasing intensity and S&Ls experience difficulty with each interest rate rise. Interest rate ceilings prevent S&Ls from paying competitive interest rates on deposits. Thus, every time the market interest rates rise, substantial amounts of funds are withdrawn by consumers for placement in instruments with higher rates of return. This process of deposit withdrawal (\"disintermediation\") and the subsequent deposit influx when rates rise (\"reintermediation\") leaves S&Ls highly vulnerable. Concurrently, money market funds become a source of competition for S&L deposits. S&Ls are additionally restricted by not being allowed to enter into business other than accepting deposits and granting home mortgage loans. \n \n 1967--State of Texas approves major liberalization of S&L powers. Property development loans of up to 50% of net worth are allowed. \n 1972--Hunt Commission recommendations would have created federal savings banks to replace S&Ls. The banks would have had additional authority to make commercial loans and invest in commercial paper. \n \n 1973--FINE Study would have granted same powers for S&Ls as for banks, including checking accounts. Also recommends consolidation of the regulators. Interest rate insurance was recommended if S&Ls are to remain primarily involved in housing finance. \n \n 1978--Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978 enacted. Weak version of previous recommendations. Allows S&Ls to invest up 5% of assets in each of land development, construction, and education loans. \n \n 1979--Doubling of oil prices. Inflation moves into double digits for second time in five years. \n \n 1980-1982 Statutory and regulatory changes give the S&L industry new powers in the hopes of their entering new areas of business and subsequently returning to profitability. For the first time, the government approves measures intended to increase S&L profits as opposed to promoting housing and homeownership. \n \n ... & so on up to the present day ...\n FDIC: The S&L Crisis: A Chrono-Bibliography\n\n \n If I'm not mistaken, one of the results of the S&L Crisis was the son of the then VPUSA at the tume, Neil Bush, narrowly avoided jailtime on criminal charges but had to pay fines as the result of a civil suit. Of course the fines were not nearly as much as what he gained.\n \n Again, who hit the jackpot? Again, who got sold down the river?\n \n Fool me once ...",
