   "The United States should not enter a war unless it is willing to use the atomic bomb. It did so in Korea and Vietnam. 90,000 lives were lost. 2,700 lives have now been lost in Iraq. This must end. North Korea has tested a nuclear weapon and stated that U.N. sanctions are a declaration of war. The United States must fortify itself against nuclear threat. North Korea as well as Iran must understand they will face massive retaliation if they start a nuclear war. They will face annihilation as Japan would have had it not heeded the warning of Harry Truman. \n \n Iran is headed in the direction of nuclear weapons. There are 30 nuclear sites around Iran. Ahmadinejad, the Iranian leader, has ignored requirements set forth by the United Nations. It may be imperative for the United States to bomb Iranian nuclear sites in 2007. Secretary of State Rice may assume Colin Powell's role in issuing the ultimatum. \n \n Jim Colyer http://www.jimcolyer.com",

   "I guess they don't teach history in American schools anymore.\n Japan wanted to surrender all summer but Truman wouldn't let them. He wanted to throw the bomb to intimidate Stalin.\n\n \n Very, very simplistic. The US demanded an unconditional surrender. The Japanese wouldn't accept it. The losers don't get to dictate terms. Furthermore certain elements of the Japanese high command wanted to surrender. Many did not. Lastly Japan didn't even surrender after the first bomb was dropped. It still took them 3 days and another bomb to make that decision.\n \n \n \nIf you actually had a brain (or a good school system) you would know that to enrich uranium to weapons grade, Iran needs many many more centrifuges.\n\n \n Having a brain doesn't automatically make one privvy to information on uranium enrichment. I don't imagine most school systems spend much time on the subject either. But as you are the expert perhpas you could tell us if the 3000 centrifuges the IAEA stated that Iran was planning to install, would be sufficient? Or how much of the 85 tonnes of uranium hexafluoride Iran currently has in its possession, would be needed?\n \n \nIt would be quite easy to monitor that using spy satellites, there's no way for Iran to hide that.\n\n \n Like North Korea you mean?\n \n \nNow considering the fact that the IAEA stated that the US report on Irans nuclear activities was essentially a pile of bovine excrement, it's quite easy to see that the US wants war no matter what.\n\n \n They also stated that they couldn't guarantee that Iran's programmes were for peaceful means - they merely couldn't say for sure that they were for military programmes.

COME ON.\n\n \n The point is, what if Iran does an Iraq? What if they kick out the inspectors (which they could easily do). Given the fractured nature of the security council and the current deployment of many troops, it could easily take over a year to be in a position to do anything about it. Effectively the UNSC would be powerless to do anything about it.\n \n \nThat is the second half of the ElBaradei quote from which you are drawing your material.

Turns out that is becuase it did not exist.\n\n \n Actually they delivered tonnes of contradictory information which pointed to several thousand tonnes of missing weaponry. The likely explanation is that it deteriorated or was destroyed without the knowledge of inspectors but you'd need to be pretty sure.\n \n \nIn the real world, most experts are saying that Iran probably does nto have a weapons program, because it would not make sense for it to have one. Until they can enrich uranium, they have no program (unless they switch to a plutonium based weapon strategy).\n\n \n There's a lot more to making a \"bomb\" than simply having the uranium.
