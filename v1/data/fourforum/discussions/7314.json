   "I have been trying to help a family that regularly visits one of the food pantries my wife and I are involved in. It is kind of a sad case. The guy and his wife were both middle management at the local Modine plant. It closed, and they both lost their jobs. At the same time that the Modine plant closed, there were 600 layoffs from other companies (modine laid of 1200 people). This made the local job market extremely competitive and neither the guy nor his wife was able to find work. They were making about $180,000.00 combined.\n \n They ended up selling their house to avoid foreclosure, and moved into their 5th wheel camper on a relatives land. They have sold off most of what they own to pay debts, and he had to take a job on the line at another plant in town at $28,000 per year. Not good times.\n \n Anyway, they recently got a notice stating that their camper was going to be seized and sold to pay debts. The camper is not surety for the note in question (they own the camper straight out). \n \n I spoke with an attorney that is in Rotary with me and he thought the best course of action for this guy would be chapter 7. While there are a lot of hops you have to jump through to go chapter 7 anymore, and the valuation of assets is completely different, you CAN still do it. He sent all the needed paperwork over to me with information about how to fill it out and file it. \n \n I took it to the guy, who filled out the paperwork, took the stupid online credit class, and did all that great stuff. Today I took him up to Topeka to file his papers. There is a $275 filing charge, but you can fill out either a request to have it waived, or a request to pay it in installments. He filled out the request to pay it in installments. As he handed it over to the lady, she said \"Are you sure you can't pay your filing fees up front\". The guy told her \"I don't have that much money\".\n \n She reached around the partition and tapped on a credit card sign and said \"we take all major credit cards\".\n \n What kind of idiot company gave a bankruptcy court a merchant account to accept credit cards? It said right on the receipt \"Federal Bankruptcy Court\". So you pay your bill with a credit card, then go on in and wipe out the debt. What a deal! There is something incredibly ironic about having your credit card company pay for your bankruptcy filing.",

If so, you must file chapter 13. Over 97% of people who previously filed for cahpter 7 would still be eligible under the new guidelines.\n \n BAnkruptcy judges have in the past routinely denied chapter 7 bankruptcy for people who they found could afford a chapter 13, and using standards more lax than those currently codified. \n \n If you qualify for chapter 7, you still get all your debts wiped out.",
