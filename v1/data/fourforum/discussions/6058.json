Think about this: it probably feels more natural for a child to chew with his or her mouth open as well, and one could also argue that teaching them to not chew with their mouth open could send them the message they are bad or wrong for doing it. And there's no advantage from the standpoint of harm in teaching them to chew with their mouth closed. Yet parents do this all the time. I think the real issue is that parents should, no matter WHAT they teach them, do it in a way that fosters self-esteem and self-worth in the child. Even if they DO teach them to write with a different hand. \n \n But I also think that unless there is quantifiable child abuse going on, society should never force parents to raise a child a certain way or force a parent to teach or not teach certain things. Parents have to be free to parent the way they feel they should, as long as there is not quantifiable child abuse going on.",

   "Another factor is that determining a child's sexual attractions* is not an easy thing to do prior to puberty.

It seems there is a leap going on here from saying 'here's a different way' to 'you are defective.' One doesn't necessarily mean the other.\n\n \n Well, you're right about that; it isn't always bad to teach children to do things a different way. But I think that there is a difference when we get into aspects of preference. For example, although a child might like to chew with his mouth open, but it isn't a very traumatic or important preference by any stretch of things. When we start getting into telling our children who they love or don't, we are dealing with telling someone to act against one of the strongest preferences an individual is capable of having. This is likely to be traumatic, while stopping a child from chewing with his mouth open is not.\n \n Remember that the original question was whether there could be any negative side effects of changing a natural tendency, and this is a negative side effect that is certainly possible.\n \n \nSo what do you suggest we do with pedophiles? Or do you think it's a learned behavior?\n\n \n Well, in my opinion, engaging in pedophilia is a behavior, though the attraction is a natural preference. Trauma may result from teaching a pedophile not to have sex with a child and that he cannot have a relationship with the person he loves until that person gets older. However, that emotional distress is a lesser harm than allowing an individual to have sex with a child.",

It should be nothing less than impossible for parents to rid their child of such a preference.

   "similarly, there is nothing the parent can do to make a child grow to dislike the comfort he gets from thumbsucking... or is there...?\n \n at the early stages of a person's life, the parent has a huge input in influencing their child's values. even moreso, continually forcing the child to do things in a certain way, whether they value it or not, creates the habit to do things that way in the child. eventually, as the child grows more self-aware, they may learn to appreciate the way they were taught to do things, justifying it as \"they've always done it that way\". soon enough, it is common for them to convince themselves that the way they do things (i.e., the way they were taught from young) is their \"natural way\" of doing things, and the habit is so physically and mentally comfortable for them that they would fail change it even if they really wanted to.\n \n even as an adult, with the ability to congitively make decisions, habits like these are almost impossible to change. they usually require advanced psychological techniques (therapy, hypnosis, verbal reprogramming, etc) which are difficult, time consuming and not guaranteed.\n \n it still does not change the fact that the individual was not born that way.\n\n \n I wouldn't say that an adult not wanting to suck his thumb is the result of a parent's reprogramming of the child at an early age, I would say that the parents simply stop their child from sucking his thumb until he gets to an age where his preference for sucking things vanishes as a result of genetics.\n \n There may be some behaviors which are taught at an early age by parents, but the difficulty to change those behaviors may result from the adult's preference to do things the easiest way, to exert the least energy, and to put in the least thought.\n \n \ni'm not saying that this is the case with homosexuality or all types of behaviors, but from the individual's perspective it is virtually impossible to tell the difference between a trait they learned from very young and a trait they feel they were born with\n\n \n This may be, but in the case of homosexuality, for example, children are learning precisely the opposite of homosexuality, yet they are still becoming homosexual. That alone is strong evidence suggesting that homosexuality is a trait one is born with, not one that is learned at an early age.\n \n \ntelling yourself \"Aah people will hate me\" is precisely what self-loathing is. you have a preconceived notion on what you think others will think based on what you think about yourself\n\n \n But I have a very high opinion of myself, borderline arrogance, even, though I try not to think myself better than anyone else. Well, not my physical appearance, but you get the idea. I'm not worried that people will hate me because I think I'm worthless, I'm worried that people will hate me because, well some probably will. Or at least they'll disapprove of me or look at me in a different light. It threatens to become my master status. The last thing I want is for anyone to treat me like a bisexual person instead of just a person.\n \n \nwe seem to be forgetting that all these \"harmful\" side effects we are discussing are entirely based on our perception of society's expectations of us. people are taught to be dependent on social approval, and therefore have a impulsive urge to \"fit in\". in the case of homosexuality, they seek social approval, not by conforming to the established social norms, but by creating a pressure that causes society to accomodate them. the result is the same, the need of fittin in being fulfilled\n\n \n There is a need to fit in, probably taught by society as a method to fulfill some of our natural preferences. However, shouldn't the fact that most gay people are not conforming, but are creating pressure to cause society to accept them indicative that they probably cannot change?\n \n \ni personally would rather people not be needy for social acceptance and accept themselves, but the system is nearly fool-proof by design. parents teach their kids to act according to the social order, perpetuating the dependence syndrome\n\n \n I would rather people accept themselves instead of conforming for social acceptance, that is certain, but in those cases it is necessary to put pressure on society to change, for if you are not accepted by society, you will suffer in it.\n \n \nin my opinion, the \"negative\" side effects mentioned are completely imaginary and subjective. i have yet to see an example of a single objective negative effect of forcing a child to change teir \"natural tendencies\"\n\n \n I, on the other hand, would argue that it is impossible to change someone's natural tendencies, and pressure to do so is the cause of depression and suicide, as suggested by my comments on the negative effects of teaching someone sexual behaviors contrary to his natural preferences.",

   "* PROVING A NEGATIVE  \n (The Objectivist Newsletter, April 1963) \n \"Proving the non-existence of that for which no evidence of any kind exists. Proof, logic, reason, thinking, knowledge pertain to and deal only with that which exists. They cannot be applied to that which does not exist. Nothing can be relevant or applicable to the non-existent. The non-existent is nothing. A positive statement, based on facts that have been erroneously interpreted, can be refuted--by means of exposing the errors in the interpretation of the facts. Such refutation is the disproving of a positive, not the proving of a negative.... Rational demonstration is necessary to support even the claim that a thing is possible. It is a breach of logic to assert that that which has not been proven to be impossible is, therefore, possible. An absence does not constitute proof of anything. Nothing can be derived from nothing.\" \n \n Doubt must always be specific, and can only exist in contrast to things \n which cannot properly be doubted. \n \n Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\n http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/7695/FALLACYS.HTM#237",

   "Among the improvements: they made clear that Love in Action Refuge (yes, as numerous threaders pointed out, this makes them LIARs) is NOT a registered mental health clinic -- only one counselor is licensed. (And I assume that counselor could be reprimanded or lose their license for engaging in therapy that the APA has condemned. Perhaps they're only licensed by the state?) Since it ISN'T a mental health clinic, I still take issue with CNN describing chat sessions as \"group therapy.\" Shouldn't group therapy be reserved only for sessions led by a professional? Is the only licensed therapist always present at every session? If not, it doesn't deserve this patina of professional respectability -- especially since what they practice has been condemned by every reputable medical and mental health organization in the country as dangerous, wrong, and potentially extremely damaging.\n \n They still incorrectly describe the leader Rev. Smid [what a name!] as \"rejecting homosexuality,\" a claim these fringe groups know they can no longer pretend to make -- even Rev. Smid doesn't claim he's now straight, just that he won't act on those desires. Again, it's important to note that just a few years ago they lied and said people could choose to be straight and that being gay was merely a choice. Society is so far beyond such idiocy, today even the far right doesn't trot that lie out anymore. Even the IDs of the people who went through the program are poorly thought out: two young men interviewed are labeled \"graduate,\" which again gives this sketchy organization that is seriously condemned by the entire medical community an air of seriousness it doesn't deserve. You can't graduate from a scam.\n \n All the footage used was presumably shot the first time around. But what a difference a day makes. With the new emphasis on facts and the overwhelming medical opinion about this fraud, they even used a better quote from Dr. Drescher of the APA than the one they used the first night. \"These people [the teens being told by their parents they should be ashamed of the way they were born] are in a lot of pain and desperate,\" says Drescher. \"This movement preys on that desperation.\"\n \n The real zinger: LIARs only claims that 24 people have gone through the program since it began three years ago. That tells us a lot. There's very little demand, it's extremely fringe and wildly ineffective. We know just from the two men interviewed that at least three of those 24 are happily gay and the one mild success story says he'll be attracted to men for the rest of his life and may simply try to be chaste. That's far different from their wild claims 10 years ago that being gay was a choice and anyone who wanted to could marry a woman, settle down and be happy. Of course, like all the other scams that have popped up over the years, LIARs refuses to keep track of the people it has abused by teaching them to hate the way they were born. So you can bet that out of the remaining 20 that most are happily gay or desperately miserable. Or, God forbid, dead. The charlatan running it -- Rev. Smid -- says he \"doesn't know\" how many have succeeded by his standards. He can't keep track of 24 people? That's either complete callousness on his part or more obviously he doesn't want to know.\n \n Oh and the one young man they offered up to the media -- Ben Marshall -- had to spend EIGHT MONTHS with LIARs and even he doesn't consider it a success based on what he expected -- which was to \"become\" straight. Good luck to Ben and I hope five years from now he'll be telling the media how he learned to love himself and love God at a UU or UCC or some other house of worship and what a joke this group was. Certainly I think the chances of him being happy by spending his life ashamed of the way he was born are not good.\n \n But the heart of the segment was a live one-on-one interview between Zahn and another \"graduate\" Gerard Wellman, who now works for LIARs. (Another Dickensian and ironic name for a clean-cut nice young guy -- dude, you are a well man AND a gay man; it's a pity you think you have to be ashamed of yourself). \n \n Zahn was polite but pretty darn on target. She emphasized how he is and always will be gay and that the best the program can hope is to get Wellman and others to SUPPRESS themselves. She emphasized how it's one thing for an adult like Wellman to choose to go through this and a very different thing for a minor to be forced into it. LIAR's line is that the parents have the right to raise their children any way they choose. But the response is that you have no right to assist a parent in shaming and emotionally damaging a child by telling them to be ashamed of their skin color or gender or sexual orientation. Zahn talked a lot about the vulnerability of the children being pushed through LIARs. When Wellman tried to compare this program to a parent's right to have their children take music lessons, Zahn shot him down and said that music lessons never lead to suicide attempts.\n \n My favorite moment:\n \n Zahn: But in a way, aren't you denying who you are?\n Wellman: Aren't we all?\n \n Uh, no. We're not. Only people abused by their parents and their misguided religious leaders try to deny who they are. Lead a good Christian life by being in a faithful monogamous relationship with a nice Christian guy, Wellman, not by trying to suppress who you are and second-guess God.\n \n Kudos again to Zahn for doing a much better job the second time around.\n http://www.americablog.org/",
