   "It was his tight, white jeans, snakeskin shoes and the fairy that Nima Daivari wore on a chain around his neck that prompted a stranger to call him a XXXXXX and attack him.\n \n And it was Daivari's boxing training that led him to pound back at his assailant, headlocking him until police arrived at the scene on the 16th Street Mall.\n \n What happened next is tougher to explain.\n \n A Denver cop not only refused to press charges, but he wouldn't investigate the hate crime or even bother to take the attacker's name.\n \n In the end, the bad guy slipped away, the officer was slapped on the wrist and now Daivari has lost his civil-rights case because the city says Daivari, as a gay man, has no constitutional right to require an arrest.\n \n Something is wrong with this story.\n \n \"So basically anyone can walk up, assault a gay man on a crowded street and Denver essentially ignores it. That's messed up, and people there should know it,\" says Daivari, 26, a recent law school graduate in New York City.\n \n On St. Patrick's Day 2007, he was on his first and only visit to Denver when he, his cousin and her boyfriend were walking home from dinner at a 16th Street eatery.\n \n \"What may be the most embarrassing thing is that I have to admit to everyone that I actually ate at the Cheesecake Factory,\" Daivari quips.\n \n Suddenly, a pedestrian passed by and yelled, \"Keep that XXXXXX away from me.\"\n \n \"Excuse me?\" asked Daivari, who then was punched in the head by the assailant.\n \n Daivari reacted with a few jabs of his own and held his attacker until police broke up the fight.\n \n Officer Richard Boehnlein refused Daivari's repeated demands to press charges, telling him, \"No, go home.\"\n \n Daivari's complaint resulted in a finding that the officer should have at least documented the case and probably arrested his attacker. Boehnlein was reprimanded merely with \"a fine of one regular day off.\"\n \n The city refused Daivari's settlement request that Boehnlein undergo sensitivity training.\n \n Assistant City Attorney John Eckhardt touts Denver's support for gay and lesbian rights, saying, \"The training the city provides its police officers is exemplary in these areas.\"\n \n So exemplary, in fact, that Eckhardt asserted it was \"not evident\" to police \"that Mr. Daivari is a homosexual,\" even after he told them his story.\n \n \"Come on, I look like a raging homo,\" Daivari says proudly.\n \n \"Officers must use discretion in deciding when and where (to take reports),\" Eckhardt argued in denying Daivari's claim that police inaction was a result of Daivari's \"outwardly homosexual appearance, his failure to conform to male gender stereotypes.\"\n \n U.S. District Judge Zita Weinshienk dismissed the case Thursday, holding that no rights were violated. Gay men are not a protected class under the Constitution.\n \n Says Daivari's lawyer, Jessica West: \"The city of Denver essentially claimed that gays and lesbians in Denver live without any right to police protection. I certainly hope that they are wrong.\"\n \n So should we all.\n \n Justice has failed Nima Daivari, who vows never to return to Denver.\n \n \"I would much rather they arrested the guy who attacked me so there would be a mug shot out there of him with his face ----ed up by a homo,\" he says. \"But the city deprived me that right and seems perfectly comfortable with its cops letting hate criminals beat people up and walk free.\" http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_10459273\n \n emoticon_xdonno\n Anti-gay fever is alive and well...",

   "Could it be that this poor innocent victim is setting himself up to be just that!!! A VICTIM? I mean, this isn't exactly the first time this has happened to him. And he seems to dress for gay bashing muggings rather than for success. Excuse the pun. This guy is looking for reasons to sue people as he builds a name for himself as a liar, er, I mean a lawyer. This guy is damaging the cause of true homosexual victims and here you are holding him up as an example of unfair treatment. You should be ashamed of yourself for betraying your community by supporting this fraud. emoticon_xgood Nima's NOT so excellent adventure emoticon_xdonno\n \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\"-until someone gets gay bashed\n March 13, 2008 in Uncategorized by admin | 3 comments\n A very timely thing happened to Nima Diavari last weekend. He's on vacation in Vegas. It's late. He's walking back to his hotel. And right then and there-on the neon-lit drag of the self-proclaimed \"Entertainment Capital of the World,\" Sin City, Glitter Gulch-he gets gay bashed. He doesn't fight back, but the funny thing is, this same weekend; the whole country is obsessing over brutal killing of a 15-year-old hate crime victim. Yet on that night-only a few hours away from Oxnard, CA-25-year-old Nima is experiencing the same kind of hate speech that precedes a Larry King type of murder. And I'm not convinced that a celebrity filled Logo PSA is the solution.\n So while we bloggers are sharing the new LOGO Stop Hate Crime PSA (see below), Nima is living the real thing. Here's the email he sent to friends. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the subject.\n \n ---- Forwarded message ----\n From: Nima Daivari\n Date: 08-mar-2008 13:32\n Subject: Las Vegas\n \n I just walked from Krave, which is by Planet Hollywood to the Wynn, which is where I'm staying. I was alone. I was wearing my neon yellow cardigan with no shirt underneath. The top button was undone as were the bottom two. I was wearing a black skull cap, a gold chain on my pants, three necklaces, a gold belt, and my brown, multi-tone, multi-print shoes. This is an outfit I often wear in New York, and according to my dear friend Lane, one that I wear often in LA. Yes, it's flashy, but hey, this is Las Vegas.\n \n Along the way back to the hotel, I was called a XXXXXX so many times (that I heard) that I lost count. I was harassed by two marines so incessantly that a black man next to me started screaming at them \"This isn't the Third Reich, shut the #### up\" to which they started responding and the argument went back and forth. When the not-really pro-homo-but-definitely-agitated-black-man asked me why I didn't say anything, I told him that this is Vegas, everyone is drunk, the marines would just continue calling me a XXXXXX, things would get ugly, and I didn't need to deal with that while on vacation...again.\n \n I was then harassed by a drunk woman from St. Louis, Missouri who shamefully walked away after I indulged her for a while, spoke respectfully and eloquently to her, and told her I didn't want any trouble-that I was just trying to get home. Then a large black woman began harassing me with her entourage cheering her on. Again, I politely declined her request to party and whatnot and continued on.\n \n Next, a person threw a handful of change at the back of my head and yelled XXXXXX. I turned and said \"Wow, you're such a big man\" and continued on. About 2 minutes later, a man flicked a lit cigarette at me.\n \n The last thing I can recall was two security guards for Harrah's calling me a XXXXXX. I'm sure several other things occurred between Harrah's and the Wynn, but they escape me at this time.\n \n While perhaps after the first few comments another person would have buttoned up a bit or jumped in a cab, I refused to do so. Stupid? Probably, but I'm so over all this I can't even begin to describe the gamut of emotions I'm going through.\n \n This is what it's like to be a flashy, out, and proud gay man.\n Just reading this account tells me this guy is setting himself up for an attack. He's being as obvious and as flamboyant as he can possibly be. And notice this description of how he was dressed before the Denver attack. It was his tight, white jeans, snakeskin shoes and the fairy that Nima Daivari wore on a chain around his neck that prompted a stranger to call him a XXXXXX and attack him. Notice a pattern? Is this guy looking to just dress well? Or is he attempting to dress as loudly and as flamboyantly as humanly possible in order to attract attention homophobes? Especially since this has happened to him before. Any rational person would seek not to stick out in such an obvious way if he wanted to truly avoid a repeat of what happened earlier. But NOOOOO, this schmuck wears a flashy fairy necklace to boot. Why not just wear a neon sign that say's \"Here I am low class homophobes, come attack me please!\"",

It is only human nature that they would consider their dress in the future in order to avoid a repeat of such an attack. But not this guy, He dresses flashier than before. So why am I supposed to empathize with him again? The negative attention is obviously more important to him than his personal physical safety. \n \n And as for your true christian remark, it is because I am a true christian that I would expect someone to dress modestly to begin with. But knowing this world we live in, I can understand a person being victimized once for his dress accidently, but when he repeats his performance on purpose a second time, it seems obvious that he has serious personal issues with attention grabbing. Sorry if that personal critique seems insensitive to you, but then again, no I'm not. emoticon_xbye",

   "Fault-of-the-perpetrators and the concept of avoiding-trouble are not mutually exclusive. It's not an either/or scenario, and there is no reason one can't be of the opinion of BOTH. This is yet another thread that has gotten off the mark, IMO, where people are defending extremes of positions that aren't even mutually exclusive. Of course it's wrong for anyone to be raped. I really don't think anyone here is arguing perpetrators be absolved of responsibility for their actions, or that they aren't at fault. And that includes bullying and attacks against gays. I think what's being pointed out here is that often people DO have some control over whether they are harmed or not. Just like you don't swim in the water when the lifeguard has warned about shark sightings. If there's a group of people who are known gay bashers, then it's still foolish to not avoid them, even if what they do is still wrong on their part. If one knows that dressing a certain way is going to have the effect of bullying somewhere, then it's STILL not a smart thing to do regardless of the fact that the bullying shouldn't take place to begin with. The fact bullies are the ones really at fault doesn't mean we should throw common sense to the wind. Yes, it is the bully's fault what he's doing, and no, the victim of the attack isn't responsible. And yes, there are cases where the victim truly is blindsided and couldn't have avoided the attack. But there IS also such a thing as 'asking for trouble', or not being smart and trying to avoid it. And that factor doesn't need to be swept under the rug, either.",

What did you mean when you said:\n \n \"...if a hot woman wore a skin tight T shirt that said \n RAPE ME!\n Please?\n \n And in short order, after leaving a bar that night she got forcibly raped by some guy, would you feel sorry for her, if later on you heard that she wore the \"same exact shirt\" and got raped again? And was making an issue about it as if she played no part in causing it? Wouldn't you say that this girl is literally asking for it...\"\n \n because I really don't see any other way to take it.

   "I think what's being pointed out here is that often people DO have some control over whether they are harmed or not.\n\n Do you understand what \"terrorism\" is?\n People who are doing something THEY HAVE EVER RIGHT TO DO, are made to curb their actions for fear of violent repercussion.\n \n The mentality works in multiple ways and plays out on multiple levels.\n Sometimes the repercussions can just be verbal attacks.\n \n I think the thing you are missing in all this is that the VICTIMS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO what they are doing, and it's because the ASSAILANTS may act in an ILLEGAL manner that you are talking about the victims not doing what they want to do.\n \n Terrorism...\n \n \n \nJust like you don't swim in the water when the lifeguard has warned about shark sightings.\n\n Here is where you reveal one huge problem with the situation.\n You liken the assailants to \"sharks\".\n And I AGREE with the association, cause sharks are not interested in other people's rights. They are single-minded.\n \n Quite frankly, my solution to the situation is to IDENTIFY WHO are the sharks so they can be dealt with. Whether they be Christian gay-bashers or whatever, the AMERICAN ideal is to PROTECT rights.\n NOT to make minorities restrict themselves cause otherwise they might get hurt.\n \n In America, we PROTECT people against human sharks.\n NOT ask that humans be somebody else because they could get assaulted.\n \n \n \nIf there's a group of people who are known gay bashers, then it's still foolish to not avoid them, even if what they do is still wrong on their part.\n\n And here's another problem.\n This guy was just WALKING AROUND IN DENVER.\n It's not like he went to Fred Phelps' church and sat in the front pew.\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n Both you and Archie are throwing common sense out the window for SOME SEMBLANCE of a way to attack the gays and criticize the gays.\n I say NO!\n If the \"gay\" person involved was doing something he should have EVERY RIGHT TO DO, then it's only helping the assailants by attempting to criticize the gays...\n \n \n We do NOT live in a society where others DEFINE what is \"asking by trouble\" because a minority group is doing something they HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO.\n We've been through these periods of history before.\n They were called \"uppity\" when the blacks did things that they had EVERY RIGHT to do, when others would demand (for NO reason beyond prejudice and bigotry) that they CURB THEIR RIGHTS...\n \n \n Earlier, I asked about what would happen regarding Christians in the Middle-East, when the mentality of the \"society\" there is to have some aggressive attacks against Christians...\n I still have not recieved an answer.\n \n When blacks had problems cause whites didn't like the blacks doing things the whites didn't want them to do, the solution WAS NOT to make the blacks cater to the bigotted whims of the racists. emoticon_xdonno",

   "Archie, let's try a different question.\n \n What if you were attacked by someone who didn't like christians because . . \n \n 1) you were wearing your favourite cross or crucifix.\n \n or\n \n 2) they saw you coming out of your local church.\n \n Would you be prepared to . . \n \n 1) stop wearing your favourite cross or crucifix?\n \n 2) stop going to church?\n \n Would you be prepared to stop wearing something you like, or stop going where you like going in order to avoid further attacks?\n \n If not, then you would be doing exactly the same as the gentleman you are berating for continuing to wear clothes that he likes wearing. It would be wrong of him (or you) to change his life just because there are ignorant homophobes (or anti-christians) lurking around out there. If he chooses to hide his nature in order to placate these XXXXXX then he would be reinforcing their behaviour. You cannot challenge the antisocial behaviour of a few obhorant people by hiding from them. You have to confront them and that is exactly what this gentleman is doing. He has every right to be proud of who and what he is. You should be applauding him for his behaviour, but we all know which side of the fence you're on and the true reasons for your untenable attitude.\n \n Smiley",

   "Ok Archangel and jyoshu: what do you feel gay people and women should be wearing when walking down the street, so we can feel safe?\n \n Is a tight T-shirt acceptable, even if it's refreshingly on \"gasp\" a man with a great body? What colours are acceptable or to be avoided? Should gay men stick to dark, \"manly\" straight fascist hues? What about hairdos? Can we tell a gay one from a straight one? \n \n It's no wonder that gay men and women don't feel safe, with these attitudes, which are wrong to put any responsibility on the victim.\n \n I had an experience. I was walking down the street late last New Year's Eve, on my way to a party. I had on a black leather jacket that was probably too light for January, but looked great. My short hair was dyed blond at that time, as many straight or gay men do, today, of course. I wasn't wearing a toque and it was blowing in the wind. I had on dark, relaxed fit jeans and no jewellery at all. I heard from a loser in a passing truck, \"ha, ha, ha, you're (expletive) gay!\" Nothing else happened. It did disturb me, and gave me the sense of not being safe. This is probably similar to the anxiety many women feel.\n \n The problem is with the basher's own personal insecurities being projected onto others. Anything can be a trigger. Sometimes the person may be gay, or may not be. However, the problem isn't with the victim and how he or she expresses personal tastes in grooming or fashion, or who they are.",

Look, you can wear what you want. If you want to wear a toga down the street, knock yourself out.
