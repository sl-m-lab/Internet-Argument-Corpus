Many of them have posted on this forum how they want to physically wretch when they see a man and a woman kissing or otherwise showing each other affection in public.\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Really?.......... Well maybe it's because it's not normal to the homosexuals that you speak of. Maybe they are violated for viewing something that is not normal........to them. However I did not mention anything about public affection. The mere fact that someone is gay is enough for a number of straight folks to take issue. I don't know of any gay people that take issue with heterosexuals for being heterosexual. There must be some, but I have never run across any. Perhaps life has taught most gay people how NOT to treat others, or perhaps they realize that heterosexuals can't help what they are, and decide to accept them for who they are. What a revolutionary concept. \n \n \n \n Archangel\n But to answer your question directly, the reason why there isn't straight reparative therapy is because it is innately known and understood within the human race that to be a heterosexual is to be normal in ones sexual proclivities. \n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Your statement is only true when applied to heterosexualty and heterosexuals. Homosexuals are not attracted to the opposite sex, so sexual proclivities with the \"opposite\" sex are abnormal. Same sex encounters are perfectly normal for homosexuals when one happens to be a homosexual. That's how it works. \n \n \n \n Archangel\n That's why straight kids aren't sexually confused guilt ridden victims of suicide as homosexual kids suffer from to a higher degree.\n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n From all that I have seen and researched it is the ignorance and hostility that they experience in their \"straight\" environment that may lead some to misfortune. What about the person who has been ridiculed and ostracized for being handicapped and as a result becomes a confused guilt ridden victim of suicide? Is it because of the handicapp? No..........it has to do with the way they are treated by those around them. It is the way the handicapp is viewed, not the handicapp in and of itself. The same goes for gay kids. But like so many in this world who are not \"normal\" for one reason or another most gay people grow up happy and well adjusted in spite of it all.\n \n \n \n Archangel\n It boggles my mind that you lack the intellect to appreciate something so simple and obvious, and would dare to even ask such an infantile question. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n It boggles my mind as well that you couldn't tell that I placed this thread for the sole purpose of giggles.

   "Archangel\n That's why straight kids aren't sexually confused guilt ridden victims of suicide as homosexual kids suffer from to a higher degree.\n\n \n \nAnthony321\n From all that I have seen and researched it is the ignorance and hostily that they experience in their \"straight\" environment that may lead some to misfortune. \n\n \n This is another one of the lies told by the majority of homosexual proponents in order to further characterize and classify homosexuals as victims of a predominantly straight society. The reality is that homosexuals who have come out of the closet have a lower self negativity opinion than those who remain closeted. \n \n This is revealed in a higher suicide rate in those who internalize their homosexuality which means that it isn't the prejudice of others which causes them to commit suicide but their own personal self hatred and rejection of what they perceive to be an unchangeable and unacceptable aspect of their persona. Here's an excerpt from the study:\n Disclosure of Sexual Identity\n The degree to which one's sexuality is made public may also affect the experience of stressors. Persons who have made their sexual identities public to a large degree have significantly less internalised homonegativity, and perceive society to be less devaluing and discriminatory than those who keep it mostly personal. Internal stressors are thus greater for people who are mostly closeted. A person who has not come out may experience less social support and thereby less access to gay-positive views with which to view his sexuality in a positive light. People who are largely out of the closet are thus more able to overcome their internalised homonegativity (gay-related self-hate) than those who are mostly closeted.\n \n Not having come out also makes a person unfamiliar with the actual reactions of others. This person would therefore expect people to be more discriminatory and devaluing of homosexuality, than someone who has mostly come out. The moderate correlation between internalised homonegativity and perceived stigma suggests that a gay/bi person may be more likely to perceive society as discriminatory and devaluing of homosexuality, because he himself is prejudiced toward his homosexuality. Since greater disclosure is correlated with lowered internalised homonegativity, which is correlated with lower perceived stigma, it follows that a person out of the closet may be more likely to see others as willing to tolerate him, because he has become more able to tolerate himself.\n \n People who have greatly disclosed their sexual identity have however experienced significantly more verbal slander and threat, harassment, and physical and sexual assault, and discrimination than those who are more closeted. Yet despite the increased experience of victimisation and discrimination, the self-disclosed person holds more positive beliefs and fewer PTSD symptoms. It will also be recalled that out of the closet people also hold less internalised homonegativity. It may be postulated from this that being largely out of the closet helps a person to overcome his loathing of his sexuality, which may enable him to build resilience against the effects of being victimised for being gay. The mostly closeted person on the other hand, is more likely to be traumatised when victimised, even though he is less likely to be victimised. This increased vulnerability may be partly owing to closeted people having more internalised homonegativity and less access to support.q online - FEATURE:\n \n This study in no way minimizes the very real feelings of rejection and discrimination which some out of the closet homosexuals experience in a predominantly straight society. What it does show though is that internalizing and denying who they are is a major stressor which can't be attributed to outside abuses since nobody knows what they are going through internally nor that they are even struggling with these feelings of sexual inadequacy.\n \n PS If you don't want to be corrected on the shallowness of the thread subjects you post, then don't post nonsensical threads.",

   "This is another one of the lies told by the majority of homosexual proponents in order to further characterize and classify homosexuals as victims of a predominantly straight society.\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Is your definition of a lie, anything that you don't agree with? How is it that you cannot see any victimization by straight society? All you have to do is take a look at a number of your posts. And you claim to be part of the 96% of the population that refuses to have these homosexual people destroy this great nation. In these last few years we have seen laws passed to ban gay marriage, adoption, and civil unions. Who are the victims of this intolerance and ignorance? I'll tell you who isn't the victim,,,,,,,,,the predominantly straight society. But in your haste to save the nation you may or may not realize that gay people have straight families and straight friends as well. While no rights were repealed or denied for these straight people, we cannot say the same for their loved ones who happen to be gay.\n \n \n \n Archangel\n The reality is that homosexuals who have come out of the closet have a lower self negativity opinion than those who remain closeted. \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n The above statement is in direct conflict with your statement below.\n \n \n \n Archangel\n This is revealed in a higher suicide rate in those who internalize their homosexuality which means that it isn't the prejudice of others which causes them to commit suicide but their own personal self hatred and rejection of what they perceive to be an unchangeable and unacceptable aspect of their persona. \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n The above is your own conclusion as to why the \"closeted\" homosexuals have a higher suicide rate than those who are not \"closeted.\" The very reason these homosexuals are in the closet is because of the prejudice. Why do you suppose they perceive their sexuality as unacceptable? Because the world around them is so accepting of those who are different? Also the perception that it is unchangeable is more than a perception, it's a reality. It's a tradgedy that societal ignorance can lead some people to believe they need to repair something that does not need fixing.\n \n Disclosure of Sexual Identity\n The degree to which one's sexuality is made public may also affect the experience of stressors. Persons who have made their sexual identities public to a large degree have significantly less internalised homonegativity, and perceive society to be less devaluing and discriminatory than those who keep it mostly personal.

This person would therefore expect people to be more discriminatory and devaluing of homosexuality, than someone who has mostly come out. The moderate correlation between internalised homonegativity and perceived stigma suggests that a gay/bi person may be more likely to perceive society as discriminatory and devaluing of homosexuality, because he himself is prejudiced toward his homosexuality. \n The first half of this paragraph makes clear that the fears we have about the reality of unknown situations are not nearly as bad as the fears we carry before actually exposing ourselves to the unknown new experience. And by avoiding that reality, we add unneeded and increased stress just for avoiding it. \n Then it deduces that the cause for ones fear of coming out is his own internalized prejudice toward his homosexuality. If he can't forgive or accept himself, in his mind, he can't expect anyone else to accept him.\n \n But I agree that the article acknowledges that prejudice and discrimination still exists in the larger society. That's why I posted this section also in my post above:\n People who have greatly disclosed their sexual identity have however experienced significantly more verbal slander and threat, harassment, and physical and sexual assault, and discrimination than those who are more closeted. Yet despite the increased experience of victimisation and discrimination, the self-disclosed person holds more positive beliefs and fewer PTSD symptoms. It will also be recalled that out of the closet people also hold less internalised homonegativity. It may be postulated from this that being largely out of the closet helps a person to overcome his loathing of his sexuality, which may enable him to build resilience against the effects of being victimised for being gay. The mostly closeted person on the other hand, is more likely to be traumatised when victimised, even though he is less likely to be victimised. This increased vulnerability may be partly owing to closeted people having more internalised homonegativity and less access to support.\n And why I wrote this opinion.\n This study in no way minimizes the very real feelings of rejection and discrimination which some out of the closet homosexuals experience in a predominantly straight society.\n ===================================================================================================\n \n \nArchangel\n That's why straight kids aren't sexually confused guilt ridden victims of suicide as homosexual kids suffer from to a higher degree.\n\n \n \nAnthony321\n From all that I have seen and researched it is the ignorance and hostily that they experience in their \"straight\" environment that may lead some to misfortune. \n\n \n This is another one of the lies told by the majority of homosexual proponents in order to further characterize and classify homosexuals as victims of a predominantly straight society. The reality is that homosexuals who have come out of the closet have a lower self negativity opinion than those who remain closeted. \n \n This is revealed in a higher suicide rate in those who internalize their homosexuality which means that it isn't the prejudice of others which causes them to commit suicide but their own personal self hatred and rejection of what they perceive to be an unchangeable and unacceptable aspect of their persona. Here's an excerpt from the study:\n Disclosure of Sexual Identity\n The degree to which one's sexuality is made public may also affect the experience of stressors. Persons who have made their sexual identities public to a large degree have significantly less internalised homonegativity, and perceive society to be less devaluing and discriminatory than those who keep it mostly personal. Internal stressors are thus greater for people who are mostly closeted. A person who has not come out may experience less social support and thereby less access to gay-positive views with which to view his sexuality in a positive light. People who are largely out of the closet are thus more able to overcome their internalised homonegativity (gay-related self-hate) than those who are mostly closeted.\n \n Not having come out also makes a person unfamiliar with the actual reactions of others. This person would therefore expect people to be more discriminatory and devaluing of homosexuality, than someone who has mostly come out. The moderate correlation between internalised homonegativity and perceived stigma suggests that a gay/bi person may be more likely to perceive society as discriminatory and devaluing of homosexuality, because he himself is prejudiced toward his homosexuality. Since greater disclosure is correlated with lowered internalised homonegativity, which is correlated with lower perceived stigma, it follows that a person out of the closet may be more likely to see others as willing to tolerate him, because he has become more able to tolerate himself.\n \n People who have greatly disclosed their sexual identity have however experienced significantly more verbal slander and threat, harassment, and physical and sexual assault, and discrimination than those who are more closeted. Yet despite the increased experience of victimisation and discrimination, the self-disclosed person holds more positive beliefs and fewer PTSD symptoms. It will also be recalled that out of the closet people also hold less internalised homonegativity. It may be postulated from this that being largely out of the closet helps a person to overcome his loathing of his sexuality, which may enable him to build resilience against the effects of being victimised for being gay. The mostly closeted person on the other hand, is more likely to be traumatised when victimised, even though he is less likely to be victimised. This increased vulnerability may be partly owing to closeted people having more internalised homonegativity and less access to support.q online - FEATURE:\n \n This study in no way minimizes the very real feelings of rejection and discrimination which some out of the closet homosexuals experience in a predominantly straight society. What it does show though is that internalizing and denying who they are is a major stressor which can't be attributed to outside abuses since nobody knows what they are going through internally nor that they are even struggling with these feelings of sexual inadequacy.",

   "First of all Jake, I'm not propagating anything at all.\n\n \n Whatever you want to call it, your take on it is ridiculous. Way out of bounds!\n \n \nI'm correctly interpreting\n\n \n No, you are suggesting something that isn't there. Internalized prejudices like homophobia come from the EXTERNAL society, come from OTHERS. It is taught to the gay person.\n \n \na secular study published by a gay web site in South Africa, here: q.co.za - our world our way and here once again is the link to the specific info I posted: q online - FEATURE: I\n\n \n Where it comes from isn't the issue, your interpretation is.\n \n \nhave also posted both of my prior posts on this subject below as evidence that the only person here who has brought the bible or God into this discussion is YOU. Not once have I held anyone to christian ethics or values in discussing this study.\n\n \n \nBut to answer your question directly, the reason why there isn't straight reparative therapy is because it is innately known and understood within the human race that to be a heterosexual is to be normal in ones sexual proclivities. That's why straight kids aren't sexually confused guilt ridden victims of suicide as homosexual kids suffer from to a higher degree.\n\n \n In the above, you talk about gay kids being guilt ridden and sexually confused, because it's INNATELY KNOWN that to be heterosexual is normal. That's making a negative prejudgment on homosexuality, and a positive one for heterosexuality. We all know from previous posts that your heterosexual superiority notion comes from your belief of what God wants in the Bible. You are also erroneously trying to suggest by that quote and from further posts, that internalized homophobia is innate. Internalization comes from externalized and social elements. It's taking what's out there(external), and dealing with it internally. How one deals with it, will determine a positive or negative outcome. The gay person does not come up with the internalized homophobia if left alone, if not taught that homosexuality is bad.\n \n \nI have even admitted and acknowledged that homosexuals experience real rejection and discrimination from the larger hetero society and even then you can't accept me saying something you would insist is true under any other circumstance or said by anyone else.\n\n \n Well, of course I acknowledge this. This is where the internalized homophobia comes from. \n \n \nI invite all objective observers to read the study itself as well as my posts below and decide for themselves which of us is interpreting it with a skewed perspective.\n \n ===================================================================================================\n \n \n \n The study I posted was specifically comparing the impact on young homosexuals who hide/internalize their homosexuality as compared to young homosexuals who are open about their condition, and that it is a contributing factor for homosexual suicide. Here's the relevant section from the link.\n\n \n \nA person who has not come out may experience less social support and thereby less access to gay-positive views with which to view his sexuality in a positive light. People who are largely out of the closet are thus more able to overcome their internalised homonegativity (gay-related self-hate) than those who are mostly closeted.\n\n \n \nI found it interesting that this study acknowledges a gay related self hatred either way,\n\n \n No, that's a wild stretch of the imagination. \"More able\" to overcome, does not acknowledge that gay people always have some internalized homophobia left over after coming out. It doesn't say the internalized homophobia is an innate sense of guilt which would exist no matter what social conditioning.\n \n \nbut considers that those who acknowledge their homosexuality at least have a healthy and positive outlet for dealing with it.\n\n \n If there is a healthy way to deal with the anti-homosexuality prejudice, then there is nothing objectively negative or harmful about homosexuality. There is no innate understanding nor sense of guilt.",

They feel the social pressure because as their friends reach puberty and are attracted to girls, they understand that they aren't. They know they are different and at that point, no social pressure at all is making them feel that way. It is totally self imposed since they don't fit even their own definition of what is socially normal. That is what the study is saying, and is all I'm agreeing with as a very real symptom of their suffering. This is one very real cause for gay stress. q online - FEATURE:",

THAT'S A LOAD OF HORSE MANURE. I AM JUST RESPONDING.\n \n \nNo it isn't at all. Nothing I have said has been an attack on homosexuality since nothing I have said has been about my personal opinion of it. I'm attempting to give an historical and social overview of why it has been rejected as a cultural principle over thousands of years, and isn't just a modern perception. What year do you think the 50 or so Nations which consider homosexuality a crime punishable by Prison or Death instituted those laws? A decade ago or a thousand years ago? I rest my case on that point.\n\n \n Here we go again. You're using social examples and the law. I can point to other examples where there is gay equality. I can demonstrate examples where other groups do not have equal rights, going back a thousand years or to the beginning of patriarchy.\n \n \nIt's not speculation at all. It's an honest interpretation of what the study say's. That you refuse to acknowledge that changes nothing.\n\n \n You just keep shoveling it. The study didn't say internalized homophobia equals an innate understanding among homosexuals that homosexuality is wrong. NOWHERE DOES IT SAY THIS. PLEASE SHOW ME WHERE IT DOES! It talks about things like social supports being the deciding factor. Because it uses terms like out of the closet people are \"less likely\" to experience internalized homophobia/homonegativity, you take that as the study saying it's innate. Well, that's not so. Psychology doesn't attempt to provide ABSOLUTE ANSWERS, that's the realm of your RELIGION. Also the fact that the study says the deciding factors are variable and social in nature, does not provide for those absolutes. \n \n \nYou're in denial of the reality that children understand right and wrong, normal and abnormal. They know what feels right socially and what doesn't. That's why they suffer silently even if they live in a liberal home with parents who have no qualms about homosexuality. They feel the social pressure because as their friends reach puberty and are attracted to girls, they understand that they aren't. They know they are different and at that point, no social pressure at all is making them feel that way. It is totally self imposed since they don't fit even their own definition of what is socially normal. That is what the study is saying, and is all I'm agreeing with as a very real symptom of their suffering. This is one very real cause for gay stress. q online - FEATURE:\n\n \n Archangel, this is garbage. There's no logic here at all. How on earth can you claim the guilt is self-imposed, then say the guilt is based on what is \"considered socially normal\"? That's a contradiction. It's very obvious from the evidence that children hear homophobic comments from an early age. That's why some gay people are taught who they are is wrong, until they find social support.",

   "You speak of this as if it's just an american problem smiley. If what you say were true then homosexuality wouldn't have a history being frowned upon in the majority of societies since the beginning of communal living.\n\n Where did you get the notion that I think this is a purely american problem. At no point have I made any such intimation.\n \n And to answer your second point I shall use one of your own arguments against you. You have argued in the past that all nations that have accepted homosexuality in any shape or form have fallen. Well, all those 'majority of societies' you mention have also fallen, ceased to be, gone the way of the dodo. Why would that be?",

Only that out of the closet gays have an outlet which in the closet gays don't have.\n\n \n The article was discussing how internalized homonegativity may be overcome or not overcome as the result of social processes. No kidding, it comes from inside, that's why it's internalized. However, the fact that it's internalized, does not make it innate. Internalized prejudices are the result of outside/external social forces. Look at Jewish self-hatred, a term coined in a book by an author named Messing, in the 1930s. That's internalized, but not innate. It's the result of outside forces and culture. A long anti-semitic history, and an expectation that everyone should be Christian, or before Christianity, at least, not Jewish. That's referring back to your previous posts arguing from history. \n \n \nI take it to mean that even though out of the closet gays do receive discrimination, the positive acceptance they also receive is more beneficial to their identity than the stress placed on those who suffer all alone in quiet desperation as they hide who they are from even those who like and love them as it say's below.\n \n \n \nNot having come out also makes a person unfamiliar with the actual reactions of others.

The reason people do hide is external though, not an innate sense of guilt. The external gives the closeted gay person the feeling of guilt, or the feeling that who he or she is okay. For the ashamed and closeted, it's a feeling of not living up to societal expectations, or parental expectations, as you may have hinted at earlier. But it's all external. Naturally, that's going to be taken in by the person internalizing, and become a personal issue or problem. However, it doesn't have to be that way, as those out of the closet can attest to.",
