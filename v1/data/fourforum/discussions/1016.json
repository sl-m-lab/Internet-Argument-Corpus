That doesn't mean he isn't in our heads at all time knowing what we are thinking, and why we make decisions.... but he could only have access to thoughts and decisions as they happened. \n\n \n The contradiction of free will is actually something I misunderstood for a quite a while but now I understand it better. The way you view it is that since God knows our every move that means it must all be predetermined, right? If I were to flip a coin and God already knew it would land on heads, then that means it must have been fate that it land on heads correct? This is actually not true. Just because God already knew what side the coin would land on doesn't mean that it was fate that it land on that side although it would appear that way to us. God would be unconstrained by time though. So he could travel to the future to see what side the coin landed on and then return back to our time and tell us that it will land on heads. That way fate didn't play a role and God was still all knowing. The same would be true for a human that could travel through time. He would be able to predict the outcome of every football game for the rest of time and most people would probably think that he rigged the games or that he found a way to determine what fate had in store for the teams, but of course neither would be true.\n \n The only place where being all knowing and free will contradict is in God himself. If God already knows everything that he is going to do then he cannot have free will to change what he is going to do. However, God is all powerful as well which means that he is able to have free will if he wants it. This is a contradiction but it is on a Godly level so we cannot even know if this is a true contradiction or not since God may not be binded by time or need to do things in a particular order as we are made to do here on Earth.\n \n \nOn a side note just about my personal expectations of heaven and hell:\n \n I haven't seen any evidence of either, or any conclusive evidence that a particular God exists, and his version of the afterlife is true.

So I said a prayer asking God to leave me to whatever my fate was in not believing in him. If that means eternity in hell, so be it.\n\n \n I have a similar problem with the choosing between looking for logic and believing in faith. Faith is the complete opposite of logic as far as decision making goes. With faith your decisions and observations can be made to be true or false if you want to believe they are. With logic you get to question everything and find the true meaning behind events. You cannot have faith in God and logically be trying to determine if he exists or not because any question you have about him would be answered by your faith in him. It just doesn't work.",

   "Valid questions indeed.\n \n \n \n I find it strange that God, being all knowing, already knew long before he even considered creating the Earth or humans that Adam and Eve would of course eat from that tree if he made humans in the way the he was going to and made the garden in the way that he was going to and made his rules the way he was going to.

This is just an individual opinion and I'm just curious what your opinion is since you think damnation is eternal.\n\n \n I am afraid that I cannot answer some of your questions. They are valid and actually very deep. The concept that God did not create Sin is interesting. A full study of Hamartiology would be necessary to give a full view of sin and it's initiation. The way I understand it, God did not create it but he did create the possibility for it. Sin is not just disobediance. It is separation from God. If God did not create this possibility then free will would not exist as there would be no choice. People would simply be with God.\n \n I have said the following in another board and the people argued circularly and would not see it. Love, by definition, requires that a choice be made. If there is no choice then it is not love. It would be like me going home to my wife on her birthday and saying, \"My dear, I was forced to give you this birthday gift.\" Yucko! For it to be loving to my wife, I have to have the choice to give or not give and then to make the choice to give. God does not want automoton(sp?) obediance. He want's us to love Him. That is why the possibility of sin had to be created. \n \n Please also note from my previous post that it is not that Adam and Eve cemented it all for us. It is that they represented us. We would have done the same thing. Period. The other thing God wants is for us to depend on Him. it is why he allows us to be imperfect. Love is a process of meeting needs after all. God wants us to have needs so that He has a place to love us. \n \n Lastly, it is faith in God, not religion.\n \n As for the opinion on percentage, I could not hazard a guess. There are many that have gone before and many yet to come (I guess, I can't really predict the future). My point on judgement is that it is dangerous to even do that. God asks us to love. period. I wouldn't even know where to begin to come to a mildly educated guess on a percentage. Honestly, I am not just trying to avoid your question.",

   " I prefer to look at Hell as more of a position rather than a locality. I, unfortunately, disagree about eternal hell.\n\n Hey, don't worry. My mind on this changes quite often. I've been reading quite a few Bible verses that suggest, and outline eternal punishment, in this you are correct. My mind is open to the idea, and in good time, I hope to find the way. Perhaps not in this lifetime; but certainly in the next.\n \n I know this isn't too scientific but what percentage of the people do you think will face eternal damnation?

This is a contradiction but it is on a Godly level so we cannot even know if this is a true contradiction or not since God may not be binded by time or need to do things in a particular order as we are made to do here on Earth.\n\n Some great topics raised here. The fact is, as you have said, we cannot attempt to completely comprehend God, for if we could: we would be him! This would go pretty deep, we would have to consider God's nature. Free will is more a thing made for \"mankind\". Then this begs the question: \"do animals have free will?\", but I won't get into that.\n Anyways, I would have to presume that God does not have free-will, primarily because he cannot do something that contradicts his nature. I'll do some research, see what I can dig up.\n \n Faith is the complete opposite of logic as far as decision making goes.\n\n I would have to completely disagree with you. The world shows significant order; I cannot get myself to deny that such a world does not have a creator. It is logic, that has led me, and many others, to believe in God.\n \n As far as creating sin goes: God did not create sin. It is in contrary to his nature. Sinfulness is the complete opposite of holiness. This then begs the question, Where did it come from? I can't say that I have the answer, but I can suggest a guess, which appears to make sense to me.\n \n God created man, to love him. Now, for one to love, it cannot be forced; it would negate love. For us to love God, we must have free will, which is what we have been granted. (John 1:12-13) We have free will of the choice whether to love God. However, with this choice, we are also granted the choice to do evil and unholy deeds; and to not love God.\n \n **I just realized, reading your Post Epaphras, that you mentioned this. Hey!! I suppose great minds think alike.\n \n I agree with Epaphras, God created the possibility for sin to exist. Lucifer, Adam and Eve were all created by God, without sin. However, later, they sinned. God did not cause them to sin, we see this in James 1:13. It was by their free will that they sinned.\n \n This can be described well with the use of \"The Parent\" and \"The child\". The Parent creates the conditions for where disobedience is possible. However, the parent remains innocent from the sin. The parent bore the child; however, they did not cause the child to sin.\n \n There are some great discussions here, I just want to thank everyone for taking part....keep posting!",

I'll try to explain it:\n \n The fact that God knows what choices we will make, before we make them, does not mean that we cannot have free will. By knowing what will happen does not mean that we are preventing or causing that thing to happen. The sun will rise tomorrow. By knowing this, I am not causing it or preventing it from rising. Another example:\n \n I have watched a football game previously. I have it recorded, and I watch it again. The fact that I know exactly what a player will do, does not constrict the players of free will. \n \n Logically, God knowing what we are going to do does not mean that we can't do something else. It simply means that he already knows what we have chosen. Our freedom is neither restricted by God's knowledge; it is simply realized ahead of time.\n \n It is simpler to realize when you understand that God is transcendent (out of the space/time continuum) and not a linear entity. He is not constricted, and is outside, and inside of time.

   "SilentPoet- No worries. ;)\n \n Faith- Yep, there's that one, there are more that suggest it:\n \n And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever. \n ~Revelation 19:3 \n \n Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. \n ~Matthew 18:8 \n \n And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. \n ~Matthew 25:46\n \n There are more references like this in Jude 7, 2 Thess. 1:9 and Jude12-13.\n \n I'd just like to add in a comment I received from someone:\n \n Now, in regards to this question, the answer, if the statement were true, would be: \"It ain't fair!\" However, although the good things we do does not earn us salvation, rather it is the faith motivating those works that does, God still remembers our good works. \"God is not unrighteous,\" Hebrews 6:10 says, \"so as to forget [our] works.\" \n \n As far as eternal punishment goes, I notice some here do not believe in it. As a matter of fact, the Bible agrees. \"The wages of sin is death,\" not eternal life of suffering according, to Romans 6:23. The dead are not aware of anything, so they cannot be suffering. (Ecclesiastes 9:5; Psalm 146:4) This doesn't mean the body is dead while the soul lives on, for the Bible tells us at Ezekiel 18:4, 20 that \"the soul that sinneth shall die.\" \n \n So then, in conclusion, the way God deals with us is fair. The righteous get live forever on earth, as Matthew 5:5 says, and the unrighteous will not be here to cause them trouble, as emphasized in Psalm 37:9-11, 29 & Proverbs 2:21, 22.

As for Ezekiel's description of heaven, I am not certain that it agrees with \"our modern interpretation.\" I see heaven very differently than I did before I became a christian. I also see \"hell\" very differently. I cannot remember which minor prophet talks about ghenna. It may also be in the Psalms. \n \n I think the common idea of heaven of chubby angels and sitting on clouds if far off. My opinion of Heaven from what I get in scripture is that it is to be in the presence of God and the absence of Sin. Christians (some of them anyway) believe that we can be in the presence of God right now. However, we are not free of the presence of sin. \n \n I suppose the converse of that would mean hell is not being in the presence of God at all and always being in the presence of sin. \n \n I like this particular concept of sin. It is treated more as an entity than an action. While there are sins that are committed, The concept of sin as an entity is evident in both old and new testaments. \n \n Are you orthodx jew?
