   "Original: http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2004/01/29/006.html\n \n \n \n The Chances of Domino Democracy\n \n By Peter Bouckaert, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2004. Page 8\n \n In a rare show of interest in the Caucasus, world leaders descended on Tbilisi last Sunday to celebrate the inauguration of Georgia's new president, elected democratically after that country's \"rose revolution\" in November. I wonder if they heard President Putin's raw analysis of the relevance of Shevardnadze's ouster. According to newspaper reports, he told Georgia's acting president, Nino Burdzhanadze, that leaders all over the CIS were \"shitting in their pants.\" Anyone dreaming of the \"democracy domino effect\" in the region should watch these leaders carefully, and start by looking across the border to Azerbaijan.\n \n I spent a month in Azerbaijan documenting how the government rigged the October presidential elections and crushed the opposition afterwards. In his first three months in office, President Ilham Aliyev quickly built up a remarkable record of repression and torture. I wonder if that's the lesson regional leaders will take from the Caucasus. \n \n Despite Azerbaijan's long and public history of vote-rigging, Azeris clearly expected something different this time around. The era of Heidar Aliyev was coming to an end, the country was now in the Council of Europe and constant media ads -- sponsored by the U.S. embassy -- said that voter fraud was a crime and would not be tolerated. \n \n But even before election day, things looked decidedly undemocratic. Local authorities, appointed by the president, kept banning opposition rallies or assigned them to tiny venues. When opposition rallies did take place, they were surrounded by burly riot police who occasionally decided to bash heads. \n \n During the presidential campaign, the police beat and arrested opposition supporters for holding up political banners, putting up posters or even simply shouting the names of opposition leaders. Of course, if you decided to watch the government-controlled television channels -- considering there are no truly independent television channels in Azerbaijan, you had little choice -- you would be forgiven for failing to realize that there even was an opposition candidate.\n \n The government, determined to ensure the first dynastic succession in the post-Soviet era, was in no mood for risk on election day. The authorities, uninhibited by the large international monitoring presence, blatantly rigged the election in favor of Ilham Aliyev. One election official joked with me and his colleagues during the vote-counting that it was so much easier in the old days, when they didn't have to worry about transparent election boxes and international monitors. But they managed to overcome these pesky hurdles -- Ilham Aliyev emerged as the president, with an improbable three-quarters of the votes. The OSCE and the Council of Europe confirmed widespread fraud. \n \n Not surprisingly, political violence erupted after the election. The opposition, which had been nonviolent during the past 10 years of rigged elections and repression, took to the streets on the day after the election. Clashes with the security forces quickly turned violent. For a moment the opposition chased away the security forces and beat up a few soldiers and police who didn't manage to get away. The security forces returned in massive numbers, and the outcome was predictable.\n \n I watched from the roof of a nearby hotel as thousands of police and army troops surrounded Freedom Square, where the protesters had gathered, and began closing in on the crowd. The next half-hour was one of unimaginable violence: The security forces chased and beat whomever they could catch. Unconscious protesters were thrown on a big pile, and whoever made the slightest movement was beaten again.\n \n When they finished, the security forces raised their metal riot shields and began beating them in unison with their rubber truncheons, raising a fearsome war cry that could be heard all over the city. The forces of intimidation had won. At least one protester was dead, and some 300 wounded. \n \n But that was only the beginning. Using the post-election violence as a pretext, the government launched a massive crackdown on the opposition. Nearly 1,000 opposition supporters and leaders were arrested across the country. Also arrested were some 100 election officials and monitors who had shown the audacity to refuse to certify fraudulent election results. \n \n Many were taken to the Ministry of Interior's feared Organized Crime Unit, where they were subjected to severe torture, including beatings to the point of unconsciousness, threats of rape, and at least one documented case of electric shocks. More than 100 opposition leaders remain in prison, facing charges that could lead to up to 12 years in prison.\n \n All across the country, opposition activists and, in some cases, even their apolitical relatives were dismissed from their jobs in retaliation for their political activities.\n \n When U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld went to Baku in December to discuss military ties, he refused to answer questions on the elections and the post-election crackdown, stating that \"The United States has a relationship with this country. We value it.\" In Azerbaijan, the United States is turning President Bush's new democracy initiative on its head, favoring economic interests and \"the devil we know\" over consistency on democratic and human rights standards.\n \n But those who wish to shape the future of the Caucasus would do well to stand up to the troubling developments in Azerbaijan rather than celebrate the victory of democratic forces in Georgia. President Heidar Aliyev made sure that the \"rose revolution\" that swept Shevardnadze from power would never occur in Azerbaijan\n \n The big, peaceful crowds like those the opposition gathered in Tbilisi haven't been seen in Azerbaijan in a decade: Anyone who tries to launch even the most peaceful of opposition protests risks police violence. Freedom Square, the main plaza in the capital, has been off-limits to the opposition since Heidar Aliyev's return to power.\n \n The opposition in Georgia was able to prevent an Azerbaijan-style crackdown by carefully building a base of power within the parliament and the Tbilisi municipal authorities, but in Azerbaijan such institutions independent of presidential power simply don't exist. The presidency is all powerful, at the national as well as the local level, controlling everything from village-level administrations, the parliament and the judiciary. There are no independent television stations to ensure that the opposition viewpoint comes across, and the government-controlled channels vilify the opposition, going even as far as broadcasting \"confessions\" gathered under torture. A common slogan painted on roadside billboards sums up the Azerbaijani reality perfectly: \"Heidar is the Nation. The Nation is Heidar.\"\n \n Shevardnadze's Georgia found itself in a very different reality. Clearly, Shevardnadze also attempted to use his local cronies to rig the election in his favor during the parliamentary elections. But when the opposition came out in the streets, Shevardnadze eventually realized that its power base was too strong to simply crush by calling out the security forces -- some of whom had already joined the crowd. When he resigned, he acknowledged that a crackdown would have led to unacceptable bloodshed. In fact, it was Shevardnadze's tolerance of opposition in the parliament and the independent media that prevented him from succeeding in stealing the elections. \n \n In November I found myself in the home of a respected village leader who had played a leading role in Azerbaijan's courageous struggle against Soviet oppression. He had been arrested after the election for his support of the opposition, and subjected to electric shocks that had nearly killed him. But what bothered him most was the disappointment of his villagers, who kept telling him: \"You convinced us to fight against the Soviet Union for democracy. What democracy did you get us? We have all been fired from our jobs, there is no gas to heat our homes, and now the police keep calling us to the station. What kind of democracy is this?\" He broke down in tears, saying he had no answers.\n \n Peter Bouckaert is a senior emergencies researcher for Human Rights Watch, and author of the report, \"Crushing Dissent: Repression, Violence, and the Azerbaijan Elections.\" He contributed this comment to The Moscow Times.",
