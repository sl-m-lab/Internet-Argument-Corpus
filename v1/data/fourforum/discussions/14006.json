   "It would also make them non-Christian since they worship on Saturdays, wouldn't it?\n\n \n Can you tell me where in the New Testament it says that the Sabbath has to be done on Sunday? It's traditional, because of what was adopted by the Catholics, and kept by the protestants.. but.. is it biblical?\n \n As for that web site, let's look at it's  Statement of faith \n \n \n\n We believe that the Scriptures, both the Tenach (Old Testament) and the B'rit Chadasha (New Testament), are fully inspired and God's complete and final revelation to man until the Messiah returns. The 66 books of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation are inerrant in the original autographs. They are authoritative in every category of knowledge including faith, practice, science, and history (Proverbs 30:5-6; Isaiah 40:7-8; Jeremiah 31:31; Matthew 5:18; II Timothy 3:16; II Peter 1:21).\n \n scroll2.gif (3554 bytes) The Nature of God\n \n We believe there is only one God; we believe in the uniplurality of God as reflected in the Shema. God is the creator of all things. He is infinite and perfect, eternally existing in three equal persons, each possessing the nature and perfections of deity, as well as the characteristics of personality (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 43:10-11, Isaiah 48:16).\n \n The Father\n \n We believe in God the Father, the sovereign Ruler over all, who has chosen Israel as His unique people, and is Father of Yeshua (Jesus), the Messiah, whom He sent into the world (Exodus 4:22,; Matthew 3:17; John 1:12; 3:16; Galatians 3:26).\n \n The Son\n \n We believe God's one and only unique Son became flesh in the person of Yeshua (Jesus) of Nazareth, the promised Messiah of Israel, who was conceived by the Spirit of God and born of the Jewish virgin Miriam (Mary). He is both fully God and fully man, united forever without division or confusion (Isaiah 7:14; 9:6-7; Jeremiah 23:5-6; Micah 5:2, John 1:1, 8:58, 1 Timothy 3:16, Hebrews 1:2-3).\n \n We believe that Messiah Yeshua died as a substitutionary sacrifice for man's sin and that all who believe in Him are declared righteous on the basis of His shed blood. The Messiah's substitutionary death was the purchase price for our redemption and was foreshadowed in the Tenach in the slaying of the Passover Lamb and the suffering of the righteous Servant of the LORD (Leviticus 17:11; Psalm 22:16; Isaiah 42:1-4; Isaiah 50:4-11; Isaiah 52:13-53:12; Daniel 9:26; Zechariah 12:10; Mark 10:45; Romans 3:24-26; 5:8-9; II Corinthians 5:14, 21; I Peter 3:18).\n \n We believe that Messiah Yeshua died, was buried, arose from the dead bodily, ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father. Presently He serves as our Kohen Ha-Gadol (Great High Priest) according to the priesthood of Melchizedek. As such, He is intercessor and advocate before the Father on behalf of all believers (Psalm 16:10-11; 110:4; Zechariah 6:12-13; Acts 1:9-11; I Corinthians 15:3-8; Hebrews 7:1-25; 8:1; I John 2:1).\n \n The Holy Spirit\n \n We believe the Ruach HaKodesh (The Holy Spirit) is a person of the Godhead; and as such, He possesses all the distinct attributes of Deity. He is ever present to glorify and testify of Messiah Yeshua. In the Tenach, the Spirit of God temporarily empowered and filled individuals for specific service to God. Today, at the moment of salvation, each believer is immersed, sealed and permanently indwelt by God's Spirit. We believe that at salvation the Holy Spirit sovereignly imparts at least one spiritual gift to every believer for the purpose of edifying and equipping the Body of Messiah. Believers should seek to identify and utilize their God given gifts, desiring the greater gifts. (Genesis 1:2; Psalm 139:7-8; Nehemiah 9:20; I John 9:20; John 14:16-17; 15:26-27; 16:7-15; I Corinthians 2:10-11; 12:4-31; II Corinthians 13:14; Ephesians 1:13-14; 4:30).\n \n\n \n This is very very non-Jewish, and very very Christian.",

MJ's also say they keep the Law of Moses.\n \n There is no Sunday 'sabbath', Christians worship on Sunday, but they don't call it a 'sabbath.' They also do not see it as a day or rest, and I agree the term 'sabbath' does not fit Christianity.",

GOD AS THREE?\n \n The Catholic idea of Trinity breaks God into three separate beings: The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19). \n \n Contrast this to the Shema, the basis of Jewish belief: \"Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is ONE\" (Deut. 6:4). Jews declare the Shema every day, while writing it on doorposts (Mezuzah), and binding it to the hand and head (Tefillin). This statement of God&#8217;s One-ness is the first words a Jewish child is taught to say, and the last words uttered before a Jew dies. \n \n In Jewish law, worship of a three-part god is considered idolatry&#8212;one of the three cardinal sins that a Jew should rather give up his life than transgress. This explains why during the Inquisitions and throughout history, Jews gave up their lives rather than convert. (end of quote).\n \n ********************************************************************************************\n \n Really, pappi, when are you ever going to dig deep and study the issues before you try to pawn this anti-Christian rubbish off on people? Jews for Judaism is a dishonest website. You'll see why in a moment.\n \n The \"Shema\" Verse\n \n For most Jewish people, the \"Shema\" is the foundational verse for the concept of a monotheistic God. It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. But in fact, the Shema verse does not refute the concept of a Triune God. Here's why. \n \n The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n In Ezra 2:64, the Bible records, \"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand, three hundred and threescore.\" The words translated \"whole congregation\" in English are derived from the single Hebrew word echad. Again, a singular entity (one congregation) is comprised of more than one individual.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). He chose echad to make his point, so that it might be understood there is a plurality in union. \n \n \n\n Sorry ER this one is going to be a tough nut for you. \n \n\n \n LOL!! Sorry to disappoint you, pappi, but this is Bible basics 101 stuff, and you're the one who is clueless.\n \n Jews for Judaism and Judaism Online don't like to mention what you just read, do they, pappi? And apparently you're too lazy to do your own homework so that you will know when those people are lying to you.\n \n You're busted, and so is your dishonest Jews for Judaism and Judaism Online websites. I could go through their arguments one by one and show you what a load of manure their arguments are, but it doesn't matter to you, does it?",

A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n In Ezra 2:64, the Bible records, \"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand, three hundred and threescore.\" The words translated \"whole congregation\" in English are derived from the single Hebrew word echad. Again, a singular entity (one congregation) is comprised of more than one individual.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). He chose echad to make his point, so that it might be understood there is a plurality in union. \n \n \n \n LOL!! Sorry to disappoint you, pappi, but this is Bible basics 101 stuff, and you're the one who is clueless.\n \n Jews for Judaism and Judaism Online don't like to mention what you just read, do they, pappi? And apparently you're too lazy to do your own homework so that you will know when those people are lying to you.\n \n You're busted, and so is your dishonest Jews for Judaism and Judaism Online websites. I could go through their arguments one by one and show you what a load of manure their arguments are, but it doesn't matter to you, does it?\n\n \n You sad sad man. You know when you pick something to debate and then argue it yourself it means your not firing all your cylinders there bub. \n \n If you want me to participate you either pick some or respond to something I post. Just using my name in your posts doesn't count mon chi chi.\n \n So if you think you are ready just address one of the issues I stated and remember I respond then you do.\n \n As for your shema tangint you seem so proud of, but you should be used to this by now. That sensation of falling as your bubble bursts.\n \n That little word echad that \"proves the Trinity\" has quite a few meanings and used a whole lot of times here are some examples.\n \n Exodus 9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. (KJV)\n \n 2 Samuel 13:30 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left. (KJV)\n \n 2 Samuel 17:12 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that [are] with him there shall not be left so much as one. (KJV)\n \n Ecclesiastes 4:8 There is one [alone], and [there is] not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither [saith he], For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity, yea, it [is] a sore travail. (KJV)\n \n Here instead of me telling you this is the actual definition of the word which is used a total of 952 times.\n \n 1) one (number)\n \n a) one (number)\n \n b) each, every\n \n c) a certain\n \n d) an (indefinite article)\n \n e) only, once, once for all\n \n f) one...another, the one...the other, one after another, one by one\n \n g) first\n \n h) eleven (in combination), eleventh (ordinal)\n \n How upset do Christians get when an interpretation is challenged? Often the defense is that it has always been understood that way, but here your the ones telling the Jews how to interpret their language used in their sacred texts that they have studied thousands of years longer to support a stupid, yes stupid concept. Read the official statement, it sounds like something out of Abbott and Costello, that was thought of and forced down people's throats by threat of death from the Emperor in about a 100 year period 200 years after the Death of Jesus.\n \n Get a grip, even without this goofball understanding the Trinity as concept is just silly.",

   "Educating Pappi\n \n \n You sad sad man. \n\n \n Tsk, tsk.... You anti-christian trolls get real testy when your pet arguments bite the dust, huh, pappi?\n \n \n That little word echad that \"proves the Trinity\" has quite a few meanings ...\n\n \n And one of them was as a compound-unity noun, which busted the Judsiam Online argument that it meant strict singularity. Once again, you set the truth aside when it doesn't serve your backwoods bias.\n \n \n\n How upset do Christians get when an interpretation is challenged? Often the defense is that it has always been understood that way, but here your the ones telling the Jews how to interpret their language used in their sacred texts that they have studied thousands of years longer to support a stupid, yes stupid concept.

Because you still don't get it.\n \n Plurality in Personal Pronouns\n \n Plurality in personal pronouns (such as \"us\" and \"our\") when used in reference to the Lord, lends additional documentary evidence for the plurality of God.  A good case in point is Genesis 1:26:\n \n \"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let have dominion over the fist of the sea, and over the birds\n of the air, and over the livestock, and over all the earth.\"\n \n Here, we see a conversation that is taking place prior to the creation of man. Who is this person or persons with whom God is conversing? First, this 'person' or 'persons' is able to communicate with God in His own realm of timeless eternity. Because man had not yet been created, He was not speaking to someone of earthly intelligence, but someone in the heavenly, supernatural and eternal realm.\n \n Secondly, this person or persons with whom God is communicating apparently has the same kind of creative ability as God (\"Let us make\").  This clearly implies a cooperative effort between God (Elohim - plural) and the person or person with whom God is speaking. (p.s. Only God can create life in the Bible, pappi, so already you're busted.)\n \n And finally, the person or persons with whom God is speaking is comparable, or identical, with God (\"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\").\n \n When confronted with this passage, modern Jewish rabbis often claim that God is speaking with angels. However, this explanation fails to address a number of problems. First, there is no indication found anywhere in the Bible that says angels can create life. Secondly, nowhere is it indicated that angels were ever made in the image and likeness of God. And finally, there is no indication from scripture that mankind was ever made in the likeness of angels. \n \n Just one more example. In Genesis chapter 11, God is looking down at man's attempt to build the Tower of Babel to make a name for themselves. In verse 7 God states:\n \n \"Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will\n not understand one another.\"\n \n Once more, the personal pronoun \"us\" is used as a reference to God. Note that in verse 11:5 it is \"the Lord\" that is referred to when \"us\" is later used (\"The Lord came down to see the city\"). \n \n The Holy Spirit is a Person - God!\n \n While in Genesis 1:2 we see the \"Spirit of God\" moving upon the face of the waters during creation (remember God as \"Elohim,\" a plural creator), there is a very important and often overlooked verse in which the prophet Isaiah reveals that the Holy Spirit is more than just some type of spiritual force. Isaiah 63:10 reads,\n \n \"But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore He was\n turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.\"\n \n The word \"vexed,\" as used above, is the Hebrew word \"atsab,\" which means \"to worry, pain, or anger; to grieve, hurt, or make sorry\" (Zodhiates Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary section, page 91). The question, of course, is \"How can some inanimate force be angered or grieved, as we see occurred in the above passage? Only if the Holy Spirit was alive and possessed personal attributes could He experience these types of emotions.\" The Holy Spirit must therefore be a person. \n \n Another important verse that shows that the Holy Spirit is one of the \"Creators\" is found in Job 33:4, which reads,\n \n \"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty\n hath given me life.\"\n \n Obviously, the Holy Spirit must possess intelligence in order to take part in the creative process. Other \"personal\" attributes of the Holy Spirit are as follows:\n \n 1. The Holy Spirit \"testifies\" (Nehemiah 9:30).\n 2. The Spirit \"instructs\" (Nehemiah 9:20).\n 3. The Spirit \"strives with men\" (Genesis 6:3).\n 4. The Spirit sends messengers (Isaiah 48:16).\n 5. The Spirit enabled Joseph to interpret Pharoah's dreams (Genesis 41:38).\n 6. The Spirit gives wisdom (Exodus 28:3; 31:1-6; 35:31).\n 7. The Holy Spirit is the \"Spirit of Wisdom\" (Isaiah 11:2).\n 8. He is the Spirit of Knowledge (Isaiah 11:2)\n \n Notice clearly that all of the things that the Holy Spirit does requires intelligence of the variety that only God alone can possess. This ties God and the Holy Spirit together in a most closely-knit and inseparable unity. \n \n In Psalm 51:11, in the prayer of David to His Father in heaven, David alludes to the Holy Spirit when he prays, \"Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.\" \n \n Considering the aforementioned evidence, we can only conclude that Holy Spirit is a living person (diety), who possesses the same intellectual and creative attributes as Almighty God.\n \n Now - who is the descendant of King David in Jeremiah 23:5-6 who is called THE LORD (JEHOVAH) OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS?\n \n Who is the baby in Isaiah 9:6-7 who will be called Mighty God? \n \n David knows who this person is, and David calls Him, \"Lord:\" \n \n \"The Lord says to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your\n enemies a footstool for your feet.\" (Psalm 110:1)\n \n Jesus once asked the pharisees of His day, \"Who do you say the Messiah is?\" The pharisees responded, \"The Son of David.\" Jesus replied, \"How then can David, speaking in the Spirit, call Him Lord when he says, 'The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. If he is David's son, how then does David call Him 'Lord?\"\n \n Who is that, pappi??? \n \n How many \"gods\" are you now having to spend time trying to identify, that gut your 'no Trinity' theory? LOL!\n \n Pappi, you're busted!! Jesus is Lord!!\n \n So what are you now, a Jew for Judaism? LOL!!\n \n emoticon_xagreeemoticon_xbyeemoticon_xbouncer",

   "Contrary to Trebor's assertions, I went through each of the posted 'contradictions', sic, long ago. I have read Jews for Jesus, as well as other sites critical or outright derogatory of Christ. \n\n \n Which means they are liars or confused or whatever makes them wrong and Christianity right\n \n \n \nHere is a site that has a Pro and Con posting with bibliographies, that briefly address this question. There are so many others to pull from for this and the other points you put up, this is elementary and you can do this without much effort, so if you are truly interested you will study up before putting out stuff that can be easily refuted in the perception of reasonable people. Lineage of Jesus@Everything2.com\n\n \n Funny neither one resolved all the issues. You see there are many problems with the Genealogy of Jesus. I have never seen any pro site address every one (meaning having merit, not frivolous). So you have this false sense of confidence, but it is just a shell game. Every time it is pointed out why those three can't have a child of the Davidic line something new is created to overcome it, and by creative I mean based on imagination.\n \n \nAnd by the way, the Catholic Church is not the final repository of theological truth, not even close. There are catholic theologians in the true sense that can take apart the doctrine and 'truth' of the Catholic Church.\n\n \n Well as the largest denomination as with 1.17 Billion followers representing 17% of the world's population I am going to say they are pretty influential as a group. Further since they established most of what is Christian today as well as have a large number of the historical documents. Sorry can't just dismiss them because they are Catholic. \n \n What Ray isn't a Catholic in the true sense. Impeccable credentials. Look at you just discount anything you don't want to hear because it's contrary to your beliefs. \n \n \nOne can also reasonably state than if Jesus Christ does not embody the characteristics of the Jewish Messiah (which many, if DO believe by the way) then the Jews will continue to have a very long wait. God must really be po'd at these people......\n\n \n Which is a worse tease that or Jesus coming to do half the job and not telling when he will be back?

LOL!!\n \n emoticon_xagreeemoticon_xbyeemoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n Enjoy the ride over the cliff grasshopper. When you want to know about Hebrew ask a someone who speaks the language.\n \n In the beginning, Elohim created the heavens and the earth.\n \n Genesis 1:1\n \n \n \n The Hebrew word for God is Elohim. Elohim ends with the masculine plural suffix \"-&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;\" From this we might conclude that Elohim signifies a numerical plural (i.e. denoting multiplicity) and translate it accordingly as gods. But before we determine whether the world was created by a single God or multiple gods, we must consider whether Elohim is really a numerical plural.\n \n In Hebrew, a numerically plural noun has three characteristics:\n \n 1. It receives a plural suffix;\n 2. It receives a plural verb;\n 3. It receives a plural adjective.\n \n The first characteristic, the plural suffix, is familiar to the English speaker. In English, most nouns have the plural suffix \"s\" or \"es\". For example, dog is the singular while dogs is the plural. Hebrew adds another dimension by matching adjectives and verbs to the noun. In Hebrew, a plural noun gets a plural verb and plural adjective. In contrast, English verbs and adjectives do not change to match the noun. For example, in English:\n \n Singular: The big dog guarded.\n \n Plural: The big dogs guarded.\n \n But in Hebrew:\n \n Singular: The big (sg) dog (he) guarded. &#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512; &#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1489; &#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;\n \n Plural: The big (pl) dogs (they) guarded. &#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;\n \n \n \n So the first thing we must check about Elohim is whether it gets a plural adjective and plural verb, because this will tell us whether or not it is a numerical plural denoting multiplicity. In the very first verse of the Torah we read &#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; meaning \"Elohim (he) created\". Were Elohim a numerical plural, the verse would have to say &#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; \"Elohim (they) created\". Indeed, the word Elohim appears in its plural form over 2000 times throughout the Hebrew Scriptures and in virtually every instance it has a singular verb. It is always \"And Elohim (he) spoke to Moses \" and never \"And Elohim (they) spoke to Moses \". The same thing can be found with the adjective. The adjective for Elohim is singular, not plural. Thus we find &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511; \"righteous (sg) Elohim\" (Ps 7:10) and not &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; \"righteous (pl) Elohim\".\n \n So why does Elohim have a plural suffix if it is numerically singular with a singular verb and singular adjective? It turns out there is a special type of plural in Hebrew that has a plural suffix even though it is numerically singular with a singular verb and singular adjective. These nouns are called majestic plurals. The meaning of the plural suffix in the majestic plural is not that there is more than one of the noun, but that the noun is \"great, absolute, or majestic\". For example, &#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503; means \"master\" while &#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; (Isa 19:4; Mal 1:6) with the masculine plural suffix means \"great master, lord\". Thus we read, \"I will imprison the Egyptians in the hand of a harsh lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them\" (Isa 19:4). In this verse the fierce king that will enslave Egypt is described as an ?&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492; \"a harsh (sg) lord (pl)\". In this verse, the plural suffix attached to the word ?&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; does not make it a numerical plural (\"masters\") but instead magnifies the meaning (\"great master, lord\"). Because &#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; is a majestic plural it receives the singular adjective &#1511;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492; (harsh) and not the plural adjective &#1511;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; that would be required for a numerical plural. The word &#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500; also means \"master\" while &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; with the masculine plural suffix means \"great master, owner\". For example, in Exodus 21 the owner of the \"goring ox\" is repeatedly referred to as the &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; \"owner\". The word &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; has the plural suffix even though the ox is only owned by one person. In this case, the plural suffix magnifies the noun imbuing it with a connotation of \"absolute owner, complete master\". Because &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; \"owner\" is a majestic plural it gets a singular verb. Thus we read concerning the negligent owner whose ox has killed, \"the ox shall be stoned and the owner (he) will be put to death\" (Ex 21:29). The verb ?&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514; meaning \"he will be put to death\" is in the singular even though the word for \"owner\" &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; has the plural suffix. The common characteristic of majestic plurals is that they have the plural suffix while denoting singular objects and as a result they receive singular adjectives and singular verbs. Elohim is quite simply an example of the majestic plural and means \"great God\".\n \n It is worth noting that the word Elohim is not always a majestic plural. When referring to the pagan gods, the term Elohim is usually a numerical plural. For example, the second commandment forbids us to worship &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; \"other (pl) gods\". In this phrase, not only does Elohim have the plural suffix, but it receives a plural adjective &#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; other (pl). This tells us that in the second commandment Elohim is used not as an majestic plural but as a numerical plural denoting multiplicity. The prohibition is not against a specific \"other (sg) god\" but against any \"other (pl) gods\". Elohim is used numerous times throughout the Tanach to refer to pagan gods and in most of these instances it is a numerical plural denoting multiple (false) gods. So we see that when the Tanach speaks about YHWH it uses Elohim as the majestic plural meaning \"great God\" but when it speaks about pagan gods it uses Elohim as a numerical plural meaning \"gods\". In both instances the accompanying verbs and adjectives reveal to us which meaning is intended.\n \n Does the majestic plural form of Elohim implies that there is anything multiple about God? To help clarify this it is worth looking at the few instances where the majestic plural form of Elohim is used to refer to someone other than YHWH. The clearest example of this is in Exodus 7:1. In this passage YHWH tells Moses that he will make him an Elohim to Pharaoh: \"Behold I have made you an Elohim to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet\" (Exodus 7:1). Certainly this does not mean that YHWH made Moses into a god, but rather that he would speak to Pharaoh with authority through Aaron who would serve as his mouth-piece in the way that the prophets serve as the mouth-pieces of YHWH. In any event, there is clearly nothing multiple about Moses, even though he was made an Elohim to Pharaoh.\n \n On rare occasions Elohim is used as majestic plural even when referring to pagan gods. For example, \"And they bowed down to Ashtoret the Elohim of the Sidonians, to Kemosh the Elohim of Moab, and to Milkom the Elohim of the children of Amon.\" (1Ki 11:33). Here we see three pagan deities each of which is referred to as an Elohim. Obviously the book of Kings is not saying that any of these false deities is a \"great God\". On the contrary, the verse goes on to rebuke the Israelites for worshipping them. The meaning is that the Sidonians, Moabites, and Ammonites looked upon their deities as great Gods and in this instance Scripture employs the terms used by the pagans themselves to refer to their own deities. At the same time we must observe that Ashtoret, Kemosh, and Milkom are each referred to as Elohim even though there is nothing multiple about any one of them.\n \n Clearly the word Elohim, when it refers to YHWH, is an majestic plural which is numerically singular, having a singular verb and a singular adjective. This majestic plural is simply a grammatical form that denotes greatness without any implication that the object itself is a plurality or multiplicity. If we maintain that Elohim implies multiplicity then we must concede that Moses was also a multiplicity along with Kemosh the pagan deity of the Moabites and Milkom the pagan deity of the Amonites.\n \n That YHWH is a single individual and not a multiplicity of gods or personalities is consistent with what we find throughout the Hebrew Scriptures. Moses declares to the children of Israel, \"YHWH is our Elohim, YHWH is one\" (Dt 6:4). Were YHWH a multiplicity of gods or personalities what would be the point of saying that He is \"one\"? It is worth noting that it does not say YHWH is one of something (one god, one personality). He is just simply \"one\", in every respect of the word. Similarly, the prophet Zechariah tells us about the universal worship of YHWH at the end of days, \"And YHWH will be king over the entire earth; at that time YHWH will be one and his name will be one\" (Zech 14:9). Zechariah is saying that today people multiply YHWH but at the end-time all mankind will know that YHWH is a single individual deity with one single name. We are taught in the book of Isaiah that YHWH is the one and only, \"I am YHWH and besides me there is no savior\" (Isa 43:11). Elsewhere in Isaiah, YHWH poses the rhetorical question, \"Is there an Eloha (God) besides me?\" (Isa 44:8). Similarly we read in the Psalms, \"Who is an Eloha (God) besides YHWH and who is a rock (=savior) besides our Elohim?\" (Ps 18:32). In these verses the word for \"God\" is Eloha ?&#1457;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;&#1468;&#1463;, the singular form of Elohim. These passages are saying that YHWH is an Eloha and besides Him there is no other Eloha. Indeed, YHWH is called by the singular Eloha (God) some 47 times throughout the Hebrew Scriptures which proves that He is not a plurality or multiplicity. This and the fact that the verbs and adjectives connected with Elohim are always singular confirm our conclusion that Elohim is an majestic plural denoting a singular individual but with a connotation of greatness.\n \n Some pronounce Elo'ah or Elowah.\n \n YHWH is called Eloha (God), the singular form of Elohim, in the following verses: Dt 32:15.17; Isa 44:8; Hab 3:3; Ps 18:32; 50:22; 114:7; 139:19; Job 3:4; 3:23; 4:9.17; 5:17; 6:4.7.9; 9:13; 10:2; 11:5; 12:4.6; 16:21; 19:6.21.26.; 21:9.19; 22:12.26; 24:12; 27:3.8.10; 29:2.4; 31:2.6; 33:12.26; 35:10; 36:2; 37:15.22; 39:17; 40:2; Prov 30:5; Neh 9:17.",

   "Educating Pappi\n \n \n \n Who is that, pappi??? \n \n How many \"gods\" are you now having to spend time trying to identify, that gut your 'no Trinity' theory? LOL!\n \n Pappi, you're busted!! Jesus is Lord!!\n \n \n emoticon_xagreeemoticon_xbyeemoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n We aren't done yet billy, school is still in session\n \n In part 1 we saw that the word Elohim is an \"intensive plural\". The intensive plural has the plural ending but the verbs and adjectives that accompany it are singular. The intensive plural denotes a singular object or individual but adds a connotation of greatness. So Elohim does not mean gods but great God.\n \n Until now it was observed that the verbs and adjectives connected with Elohim are always singular. However, in the book of Genesis we find three passages in which God speaks in the first person plural as \"we\", \"our\", and \"us\". The first such passage deals with the creation of mankind, in which God declares, \"Let us make man in our image after our likeness that they may rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the animals and over the whole earth and over all the creeping things that creep on the earth.\" (Gen 1:26). Who is this \"us\" and \"our\"? Does God have multiple personalities? Is there more than one God?\n \n Immediately before the words \"Let us make man in our image\" we read \"And (he) Elohim said\" &#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;. The word &#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512; \"and he said\" is the 3rd person singular form of the verb &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (qal inverted future). This indicates that the speaker is a singular individual. Were Elohim a plurality the verse would have opened \"And (they) Elohim said\" &#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;. The phrase \"Elohim said/ spoke\" appears about fifty times throughout the Hebrew Scriptures and in every single instance it is \"(he) God said/ spoke\" in the singular and never \"(they) God said/ spoke\" in the plural.\n \n From the words \"Let us make man\" we might expect mankind to be created by multiple creators. The word &#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492; \"let us make\" is the 1st person plural (qal future) of the verb &#1506;?&#1474;&#1492; (to do, to make). The &#1504;- prefix indicates that it is \"us\" which seems to imply multiple creators. Similarly, from the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1461;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; \"in our image after our likeness\" we might expect man to be made in the images of multiple individuals. The suffix -?&#1493;&#1468; at the end of each word is the possessive suffix which means \"our\". We might think that \"our\" image and \"our\" likeness refers to multiple individuals with similar characteristics with which mankind was to be endowed. Yet when the creation of mankind actually takes place, in the very next verse, it says, \"And (he) Elohim created man in His image, in the image of Elohim He created him\" &#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1501; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488; &#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465; (Gen 1:27). So man was not created by the multiple \"we\" but by the single individual Elohim who is termed \"He\". Nor was man created in the image of a group of multiple individuals but only in the single image of Elohim which is described as \"His image\", that is, the single image of the Creator. Were Elohim a multiplicity the verse would have to have read, \"And (they) Elohim created man in their image, in the image of Elohim they created them\" &#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1501; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;. Since this is not what Scripture says we must conclude once again that Elohim is a singular individual.\n \n What of the other two instances in which God speaks in the 1st person plural as \"we/ us\"? The next instance is in the Garden of Eden Account. After Adam eats of the forbidden fruit, God declares, \"Behold the man has become as one of us, knowing good and evil\" (Gen 3:22). Despite this reference to \"us\" we again find that God is a singular individual. The very same verse opens, \"And (he) YHWH Elohim said\". Were YHWH Elohim a plurality the verse would have to have read, \"And (they) YHWH Elohim said\". Furthermore, after God explains the concern that the undeserving Adam may eat from the Tree of Life we read, \"And (he) YHWH Elohim sent him from the Garden of Eden\". It is the single individual YHWH Elohim who banishes Adam from the garden, not the plural \"we\".\n \n The third instance of the divine \"we\" appears in the Towel of Babel Account. After observing that mankind is in a state of rebellion, God declares, \"Let us go down and let us mix up there their language\" (Gen 11:7). The very same speech opens, \"And (he) YHWH said\" (Gen 11:6) which indicates that we are dealing with a single individual YHWH. When God actually descends to mix up the languages we read, \"And (he) YHWH scattered them from there across the face of the entire earth\". In this passage as well, YHWH is referred to as a singular individual (\"He said\", \"He scattered\").\n \n The Royal We\n \n If YHWH Elohim is a single individual, why does He speak about \"we\", \"our\", and \"us\"? How can any singular speaker refer to himself as \"we\"? There is a linguistic phenomenon in which a speaker refers to himself in the plural. In many cultures and civilizations kings refer to themselves in the first person plural as \"we\". This is generally considered a sign of self-magnification, similar to the intensive plural used to magnify nouns. The best-known example of this is the British royal family who use the \"royal we\". The 19th century English Queen Victoria used to express her dissatisfaction by declaring, \"We are not amused\" rather than the expected, \"I am not amused\". In modern English the royal we is used in a variety of contexts not necessarily related to royalty. For example, in certain types of formal speaking and writing, \"we\" can be used \"by a speaker or writer, in order to secure an impersonal tone, or to avoid the obtrusive repetition of 'I'\". Modern English also has the \"modest we\" in which \"a person uses a plural form in order not to call attention to himself as an individual.\" In some dialects of American English \"we\" is used in place of \"I\" as a colloquialism, without any connotation of formality or self-magnification. For example, \"Give us a chance!\" in certain dialects of American English has the meaning of \"Give me a chance!\". Thus the royal we in English is not strictly speaking \"royal\" as it is used in a number of social contexts.\n \n In ancient times, the royal we was not strictly speaking \"royal\" either. Instead it was used as a formal mode of address in the context of a \"royal court\". An ancient king was always surrounded by a host of advisors, ministers, and attendants known as the \"royal court\" or \"royal council\". Daniel, standing in the Babylonian royal court, said to king Nebuchadnezzar, \"This dream and its interpretation we shall say in the king's presence \" (Dan 2:36 [Aramaic]). The singular individual Daniel refers to himself as \"we\" because this is the formal mode of address used in the royal court. Job's companion, Bildad the Shuchite complains to Job, \"Why have we been considered as an animal, as stupid (pl) in your eyes\" (Job 18:3). When Bildad says \"we\" he is not referring to himself and his two companions. Were this the case he would have said, \"Why have we been considered as animals\". The fact that Bildad complains that he has been considered \"an animal\" in the singular proves he is only talking about himself. While Bildad is not in a royal court he uses the royal we because he is partaking in a royal court-like audience. Before being tested by God, Job had been a local nobleman with great wealth (Job 1:3). After losing everything, Job sat on the floor (like a king sits on his throne) surrounded by his companions who came to comfort him and give him advice (like a king's courtiers) (Job 2:11-13). Job's companions proceed to give long flowery speeches full of advice in the manner that courtiers might address a king in the royal court. As a result, they occasionally resort to the use of the royal we. In both of the above examples the speaker is addressing a royal court or similar forum. In this context, the royal we is employed as a formal mode of address, somewhat like the \"we\" used in certain types of formal English oratory and writing (see above). It is worth noting that the royal we was used in an erratic fashion in biblical times. Thus when Daniel addresses the royal court on a different occasion he speaks as \"I\" (e.g. Dan 5:7). This is rather like the queen of England who now only refers to herself as \"we\" on rare occasions.\n \n Another example of the royal we can be found in the words of Ahab king of Israel. Ahab had been planning an invasion of Aram and assembled 400 prophets to tell him how victorious he would be. Sitting on his royal throne before his assembly of courtiers Ahab asked the 400 prophets, \"Shall we go to the highlands of Gilead for war or shall I hold back\" (2Chr 18:5). When speaking in the royal court the king freely switches off between the royal we and the regular \"I\"! The 400 prophets respond to Ahab as a singular king, \"Go up (singular) and God will deliver into the hand of the king\" (2Chr 18:5). Despite Ahab's use of the royal we, he is not \"mysteriously\" transformed into a multiplicity of personalities and his four hundred false prophets accordingly speak to him as a single individual king.\n \n The Heavenly Council\n \n If the ancients used the royal we as a formal mode of address when speaking in a royal court or council, who is YHWH addressing when he says \"Let us make man in our image\"? Does YHWH have a royal council? For that matter would the all-powerful Creator of the universe bother to tell His creations what He is about to do before doing it? As a matter of fact He would! Scripture informs us that YHWH is a wise king and like a human king he informs His subjects of what he is about to do. Thus we read, \"Lord YHWH does not do anything unless he has revealed His council &#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; to His servants the prophets\" (Amos 3:7). The Hebrew word&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; council literally means a grouping of people such as an assembly or congregation, as in the verse, \"Let not my soul come into their assembly &#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;, let not my honor be united with their congregation\" (Gen 49:6). By extension &#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; also has the meaning of an assembly of advisors, as in the verse, \"Plans are foiled without council ?&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;, but they succeed through many advisors\" (Prov 15:22). In this last verse most English translations render the word &#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; as \"counsel\", that is, the advice given by a council of advisors. However, the Hebrew word &#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; refers to the council of advisors itself, and only indirectly to the advice that they give. When we read in Amos that YHWH reveals \"His council\" &#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; to the prophets the meaning is that he makes known to them the secret deliberations that took place in the heavenly council. It is knowledge of these deliberations that false prophets are said to lack, as we read in Jeremiah, \"For who among them has stood in the council of YHWH ?&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; and seen and heard his word? Who among them has listened to His word and heard?\" (Jer 23:18). We see that a true prophet has knowledge of the deliberations that take place in the \"council of YHWH\" whereas the false prophet lacks this knowledge. We read further in the same passage, \"(21) I did not send those prophets... I did not speak to them yet they prophesied. (22) Now if they have stood in my council ?&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;, let them announce my words to My people that they return from their evil way and the wickedness of their actions\" (Jer 23:21-22). Again we see that the false prophets are unable to speak the word of YHWH because they have no knowledge of the deliberations that took place in His heavenly council.\n \n What is the \"council of YHWH\"? We find throughout the Hebrew Scriptures that YHWH is said to be surrounded by a large host of angels. For example, in one vision Daniel sees YHWH sitting like a king surrounded by millions of attendants:\n \n \"(9) And the Ancient One sat down, His garment like white snow, and the hair of His head like clean wool, His throne flames of fire and its wheels burning fire. (10) A river of fire flowed forth; a million attended Him and a hundred million stood before Him. The judgment began and the books were opened.\" (Dan 7:9-10)\n \n In Daniel's vision YHWH is described as a mighty king with a large council of courtiers. YHWH sits like a wise king in judgment (Prov 20:8; 29:14; 1Ki 3:28; 2Sam 15:2). The courtiers serve as YHWH's royal council of advisors and among other things keep records.\n \n Another description of the heavenly council can be found in the vision of Michayahu ben Yimla. Michayahu was called to advise Ahab King of Israel on whether or not he should set off on his invasion of Aram. We have already seen that Ahab assembled 400 prophets all of whom told him he would be victorious in this invasion. However, one lone prophet, Michayahu ben Yimla, informed the king that he would die in battle and that the other prophets had been misled by a false spirit of prophecy. Michayahu explains how this false spirit of prophecy came to infect Ahab's prophets:\n \n \"(19) And he said, therefore, listen to the word of YHWH. I saw YHWH sitting on His throne and the entire host of heaven standing on His right and His left. (20) And YHWH said, Who will tempt Ahab that he go up and fall in the highlands of Gilead. And one said, 'In this manner' and another said, 'In that manner.' (21) And a certain spirit went forth and stood before YHWH and said, 'I will tempt him'. And YHWH said to him, 'In what manner?' (22) And he said, 'I will go out and be a false spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And He said, 'You shall tempt and be successful. Go and make it so!'\" (1Ki 22:19-22).\n \n In Michayahu's vision YHWH sits like a king on His throne surrounded by His royal council which consists of the \"entire host of heaven\". The \"host of heaven\" refers to the angels, as in the verse, \"Praise Him, all His angels! Praise Him, all His hosts!\" (Ps 148:2). YHWH consults His angels in the same way as a flesh and blood king might consult the members of his royal council. The angels raise various proposals (\"And one said, 'In this manner' and another said, 'In that manner.'\"). Finally a \"spirit\" comes forth and proposes that it be a false spirit of prophecy in the mouth of the prophets of Ahab. YHWH accepts the proposal and orders the spirit to carry out the mission.\n \n Another description of the heavenly council appears in the book of Job. We read there, \"And it was a certain time, and the sons of God came to stand before YHWH\" (Job 1:6; 2:1). What follows is a deliberation between YHWH and a satanic angel, similar to that which took place in the vision of Michayahu between YHWH and the spirit of false prophecy. The \"sons of God\" that comprise the members of the heavenly court are the angels. The angels are called \"sons of God\" because they are YHWH's holy and chosen messengers. The Israelites are also described as sons of God, as we read in Deuteronomy:\n \n \"(1) You are sons of YHWH your God, you shall not cut yourselves nor place a baldness on your head for the dead. (2) Because you are a holy nation to YHWH your God, and YHWH has chosen you to be His chosen people out of all the nations on the face of the earth.\" (Dt 14:1-2).\n \n Israel is forbidden to partake in pagan mourning practices because they are \"sons of YHWH\", which means they are a \"holy nation to YHWH\", a \"chosen nation\". So to be a \"son of God\" simply means to be holy, chosen by God. The angels are called \"sons of God\" in Job because they too are \"chosen\" and \"holy\". In fact, one of the biblical terms for angel is &#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473; \"holy one\". Daniel sees an angel in a vision which he describes as a \"holy one\" (Dan 8:13). In Nebuchadnezzar's dream he sees \"an angel and a holy one coming down from heaven\" (Dan 4:10 [Aramaic]). The phrase \"an angel and a holy one\" is an example of the stylistic device hendiadys, that is, \"two that are one\" (like &#1514;&#1465;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; ?&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;). This means that \"angel\" and \"holy one\" are functionally synonymous in this context.\n \n The terms \"angel\" and \"son of God\" are also used synonymously. When Nebuchadnezzar throws Daniel's three companions into the fiery furnace, he is surprised to see a fourth person in the furnace with them. He explains that \"the appearance of the fourth one is like a son of God &#1489;&#1463;&#1512; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;\" (Dan 3:25 [Aramaic]). Only a few verses later Nebuchadnezzar declares, \"Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Aved-Nego who sent His angel &#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1461;&#1492;&#1468; and saved His servants who trusted in Him\"(Dan 3:28 [Aramaic]). Thus when Nebuchadnezzar sees a man with the appearance of \"a son of God\" he knows this to be an \"angel\" &#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456; of God.\n \n The phrase \"holy ones\" is used interchangeably with the phrase \"sons of God\" when referring to the heavenly council of angels. Thus we read \"May your wonder, O YHWH, be professed in heaven; even your faithfulness in the congregation of holy ones\" (Ps 89:6). The \"congregation of holy ones\" &#1511;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500; &#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; in Ps 89:6 is the heavenly council of angels and in the following verses is referred to as the \"sons of God\" &#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497; &#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; (Ps 89:7) and the \"great council of holy ones\" &#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; &#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; (Ps 89:8).\n \n The Divine \"We\"\n \n We have seen that kings and courtiers use the royal we as a formal mode of address in the royal council. We have also seen that YHWH is described as being surrounded by a heavenly council of angels. In the sixth chapter of Isaiah we find that YHWH uses the royal we when addressing the heavenly council. In Isaiah's vision he sees YHWH on His throne surrounded by the heavenly council of angels:\n \n \"(1) In the year that king Uziyahu died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and elevated, and His train filling the sanctuary. (2) Burning-ones (seraphim) standing above him, six wings each one, with two it covers its face, and with two it legs, and with two it flies. (3) And one called to another and said, \"Holy, holy, holy is YHWH of hosts, the entire earth is filled with his glory... (8) And I heard the voice of the Lord saying 'Who shall I send and who shall go for us?' and I said 'Here I am, send me!' And He said, 'Go and say to this people...'\" (Isa 6:1-3,8-9)\n \n YHWH is sitting on His throne as the king of the entire universe surrounded by fiery angels. As in the vision of Michayahu, YHWH addresses his court asking who He should send on the divine mission. When addressing the heavenly council YHWH freely switches off between \"I\" and the royal we, even in mid-sentence! YHWH says, \"Who shall I send and who shall go for us?\" This is reminiscent of Ahab's question to his royal council, \"Shall we go to the highlands of Gilead for war or shall I hold back\" (2Chr 18:5). Both YHWH and Ahab freely switch off between \"I\" and the royal we when addressing the royal/ heavenly council.\n \n Conclusion\n \n When YHWH says in Gen 3:26, \"Let us make man in our image after our likeness\" He is also addressing the heavenly council of angels. The same is true when He says, \"Behold the man has become as one of us, knowing good and evil\" (Gen 3:22) and \"Let us go down and let us mix up there their language\" (Gen 11:7). In all three instances YHWH is speaking to His heavenly council of angels as He did in the visions of Michayahu and Isaiah and in the book of Job. This is also what is meant in the verse, \"Lord YHWH does not do anything unless he has revealed His council &#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; to His servants the prophets\" (Amos 3:7). We see from this that YHWH's actions are deliberated upon in His heavenly council &#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491; of angels. The use of the royal we is simply a formal mode of address employed when speaking before such a council. It can be freely used by kings and courtiers, but it does not imply the king or courtier is a multiplicity. Daniel, Bildad, and Ahab all spoke in this fashion even though they were all singular individuals with single personalities. YHWH, the king of the entire universe, speaks in this fashion before His heavenly council of angels. Yet when YHWH acts he is always described as acting alone as a singular individual. Thus in the first \"we\" passage we find, \"And Elohim (he) created man in His image\" and not \"And Elohim (they) created man in their image\". In the second \"we\" passage we find, \"And (he) YHWH Elohim sent him from the Garden of Eden\" and not \"And (they) YHWH Elohim sent him from the Garden of Eden\". Finally, in the third \"we\" passage we find \"And (he) YHWH scattered them from there across the face of the entire earth\" and not \"And (they) YHWH scattered them from there across the face of the entire earth\". Although YHWH brought up these actions for deliberation in the heavenly council, when they were actually carried out YHWH is said to have done them alone, for YHWH is the sole master of all creation, as it is written:\n \n \"(5) I am YHWH and there is no other; besides Me there are no gods; I have girded you [i.e. protected you] even though you did not know Me. (6) So that they will know from the rising of the sun to the setting that there is none besides Me; I am YHWH and there is no other. (7) The one who forms light and creates darkness, who makes peace and creates evil, I YHWH do all these things.\" (Isa 45:5-7).",

   "(To Trebor) So how do you consider yourself a Reform Jew if you don't believe in God?\n\n \n What Reform Jews Believe\n \n Judaism, Reform Judaism, Reform Jews, What Reform Jews Believe, About Reform Judaism- Beliefnet.com\n \n *Belief in Deity\n Beliefs vary among adherents, including that of nonbelief or questioning belief, and all are welcome and considered personal, but the official stance is that there is one God Almighty--Creator, all-powerful, ever-present, and all knowing--formless, incorporeal spirit. \n \n \u0095 Incarnations\n None, as only God is worshipped. Moses was the greatest of all prophets. \n \n \u0095 Origin of Universe and Life\n Most believe that Genesis is to be understood symbolically. God created and controls all phenomena revealed by modern science. \n \n \u0095 After Death\n Reform Jews believe in the world to come and a messianic age (but no individual Messiah). Personal beliefs in the details of afterlife are diverse, as there is no official position. Some believe in heaven and hell but only as states of consciousness; some believe in reincarnation; some believe God is all-forgiving; and some may not believe in an actual afterlife. Regardless, Judaism generally focuses on living a virtuous life, rather than working toward reward after death. \n \n \u0095 Why Evil?\n No original sin. Most often, Satan is interpreted symbolically to represent selfish desires that are inherent within all. God gave people free will, and people are responsible for their actions. \n \n \u0095 Salvation\n The main emphasis is on living the kind of life that God commands, which will surely be rewarded if there is an afterlife. Most believe God is forgiving of all; there is no hell to which some are condemned. Salvation is achieved through faith and prayer to God, good works, concern for the earth and humanity, and behavior that does no harm to others. The extent to which one follows Jewish Law is an individual decision. \n \n \u0095 Undeserved Suffering\n God gave humans free will to feel pleasure and pain, and his purpose in allowing deep suffering of the innocent must be good even if mysterious. It is generally believed that God suffers along with the sufferer. More important than knowing why God allows suffering is to work to help those in need. \n \n \u0095 Contemporary Issues\n Judaism holds that human life begins upon first breath, and Jewish law requires abortion if necessary to save the mother's life prior to birth. Most believe potential human life should never be terminated casually, but it is generally regarded as a personal decision, especially within the first 40 days of pregnancy. Homosexuality: Homosexuals are God's creation, and Jewish instruction is to love our neighbors as ourselves. Reform (and Conservative) Judaism have a long history of support for homosexual rights. \n \n So, what we have here is a hodgepodge of beliefs that are all over the board, including even non-belief! Some say there is a Creator and some say there is no creator. There is no official recognition of an afterlife, or even a Jewish Messiah. If there is an afterlife, it's based on rewarding works - believing in God is not even necessary (note \"Belief in Deity\" paragraph above). This is somewhat humerous since who is it that's supposedly going to reward those works if God doesn't exist?). As noted in their beliefs, \"Most believe God is forgiving of all.\" One has to wonder then if Reform Jews will feel at ease in eternity with Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin and other serial murderers running loose in their midst? In addition, rather than embrace traditional Judaism which teaches that Homosexual relations are a sin, Reform Jews openly endorse gay sex, saying such behavior is God-created! What's more, reincarnation is in too if they want, which is a documented pagan belief contrary to reason and traditional Judaism. In short, Reform Judaism is pretty much whatever people want to believe, based on their man-made whims. Questions such as, \"What happens to you if you are not a Reform Jew,\" and, \"How many works, and what kind of works, does it take to be rewarded with the afterlife\" are obviously anyone's guess. IMO, Reform Judaism is a hodgepodge philosophical structure which is ill-defined, often contradictory to traditional Judaism, etc., man-created, and can certainly incorporate and embrace pagan beliefs and subjective, politically-correct dogma. \n \n A Reform Jew discusses his religion:\n \n One of the great problems of Reform Judaism, and I am a Reform Jew, is its lack of definition....\n \n Reform Judaism correctly modified a Judaism that was only dependent on belief and added the mental tool of reason to the religion. Reason has all but destroyed faith or belief because it has concluded that all religious truths, including the Revalation at Sinai, the major source of Jewish ethical and ritual law, must be evaluated through logic and these truths or beliefs have only a relative authenticity,i.e., they must be evaluated with a consideration of the historical, social, economic and psychiologocal persectives of the ancient Jews. As a result of this process, the Reform Jew has eliminated all if not almost all binding Jewish Law, and therfore, all or almost all binding behavior. \n \n The Reform Jew identifies himself primarily on the basis of belief. He believes that Judaism authenticates ethics. Yet Christians, agnostics and aetheists appaer to be ethical, and thus Jewish mandated ethiocal behavior does not differentiate and define the Jew.\n \n Many Reform Jews believe that \"God is in us\" which is denounced by traditional Judaism; the traditional concept of God is One who is separate from us and transcends the natural world....At the recent Reform Convention, the President of the Reform Judaism announced his intent that Reform Jews should re-embrace spirituality. \n \n Reform Judaism is by far the largest branch of Judaism, and the loss of membership in Reform Judaism is staggering. Reform Judaism which constitutes the largest segment of liberal Jews needs help...It recognizes that it has a problem. The rabbis have recognized the problem for several decades, but they have been unable or unwilling to solve it.\n \n Mail.Liberal-Judaism Volume 7 Number 79\n \n \n Religious zealots, arranged right to left\n \n Liberals who want you to be liberal are moral, but Christians who want you to be Christian are bigots.\n \n As far as the news media are concerned, there is no religious left, only the religious right and \"mainstream\" denominations - and, of course, the religious right is regularly described as bigoted, narrow-minded and intolerant, not to mention a threat to the separation of church and state.\n \n Yet, within Christianity and Judaism, the left is very much alive, and in Judaism it is dominant. This leftism was made apparent last month in Houston at the biennial convention of the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest of Judaism's denominations.\n \n Let's begin with religious intrusion into politics. This is probably the least defensible charge thrown at the religious right. First, religious individuals and groups have as much right to attempt to influence society and state as secular individuals and groups do. Second, the religious left is at least as active in attempting to influence governmental policies as the religious right. Perhaps more so.\n \n Take, for example, the Reform convention's resolution opposing the nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court (even before hearings have begun). I am unaware of any Orthodox Jewish convention having passed a resolution against the nomination of secular or liberal judges to the Supreme Court. \n \n A second example was the convention's resolution calling for \"full voting rights\" for the citizens of the District of Columbia. Now, why exactly is that not religious intrusion into politics? And how is that different than when Southern Baptists passed a resolution calling on the United States to keep marriage defined as between a man and a woman? \n \n Such intellectual inconsistencies continued in the keynote address by the head of Reform Jewry, Rabbi Eric Yoffie. The rabbi reserved a portion of his address for an attack on the \"religious right,\" whose leaders, he said, believe that \"unless you attend my church, accept my God and study my sacred text, you cannot be a moral person.\"\n \n As I do not believe Rabbi Yoffie knowingly told a lie, I can only assume that he did not mean what he said. His statement is false. I've never heard of a single mainstream conservative, fundamentalist or right-wing Christian who has said or even hinted at this. It is true that the Christian right largely believes that one must believe in Jesus Christ in order to attain salvation. But \"saved\" is hardly the same as \"moral.\" Christian leaders acknowledge that there are moral non-Christians.\n \n What we have here is left-wing projection: It is the left that believes that if you do not adhere to its values and politics, you cannot be a moral person. Howard Dean recently said that Democrats care if children go to bed hungry at night and Republicans don't. \n \n Rabbi Yoffie also said that \"we need beware of the zealots who want to make their religion the religion of everyone else.\" But isn't that exactly what liberals wish to do - make everyone liberal? Why, pray tell, are liberals who want everyone to be liberal considered moral and moderate, but Christians who want everyone to be Christian considered \"zealots\" and \"bigots\"?\n \n Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the Jewish religious left's convention was how clearly it revealed the supremacy of leftist concerns over Jewish ones. History will record that a month after the Islamic Republic of Iran called for the annihilation of the Jewish state, 5,000 Reform Jews passed resolutions calling for District of Columbia voting rights and \"workers' rights\" but none about a call for what would amount to another Holocaust or about Islamic anti-Semitism generally, the greatest eruption of Jew-hatred since Nazism. History will likewise also note that two years after the United States made war on a bloodthirsty tyrant who paid the families of murderers of Jews $25,000 each, Reform Judaism passed a resolution condemning that war.\n \n As an active member for 15 years of a Reform synagogue that I love, I can only take this as another sign that the movement has been taken over by people whom one rarely hears about - the religious left. \n \n http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-op-prager11dec11,0,7353045.story?coll=la-sunday-commentary (L.A.

   "Well first, I see you didn't have an answer to all the examples I posted that already busted your \"no Trinity\" folly.\n \n \"Elohim\"\n \n In the very first verse of the Bible we find a statement which clearly illustrates the plurality of God.\n \n \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\"\n Genesis 1:1\n \n The Hebrew word that is used for God in Genesis 1:1 is the word Elohim, a derivitive of the word El. \"El\" denotes God in the singular sense, while \"Elohim\" is the plural notation for God. Of the 2,750 times that these words are used in the Old Testament, Elohim, the plural form, is used in 2,500 cases, and is used 32 times in the accounts of the Genesis creation of the heavens and the earth.\n \n Another excellent example of the word Elohim used in a critical text is found in Exodus 20:1, where the Lord is giving the Ten Commandments to Moses and the people of Israel:\n \n \"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt.\"\n \n Grammatically, it would be acceptable to say, \"I am the Lord your Gods.\" Such examples as these, which occur 2,500 times in the Old Testament, raises the following question: If the scriptures are the divine word of God, why would the Lord consistently select the plural form of God - Elohim, to refer to Him in a plural sense? Why would He not use the singular form, El, in each instance? This is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed for those who believe in a monotheistic God.\n \n \"Majestic\"?

I can't for the life of me understand pickled pigs feet, cow tongue or monkey brains, I don't know that I could work in a slaughterhouse or be an ER doctor yet many do and much worse without hesitation.\n \n But for the sake of argument we travel down this road, an instinctual disgust for something is meaningless unless one learns from that perception. It further can be very misleading in not all things that seem good are and vice versa. \n \n The experiment also does not take into consideration bias that is inherent in any experiment with people and their judgments. As I had said I think the stronger argument is one in which God would have given man the ability to become moral. Trying to make it something hardwired into us I think is to big a leap from point A to point B.\n \n \n Emotions key to judging others: New piece to puzzle of how human brain constructs morality from study of harmful intent\n Revealing The Origins Of Morality -- Good And Evil, Liberal And Conservative\n Moral dilemma scenarios prone to biases",
