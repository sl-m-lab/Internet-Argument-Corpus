Before, you could not walk three blocks without fearing for your life. Now you can. But not four,\" he said. \"We have water and sometimes electricity. It is good. I am happy to be alive. Also, I know that none of my family members will be killed while walking these blocks. They were all killed during the invasion.\"\n\n \n \nFox noted the absence of Sunni-Shiite tension in the village, attributing the success to aggressive outreach to tribal sheiks, coordinated efforts to open communication and promote understanding, and the 2005 massacre that killed much of the Shiite minority.\n \n \"There are more than enough armchair quarterbacks to tell you that these people won't work for a unified nation, but for about two years that's just what's happened here,\" said Fox. \"If you want to see dysfunctional, look at Tuz Khormato. Or Jican. Or any area other than these three blocks.\"\n",
