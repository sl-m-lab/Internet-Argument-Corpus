   "A few hours ago my wife and I helped a woman we'd just met do something that she had no ability to accomplish for herself. To us it was \"no big thing\" because we do similar things frequently and easily - and it took only a half hour or so. \n \n When we were finished she was very thankful and a bit amazed that we would just do things for a stranger. THEN she said, \"You must be Christian\", as though that explained our good nature. \n \n My wife corrected her mistake and said that if we decide to do something for someone it is because we decide to do so - not because of religion. The woman (a Christian as it turned out) seemed genuinely shocked to encounter that attitude - as though she could not understand how Non-Christians (my wife and I are atheists) could be moral, ethical, helpful, kind or generous. This is not the first time we have encountered that attitude, and really not that uncommon. \n \n Question for discussion: Why do many (most?)

I won't speculate as to what percentage of Christians hold that attitutude, but I have noticed it myself. One frequent poster here once claimed to me that only Christianity really, really calls on people to be good, that other religions don't come close in that regards. Putting on my speculation hat, I would guess this trend has a similar motivation to many behaviors witnessed in excessively expressive religious people: a need to bolster a lack of real faith. It's not enough for them to simply believe their religion, it's not enough for them to think that they are right, others have to be wrong as well. This can be expressed in many ways, of course. In this instance, we're seeing it take the form of \"my religion is the only true path to goodness\". If goodness can come from any religion, or even no religion, then they lose a concrete reason why their religion must be followed. They would have to fall back to merely relying on faith for their belief, and apparently they would rather not do that. That's my guess, anyway.",

Christians assume that \"goodness\" or good deeds or morality are characteristics produced by their religion and not by other belief systems or by non-religious moral and ethical codes (even though the evidence is to the contrary)?\n\n \n Hi, I am newcomer, its nice to meet all of you! I am a conservative Christian and this is my views in regards to this matter:\n \n I find that it is not that Christians assume that goodness or deeds are aspects of their religion, rather, these are qualities that both you (internally and you may not know it) and the general Christian believe are driven by the faith of Christianity. It may coincide with other religions , like the golden rule (Christianity) and karma (hinduism), but that doesn't mean that kindness is a universal thing.\n \n There are two reasons for this. First, that person may assume that you are a Christian because it is instilled with you since birth that kindness is an act of good, but the truth is that it is NOT universal. To help others is not something present in all religions, nor a good thing. To help a slave in old polytheistic religions would be insane and not a generally good thing to do. This is also about perception.\n \n I am assume that you are living in a generally Christian country or region, by the way the person thanked you. If not, it is my deepest apology of my ignorance of this matter. You see, if kindness is not an aspect of Christianity, then why did you help that person in the first place? If you don't have some sort of underlying belief in God, then why did you bother to help? I'm assuming that you claim it is your belief in an omnipresent, universal moral code, but I disagree. Kindness doesn't come from nowhere, Giant, it doesn't come from some logical moral code. It is something driven from a religion. If atheism is so true, then why do you feel the need to assist others? I mean, if I steal something from someone, nothing will happen after I die. If I kill everyone on this planet, nothing will punish me. \n \n And the final reason for your question, why do people perceive good deeds come from religion and not a moral code? Because laws, ideas, and traditions in any area are based off of the church (not meaning Christian per se, but any state religion like Islam). You don't steal, you don't lie are all Christian beliefs, but if there was a religion on this planet that supported stealing, lying, you can't really say that it is universal then, can you? I truly believe that by assisting that person, you have an underlying Christian side to you.",

   "Here we go again. Where on Earth did you get these notions from? Are you saying that, without religion, mankind would have no moral code or fibre? By what stretch of the imagination do you assume such?\n \n Actually, this is exactly what I am stating. ;) Without religion, there is no moral code. For example, there is no established society in the world, with laws, that has not had a historical state religion embedded into it. Even with established \"secularism\" (established, but not internal) in America, even without a ten commandments placed on the board in a school, rules are established that are of Christian background. Freedom, for example, is not a universal right. In older Hinduism, the caste system established prevents lower class Untouchables to communicate with anybody at all. Therefore, through deductive reasoning, if universal rights are not found in Hinduism, then it is not universal. However, this of course would spawn the counter argument that atheism is true enlightenment, and that simply demonstrates the foolishness of established religion, and its detrimental effects. But then, atheism could also be a syncretic philosophy that takes parts of other religions and combines them.\n \n Perhaps wouldn't have been a good thing to do if caught, but that doesn't negate the existence of a moral code based on helping each other. And where is the evidence that:\n a. religion authors a/the moral code;\n b. outwith religion there is no moral code;\n c. the moral code of those without belief in a deity is founded in institutions in which they do not believe?\n \n Why on earth would you feel it in your heart (or mind or whatnot) to help another if you are not grateful of the love of God? Now put simply, A.) Religion does author the moral code of a society, then how would the moral code be in existence? Again, this is difficult to explain, because like a fish who is the last one to realize it lives in the ocean, we are indoctrinated values and morals that are just too difficult to imagine life without. B and C.) First, The constitution is the peak and the height of all American freedoms, just like in other countries with a constitution. It stresses freedoms for all individuals. But what the framers didn't know (or we do not know that they knew) was that freedom, as I have stressed, is not a universally given right. The coincidence of helping each others may be present in most religions, even anti-religions, but freedom is not, it is an enlightened idea based on the freedoms indoctrinated in the Bible. The idea of Universal freedom only just came in the 1700s, where enlightened \"free-thinking\" individuals came up with the idea. Of course, it was always there in the Bible, evidently in Exodus, but like I said, people only see what they want to see.\n \n \n This is where some Christians act out of fear of punishment from God. If there was no such fear of punishment, then you may well do as you please. That's the scary thing about religion: don't act naturally towards your fellow man, make sure of your own vested interests, come what may.\n \n Exactly, some Christians, which is an entirely different topic. Of course, if there is no fear of punishment, one may do as one pleases, but that is not why some others are Christians. I seemed to have used the wrong words. I don't try to help others because I don't want to go to hell. I want to help others so I can be spiritually full and go to heaven, and be with the Lord. And what exactly is natural to your fellow man? What are my interests?\n \n 'Atheists' tend to think differently. This life is all there is, so we try and make it as pleasant as possible. We try and adopt civilised behaviour towards each other because it's in ALL our interests. It's a natural consequence of our own development. We don't need a book to TELL us how to conduct ourselves, then take the moral high ground as if religion was the font of all wisdom and human behaviour.\n \n Pleasant is an extremely subjective word that suggests a normal lifestyle. Pleasant depends on the person. Of course, if everyone around you is acting \"pleasant\", and \"civilized\", you would have to be pleasant and civilized too to work in a mutual society. If this life is all there is, and atheism is so true, then why not make the most of it, start a revolution, overthrow this heinous government, promote the idea that everyone should work solely for their own interests, and eliminate all existing rituals of religions (marriages, funerals, Christmas, easter, Valentines Day, etc). But of course, free thinkers are already doing all this to try and make our society more \"pleasant\". \n \n In all honesty, and this may sound corny, Science and rational thinking may be able to explain rational phenomena, like why the earth goes around the sun, but never, even with infinite knowledge of the universe, will ever be able to explain the irrational phenomena why people form such bonds of love, and why our society is built upon mutual cooperation.",

I hope you get it!\n \n \nDuring the Seventh Crusade, led by St. Louis, Yves le Breton reported how he once encountered an old woman who wandered down the street with a dish full of fire in her right hand and a bowl full of water in her left hand. Asked why she carried the two bowls, she answered that with the fire she would burn up Paradise until nothing remained of it, and with the water she would put out the fires of Hell until nothing remained of them: \"Because I want no one to do good in order to receive the reward of Paradise, or from fear of Hell; but solely out of love for God.\" Today, this properly Christian ethical stance survives mostly in atheism.\n\n \n You can find the whole article here.\n \n \nWhy on earth would you feel it in your heart (or mind or whatnot) to help another if you are not grateful of the love of God?\n\n \n And going back to this question, let's think for a minute.\n \n There are some (okay, most) Christians who say that theirs is the only true religion. If you are saying that you only do good deeds for the love of God (ie your god - to be rewarded by or punished by), then, assuming that these Christians are correct, it must follow that those who worship other gods are doing good deeds for nothing (or a lie).\n \n So goodness cannot come from only the Christian God as there are billions of people round the world who do not believe in the Christian god. So their goodness comes from within them and nowhere else. So why can this not be true of all people, that goodness comes from within, not from some mythical supreme being?\n \n Smiley",

   "The religious must fight on rational grounds. The religious must not pose any topics rooted within irrationality, because that would be a demonstration of their ignorance.\nHow would you define rationality? Most topics posed by the religious are irrational, in that they are emotive arguments and not based on logic and reasoning. Mind-bending belief in an unproven deity, flat denial of any fact or theory which could usurp that belief, reward-seekers generally lacking in altruism, the whole showing a lack of sound judgement as for the large part their belief system is totally unfounded.\n \nWe can't ask for the scientific reason for why we have feelings, or fall in love, because that would sound idiotic and idealistic.\nYou carry on believing that. Are you afraid of a non-religious answer? Why would it sound idealistic? Bizarre.\n \nI myself (sic):p seem to be falling in the that trap too.

You could do good deeds, give millions of dollars to the poor, but if your heart is stone, then your deeds really mean nothing.\nSo Christian good deeds are based on the belief and love of Christ?

But I suggest that you'd still act morally and ethically as a contributing member of society.

However, survival of the fittest claims that it is NOT beneficial for one to help others, only to your advantage.

To do a good deed for nothing (not that means nothing) is a far greater thing than to do a good deed because you are force or cajoled into doing so.\n \n You may do good deeds for the love of Christ, but there are plenty of people who don't need that love to do the same.\n \n \nCooperating with others from an atheistic point of view shows the benefits for you.

I hope you're not implying that those who are not religious cannot move beyond this concept.\n \n If I were to live in a purely selfish manner, I could not then moan if others did the same.

By reading you gain experience (assuming you're reading the words of others), you can develop concepts of what is right and what is wrong. Interaction with others is another way of developing a moral concept. The inclusion of a mythical supreme being only introduces the concept of an overseer, someone who will punish/reward you.\n \n Your example of the two children playing is flawed. Each child would find that stealing from the other does nothing to enrich their relationship. However, assuming that their is a relationship left after the stealing stage, they would quickly learn that cooperation is a much better way to go for both of them.

Trust you!\n \n On your other point, I am not looking for a reason to do good deeds. 'It is the right thing to do' is all I need.\n \n As to all the arguments about whether doing these good deeds is altruistic; I agree that doing good deeds because it will improve society and therefore be good for you could be seen as not truly altrustic. It is also true that Jesus taught that you should do good deeds expecting nothing in return, but this is something that tends not to happen. The vast majority of Christians I have encountered say they do good because it pleases their chosen deity, as do those of other religions. Atheists do not need this supreme being to do good. Maybe their reward is a better society in this life.\n \n And as we have touched on the teaching of Jesus, how about the story of the Good Samaritan? The outcast was the 'good deeder' in that story. Surely that goes some way to show that you don't need to be Christian to do good deeds. It is within us all.\n \n Getting back to the initial point of this thread, which was to ask whether you need to be Christian to do good, I think it has been shown quite clearly that you don't. If the teachings of Jesus are to be absolutely altruistic, then that is indeed something to aspire to. But even in his teachings there are examples of those who manage without being Christian.\n \n However you get there, your good deeds is of equal worth.\n \n Smiley",

But regardless, you seem to be inferring here that Christians are doing it, not out of genuine compassion, but for ulterior reasons. This may be the case with many Christians, but I'd say it's also the case with atheists (for their own reasons). The most you can really say is that both groups have their reasons. And just because a deity says you should behave a certain way, and both groups do it (atheists and believers included) does not mean that one group did it not out of genuine compassion.

   "I understand what you're saying, but I think we get into deep water if we try to untangle what is and is not motive.\n\n \n I tend to think motive is one of the most important aspects of doing a good deed. In fact, I'd say motive has a lot to do with determining whether the deed is really good or not. A deed may still benefit other people regardless, but just benefiting other people can be chalked up to society taking care of itself for (as you pointed out) it's own survival. But I think that's different than true goodness. Hell, the marketplace could be beneficial. One could argue that giving someone the opportunity to buy food where there has been no such marketplace might be an act of benefit. I wouldn't call that an act of being good; rather it's a beneficial act, benefiting both parties. So I think motive always matters in whether or not the act is truly good or not. I'd agree though, that pragmatically it doesn't always matter.\n \n I also suspect that untangling intentions (motive) is really a lot more important to you than you may think. If someone is wanting you to recommend them for a job, and they just happen to send you a gift before you give the recommendation, chances are you're going to assume there's motive behind that gift other than just pure, unadulterated goodwill.\n \n \nWhen self-denial is what you seek, its accomplishment cannot but be self-satisfying.
