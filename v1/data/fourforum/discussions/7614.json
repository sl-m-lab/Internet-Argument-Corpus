   "I came across this list in a book, Ideas of the Great Philosophers by William S. and Mabel Lewis Sahakian:\n \n The Twelve Virtues according to Aristotle:\n \n Courage; Temperance; Liberality; Magnificence; Magnanimity; an unnamed virtue which lies between the Vice of Deficiency, Lack of Ambition and the Vice of Excess, (Over) Ambitiousness, so I'd think one could safely assume that this particular Virtue could be named Ambition; Gentleness; Truthfulness; Wittiness; Friendliness; Modesty; and Righteous Indignation.\n \n This was first published in 1966 and it seems to me that Righteous Indignation does not presently find favor as a virtue. Magnificence also seems to be a strange quality to be esteemed as a virtue, but it lies between the Vices of Meanness and Vulgarity so I'm wondering if it might refer to having good taste.\n \n I have not yet been able to find another source for these virtues but I would assume that they were listed in the original Greek texts of Aristotle. I wonder how these virtues would translate into modern values and if they would all meet the criteria of what is currently considered virtue.",

I would suggest more religious reasons for this: pride is hard to maintain along with a focus on the might of God and the sinfulness of man. \n \n I would agree with simone that these are rather social virtues: but that isn't bad for Aristotle.
