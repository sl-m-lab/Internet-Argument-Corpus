   "Actually the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible for any matter or information to travel faster than the speed of light. Currently, work in the area of superluminal propagation of light is being hotly debated by experts in physics. \n \n The NEC Research institute is claiming that they have forced light to exceed 3.0x10^6 m/s by setting up and array of lasers and pulsing light through a chamber filled with cesium gas. The light emerged nanoseconds before what Einstein's equations predict. Some have questioned what this means for Einstien's theories. Researchers claim the light left the chamber before it entered. This has caused controversy since it appears to violate the laws of causality, which states that causes must always preceed there events. \n \n I think the latter debate rests merely in the philosophical nature of physicists and there is no real basis for this claim. This result could simply be a problem with the instrumentation used to measure the data. Besides, someone had to throw the switch that started the light beam to begin with. Interesting question, though. \n \n Be assured that Einstien's special theory of relativity remains intact, for the mean time. Scientists have defended it, by pointing to the fact that light waves have no real mass. Therefore, what was apparently measured does not violate the light barrier for matter. The answer to your question is no, matter can not travel faster than the speed of light, given what we currently know about the physical world. Is this subject to change? Always.\n \n Here are some sources:\n \n http://www.lastek.com.au/light.htm\n http://home.att.net/~meditation/lightspeed.html",

In order to travel faster than c a particle must first reach c. If you don't believe me, then try reaching 30mph in your vehicle without reaching 20mph. This also means that considering the closer a particle reaches c the closer to infinity inertia gets, meaning it would take more than an infinite amount of energy to travel faster than c. The only way a particle can travel at super relativistic velocities is if that particle traveled at that speed naturally, much like photons travel at c naturally. The only particle that travels at such a velocity is the tachyon. The tachyon is only a theoretical particle which has never been observed in the known universe. According to theory, the tachyon (if it were to exist) is unable to interact with any sub-light particles. It's conjectured to exist in a parallel universe in which the every particle in our universe is observed as a tachyon.",

   "First off, PHOTONS DO NOT HAVE MASS. If they did when you got hit with a light you would feel it, it would be soft, but you would feel it. \n \n Now the graviational feild of an object, from what I have learned, increases realitive to the original gravitationail force exerted by said matter, some kind of infinity constant I assume.\n \n And black holes don't have infinite gravity. Don't make me explain it, but only the center of a blackhole, called the singularity, has infinite gravity. \n \n O.k., the answer to the original post is sorta. A photon is both a wave and a particle, but is considered energy. The thing that supposedly makes up a photon is a tachyon. Said tachyon is so small to be both energy and matter, being both at the same time. Now tachyons could go faster then light, mainly because if you have the same amount of energy as matter you really don't care about infinite mass, cause you'd get infinite energy as well (relative to the orginal mass/energy of stated object).\n \n Now because tachyons are both energy/matter, the answer is agian sorta. Half-a-particle-of-matter could go the speed of light, while a whole one would stop.\n \n This is uncharted terrieritory, and I would advise agiasnt trying to show up the Physicist Uncle of yours. \n \n Finally that guy above me is right (about the physics). If you think in terms of newtanian principles, and velocity A times Mass B equals force then you'll get no where. I mean think about this. Potential energy and Potential trajectroy, both effect the outcome of kentic energy (potential energy) and actual trajectory (potential trajectory). \n \n Example: If photon A has to pick path 1 or path 2, it will always pick path 1, because path 2 is already taken up by the potiential photon which exists in a parralel universe (or just a parrelel path, no bodys sure on that part).\n \n Agian highly theoritical, but you catch my drift.",

While building black holes is currently beyond us we do still know how to bend space- the mass of photons is enough to bend it a little, and a square of four high powered lasers is enough to bend it a bit (don't need much, just a little to get over the tiny fraction of c we can't acclerate a sub atomic particle up to). The high speed of the particle and the added moving of space it is in relative to us will make it go faster than light and thus back in time.\n \n Mallet's Time machine",
