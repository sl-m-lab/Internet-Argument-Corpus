   "Our Noah's Ark \n The last prophecy letter by Michael777 \n This letter is dedicated to all Christians\n \n Our time here is getting short. Therefore, I've decided to construct one final outline of prophetic events. These prophetic events, which I've been writing about and debating for over two decades, are now heading towards a conclusion. Therefore, it is important that this letters purpose be understood. This letter is an interpretation and will move fairly fast with limited explanation. I hope it is understandable to all.\n \n Since Christianity began, believers have always been taught to have faith. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen, Hebrews 11:1. It has always been my thought that if the Bible was true faith would eventually become reality. In other words, prophecies that were written in a vague manner would start to become apparent and faith would become visible. An example of this would be Noah's Ark. If we could see the Ark upon a mountain then something we learned as faith would become a reality. Reality is one step higher than Faith. Short of seeing God, which we cannot do until we die, this is as good as it gets for a believer. Therefore, this is what I call, \"Our Noah's Ark\". Our Noah's Ark is prophecy fulfilled in plain view. This now becomes something seen, instead of faith in something unseen. Better said, some of the prophecies of Revelation are finally becoming discernible, which suggests a conclusion. The two most important items that must be derived from this narrative are as follows. If these prophecies which were written centuries ago are now happening, we know two things. One, that the author of those prophecies was God; and two, that the religion he brought was true. Any other way must become false and will lead to the second death, which is the death of the soul. Let's get started. \n \n Note: not all verses are exact quotes. Some are paraphrased.\n \n Rev. 13:1 - The beast with seven heads and ten horns.\n \n The seven heads are seven nations. The ten horns are ten kings. The beast is a group of nations that will wage war or the leader of those nations. Literally, it is Israel and the Muslim nations that surround her. This beast was born when Israel received her independence in 1948. This beast though, as stated in Rev. 13:1, is actually Israel at a specific time in her history. It denotes the Oslo Accords of 1993 and the beginning of land for peace. This agreement lasted seven years and ended in September 2000 with the start of the second intifada. This brings us to those three extra kings who the beast subdues in Daniel. These kings were Israeli Prime Ministers and all served during this seven year time frame. Arafat was known to have boasted that he affected the elections in Israel three times through terror. Daniel 9:27 says he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week. The covenant began with the agreement between Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin. It is also known as Daniel's 70th week. In Hebrew, the word many is written Rab. \n \n Rev. 13:3- The beasts deadly head wound.\n \n Head is a nation. It is similar to the heads of Rev 13:1, only singular. The beast's head (nation) was wounded in 1967 and is now being healed through the Oslo Accords.\n \n Rev. 13:4- And they worshipped the dragon. Who is able to make war with him?\n \n Islam is a false religion. The dragon is Satan. As long as they aren't worshipping Christ they are worshipping Satan. Who is able to make war with him refers to the difficulty of fighting a terrorist enemy. In other words, they are not really an army. A suicide bomber is almost impossible to defend against.\n \n Rev. 13:5- he was able to continue 42 months.\n \n Arafat continued for 42 months during the Oslo Accords before terror finally caused the Israelis to stop giving into his demands. The last 42 months of those seven years were not nearly as productive for him. This was during the term of Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister from 1996 to 1999.\n \n Rev. 13:7- power was given him over all kindreds and nations.\n \n Arafat had power over all peoples of the Earth in the United Nations. All nations wanted Israel to give back lands won in the 1967 war. Votes in the U.N. are always one-sided in favor of the Palestinians.\n \n Rev. 13:10- this is a parable. Those who lead into captivity will be taken captive. Those who kill with the sword shall be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and faith of the saints.\n \n Translation- If you lead others to false Gods you will be taken captive by those Gods. If you kill with the sword, which the Lord is the two-edged sword or better said the Word of God , you will be killed with the sword. In other words, believers will be taken by the Lord. This is the faith of the saints.\n \n Rev. 13:11- and I beheld another beast coming up out of the Earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.\n \n This second beast has two horns. The horns are kings. Therefore, this second beast is a country with two kings. This is the Palestinian Authority after Hamas was elected and brought into the Unity Government in 2006.\n \n Rev. 13:12- And he exercises all the power of the first beast before him, and causes the earth and them which dwell therein, to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.\n \n Hamas exercised all the power of the previous PA government because they were now an equal partner in the Government. Also, the leader of Hamas caused them to worship or honor the first beast (Mahmoud Abbas and the PA) because he would not honor the first beast. The first beast was the PA without Hamas as a member. The image of the beast is what the Government of Mahmoud Abbas represented. Verse 12 does not mention the image yet, we are just informed that he caused them to worship the first beast. Verse 14 and 15 gives the details of how that worshipping or honor was to commence. An image was created of the first beast that he (the false prophet) caused to be honored. This image of the beast is three items; the recognition of Israel, the honoring of all prior Palestinian agreements, and a renunciation of terror.\n \n Rev. 13:13- \"And he does great wonders, so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the Earth in the sight of men\". What is the great wonder that he does in the sight of men?????\n \n The answer is Hamas or Palestinian rocket fire on the cities of Sderot and Ashkelon. \n \n Rev. 13:15- And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast, should be killed.\n \n Hamas gave life unto the image of the beast. Why? Because Hamas would not honor the image themselves. In other words, if Hamas agreed with the image it would never have been an issue. It was born from their disagreement. Therefore, they gave it life. Another way to say it is they caused it to be or exist.\n \n Rev. 13:16- \"and he caused all both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or their foreheads:\n Rev. 13:17- And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\n Rev.13:18- Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding, count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man, and his number is, six hundred threescore and six.\"\n \n These last three verses all refer to the beast (Mahmoud Abbas). If you were to think of it as a time line, it drops back in time a few years. Verse 16 is the election of Mahmoud Abbas as the President of the PA Government after the death of Yasser Arafat. All voters received an indelible ink mark on their hands so they could not vote twice. This was the Mark. It says in verse 17 no one could buy and sell unless they had the mark, the name, or the number of the beast. The number of the beast happened on June 16, 2006. This was the date that a new program was established that allowed Mahmoud Abbas to receive funds to pay the salaries of his people. This program was called the Temporary International Mechanism. All salaries passed through the office of Mahmoud Abbas. Therefore, if you were a supporter of his and on his payroll you got paid. Hamas did not receive salaries. Hamas also did not receive the mark of Mahmoud Abbas. They boycotted the PA elections for President on Jan. 9, 2005. \n \n I cannot explain it much better than that. This is why this is my last letter. There is nothing more for me to say. Now all that's left is for the final war to start. I believe that will happen very soon. This is Our Noah's Ark. Michael777",
