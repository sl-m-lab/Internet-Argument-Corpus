So, by some stretch of the imagination, NS is not selecting benefit. Is this reasonable?\n\n No. It is a given that natural selection has no power of prediction. If failing to select a neutral or negative trait at the time will cause problems in the future NS won't care. That does not mean the trait is not beneficial now. NS selects for benefit in reproducing offspring as that is the only thing that can effect the next generations gene frequency. It is just lucky for us that intelligence necessitates a very individualistic mode of survival, our form perhaps among all animals places great emphasis on control systems based on dynamic reaction as opposed to hard coded instincts. This causes the 'species' at any particular moment to adapt in seconds and not centuries, it gives the individual benefit in it's own life and not just in the context of it's children. I mention this because that is a very common theme among animals. Individual success is typically very related to reproductive success because only a successful animal has the resources to produce many young, plus as soon a sexual selection started the ultimate competition not just with other species but with your own species starts, which instantly ties evaluation of genes by at least some kind of criteria to the reproductive success ratio. This allows genes to be selected not just for how well the animal can reproduce but live as well (I know the living well is just a means to an end from an evolutionary perspective).\n \n This all is pretty useful conceptually but we must remember the original definition, benefit is not individual success by any other standard other than reproduction. Therefore natural selection selects only for benefit and filters only disadvantage. It does not select future or past modifications, it does not select individual well being except in so far as it is tied to the reproductive benefit.\n \n Note also the somewhat circular logic one would put oneself through if they confused the two. Often enough biologist (quite rightly) define a successful life as one which produces many offspring.\n \n At the extreme opposite end of human mode of survival (what gives us selective advantages) stands parasites, parasites lives in general consist entirely of producing the next generation. How can you define the success of such an organism except by it's reproductive success i.e. real benefit?\n \n That panda example sounded pretty reasonable, but as you noted in your post it must have been beneficial when it was selected. No selective pressure would select against many baby pandas unless mother pandas take care of them (and they do) which means if there were many many pandas once it would be more about how many cubs a mother could take care of to the point where they could compete in the population. Not really an individual vs species benefit. Selection just as it doesn't care about future, past, or unrelated 'benefit' also does not see the big picture of the species and selects for features which seem to take into account the state of the species only in so far as they help the reproduction of the individual. i.e. if a panda mother could raise more cubs that would have a chance; it would be selected despite the fact that a heightened reproduction would not be stable given the resources and more pandas would fight it out.

   "Freedom, not sure how you interpreted what I said as NS selecting for future environment. NS will select a low birth rate because a high birth, if it becomes prevalent within a local group, would be detrimental to the whole of that local group where the frequency of whatever trait leads to a high birthrate is prevalent. That is, the groups of populations within a genome (or species) that keep their birthrate low are more successful than groups that don't. You have to realize that breeding is not perfectly mixed and local groups breed within local groups more often than they breed between local groups.\n \n So instead of concentrating on numbers, the panda concentrated on quality. If some quality is tied to successful offspring or good health, it will often become what NS starts selecting for. Say, a healthy, colorful coat shows that a panda is resistant to parasites, for example. You have mates selected based on a colorful healthy coat. You see this often when a species has few or no natural predators. It stops becoming a numbers game and becomes a health or fitness game. The species finds a way to compete within its genome without resorting to high birthrate.\n \n All this said, NS still only selects what is benefiting the individual. I said \"by some stretch of the imagination\" in my earlier post because NS was selecting traits that benefited the population and in turn the entire genome - but this is only because the individual finds itself within that genome.",

That's one example just off the top of my head.\n \n I hope you don't think I'm talking about one allele having both reproductive success and survival detriment. That being said, it's easy to see how an organism which is selected for due to it's reproductive success could also have a gene which negatively impacts it's survival.\n\n But the t gene comes from mutation not selection.",

What I was contending however is that benefit would mean absolutely nothing without reproductive success which is not what bennedict implied.\n\n I think that you are correct. There is a great example of your point related by Jonathan Weiner in his book about the 20+ years that evolutionary biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant spent in the study of Darwin's finches on Daphne Major island in the Galapagos.\n Jonathan Weiner. 1994. The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time. Alfred A. Knopf. New York.\n \n Also there is 1995, Vintage Books (A Division of Random House). New York.The former is the hardcover, ISBN 0-679-40003-6. The latter is the paperback, ISBN 0-679-73337-X.\n \n The Grants spent several months each year observing, capturing and tagging the Galapagos finches. The were actually able to identify individual birds by sight. They observed that the two longest surviving birds in over 20 years of observations (both males) did not leave any offspring that survived to reproduce. So whatever benefits allowed these two birds to survive so long, and allowed then to reproduce so many times, was in the long run irrelevant to evolution. None of their offspring survived to reproduce.\n \n Generally I state that natural selection is differential reproductive success. But the two birds that the Grants observed probably produced, in toto, more offspring than any other birds on the island. And yet, they are irrelevant to evolution.\n \n So natural selection isn't merely survival to produce offspring, but survival to produce offspring that also reproduce offspring that also survive to produce...etc.\n \n One thing that I can claim and that you can claim is that all of our ancestors were survivors who reproduced.",

   "One thing that I can claim and that you can claim is that all of our ancestors were survivors who reproduced.\n\n Ah good old humans. Sometimes I hear the idea that humans are not subject to evolution because of our civilization. That is of course not true, but we are certainly a totally novel system of selection pressures that don't fit a comparison to other animals.\n \n Some animals promote their genes by favouring only their own reproduction, some favour genes similar to theirs (selfish gene). What humans have transcended is either of those modes (although given up neither), a human can select for traits irregardless of whether they are his own genes or similar genes by supporting those traits in a social setting. The evolution of man is no longer an evolution of genes but primarily of values, the heritable traits are now knowledge; the selection pressures for virtues.\n \n Compared to random mutation it is little wonder that the progress we have made has been in the blink of an eye, when instead of a generation a shift in thought can take place in a single moment.\n \n That 'something' which has made upright apes more powerful (and in my opinion more likely to endure a very long time) is the complete real time automation of adaptation. Say humanity faces a new problem in the next 100 years or so. What chance has a behavioral modification through mutation to beat a change in beliefs to the adaptation?\n \n The rational faculty in man has replaced almost everything that had to be slowly modified over eons and even now it is taking selection pressure of the need to fight disease, and a thousand other little functions.\n \n I'm sorry, clearly I'm ranting; that didn't really have much to do with your post emoticon_emb",
