Then, there's Noah and the whale or a great fish or something, and a whole bunch of other adventure stuff. For sex, there's always King Solomon who always had an eye for the ladies--like his daddy, hehe. The angst and woe of Job and, speaking of Solomon's daddy, David, a lot of whining but a real whizbang story about the sling and stone and the giant and bringing down a kingdom, and there's the lions in the den and what's his name.\n \n I mean, you have a book that's just chock full of adventure of stories with a bunch of prophets calling out \"Woe to the sinners\" on the sideline once in a while.\n \n Tales of rape, incest, adultery gad, talk about steamy.

   "Actually the bible was not written for a secular readership its a hard book to understand and many untaught, unguided and worse many unstable people twist scripture for their own ends, the bible was not available to a secular readership until rather recently about 500 years ago when a certain monk transcribed it from the original greek & hebrew into german, you can thank the printing press for the so called \"liberation\" of the bible...personally I think its \"pearls thrown to the swine\" - not that I am calling any of you pigs, no its a religious term that you may take offense to but really there is no actuall insult there....\n \n The bible previously had only been wrote in greek and hebrew and availible to read in a pre-reformation church where it would be kept chined up.\n \n This served two purposes.\n \n 1. That scripture could only be read by those interested enough to go to church, thus most likely Christian\n \n 2. Only those who had a good education in the \"religious languages\" of hebrew and greek could understand it, thus most likely a well taughed well guided Christian.\n \n So your answer is no, its not a book written to bring about conversion, it was writen for the intention of preserving the word of god and teaching, rebuking, correcting and training the man of god....i.e the Christian in righteousness.\n \n Since the reformation and the translation of the bible into every language known to man we have had new so called \"christian\" churches springing up on every street corner for years there now exists over 33,000 denominations of christianity all with different beliefs and doctrines all based on peoples private interpretation of the bible, and these churches actually encorage private interpretation of the bible even though the bible itself clearly teaches that private interpretation of the bible should be DISCOURAGED.....
