   "\n Andrew Klavan\n A Man Alone\n Jesse Lee Peterson versus the \"black experience\"\n \n .In December 2001, the Toyota Motor Corporation held a public meeting at the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with racial activist Jesse Jackson. The purpose of the gathering was to discuss Toyota's \"Twenty-First Century Diversity Strategy,\" a ten-year program worth some $7.8 billion in contracts for minority-owned businesses. At even a casual glance, the program seemed a capitulation to Jackson, who had threatened to call for a black boycott of the carmaker over some ads that he deemed racist. Toyota's denials that it had given in to racial extortion rang unconvincing.\n \n Also in attendance that day was another black minister named Jesse-the Reverend Jesse Lee Peterson. Peterson is the staunchly conservative head of the Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny, or BOND, which is dedicated to \"rebuilding the family by rebuilding the man\"-educating males, mostly black males, about personal strength and responsibility. Peterson is also Jackson's sworn nemesis and calls him, among other things, a \"racist demagogue\" and a \"problem profiteer.\" For two years prior to the Toyota meeting, he'd been holding rallies declaring Martin Luther King, Jr. Day a \"National Day of Repudiation of Jesse Jackson.\" So when it came time for the Q&A, Peterson asked Toyota's reps if BOND could apply for its grants without joining Jackson's Trade Bureau at an entry fee of up to $2,500.\n \n \"All hell broke loose in the room,\" Peterson writes in his book Scam: How the Black Leadership Exploits Black America. \"Several blacks got up and started screaming obscenities at me.\" Jesse Jackson denounced \"some parasites who want to pick up apples from trees they didn't shake.\" When Peterson tried to leave the meeting, he claims that Jesse's son Jonathan confronted him and shoved him in the chest, while others surrounded him, shouting obscenities.\n \n Peterson sued, claiming that Jesse Jackson threatened him and that Jonathan assaulted him. The jury split 6-6 on the assault charge, and it was settled out of court. A lengthy 6-6 split on the other charges ended when, according to the Los Angeles Times, three jurors, still professing to believe Peterson, surrendered to the argument that he hadn't proved his claims. Though Jesse Jackson had to admit under oath that his Trade Bureau played a role in distributing the Toyota grants-and though he acknowledged the \"parasites\" remark-he and his son walked away largely unscathed.\n \n A Man Alone by Andrew Klavan, City Journal Winter 2010 \n\n \n It's refreshing to see a black man expose the race-baiting of Jesse Jackson and others. emoticon_xagree",
