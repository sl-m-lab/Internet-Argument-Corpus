Our legislators have decided that we do not want to have a Terry Schaivo case here. To the best of my knowledge, we have not had a case challenging these statutes.\n \n Are there any exceptions for when your will should be outright ignored?\n \n Only, IMHO, if I were incompetent at the time I made the Advance Directive or Living Will. That would be a matter for the Surrogate's Court to determine.\n \n Otherwise, my wishes should prevail, just as the wishes of a pregnant woman should prevail in the matter of continuing or terminating her pregnancy.\n \n See, we can easily get back to the forum topic. emoticon_xgood",
