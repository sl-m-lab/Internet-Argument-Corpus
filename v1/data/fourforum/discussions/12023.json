   "If I'm seeing the right photo, these eyes are in no way in the rear of the head. Although they do serve lateral vision because the insect has no neck and therefore is unable to turn its head. It must turn its whole body in order to advance its line of vision.\n\n That photo is looking at the four eyes on the front of its head. The diagram immediately above that photo on the website shows the location of the other four eyes, to the side and rear of the head:\n http://www.bumblebee.org/invertebrates/images/Salticus3.jpg\n \nSo by what evidence do you claim this is the result of evolution and not original creation?\n\n I have to ask: why did you present the supposed lack of animals with eyes in the backs of their heads as evidence against evolution, if the existence of animals with eyes in the backs of their heads isn't allowed to count as evidence for evolution? :)\n \nHad the spider been at such a defensive loss prior to allegedly evolving the median eyes, how did it originally survive the millions of years needed to adapt?\n\n Well, assuming for the sake of argument that they even were spiders at the time they evolved their arrangement of eyes, the answer would be \"Slightly less well\" :)\n \n Seriously. Animals of the same species are competing against each other as well as the rest of the environment. Spiders hose out far, far more offspring than could possibly ever survive, so even a slight statistical advantage, over hundreds of generations, can transform the genetic profile of the species. Which makes the next useful mutation more likely to occur to a creature already possessed of the first mutation, so they stack. And so on. It doesn't have to be an all or nothing, survive or perish situation. Those are very rare. \n \n You probably drive a car to work, right? It's quite likely that a horse and cart would not meet your commuting needs. If we apply your logic from above, the advantage - even necessity - of cars in your modern way of life means horses and carts could never have existed! The mistake is obvious: we're holding too much constant. Horses and carts were once perfectly adequate - and still are in some societies.\n \nEspecially in the radically environmentally unfriendly period in evolutionary history when this evolution process would have occurred?\n\n What makes you think it was any more hostile than now?\n \nAnd why hasn't it continued to evolve more sophisticated vision in the hundreds of millions of years since then?\n\n What makes you think it hasn't?\n \nAll of these questions demand a rational answer before Creationism can be discounted out of hand.\n\n It's never possible to discount special creation of all life, only to show that it's a loose and inelegant theory that doesn't make useful predictions. Special Creation is an explanation, Evolution is an explanation. The difference is that when we ask Creation 'what should we expect?' we get little more than a shrug. Creation means anything's possible. Evolution, on the other hand, is tightly bound by its own rules. We should never see a fossil of one of these creatures earlier than those creatures. We should never see this feature in that class of creature, because it evolved after evolution seperated them.\n \n If you have two sports anchors, and before the match one of them gives a detailed run-down of the teams' history and form, and expounds at length about what he expects the result of the game to be and how each player should perform, while the other says \"Well, I definitely think one team will win; I expect the ball to be kicked quite a few times and there will certainly be some passing and some running.\" - whom do you respect more if all the predictions of both anchors prove to be accurate?",

We cannot guess what they might be. Nevertheless, we can still makes statements about the statistical likelihood of such an accident occurring, yes? Does that accurate statement of probability mean that my fate on the road is literally determined by a dice roll, that if my number comes up, I crash, with 'chance as causality'? Of course not. We are merely describing the likelihood of an event in a system of which we have imperfect knowledge. As our knowledge of the system increases, our assessment of that likelihood changes: if you know my age and gender, my driving habits, my route and how busy or quiet it is - all these things permit a more accurate assessment of the odds. If we had perfect knowledge of a deterministic system, the odds would be 1 or 0.\n \n Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail. Nevertheless, in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically, saying how long we might have to wait, or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome. So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug, for instance, was based on chance is misleading: the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA.\n \n Correctly viewed, evolution is not a series of unlikely events, but a series of highly likely ones. It is highly likely, for instance, that some bacteria in a large colony would experience a mutation enabling the digestion of nylon. Sure - breaking that event down on a per-bacterium basis yields tiny probabilities, but why stop there? Why not break it down on a per-bacterium, per-microsecond basis?

If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them...I will lay it on the line - there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.\" -Colin Patterson: British Museum of Natural History\n\n \n \n\"Evolution is a fairy tale for grown-ups. This theory has done nothing to the progress of science. It is useless.\" - Louis Bounoure, President of the Biological Society of Strasbourg\n\n \n Shall I continue...\n \n \n\"When one ponders on the tremendous journey of evolution over the past 3 billion years or so, the prodigious wealth of structures it has engendered, and the extraordinarily effective teleonomic performances of living beings, from bacteria to man, one may well find oneself beginning to doubt again whether all this could conceivably be the product of an enormous lottery presided over by natural selection, blindly picking the rare winners from among numbers drawn at utter random.\" - Jacques Monod: Nobel Peace Prize Winning Biochemist\n\n \n \nAside from any quantitative considerations, it seems intuitively impossible that such self-evident brilliance in the execution of design could ever have been the result of chance. For, even if we allow that chance might have occasionally hit on a relatively ingenious adaptive end, it seems inconceivable that it could have reached so many ends of such surpassing 'perfection. -Michael Denton: Microbiologist [1986]\n\n \n \nI have therefore tried to see whether biological discoveries over the last thirty years or so fit in with Darwin's theory. I do not think that they do...I think, however, that we must go further than this and admit that the only acceptable explanation is creation. I know that this is anathema to physicists, as indeed it is to me, but we must not reject a theory we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it\" - H.S. Lipson: University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology [1980]\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIf I have an accident on the way to work tomorrow morning, there will be a definite cause; a specific series of events leading up to it.\n \n \n You wouldn't be able to have that analogy in context... because if there is nothing, cause cannot help you.

Nevertheless, we can still makes statements about the statistical likelihood of such an accident occurring, yes?

Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce.

You have no foundation to build all those cerebrally escapist notions and pseudo-scientific hypothesis on. In order for evolution to have even the slightest modicom of viabilty, time cannot be the catalyst along with change for the possiblity for something to become something else. maybe you need to read some of the quotes from the guys on your side saying it isn't possible... they know a heck of a lot more than you do on the subject - it's faith beyond that, and this is your faith. And to quote Frank Turek, I don't have enough faith to be an atheist, nor evolutionist.\n \n\n \n Except, of course, it isn't 'pseudo-scientific' at all, and you don't understand a thing about what evolution is about. It's funny that someone who can't even understand what evolution is wants to yell about the 'fundamentals'\n \n Yet, I am sure you are just so confident that there is this mysterious uncommunicative supernatural entity that is going around helping you in undetectable ways, and is going to give you 'eternal life'\n \n \n \n \n That's fine...

   "That is true, but it is still a Nylon Bug is not a Nylon Horse... mutations can occur laterally [intra species] but not ascending [something entirely different].\n\n I keep seeing that stated and restated, and yet nobody ever seems to be able to say what the difference supposedly is. As I pointed out to someone earlier, one could readily morph a chimp genome all the way into a human genome without ever making any single change that could not be dismissed, were it to be observed in nature, as a mere 'lateral' mutation.\n \n Nor do I think you perceive the import of what you've just conceded: a nylon bug may not be a nylon horse, but nor is it constrained to be what it was, forever. The universe evidently has no blanket prohibition against novelty - and that means you cannot argue against evolution from the standpoint of inviolable principle, but only upon the substantially weaker grounds of impracticality.\n \nNo, it is you young padawan learner... that has been mislead, some of the most famous and noted Darwinian Naturalists such as Crick, Huxley, Lipson... and others have admitted to their own discredit that the entire theory of evolutions rests on chance, here... but here, lets burst that bubble for you a bit more:\n\n I'm sure you reproduce these quotes in good faith, but you ought to know they are not necessarily what they seem. The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine: he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur, with ample supporting evidence from the natural world. I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification.\n \n(An accident on the way to work has a specific cause, yet can be modelled statistically) You wouldn't be able to have that analogy in context... because if there is nothing, cause cannot help you. That is the whole argument... without anything to start you cannot have cause be the agency for events to follow.\n\n But there are ample known causes for such novelty as is required by evolution. Mutation induced by chemical or energetic interference, recombination through sexual reproduction - surely you are not suggesting that these processes do not occur?\n \nInvalid argument to assert that mutations can map a road outside of their assigned task in illogical, where would the information to do so come from?\n\n Since we have observed it happening in the case of the nylon bug, it cannot be the obstacle you presume :)\n \n It's easy to get lost in abstract concerns about 'information'. For instance, imagine a lock with a three-digit code, like those on briefcases. It's easy to get in if you know the code, but it's also perfectly possible to get in without knowing the code - it just takes longer. If you're right about the way information works, that oughtn't to be possible.\n \n The crucial point is that the lock contains all the information required to open it. That information is transferred to the person trying to open it via feedback: when you get the right code, the case opens. If there was no feedback - if the person was not actually opening the case themselves but was just blindly shouting numbers for someone else to try with no idea if it was working or not - they would be none the wiser.\n \n Similarly, the nylon waste products metabolised by the nylon bug intrinsically possess all the necessary information concerning how they can be broken down. That information is transferred to the bacteria via the feedback of natural selection: the bugs who hit upon the right combination survive, and those who do not, perish. In this manner information about how to survive in the present environment is transferred from the environment and encoded in the genome. No information is being created, it is merely being moved around.\n \n(Evolution is a series of highly likely events)Evolution simply put, is the creation story for secular humanists and nothing more, which in and among itself if fine - I don't personally care if believe we evolved from Mountain Dew, but don't try to pass that off as fact when there is substantial evidence that says otherwise.\n\n On the contrary, there is no evidence to suggest that we have not evolved via common descent. Not in any living creature thus far examined, or any fossil thus far unearthed. We are obliged to seek out evolutionary mechanisms precisely because the fact that it has happened is beyond all doubt.",

We are obliged to seek out evolutionary mechanisms precisely because the fact that it has happened is beyond all doubt.\n\n \n Well of course, everything evolved from the same self-replicating organic molecule to result from the primordial soup. That's simply inevitable, since simple mathematics indicates that such a molecule would only arise once in a great while- and in the interrim, the offspring of that one molecule would devour or absorb all others, like a hatchling that ate all the other eggs in the nest.\n \n Now the question arises: did a greater intelligence PLAN it that way? \n Well if so, then it would have to be SO intelligent, that we couldn't prove it one way or another, at our current level of development.\n \n It would have had to have started at the Big Bang, using some short of mechanism to program a complex chain of events using precise physical principles; however given what we DO know, it would have have most likely depended upon various \"uncertainty principles\" to permit a general result rather than a precise one, simply setting the process in motion and calculating that life would arise somewhere by the laws of probability (which it also created and determined).\n \n For example, Earth's evolution of humans is more or less a freak-occurrence, since the moon mainly keeps earth's rotation on its axist-- rather than the North Pole ending up on the current equator every few million years (though we DO have \"global warming\" of a few degrees about every 1000 years). \n Therefore without the moon, life could never have evolved on Earth. \n \n But the moon wasn't always there, but is believed to come from the further reaches of space, and have slammed into the Earth and RIGHT THROUGH it (see the \"Big Whack\" theory, as whacky as it sounds). Otherwise, Earth's gravity wouldn't be strong enough to keep it in orbit.\n \n Likewise, factor in the Yucatan meteorite which killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, which was irrefutably essential to human evolution, and the probability of organized planning, rapidly approaches zero-- again, short of an intelligence so advanced, that proof becomes impossible via current means.\n In fact, the very term \"intelligence\" fails in terms of being an epistemological construct, rather than ontological (which likewise fails in terms of being epistemological in itself).\n \n So the notion of \"intelligent design\" yields only the requirement of proving a negative, with no mutually exclusive positives-- i.e. it's a null argument.",

Why do textbooks claim that the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment shows how life's building blocks may have formed on the early Earth - when conditions on the early Earth were probably nothing like those used in the experiment, and the origin of life remains a mystery?\n \n\n N.C.S.E. answer: Because evolutionary theory works with any model of the origin of life on Earth, how life originated is not a question about evolution. Textbooks discuss the 1953 studies because they were the first successful attempt to show how organic molecules might have been produced on the early earth. When modern scientists changed the experimental conditions to reflect better knowledge of the earth's early atmosphere, they were able to produce most of the same building blocks. Origin-of-life remains a vigorous area of research.\n \n\n \n DARWIN'S TREE OF LIFE. Why don't textbooks discuss the \"Cambrian explosion,\" in which all major animal groups appear together in the fossil record fully formed instead of branching from a common ancestor - thus contradicting the evolutionary tree of life?\n \n\n A. Fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals all are post-Cambrian. We would recognize very few of the Cambrian organisms as \"modern\"; they're in fact at the roots of the tree of life, showing the earliest appearances of some key features of groups of animals - but not all features and not all groups. Researchers are linking these Cambrian groups using not only fossils but also data from developmental biology.\n \n \n\n \n HOMOLOGY. Why do textbooks define homology as similarity due to common ancestry, then claim that it is evidence for common ancestry - a circular argument masquerading as scientific evidence?\n \n\n A: The same anatomical structure (such as a leg or an antenna) in two species may be similar because it was inherited from a common ancestor (homology) or because of similar adaptive pressure (convergence) . Homology of structures across species is not assumed, but tested by the repeated comparison of numerous features that do or do not sort into successive clusters. Homology is used to test hypotheses of degrees of relatedness. Homology is not \"evidence\" for common ancestry: common ancestry is inferred based on many sources of information, and reinforced by the patterns of similarity and dissimilarity of anatomical structures.\n \n \n\n \n VERTEBRATE EMBRYOS. Why do textbooks use drawings of similarities in vertebrate embryos as evidence for their common ancestry - even though biologists have known for over a century that vertebrate embryos are not most similar in their early stages, and the drawings are faked?\n \n\n A: Twentieth-century and current embryological research confirms that early stages (if not the earliest) of vertebrate embryos are more similar than later ones; the more recently species shared a common ancestor, the more similar their embryological development. Thus cows and rabbits - mammals - are more similar in their embryological development than either is to alligators. Cows and antelopes are more similar in their embryology than either is to rabbits, and so on. The union of evolution and developmental biology - \"evo-devo\" - is one of the most rapidly growing biological fields. \"Faked\" drawings are not relied upon: there has been plenty of research in developmental biology since Haeckel (long-discredited drawings that were used in textbooks 20 years ago) and in fact, hardly any textbooks feature Haeckel's drawings, as claimed.\n \n \n\n \n ARCHAEOPTERYX. Why do textbooks portray this fossil as the missing link between dinosaurs and modern birds - even though modern birds are probably not descended from it, and its supposed ancestors do not appear until millions of years after it?\n \n\n \n after it?\n \n A: The notion of a \"missing link\" is an out-of-date misconception about how evolution works. Archaeopteryx (and other feathered fossils) shows how a branch of reptiles gradually acquired both the unique anatomy and flying adaptations found in all modern birds. It is a transitional fossil. These fossils are not direct ancestors of modern birds but relatives, and, as everyone knows, your uncle can be younger than you! \n \n \n\n PEPPERED MOTHS. Why do textbooks use pictures of peppered moths camouflaged on tree trunks as evidence for natural selection - when biologists have known since the 1980s that the moths don't normally rest on tree trunks, and all the pictures have been staged?\n \n\n A: These pictures are illustrations used to demonstrate a point - the advantage of protective coloration to reduce the danger of predation. The pictures are not the scientific evidence used to prove the point in the first place. Compare this illustration to the well-known re-enactments of the Battle of Gettysburg. Does the fact that these re-enactments are staged prove that the battle never happened? The peppered moth photos are the same sort of illustration, not scientific evidence for natural selection.\n \n \n\n DARWIN'S FINCHES. Why do textbooks claim that beak changes in Galapagos finches during a severe drought can explain the origin of species by natural selection - even though the changes were reversed after the drought ended, and no net evolution occurred?\n \n\n A: Textbooks present the finch data to illustrate natural selection: that populations change their physical features in response to changes in the environment. The finch studies exquisitely documented how the physical features of an organism can affect its success in reproduction and survival, and that such changes can take place more quickly than was realized. That new species did not arise within the duration of the study hardly challenges evolution!\n \n \n\n MUTANT FRUIT FLIES. Why do textbooks use fruit flies with an extra pair of wings as evidence that DNA mutations can supply raw materials for evolution - even though the extra wings have no muscles and these disabled mutants cannot survive outside the laboratory?\n \n\n A: In the very few textbooks that discuss four-winged fruit flies, they are used as an illustration of how genes can reprogram parts of the body to produce novel structures, thus indeed providing \"raw material\" for evolution. This type of mutation produces new structures that become available for further experimentation and potential new uses. Even if not every mutation leads to a new evolutionary pathway, the flies are a vivid example of one way mutation can provide variation for natural selection to work on.\n \n \n\n HUMAN ORIGINS. Why are artists' drawings of ape-like humans used to justify materialistic claims that we are just animals and our existence is a mere accident - when fossil experts cannot even agree on who our supposed ancestors were or what they looked like?\n \n\n A: Drawings of humans and our ancestors illustrate the general outline of human ancestry, about which there is considerable agreement, even if new discoveries continually add to the complexity of the account. The notion that such drawings are used to \"justify materialistic claims\" is not borne out by an examination of textbook treatments of human evolution.\n \n \n\n EVOLUTION A FACT? Why are we told that Darwin's theory of evolution is a scientific fact - even though many of its claims are based on misrepresentations of the facts?\n\n A: In the last century, some of what Darwin originally proposed has been augmented by more modern scientific understanding of inheritance (genetics), development, and other processes that affect evolution. What remains unchanged is that similarities and differences among living things on Earth over time and space display a pattern that is best explained by evolutionary theory.",

Homology is not &#8220;evidence&#8221; for common ancestry: common ancestry is inferred based on many sources of information, and reinforced by the patterns of similarity and dissimilarity of anatomical structures.\n \n \n A: Twentieth-century and current embryological research confirms that early stages (if not the earliest) of vertebrate embryos are more similar than later ones; the more recently species shared a common ancestor, the more similar their embryological development. Thus cows and rabbits - mammals - are more similar in their embryological development than either is to alligators. Cows and antelopes are more similar in their embryology than either is to rabbits, and so on. The union of evolution and developmental biology &#8212; &#8220;evo-devo&#8221; &#8212; is one of the most rapidly growing biological fields. &#8220;Faked&#8221; drawings are not relied upon: there has been plenty of research in developmental biology since Haeckel (long-discredited drawings that were used in textbooks 20 years ago) and in fact, hardly any textbooks feature Haeckel&#8217;s drawings, as claimed.\n \n \n \n after it?\n \n A: The notion of a &#8220;missing link&#8221; is an out-of-date misconception about how evolution works. Archaeopteryx (and other feathered fossils) shows how a branch of reptiles gradually acquired both the unique anatomy and flying adaptations found in all modern birds. It is a transitional fossil. These fossils are not direct ancestors of modern birds but relatives, and, as everyone knows, your uncle can be younger than you! \n \n \n A: These pictures are illustrations used to demonstrate a point - the advantage of protective coloration to reduce the danger of predation. The pictures are not the scientific evidence used to prove the point in the first place. Compare this illustration to the well-known re-enactments of the Battle of Gettysburg. Does the fact that these re-enactments are staged prove that the battle never happened? The peppered moth photos are the same sort of illustration, not scientific evidence for natural selection.\n \n \n A: Textbooks present the finch data to illustrate natural selection: that populations change their physical features in response to changes in the environment. The finch studies exquisitely documented how the physical features of an organism can affect its success in reproduction and survival, and that such changes can take place more quickly than was realized. That new species did not arise within the duration of the study hardly challenges evolution!\n \n \n A: In the very few textbooks that discuss four-winged fruit flies, they are used as an illustration of how genes can reprogram parts of the body to produce novel structures, thus indeed providing &#8220;raw material&#8221; for evolution. This type of mutation produces new structures that become available for further experimentation and potential new uses. Even if not every mutation leads to a new evolutionary pathway, the flies are a vivid example of one way mutation can provide variation for natural selection to work on.\n \n \n A: Drawings of humans and our ancestors illustrate the general outline of human ancestry, about which there is considerable agreement, even if new discoveries continually add to the complexity of the account. The notion that such drawings are used to &#8220;justify materialistic claims&#8221; is not borne out by an examination of textbook treatments of human evolution.\n \n \n A: In the last century, some of what Darwin originally proposed has been augmented by more modern scientific understanding of inheritance (genetics), development, and other processes that affect evolution. What remains unchanged is that similarities and differences among living things on Earth over time and space display a pattern that is best explained by evolutionary theory.\n\n \n Nice cut and paste. But it isn't evidence of anything, but only opinions. And you're not even honest since you plagiarized the info without giving credit to the source. http://www.thewilsonshouse.com/science/presentations/Answers_to_the_Ten_Questions_of_Evolution.ppt\n \n But regarding the so called evolution of finches, in order to accept your explanation, it must take place far too rapidly, in fact from generation to generation which flies directly in the face of what evolution claims is the process which evolution takes. You seem to think you can change the definition to suit whatever type of changes that occur in different animals. Rapid adaptation is not evolution, but it happens in animals when environmental pressures threaten the species. \n \n Yet with millions of generations of fruit flies in labs, no evolution has occurred either. No matter how you slice it, the only so called evidence for evolution is based in interpreting fossils who's ages cannot truly be verified based on existing scientific dating methods, nor can the fossils prove anything absolute since the findings are all based on interpreting what is ultimately unprovable assumptions. \n It appears the definitions used for evolution have undergone more mutations than the theory as a whole. Even the Columbus Dispatch and our proposed new Ohio Science Standards report the definition of evolution is \"a change in gene frequency in a population over time\". Evolutionists justify this by asserting a definition can be altered as more information is acquired about the theory. However, the definition is now too general and surreptitiously conceals fundamental flaws in the theory itself. Furthermore, the delineation incorporates observations unrelated to the concepts of Darwinian evolution and effectively results in a classic \"bait and switch\".\n \n A more appropriate definition for evolution is, a continuous naturalistic, mechanistic process by which all living things have arisen from a single living source which itself arose by a similar process from a non-living, inanimate world. This definition requires evolutionists to justify their claims of simplicity to complexity, life from nonlife, and common ancestry.\n \n The other definition seeks to include observed adaptations within species without a corresponding increase in genetic information. For an evolutionist to accomplish this, he must scientifically describe and observe the mechanism by which genetic information is increased via mutation. Since this has never been observed, and there is no viable mechanism, evolution is nothing more than philosophical ramblings. Biophysicist, Dr. Lee Spetner stated, \"The neo-Darwinians would like us to believe that large evolutionary changes can result from a series of small events if there are enough of them. But if these events all lose information they can&#8217;t be the steps in the kind of evolution the neo-Darwin theory is supposed to explain, no matter how many mutations there are. Whoever thinks macroevolution can be made by mutations that lose information is like the merchant who lost a little money on every sale but thought he could make it up on volume.4\n \n Reporting finch adaptation as evidence for evolution is not unique. Finch evolution gained momentum when the research team of Peter and Rosemary Grant went to the Galapagos Islands in 1973. While observing the wide diversity of finches, they discovered that during an ordinary drought, the average beak length of some birds slightly increased. This preliminary data was then extrapolated to conclude after a certain number of droughts; a new species of finch could be created with a longer beak5. What they did not realize at the time, was during rainy seasons the beaks did not stay the same, they returned to normal. This type of intrinsic oscillation is an eloquent illustration of natural selection via adaptation but not evolution.\n \n The subject papers presented in Science magazine are excellent research examples demonstrating rapid adaptations within a species of bird. However, these adaptations utilize information previously existing in the genetic code of these creatures. The fact remains, they are still finches and they are still birds.Rapid Adaptation of Finches not Evidence For Evolution - by Patrick H. Young, Ph.D.",

Could someone please provide the accession number and database of the PR.C sequence from Ohno (1984) [xii].? Was the classic esterase with beta-lactamase folds there from the start?\n Ohno (1984) suggested that the coding sequence \"originally\" specified a 472-residue-long arginine-rich protein. However this \"472-residue-long arginine-rich protein\" has no significant homology to any known functional protein.\n \n EI and EIII did not arise through a frame-shift mutation. EI has a high homology with amidases present in a lot of strains of bacteria, meaning a pre-existing enzyme was capable of breaking the amide bond of cyclic dimers. EII has a high homology with L-aminopeptidase/D-esterases present in many other bacteria.\n \n The evidence points to (and seems like the simplest explanation - Occam's razor) a pre-existing classical carboxylesterase with B-lactamase folds (NylB'/EII') with low activity (0.5% that of EII (nylB) towards nylon oligomers, gained an increase in activity towards the the oligomers through amino acid substitutions in the catalytic cleft containing the &#8220;Ser-X-X-Lys&#8221; motive without affecting the activity towards its original substrates.

   "hhehehe. Something tells me you didn't read carefully. All that site does is argue that it wasn't a frameshift mutation that caused it. It does state however: \n \n \nThe important mutations that increased EII' specificity towards Ald are G181D, D370Y and H266N, and they are situated within the Ald catalytic centre [viii]. The G181D mutation is most likely due to a G:C-<A:T transition as a result of cytosine deamination and subsequent mismatch repair by the uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) enzyme. The D370Y mutation is most likely the result of a G:C-<T:A transversion and the H266N mutation due to a C:G-<A:T transversion. It is known that during replication, certain polymerases are more error prone than others in creating transition and/or transversions. It will therefore be interesting to test whether the stringent response (triggered by nutrient downshifts) has any effect on cytosine deamination, UDG enzyme activity and polymerase III and/or IV activity (mutA cells have a higher proportion of transversions [x]). Gene expression analysis with microarrays with simultaneous sequencing of Arthrobacter sp. KI72 during various time intervals will be illuminating and would make it possible to determine whether the stringent response (and other stress responses) has any effect on the specificity of mutations. LexA, SpoT and recA activity and their downstream effect on specific polymerase activity will also be interesting.\n",

What remains obvious is that evolutionists will claim any change that occurs in Nature as evidence of their theory, even if it conflicts directly with their stated theory.\n \n Now, I know you will produce some pro-evolution link that will attempt to tie the two processes together as evolutionary processes, but I remember debating this very issue before evolutionists even accepted rapid adaptation as having actually occurred. Once they could no longer deny the reality of it occurring throughout the animal kingdom, they now attempt to explain it away as one type of evolutionary process. The only consistent fact that exists regarding evolution is its inconsistency and it's ability to rationalize any process which conflicts with what the theory of gradual evolution has always represented itself to be.

There. Now that we cleared that up, on to the following point. If selective pressure is high enough, rapid change will occur. In this case, the pressure was very high, and thus, the change very rapid, perfectly logical, perfectly in line with current evolutionary theory.

Here's just one example of the content which it argues:\n Let's Look at the Evidence:\n The following are 18 Evidences of either massive flooding and erosion, extremely rapid layering of strata, or direct evidence of a Worldwide Flood. Such evidences are found in numerous places on virtually every Continent. \n \n Polystrate Fossils: \n One of the strongest pieces of evidence for a worldwide flood is the existence of what Rupke termed \"polystrate fossils.\" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 \n \n Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The \"Fossil Forests\" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 \n \n Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. \n \n Similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada.\n \n And although there is much data on buried trees in the geological literature, most of it is over 100 years old, and difficult to access. One of the few articles on this subject was by Rupke, and in it he comments that:\n \n &#8220;Personally, I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan&#8217; in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position.\" 12\n \n With regard to Rupke's observation, I suspect the reason why such is (still) the case has more to do with one's personal bias against the concept of a Creator / God to whom we might very well have to give account than to the ever-mounting evidence against the theory of evolution and the millions of years old Earth that it requires (to appear plausible). However, T-I-M-E is simply not enough: not even BILLIONS of years of it.\n \n See also The Organic Levels of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest 13 and The Yellowstone Petrified \"Forests\" 14 by Harold Coffin.Scientific Evidence for a Worldwide Flood \n \n How do you explain\"polystrate fossils.\" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. \n \n Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 , And that similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada.\n \n There are 17 other scientific facts revealed which evolutionists either avoid asking the obvious questions about, or just flat out ignore. Examples like this: A \"Whale\" of a Fossil: Or should we say \"a fossil of a whale? It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. \n \n \"They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found. Each discovery is turned over to Lawrence G. Barnes at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The Whale, however, is one of the largest fossils ever collected anywhere... (It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet.\n \"The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47\n \n So it begs the question child as to how hydrology doesn't support a young Earth or the great flood when it is only by way of a rapid sedimentary build up which buries large trees and even 80 foot long Whales upright can be explained in hydrological terms in so many diverse places which only the great flood accounts for? And please, offer evidence to refute this information, not just insults of my intelligence or your personal opinion. If you want to have a serious debate about this, then deal with facts rather than personal attacks.",

   "Can you refute these scientific evidences for the flood without attacking the author or the source, but based simply on the science?\n\n Yep:\n \nthey were not a problem to explain in the 19th century, and are still not a problem now. John William Dawson (1868) described a classic Carboniferous-age locality at Joggins, Nova Scotia, where there are upright giant lycopod trees up to a few metres tall preserved mainly in river-deposited sandstones. These trees have extensive root systems with rootlets that penetrate into the underlying sediment, which is either a coal seam (i.e. compressed plant material), or an intensely-rooted sandstone or mudstone (i.e. a soil horizon). Dawson considered and rejected anything but an in situ formation for these fossils, and his interpretation is closely similar to current interpretations of sediments deposited on river floodplains.\n\n Just to be clear, the YEC model of flood deposition depends upon the trees not being rooted in place, especially where there are well over a dozen soil horizons layered atop one another, as there are in the Nova Scotia case. Which 'flood-based' scenario do you prefer: that each layer of trees somehow managed to grow to maturity in a few hours, deep underwater, while being buried by more sediment? Or that the flood managed to scoop up and pile the layers atop one another without disturbing them in the slightest?\n \n Or you can go with the conventional explanation, which is that occasional flooding swamped each layer of trees with sediment, with time between for a new layer to grow to maturity atop the buried remains of the old. What do you say?\n \n The anomalous example in Yellowstone, where the tree fossils aren't rooted, is easily explained: violent vulcanism and landslides deposited the sediment rather than flood deposition (you can tell that because of the composition of the deposited material). However:\n \nmost \"fossil forests\" do not occur in volcanic deposits, and do have the fragile roots of the stumps tightly penetrating into the surrounding sediment, often into a paleosol (fossil soil) [besides Joggins, see also 3]. One occurrence is even associated with dinosaur footprints on the same surface, on top of a coal seam [4, 5, 6]. The \"transported floating upright stumps\" model [2] is a complete red herring that does not apply to the vast majority of \"fossil forest\" occurrences.\n\n How is that supposed to have happened in the flood model? A dinosaur's footprint, hardening beside a tree that supposedly grew to full size in a few hours under thousands of feet of sludgy water (and yes, it would have to be thousands upon thousands of feet of water for it to hold enough material to deposit the formation).\n \n Oh, and yep:\n \nHad anybody taken the time and trouble to check the facts, they would have found that the story by Russel (1976) took some liberty with the facts and lacked very important information. First, the skeleton was not found in a vertical position, but was lying at an angle 50 to 40 degrees from horizontal. Finally, although at this angle, the whale skeleton lay parallel to the bedding of strata which at one time was the sea floor on which the dead whale fell after its death. These facts were confirmed by inquiring with the people at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History who excavated the whale.\n\n Just to be perfectly clear: the whale was not a polystrate fossil. End of story.\n \n I've tackled your source head on - do you think you could find it within yourself to throw me a bone and say \"Ok, so I was wrong?\" :)",

There. Now that we cleared that up, on to the following point. If selective pressure is high enough, rapid change will occur. In this case, the pressure was very high, and thus, the change very rapid, perfectly logical, perfectly in line with current evolutionary theory.

All you have done is posted more T.O. excuses in order to explain away solid evidence they can't refute with equally scientific facts. They actually think that claiming the whale was at a 40 to 50 degree angle rather than directly upright is evidence that the evidence is irrelevant while ignoring the evidence to the contrary. \n \n Your link ignored the fact that trees that were buried upright, without roots, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds defy the principle of gradual stratification. And you are ignoring that similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. And this is only where we have discovered such evidence. One event might be coincidental or a random occurrence, but to have taken place over such a wide range supports a planetary deluge of monumental proportions.\n \n And what about the other 16 points my link refers to? Must I quote each section directly before you'll consider it? The point is that all of the scientific questions it raises and asks leads to an accurate picture of this event occurring. For example,\n Turbidity Currents: \n A turbidity current is an underwater mud flow, the discovery of which caused somewhat of a revolution in geology. As a result, many sedimentary strata layers throughout the world have been reevaluated and found to be turbidites. 34,35,36,37,38,39,40\n \n For example, regarding turbidites and the impact they are having on modern Geology, Kurt Howard, 41 said the following in his paper on this topic: \n \n My physical geology professor said, \"Regarding uniformitarianism, you can take it with a grain of salt.\" After reviewing geology texts on the subject of turbidites, I am following the courageous professor's advice. To paraphrase his words, I am taking uniformitarianism with a grain of sand, for the philosophy of uniformitarianism states that sedimentary layers form over many millions of years, while ... recent research has shown that turbidites form within a few hours. {1} Emphasis Added\n \n In 1972 Burgert identified several lower basal Tapeats units as turbidites in Grand Canyon's Cheops Bay. Dr. Ariel Roth a geologist at Loma Linda University's Geoscience Institute, suggested that 30% of all sedimentary rocks in Grand Canyon are turbidites. Some geologists suggest that 50% of the world's sedimentary rocks might be turbidites. Emphasis Added\n \n Modern geologists discarded the terms flysch sediments and geosyncline because rapidly formed megathick flysch is incompatible with uniformitarianism and long ages. However, in the last few years, the number of geologists abandoning the classical uniformitarian discipline and adopting the new catastrophism is almost a shock to ... creationists. Geologists are finally beginning to grudgingly agree with ... creationists about the nature of the stratigraphic record, which is a record of major catastrophic events and not the slow year-by-year buildup suggested by uniformitarianism. Flysch deposits might be the sedimentary results of a global flood. The idea of geosynclines is unpopular because most geologists believe in plate tectonics. Emphasis Added\n \n Extensive Strata and Pancake Layering: \n As we observe sedimentary strata throughout the world we see almost everywhere flat-lying (or \"pancake\") layered strata. Many of these layers are so extensive that they cover several states. Evolutionists believe that such layers were deposited slowly over millions and millions of years, or that they are simply \"river\" deposits or river deltas. 42,43 Creationists, and a growing number of geologists see problems with such interpretations. 44,45 First because there is virtually no evidence of erosion between the layers, and second, because the sheer size and extent of the strata suggests that the layers were neither formed by rivers, or river deltas. That's because many of the \"layers\" are quite thick, and cover (literally) hundreds and even thousands of square miles, and in many instances are the size of the state of Utah, or even larger.\n \n This, coupled with the presence of marine fossils that are buried in many of the layers, tells us that they were deposited by ocean currents (i.e. from a major, major Flood), like nothing we have ever seen before.\n \n We can say for certain that it was the ocean (as opposed to a lake) because of the marine fossils that are buried in much of this strata. For example, in the Grand Canyon area itself, old Earth geologists have said that the Ocean swept over the whole area on six different occasions. Young Earth geologists say it was probably only once.\n What is shown very clearly from all of these scientific interpretation of the same evidence is that there are two ways to interpret it. But for you evos to claim victory based on your interpretation which is as biased as ours is, is the epitome of arrogance. We may have to agree to disagree peeling, but don't you dare just assume you're right and the debate is over because you have proven nothing absolutely.",

   "Can you refute these scientific evidences for the flood without attacking the author or the source, but based simply on the science? Here's just one example of the content which it argues:\n Let's Look at the Evidence:\n The following are 18 Evidences of either massive flooding and erosion, extremely rapid layering of strata, or direct evidence of a Worldwide Flood. Such evidences are found in numerous places on virtually every Continent. \n \n Polystrate Fossils: \n One of the strongest pieces of evidence for a worldwide flood is the existence of what Rupke termed \"polystrate fossils.\" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 \n \n Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The \"Fossil Forests\" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 \n \n Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. \n \n Similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada.\n \n And although there is much data on buried trees in the geological literature, most of it is over 100 years old, and difficult to access. One of the few articles on this subject was by Rupke, and in it he comments that:\n \n \"Personally, I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan' in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position.\" 12\n \n With regard to Rupke's observation, I suspect the reason why such is (still) the case has more to do with one's personal bias against the concept of a Creator / God to whom we might very well have to give account than to the ever-mounting evidence against the theory of evolution and the millions of years old Earth that it requires (to appear plausible). However, T-I-M-E is simply not enough: not even BILLIONS of years of it.\n \n See also The Organic Levels of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest 13 and The Yellowstone Petrified \"Forests\" 14 by Harold Coffin.Scientific Evidence for a Worldwide Flood \n \n How do you explain\"polystrate fossils.\" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. \n \n Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 , And that similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada.\n \n There are 17 other scientific facts revealed which evolutionists either avoid asking the obvious questions about, or just flat out ignore. Examples like this: A \"Whale\" of a Fossil: Or should we say \"a fossil of a whale? It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. \n \n \"They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found. Each discovery is turned over to Lawrence G. Barnes at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The Whale, however, is one of the largest fossils ever collected anywhere... (It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet.\n \"The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47\n \n So it begs the question child as to how hydrology doesn't support a young Earth or the great flood when it is only by way of a rapid sedimentary build up which buries large trees and even 80 foot long Whales upright can be explained in hydrological terms in so many diverse places which only the great flood accounts for? And please, offer evidence to refute this information, not just insults of my intelligence or your personal opinion. If you want to have a serious debate about this, then deal with facts rather than personal attacks.\n\n PRATT. I'd give links to the refutations but Larni alreay beat me to the good links",

   "\"The Biblical flood did not happen. This is a falsifiable date.The Bible gives the date of the flood as beginning 2345 BCE and ending in 2344 BCE If this were really the world-wide gig claimed by creationists then the civilizations of the world would all show a disruption in their history or at least take note of such an event, but does the rest of archeology/history corroborate the Biblical account===< NO!\n \n 1. The city of Ur of the Chaldees (ancient Sumer, location of the \"plains of Shinar\", hangout of Noah) was the leading city from about 2400 BCE until about 2,285 BCE and its history is not broken by any flood in this period.\n 2. Babylon was rising to power from about 2,400 BCE on and reached a great height of civilization under the famous King Hammurabi, who would have been a contempory of Hebrew patriarch Abraham (about 2,250 BCE), and again there is no break in this history due to a flood.\n 3. In Egypt, the 5th Dynasty, which began to reign about 2,465 BCE, was followed by the 6th Dynasty (2,323 BCE), which ruled to about 2000 BCE. This time-period is very well-documented and there was no disruption during the 5th Dynasty at the time of Noah's flood, 2,345 BCE, with the nation remaining strong and powerful throughout these dynasties.\n 4. The Harappan Civilization(2300 - 1900 BCE) in India shows no disruptions at the time of the Flood and, ironically, appears to have ended because of a region-wide drought! (some used to think that an invasion was the cause, but the evidence points away from this earlier scenario).\n 5. Chinese history begins nearly 3,000 BCE. The Shu-King historic record of China, shows that King Yao came to the throne in 2356 BCE and ruled China for many years after the alleged flood. Incidentally, durring the reign of Yao, the Shu King reports that the Hwang Ho River flooded on a number of times, for three generations, again with NO break in history. Please consult the History of China or THIS timeline. The only place you find these early rulers listed are at Chinese sites (spelled Tangyao, Westerners shorten this to Yao).\n 6. Ancient civilizations in India which predate the Bible entirely and shows no evidence that such an event ever happened ( appearance of the oldest book of the Hindu religion, the Rig Veda pre-dates the Bible considerably, according to astronomical dating provided by astronomical events listed in the Rig Veda)\"\n Did Noah's Flood Happen? :: Deus Diapente",

   "Not at all. All you have done is posted more T.O. excuses in order to explain away solid evidence they can't refute with equally scientific facts. They actually think that claiming the whale was at a 40 to 50 degree angle rather than directly upright is evidence that the evidence is irrelevant while ignoring the evidence to the contrary. \n\n AA, please, read what was posted. The significant fact is not the angle of the whale, but the fact that it was parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it was buried. By definition it was not a polystrate fossil. Polystrate = many strata. This fossil = single strata.\n \n So, how about that 'I was wrong' now? \n \nYour link ignored the fact that trees that were buried upright, without roots, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds defy the principle of gradual stratification.\n\n And you're continuing to ignore the fact that geologists know not all stratification is gradual :)\n \n By the way, the claim that these trees 'traverse' coal beds is highly misleading. The ones that 'traverse' coal beds are those with roots, and only 'traverse' the bed because they are rooted in it!\n \n Let's be perfectly clear about this: the unrooted examples present no problem at all to conventional geology, while the rooted examples are fatal to the flood model. Particularly examples like this:\n \nGeologists have also found that some of the larger polystrate trees found within Carboniferous coal-bearing strata show evidence of regeneration after being partially buried by sediments. In the case of these polystrate trees, they were clearly alive when partially buried by sediments. Because of their size, the sediment, which accumulated around them, was insufficient to kill the trees. As a result, they developed a new set of roots from their trunks just below the new ground surface and grew higher to compensate for the part of the trunk buried by sediment.[4] Until they either died or were overwhelmed by the accumulating sediments, these polystrate would likely continue to regenerate by adding height and new roots with each increment of sediment, eventually leaving several of meters of former \"trunk\" buried underground as sediments accumulated.\n\n How is that supposed to happen? If the whole tree was buried in one go under thousands of feet of sediment, how is it supposed to carry on growing?\n \nAnd you are ignoring that similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. \n\n I'm not ignoring it. The vast majority of fossil forests are rooted, and they invariably found in locations known to be susceptible to rapid deposition: floodplains, areas of excessive vulcanism and so forth. And once again, your source is clearly and deliberately misleading you:\n \nContrary to the claims of creationists, these sedimentary basins are considerably smaller than the state of Texas. The specific layers, which contain polystrate fossils, occupy only a very, very limited fraction of the total area of any of these basins.\n\n Do you understand what they're doing? This is equivalent to saying that there is a Wal-Mart covering an area the size of the United States. \n \nAnd what about the other 16 points my link refers to? Must I quote each section directly before you'll consider it?\n\n I'm happy to go through them all, if you like, but I think it better to clear the first couple up before moving on, otherwise we're just going to get lost and confused. I'm not boring you, am I? :)\n \n To recap: \n The Whale\n \n Purely and simply, this was not a polystrate fossil, by definition. It lay parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it was found - a layer which was itself folded and distorted by geological movement, hence the 40-50 degree angle.\n \n The trees.\n \n Conventional geology satisfactorily explains all the phenomena we've discussed, and has done for a hundred years. Rapid deposition is an established feature of geology and can be traced to proximate causes: periodic flooding, vulcanism, landslips etc.\n \n Fatal problems for the flood model:\n \n These are observed facts, not interpretations, for which the flood model simply cannot account.\n \n 1. Stacked layers which include rooted trees.\n \n While it's perhaps conceivable that the flood model could accommodate a rooted tree in the lowest soil layer of a formation, it's not conceivable that a flood could deposit and stack atop one another a dozen or more continuous soil layers, each containing rooted trees, and separated by layers of limestone or other materials.\n \n Conventional explanation: Trees grew, were partially and eventually completely covered by layers of rapid and/or gradual sedimentation, and then more trees grew on top. This process repeated over a substantial period of time to produce the observed effect.\n \n 2. Fossilised footprints, deep underground, beside rooted tree fossils.\n \n What on earth is the story here? How can a dinosaur leave a footprint halfway down a thousand-yard column of precipitating sediment?\n \n Conventional explanation: As above. Because the layers were not all depositied in one giant lump, there was ample time for the dinosaur to walk across the surface and leave footprints, which were subsequently covered by later stratification.\n \n 3. Trees continuing to grow after being partially buried.\n \n What more needs to be said? How can a tree, buried a kilometre or more beneath a billion tons of mud over the space of a few weeks, put out decades of extra growth?\n \n Conventional explanation: As above. Large trees survived periodic inundations with sediment and thrust out new roots into the new ground layers, continuing to grow.\n \n Further reading: One of the original papers on the subject.\n \n As I said, I'm happy to go through the rest of the page with you if you like, but what I'd like to hear first is either a flood-based explanation for the phenomena above, or an honest admission that you can neither conceive of one nor find one on the internet.

It's only your pro-evolution source which states that and I have no reason to believe your version over my own.\n\n Ah, but your source doesn't actually make many contradictory factual statements. It merely fails to mention data fatal to the flood model. Does it say anything at all about the layer upon layer of rooted tree fossils? No. Does it say anything about the evidence of post-deposition tree growth? No. Does it say anything about the whale actually crossing several strata? No - it just says the fossil was 'vertical', and lets you assume from that statement that it crossed horizontal strata. Go back and read it again - I'm right, aren't I? Now look at what it says about the proportion of rooted and unrooted fossils - 1 in 50 rooted, yes? And it says that some were up to 10, 20, even 40 feet long, yes? What it doesn't tell you is that it was the long ones that were rooted.\n \n Factually speaking, then, your source doesn't significantly contradict mine - it's merely less complete. So we are still not obliged to agree to disagree. You can take on board the extra facts and see if your source's conclusions still make sense.\n \nOf course I agree with that. The problem is that it's your link that states that growth of now fossilized trees continued while they were partially buried in sediment. My question is, how do they prove that, or observe that from fossils?\n\n It's very straightforward:\n \nIn the case of these polystrate trees, they were clearly alive when partially buried by sediments. Because of their size, the sediment, which accumulated around them, was insufficient to kill the trees. As a result, they developed a new set of roots from their trunks just below the new ground surface and grew higher to compensate for the part of the trunk buried by sediment.\n\n Another directly observable fact: the partly-buried trees had grown new root systems from their trunks into the newly deposited surface material - which was a distinctly seperate geological layer from that in which their original root systems had formed.\n \nAgain Peeling, you are picking and choosing the evidence you will accept. It was shown that both rooted and un-rooted trees were standing vertical through multiple layers of strata when we both know that if it took the millions of years for strata to form through sedimentary deposits, even an upright tree would never be found in more than one layer as it would have long since rotted away through exposure above the sediment line. You're ignoring these contradictions which directly conflict with the process of stratification,\n\n I'm really, really not ignoring anything :) As I said before, there are several well-known geological processes that result in rapid stratification - heck, one of them is flooding! Please stop saying geologists think it took millions of years to bury these trees; it isn't true:\n \nIn a few years after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, the erosion of loose pyroclastic deposits covering its slopes created a series of volcanic lahars, which ultimately buried large parts of the countryside along major streams draining these slopes beneath several meters of volcanic sediments. The repeated deposition of sediments by volcanic lahars and sediment filled rivers not only created innumerable polystrate trees, but also &#8220;polystrate&#8221; telephone poles, churches, and houses, over a period a few years.[8] The volcanic deposits enclosing these modern polystrate trees are often virtually identical in their sedimentary structures, external and internal layering, texture, buried soils, and other general character to the volcanic deposits containing the Yellowstone buried forests. As in case of modern forests buried by lahars, the individual buried forests of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest and the layers containing them are very limited in their areal extent\n\n Nor am I picking and choosing the evidence I'll accept. As I stated clearly earlier, both the rooted and unrooted trees fit perfectly well within the conventional geological models. It is your creationist source which is cherry-picking the unrooted examples while ignoring the rooted examples that are fatal to their model.\n \nAs it's perfectly ok for you to just agree regarding the innumerable inconsistencies and unprovable assumptions made by evolutionists. I don't know why you always expect me to convert you your way of thinking rather than you seriously considering the inconsistencies your pseudo science promotes. It's not as if I'm trying to get you to accept jesus here; I'm just trying to get you to objectively judge what is being promoted as facts when they aren't facts at all.\n\n But that's just it: here we are talking about facts. Facts that fit one theory and not another. It's a fact that trees can't grow under a kilometre of mud. It's a fact these rooted fossil trees did carry on growing, long after the deposition of the first layer of sedimentation. It's a fact that there are in some places over a dozen such fossil layers stacked atop one another with thick intervening layers of other minerals. These facts do not fit a theory involving a single, short-lived flood. They just don't.\n \n Forget the conventional geological model. Pretend it doesn't exist. Does that help you explain these observations in terms of a flood? No! It's still completely impossible for a flood lasting a few weeks to have created these formations. \n \n I understand you're not trying to get me to accept Jesus here. I'm not trying to get you to abandon Jesus, or even accept the conventional geological model for that matter. What I'm trying to get you to do is assess the flood model in light of the facts. Does it make the least bit of sense? Or is it just that admitting it doesn't make sense feels like the thin end of the wedge?",

   "[QUOTE=Peeling;335470]Ah, but your source doesn't actually make many contradictory factual statements. It merely fails to mention data fatal to the flood model. Does it say anything at all about the layer upon layer of rooted tree fossils? No.Yes it does! \"polystrate fossils.\" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 \n \n Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The \"Fossil Forests\" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 \n \n Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. \n Does it say anything about the evidence of post-deposition tree growth? No. Does it say anything about the whale actually crossing several strata? No -Again, irrelevant issue where a whale found thousands of miles from an Ocean is concerned, and when it is standing upright in diatomite. And here's more: Chapter 19 Appendix Part 2\n Living and fossil marine life has been found far inland in continental areas. The book, Anomalies in Geology: Physical, Chemical, Biological, by *W.R.

   "Ah, but your source doesn't actually make many contradictory factual statements. It merely fails to mention data fatal to the flood model. Does it say anything at all about the layer upon layer of rooted tree fossils? No.\nYes it does! \"polystrate fossils.\" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 \n \n Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached.

I marvel at how evolutionists can be digging up sea creatures, both freshwater and Ocean types, side by side with both large and small mammals, reptiles and amphibians and never beg the question as to how this occurred. To any rational person it would appear to be a mass extinction. But evos interpret it as they all died at their leisure over hundreds of millions of years. \n \n And yet, these same alleged scientists know full well that if anyone lays any type of dead body out in the wild, and comes back in only 7 days, it will be consumed, ravaged and its bones will be spread far and wide by the predators which ate what they wanted and then dropped what remained where they were. So it goes without saying that something big happened at once and it indiscriminately buried massive amounts of biological and organic life instantly or else they would have just ended up like any other carcass which dies out in the open and we would have even less fossil evidence than is currently available to fossil hunters.",

   "[INDENT][B][COLOR=&quot;Blue&quot;]Yes it does! \n \n Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached.\n\n Ah, my mistake. So it does admit that there are layers of fossil trees with roots and rootlets attached. Which is a bit like a defense attourney saying \"Yes, but only about 1/50th of the DNA taken from the scene belonged to my client\" :)\n \n Over a dozen layers of fossil trees, rooted in different layers of soil, cannot have been laid down by a single, short-lived flood. Do you agree? \n \nAgain, irrelevant issue where a whale found thousands of miles from an Ocean is concerned, and when it is standing upright in diatomite.\n\n I beg your pardon? The fact that the fossil isn't polystrate isn't relevant to the creationist suggestion that it is?\n \n Fact: The whale was lying parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it was found. It was not polystrate. So why would your creationist source bring it up in a discussion of polystrate fossils if not to mislead you into thinking it was polystrate? \n \nNo; it clearly say's the whale is standing vertical in diatomite. It isn't making vague implications and leaving anything to the imagination. \n\n Oh really? So it makes it explicitly clear that the diatomite layer in which the whale was preserved is also folded at the same 40-50 degree angle, does it? \n \n No, it doesn't. It lets you assume that the whale is standing vertically in a bed of horizontal strata - be honest, that's what you pictured, isn't it? So their deception worked.\n \nYou always imply that creationists are motivated to be dishonest as if they earn more money by promoting this belief.\n\n I don't recall ever bringing money into it at all, actually. I don't think it's necessary to posit financial gain as a motive for creationists.\n \n(the large fossils were the rooted ones) Again Peeling, you have it exactly backwards. it say's this: \n \n Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The \"Fossil Forests\" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 \n \n Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there.\n\n I know it says that. Now, if you would be so kind, point out to me where that says the large fossil trees weren't the rooted ones?\n \n It doesn't, does it? It just talks about how there are lots of fossil trees, and some of them are really big, and how very few of them have attached roots and rootlets. You've interpreted that to mean very few of the really big ones had attached roots and rootlets, whereas what it actually says is that very few of the fossils in total had them.\n \nI'm glad you brought this up again since you ignored my question in the last post. Prove to me how it is possible to confirm that these petrified and fossilized trees grew after being partly buried so long ago. \n\n Eh??? I didn't ignore your question; that was my answer to your question! Look:\n \nOf course I agree with that. The problem is that it's your link that states that growth of now fossilized trees continued while they were partially buried in sediment. My question is, how do they prove that, or observe that from fossils?\n\n \nIt's very straightforward:\n \n In the case of these polystrate trees, they were clearly alive when partially buried by sediments. Because of their size, the sediment, which accumulated around them, was insufficient to kill the trees. As a result, they developed a new set of roots from their trunks just below the new ground surface and grew higher to compensate for the part of the trunk buried by sediment.\n Another directly observable fact: the partly-buried trees had grown new root systems from their trunks into the newly deposited surface material - which was a distinctly seperate geological layer from that in which their original root systems had formed.\n\n How many more different ways do you want me to answer? :)\n \n We can tell the trees carried on growing because they have new root systems growing out from their trunks into multiple successive geological layers. That could not have happened if the whole tree was buried in one go. Do you agree?\n \nI never said geologists said it took millions of years to bury these trees peeling.\n\n Um, yes you did :) \n \nwe both know that if it took the millions of years for strata to form through sedimentary deposits, even an upright tree would never be found in more than one layer as it would have long since rotted away through exposure above the sediment line. You're ignoring these contradictions which directly conflict with the process of stratification\n\n See?\n \nBut my point is that if the flood occurred in reality, then potentially 2 or 3,000 feet of diverse and unique instant stratification layers with instantly buried organic and biological life, was formed in 40 short days as each new strata settled upon the one below it giving the appearance to belief hungry evolutionists that this ring of evidence represents hundreds of millions of years of evolution.\n\n If the flood occurred in reality in 40 short days, then how did a dozen layers of trees get a chance to grow to maturity, rooted in a dozen clearly distinct different soil layers, putting out more roots from their trunks into the sedimentary layers deposited atop those soil layers, all the way down that kilometre of sediment?\n \nThis explains the randomness of the types of life found in places they normally wouldn't be, and with creatures they wouldn't be caught dead with, if they had a choice that is. I marvel at how evolutionists can be digging up sea creatures, both freshwater and Ocean types, side by side with both large and small mammals, reptiles and amphibians and never beg the question as to how this occurred.\n\n And where is this 'side by side' discovery supposed to have happened? \n \nAnd yet, these same alleged scientists know full well that if anyone lays any type of dead body out in the wild, and comes back in only 7 days, it will be consumed, ravaged and its bones will be spread far and wide by the predators which ate what they wanted and then dropped what remained where they were.\n\n Yes, and? That's why relatively complete fossils are incredibly, incredibly rare: it requires exceptional circumstances. Most of the time all we do find is a skull or a thigh bone or a pelvis or a tooth.",

   "I doubt Peeling enjoys repeating high school science to you either.\n\n \n Your condescension is wasted on me since you're incapable of posting any rational legitimate arguments of your own.\n \n \nYou do understand that the whale was lying on the same angle as the strata it was found in, right? It was not a polystrate fossil-it was parallel with the strata in which it was found. It did not cross strata. Set a book on a table. Now, lift one end of the table forty degrees or so. Is the book now passing through the table? No, just like the whale is not passing through strata.\n\n \n No, I don't understand that at all. I understand that that was what TO, your apologist bible asserted which completely disagreed with my source. And only you could dishonestly imply that a body lying at fifty degree angle is resting in parallel position. Assuming it was at 50 degrees, couldn't an 80 to 90 foot object encompass 2, 3 or more quickly laid strata over a 40 day and night period which this flood occurred in? \n http://www.bats.sg/chroma_files/sharpening_diagram.gif\n \n \nAnd if Peeling was wrong and you do have a flood-based explanation for the rooted fossil trees in Nova Scotia, what is it?\n\n \n Are you actually suggesting that every single tree on Earth would have had to have been uprooted by the flood?

It's not dishonest to say the fossil is lying parallel to the strata in which it was found - you have in fact done EXACTLY what I said your creationist source expected you to do, which is intuitively visualise strata as horizontal bands and assumed that a fossil at a 50 degree angle would have to cross them.\n \nAre you actually suggesting that every single tree on Earth would have had to have been uprooted by the flood? Isn't it reasonable that every possible series of events would occur during such a deluge?\n\n It's not about whether every single tree would have had to be uprooted. It's about the fact that flood apologetics claim all sedimantary rocks were formed by deposition over the course of 40 days.\n \n Now, the facts this model has to explain are as follows: we have discovered a location where over a dozen layers of upright, rooted tree stump fossils are stacked on top of each other, separated by further layers of deposition:\n \n http://img395.imageshack.us/img395/779/treestrataks1.th.gif\n \n The dark layers bear the fossilised hallmarks of soil, including insect burrows and so forth, and there are fossil trees in each layer, with roots and rootlets still in place. Yes, there are also unrooted chunks of fossilized wood preserved in the formation, but the significant ones as far as the flood model is concerned are these rooted examples. How can a single 40 day flood produce this formation?\n \n Also (not shown on the sketch), there is the fact that many of these stumps have root systems emerging from their trunks into the later-deposited layers, proving that they were able to continue growing for some considerable time after that section of the trunk was buried. Again, how can that happen if after 40 days they were under a kilometre of mud?\n \n I repeat: these are facts, not interpretations. It is a fact the whale fossil was not polystrate, and it is a fact that there are layer upon layer of fossilized rooted trees, many with secondary root growth from their trunks, in the Nova Scotia formation. I need make no reference to the conventional geological model to show that the flood model is incompatible with that latter fact.",

This is his way of derailing to avoid being pummeled. But secondly and most interesting is that he will post anything in order to attempt to save face once he's been challenged to support his fallacious claims. \n \n He first accused CBR of assuming I'm an evolutionist because I brought up the flood. CBR rightly challenged him on that and he seemingly corrects himself to show that it was nononsense who actually brought up the flood, so he is the evolutionist according to CBR, in childs mind. But wait! Here is nononsenses post, and as you can see, it mentions hydrology which in the childs mind must mean he's talking about the flood. Is it any wonder it's a waste of time attempting to reason with him? Here's the post child linked to.\n \n \nLaws of Nature work everytime. With \"operational science\" such as the hydrology you mentioned works for the creationist as well as the evolutionist. You are talking about two different things. God created the earth and everything in it, and once it has been set in motion we have been allowed to discover some of the properties and laws of the earth. \n \n Furthermore, great scientists have believed in God and searched the scriptures and they have made advances in science because of these things. \n \n You tell me about your faith, and I will tell you about mine.\n \n \n \n Can any honest, rational and reasonable person claim in any way that nononsense was speaking about Noah's Flood in this post? Of course not. But in the delusional mind of the obvious child, he proved his point by posting that link. To the obvious child, the mere mention of the science of hydrology will be interpreted as an argument in favor of Noah's flood. Go figure, huh? I post this just to clarify that this represent the level of truth which guides this childs debating style and ability to reason.",

It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. \n \n \"They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found. Each discovery is turned over to Lawrence G. Barnes at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The Whale, however, is one of the largest fossils ever collected anywhere... (It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet.\n \n \"The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47 \n\n Would you agree that is the sum total of what your source has to say on the subject?\n \n Ok. Now, I would like you to point out where in the above text it says the fossil was polystrate. \n \n It doesn't, does it? It just describes it as 'vertical' - which is a bit of a stretch, but 50 degrees is indeed more vertical than horizontal. It says nothing about the angle of the sedimentary layer in which the fossil lies. \n \n Perhaps you don't appreciate why that omission is of such vital significance. Here's why:\n \n Sedimentary layers are (more or less) horizontal at the time they are deposited. Any distortion, bending or folding etc occurs afterward. The whale fossil is parallel to the layer in which it is buried, which means that at the time it was buried it was lying horizontal, and was subsequently tilted, along with the diatomite, through geological movement.\n \n The whale fossil was not polystrate, and your source doesn't claim it was. So why is it, do you suppose, you are so utterly convinced that your source disagrees with me?\n \n The answer is very simple: the above text is located almost immediately below a discussion of polystrate trees. The intention is obvious: talk about polystrate trees, then segue on to a 'vertical' whale fossil, highlighting the fact that its angle of burial is what's 'interesting' about it, and your readers won't notice the fact that you've stopped explicitly claiming the fossil was polystrate. Instead, they'll do exactly what you did, AA: you imagined that sedimentary layers are always horizontal and that a 'vertical' whale fossil would have to cross them. Here you are, in subsequent posts, arguing for something your own source never claimed:\n \nDo you agree that a fossil lying parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it is found is not a polystrate fossil?\n \n I have no problem agreeing with that as a factual statement. But that isn't what the evidence states according to my source. It's only your pro-evolution source which states that and I have no reason to believe your version over my own.\n\n \nit just says the fossil was 'vertical', and lets you assume from that statement that it crossed horizontal strata. Go back and read it again - I'm right, aren't I?\n \n No; it clearly say's the whale is standing vertical in diatomite. It isn't making vague implications and leaving anything to the imagination.\n\n Except it clearly is, because you go on to argue:\n \nAnd only you could dishonestly imply that a body lying at fifty degree angle is resting in parallel position. Assuming it was at 50 degrees, couldn't an 80 to 90 foot object encompass 2, 3 or more quickly laid strata over a 40 day and night period which this flood occurred in?\n\n See? You're passionately defending something your source never once claimed to be true. And you're doing it because your source behaved dishonestly, mentioning a 'vertical' whale fossil right below a discussion of polystrate trees without mentioning that the whale fossil wasn't polystrate.\n \n This is why I say many creationist sources are dishonest, AA: because I can clearly see the effects of that dishonesty upon their readers. You are now utterly - and seemingly irrevocably - committed to believing that whale fossil crossed several strata, something even your source clearly knows is factually untrue. It makes me incredibly angry and sad to see you treated like this in the name of 'righteousness'.",

   "Ok, let's go back and look at exactly what your source has to say about the whale:\n \n Would you agree that is the sum total of what your source has to say on the subject?\n\n \n No peeling, I wouldn't agree with that assessment at all. Here's the link I posted: Scientific Evidence for a Worldwide Flood And the paragraphs immediately above and below the quote you posted.\n Extensive Strata and Pancake Layering: \n As we observe sedimentary strata throughout the world we see almost everywhere flat-lying (or \"pancake\") layered strata. Many of these layers are so extensive that they cover several states. Evolutionists believe that such layers were deposited slowly over millions and millions of years, or that they are simply \"river\" deposits or river deltas. 42,43 Creationists, and a growing number of geologists see problems with such interpretations. 44,45 First because there is virtually no evidence of erosion between the layers, and second, because the sheer size and extent of the strata suggests that the layers were neither formed by rivers, or river deltas. That's because many of the \"layers\" are quite thick, and cover (literally) hundreds and even thousands of square miles, and in many instances are the size of the state of Utah, or even larger.\n \n This, coupled with the presence of marine fossils that are buried in many of the layers, tells us that they were deposited by ocean currents (i.e. from a major, major Flood), like nothing we have ever seen before.\n \n We can say for certain that it was the ocean (as opposed to a lake) because of the marine fossils that are buried in much of this strata. For example, in the Grand Canyon area itself, old Earth geologists have said that the Ocean swept over the whole area on six different occasions. Young Earth geologists say it was probably only once.\n \n A \"Whale\" of a Fossil: \n Or should we say \"a fossil of a whale? It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. \n \n \"They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found.

(It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet.\n \"The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47\n \n More Fossil Whales:\n \n \"In bogs covering glacial deposits in Michigan, skeletons of two whales were discovered ... How did they come to Michigan in the post-glacial epoch? Glaciers do not carry whales, and the ice sheet would not have brought them to the middle of a continent... Was there a sea in Michigan after the glacial epoch, only a few thousand years ago?\" 48\n \"Bones of Whale have been found 440 feet above sea level, north of Lake Ontario; a skeleton of another whale was discovered in Vermont, more than 500 feet above sea level; and still another in the Montreal-Quebec area, about 600 feet above sea level...\" 48\n \n Marine Fossils In The Mountains: \n In Mountains all over the world one can find sea shells and other marine fossils. These include the Sierras, the Swiss Alps, the Himalayas and many more. 49,50,51,52,53 For more on this subject see the following video 54 by Dr. Walter Brown.\n \n Frozen Mammoths: \n Frozen mammoths and Mammoth bones are found in large numbers in Siberia, Alaska, and Northern Europe. Some of these were in such good preservation that Eskimos would feed their dogs meat from them when they became exposed due to melting ice and snow: that is, if wolves didn't get their first. For those who want to know more see: Frozen Mammoths. Also, keep in mind that above this quoted section, polystrate strata are directly discussed. And here is a diagram regarding the same vertical whale evidence from a source that is familiar with the actual facts of this issue: here And it is nothing like your home made diagram.\n \n I agree that with any single issue raised in my link you can argue opposing views. But when all of these examples are taken together, and considering that all of these discoveries listed in that link were independently discovered by secular/non christian methods and processes. It seems ludicrous to me that we ignore what the evidence shows and disregard it out of hand since it doesn't fit with your preferred world view. \n \n \nOk. Now, I would like you to point out where in the above text it says the fossil was polystrate. \n\n \n It doesn't in the posted text, but it say's it above it here:\n Polystrate Fossils: \n One of the strongest pieces of evidence for a worldwide flood is the existence of what Rupke termed \"polystrate fossils.\" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 \n \n Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The \"Fossil Forests\" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 \n \n Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. \n \n Similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada.\n \n And although there is much data on buried trees in the geological literature, most of it is over 100 years old, and difficult to access. One of the few articles on this subject was by Rupke, and in it he comments that:\n \n \"Personally, I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan' in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position.\" 12\n \n With regard to Rupke's observation, I suspect the reason why such is (still) the case has more to do with one's personal bias against the concept of a Creator / God to whom we might very well have to give account than to the ever-mounting evidence against the theory of evolution and the millions of years old Earth that it requires (to appear plausible). However, T-I-M-E is simply not enough: not even BILLIONS of years of it.\n \n See also The Organic Levels of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest 13 and The Yellowstone Petrified \"Forests\" 14 by Harold Coffin.\n \n The Fossils Themselves: \n Fossils don't form on lake bottoms today, nor are they found forming on the bottom of the sea. 15 Instead, they normally only form when a plant or animal is buried soon after it dies. 16 Therefore, the fossils themselves are evidence of a catastrophe such as a flood or volcanic eruption that took place in the past. See also Rapid Petrification of Wood, by Andrew Snelling.\n \n Clastic Dikes: According to Austin, a clastic dike is \"a cross cutting body of sedimentary material which has been intruded into a foreign rock mass.\" 17\n \n \"These dikes...(may) penetrate horizontal sedimentary strata (or) they may occur... in igneous and metamorphic rocks. The process of formation of a clastic dike is analogous to wet sand oozing up between ones toes, but on a much larger scale.\" 17\n Clastic dikes present a problem to the \"mythions of years\" mindset of evolution in that massive \"older\" sediments are found intruding up into overlying younger strata. This must have occurred while the \"older\" sediments were still in a plastic state. \n \n What took these \"older\" sediments so long to become hard?\n \n One would think that a million years would be more than enough time to turn massive sand laden sediments into sandstone, yet we have an example of sediments which are said to be 80 million years older than those above them, and yet they still had not become hard, but were in a wet and plastic state when an earth movement caused them to be forced up into the (supposedly much) \"younger\" sediments. Such things not only present serious problems for the evolutionary method of \"dating\", but also tell us that something is wrong with the millions of years mindset of evolutionary theory itself, and thus cause strongly suspicion that we are not being told the truth by the mass media, nor the \"Scientific\" community of believers in evolution. 17,18,19 \n \n Mt. St. Helens: \n Three separate eruptions produced sedimentary-type layers hundreds of feet thick. One of these was a hurricane velocity deposit that produced thousands of thin laminations up to 25 feet thick 10,11,12 The third eruption was a lava flow, which turned into a hot mud-flow as it crossed the Toutle River. This hot mud flow not only diverted the river, but carved a 17 mile long series of canyons (up to 140 feet deep) in a matter of hours. They call it the Little Grand Canyon of the Toutle River.\" 20,21,22 And to this very day, the neither the mass media, nor any popular \"science\" publications have told the public what happened. 23 For more on this see Mt. St. Helens: Evidence in Support of Biblical Catastrophe.\n \n Palouse Canyon: \n In Eastern Washington State there is a canyon that was eroded through solid basalt by Lake Missoula floods in 1-2 days. This canyon is 300 to 500 feet deep. See references below for more information. 24,25,26,27,28 \n \n Observations at an Australian Beach: \n At Greenmount Beach on the Gold Coast of Queensland, an interesting thing occurred: \"clear laminations, or layering, in the sand--formed by the separation of normal silica-sand grains and smaller, denser mineral sand-grains such as rutile which are dark in color.. The layering was present along the whole sand mass exposed.\" 29 Emphasis Added\n \n \"This was produced as a result of a beach restoration project (which involved) the dredging of sand from (a) sand bar (on) the Tweed River and carrying it by ship several kilometres north to the southern Gold Coast beaches, where it was pumped ashore as a water/sand slurry through a large pipe to the beach.\" 29 See also Talking About Geology / Varves. 30 Emphasis Added\n \n Spontaneous Sorting of Layers: \n Laboratory experiments have shown that spontaneous sorting and layering occurs with a sand, mud and clay slurry. When the mixture slows down, the sand, mud and clay will spontaneously precipitate (settle out) and form individual layers. Dr. Guy Berthault has performed a number of experiments which demonstrate this. 31,32,33 Those who wish to see for themselves, may do so by simply ordering one of the following videos : Evolution: Fact or Belief? Or Experiments in Stratification. \n \n Turbidity Currents: \n A turbidity current is an underwater mud flow, the discovery of which caused somewhat of a revolution in geology. As a result, many sedimentary strata layers throughout the world have been reevaluated and found to be turbidites. 34,35,36,37,38,39,40\n The relevant point here is that regarding what the complete page say's, you have no right or reason to just ignore these factual discoveries which throw a massive wrench in the assumptions evolutionists make in their interpretation of this info without seriously questioning them and seeking to explain them all away with rational and reasonable answers which consistently and honestly justify the existing conflicts, if it's the objective truth that is being sought.",

Here's the link I posted: Scientific Evidence for a Worldwide Flood And the paragraphs immediately above and below the quote you posted.\n\n None of which talk about the whale fossil in question, do they? Read them again, carefully. Where does it say the whale fossil is polystrate? It doesn't.\n \nAlso, keep in mind that above this quoted section, polystrate strata are directly discussed.\n\n Keep in mind? That's the whole thrust of my argument! :) By talking about polystrate fossils, and then talking about this whale fossil, your source has created the false impression that the whale fossil was polystrate. It wasn't. Your source doesn't at any point say it was. What they've done is made you believe something they know not to be true. That's the definition of lying.\n \n \n And here is a diagram regarding the same vertical whale evidence from a source that is familiar with the actual facts of this issue: here And it is nothing like your home made diagram.\n\n Well, no. For a start, they don't include the strata in their diagram, once again allowing the reader to assume they are horizontal rather than (as they are in reality) parallel to the fossil.\n \n \n It seems ludicrous to me that we ignore what the evidence shows and disregard it out of hand since it doesn't fit with your preferred world view. \n\n I entirely agree! So why are you ignoring the evidence of layers of rooted trees (which your source does not dispute) and the fact the whale was lying parallel to the stratum in which it was buried (which your source also does not dispute)?\n \n \nWhere does it say the whale fossil was polystrate?\n \n It doesn't in the posted text, but it say's it above it here:\n\n No, it doesn't. It talks about fossil trees. Nowhere in your source does it come out and say the whale fossil was polystrate. It just says it was vertical, after discussing polystrate tree fossils.\n \n Do you understand? You are being duped. Your faith is being exploited. Your source deliberately lied to you, and you will not believe me when I try to help you see how they did it. You have no idea how upset that makes me.",

I mean, the reason why the issue of teaching creationism makes the news at all is that there are people trying to make it happen, even though they haven't succeeded yet (and aren't likely ever to reverse that trend). And they try loudly, which makes them seem much more widespread than they are.\n \n The two biggest cases recently have been in the state of Kansas and in the town of Dover, Pennsylvania. In neither case did creationism actually get taught, and in neither case did evolution get removed from the curriculum.\n \n In Kansas, the state school board removed naturalistic methodological constraints from its definition of science, so that supernatural explanations could be taught alongside natural ones. To my knowledge, this never actually happened in a classroom, however. In addition, the offending board members were subsequently voted out and the definition changed back. On the other hand, the new board members themselves were subsequently voted out in turn. I have no idea where things stand right now, but I don't think it looks too good for the creationists.\n \n This is mainly because of how things turned out in Dover. There, the local school board tried to force science teachers to read a statement saying that \"evolution is just a theory\" and encouraging students to investigate the supposedly non-religious idea of \"Intelligent Design.\" To make a long story short, not only is ID bad science and entirely religious (and perhaps even bad theology as well), several of the board members were caught in flagrant lies pertaining to the case. (It was quite absurd: they'd say \"I never said x,\" and then the lawyers would play video of them saying x.) The judge decided against the IDists, describing the entire matter as \"breathtaking inanity.\"\n \n So the upshot is, creationism has been defeated again.

   "If I was a Christian I couldn't believe in a massive lying God.\n\n \n You know, Descartes actually made an argument about this in his Meditations over 350 years ago. According to his argument, God has given us the power of reason. He has given us strong inclinations to trust it, and He has given us good evidence that trusting it works out well for us. Perhaps most crucially, He hasn't given us any way to determine that reason is systematically wrong about things. So if our reason does systematically lead us into error, despite all our inclinations to use it, then God would be (in Descartes' words) a \"deceiver\" for having given it to us in the first place. But deception, he further argues, is entirely incompatible with God's power and goodness. Hence, God cannot be a deceiver, and we ought to trust our reason.\n \n Why creationists are so opposed to \"natural reason\" -- which to a believer is a gift from God -- is really puzzling. For despite the implications (as spelled out by Descartes), they really do seem to think that it's fundamentally flawed.

   "When the fossils are aged by the rocks -That's one thing. But really! -- the rocks date the fossils much more accurately.\n [Or was it the other way around] lol.\nI don't know. Perhaps if you could only ask the creationist scientists who devised the methods of relative dating, Georges Cuvier and contemporaries for example. They recognized that the fossils from each stratigraphic layer were different from other layers. They also recognized that some widely spread fossils appeared in the strata in the same order wherever they were found. They hypothesized that the lower fossils were older than those in more shallow deposits. They assigned names to the strata, and after that they used the fossils to identify the various layers wherever they were found. They named the typical fossil layers to represent the relative ages. After than, when they found a fossil they could assign it to the appropriate age.\n \n As Wikipedia says:\n \nCuvier collaborated for several years with Alexandre Brongniart, an instructor at the Paris mining school, to produce a monograph on the geology of the region around Paris. They published a preliminary version in 1808 and the final version was published in 1811. In this monograph they identified characteristic fossils of different rock layers that they used to analyze the geological column, the ordered layers of sedimentary rock, of the Paris basin. They concluded that the layers had been laid down over an extended period during which there clearly had been faunal succession and that the area had been submerged under sea water at times and at other times under fresh water. Along with William Smith's work during the same period on a geological map of England, which also used characteristic fossils and the principle of faunal succession to correlate layers of sedimentary rock, the monograph helped establish the scientific discipline of stratigraphy. It was a major development in the history of paleontology and the history of geology.\n\n The principle is still good in that certain types of fossils only appear in rocks of a certain age. For example, trilobites only appear in rocks of the early Devonian and older. If you find a trilobite fossil, you know for sure that it did not come from Permian rocks. Other fossils were also found in rocks of a limited age. When several of these fossil types are considered together, they are typically grouped differently in rocks of various ages. These groupings are called suites. Therefore, by identifying a particular suite of fossils I can assign an approximate age to the stratum in which that group of fossils was found.\n \n Of course, these same creationists realized that the multiple strata could not represent one great flood. As a result, they realized that what they read in the Bible could not possibly be literally true. They hypothesized a series of creations and destructions - multiple creations and destructions by multiple floods.\n \n So modern paleontology has creationists to thank for the method of relative dating that is still used today to give approximate dates for fossils. It is quite reliable. But modern creationists have reverted to the dark ages before the development of scientific thought. Maintaining the fantasy that the mythology of the Bible is real is so important that creationists reject scientific theories developed by early creationist scientists. Instead creationists now point to people like Mr. Kent Hovind and Ken Ham as \"creation scientists.\"",

Previous theories had suggested only simple proteins could form spontaneously.\n \n This had been shown in a seminal experiment in the 1950s in which basic chemicals were combined in a flask, heated and zapped with electricity, creating basic proteins as a result.\n \n But proving that chemicals can spontaneously form simple proteins did not prove that spontaneous action could create more complex mechanisms.\n \n \"In the absence of such explanations, some people could imagine unseen forces at work when such complex structures emerge in nature,\" said Steinberg.\n \n Steinberg was able to show otherwise. He found the ribosome was put together using relatively simple structural rules, a bit like a three-dimensional puzzle. For critics who ask why spontaneous formation didn't lead to something other than the ribosome, Steinberg used mathematical models to show there was no other possibility. The ribosome simply wouldn't hold together if it were constructed any other way.\n \n \"The assembly followed rules that were logical and for which there were no alternatives,\" said Michnick. \"This forces us to think about bigger structures. This type of thinking is important to understanding all sorts of structure.\"\n \n For instance, the next step might be to consider why proteins begin to form wrongly spontaneously.\n \n Several neurodegenerative diseases occur when proteins start to malform, said Michnick. Steinberg's research could give insight in how that happens, and why.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \u00a9 2009 Bell Canada, Microsoft Corporation and/or their contributors.

   "You know, Descartes actually made an argument about this in his Meditations over 350 years ago. According to his argument, God has given us the power of reason. He has given us strong inclinations to trust it, and He has given us good evidence that trusting it works out well for us. Perhaps most crucially, He hasn't given us any way to determine that reason is systematically wrong about things. So if our reason does systematically lead us into error, despite all our inclinations to use it, then God would be (in Descartes' words) a \"deceiver\" for having given it to us in the first place. But deception, he further argues, is entirely incompatible with God's power and goodness. Hence, God cannot be a deceiver, and we ought to trust our reason.\n \n Why creationists are so opposed to \"natural reason\" -- which to a believer is a gift from God -- is really puzzling. For despite the implications (as spelled out by Descartes), they really do seem to think that it's fundamentally flawed. Just look at all Archie's comments belittling my reliance upon \"human intellect,\" for example.\n\n \n I have never belittled your reliance upon human intellect at all. That is patently ridiculous. That would imply I am against or oppose the use of human intellect which is also patently ridiculous to think that I oppose the use of reason. \n \n What I have belittled you on is your claim of being a committed christian when everything you say and defend opposes the christian principles and beliefs that true believers accept as obvious. Even here in this post, you quote descartes as your evidence for reason when in his own generation he was considered a person with more atheistic beliefs than christian even though like you, he claimed to be a devout catholic. Here's a short bio of his spiritual life.\n Religious Beliefs\n \n It has been rigorously debated within scholarly circles regarding the religious beliefs of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. He himself claimed to be a devout Roman Catholic, claiming that one of the purposes of the Meditations was to defend the Christian faith. However, in his own era, Descartes was accused of harboring secret deist or atheist beliefs. Contemporary Blaise Pascal said that \"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy he did his best to dispense with God. But he could not avoid making Him set the world in motion with a flip of His thumb; after that he had no more use for God.\"[13]Ren\u00e9 Descartes - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Notice what Pascal, a contemporary of his thought of him. Also notice that the man you quoted at least gave God credit for creation even though he abandoned the rest of of what it meant to be a christian. What I find curious about you is even though you claim christianity, you can't see the reason it requires for true believers to accept God at His word in the bible which God says is His Holy Word. Can't you see the problem that creates for you and your alleged spiritual condition? Try applying your critical thinking and ability to reason to that contradictory position which you so eloquently represent in every secular humanist post you write.",

Meanwhile, let me point out yours as you claim to be a dedicated believer in Christ yet you deny Him and His word at every turn in every debate you participate in.\n Tts 1:9 holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict.\n \n Tts 1:10 For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,\n \n Tts 1:15 To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.\n \n Tts 1:16 They profess to know God, but by {their} deeds they deny {Him,} being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed.\n \n Tts 2:1 But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.\n \n Tts 2:7 in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, {with} purity in doctrine, dignified,\n \n Tts 2:8 sound {in} speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.\n \n Tts 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,\n \n Tts 2:12 instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,\n \n Tts 2:13 looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,\n \n Tts 2:14 who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.\n \n Tts 2:15 \"These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority.

The ease at which you're able to find that evidence is a result of the fact that the above definition is really the only way biologists have ever defined evolution since the discovery of DNA.\n \n This link has probably already been posted, as this is a thread on the evidence of evolution, but I'll provide it anyway in case you're genuinely in search of the evidence for evolution.

I have not been in a classroom for a very long time now, but when I was, evolution and big bang were taught as one.\n\n \n They're often taught \"as one\" in secondary schools because the big bang, formation of the Earth, abiogenesis, and evolution all go in chronological order of the history of our world and life. However, you have to be careful where you draw the implication. Just because a textbook says, \"15 billion years ago, the expansion of the universe began with the big bang, 4.5 billion years ago the Earth formed, and 3.5 billion years ago life arose and began evolving,\" does not mean that all these processes are part of the same theory.\n \n This could be a helpful analogy: It's a high school physics class, and the students have to do a problem that involves variables for properties such as momentum, energy, mass, velocity, acceleration, and force all at once. But that wouldn't mean that all the variables represent the same properties.\n \n \nAccepting they are separate issues....\n \n A recent trip to the Smithsonian my son and I were confronted with the exibit proclaiming evolution as an infallible fact.\n \n As an explanation, a video was shown that stated that every mammal on the earth evolved from a muskrat looking little creature that exsisted in pre-historic times.\n \n Relying only on my own sense of logic, and enough scientific knowledge to be dangerous to myself and others, If \"natural selection\" is the basis on which evolution progresses, I can not get passed this questions,\n \n Why the different species? Just considering \"mammals\", if we all came from one rat, why did some mammals evolve to be whales and others human? Doesn't the law of natural selection in itself demand that the path from rat to human would be one linear line rather than a path resembling a tree?\n\n \n No. This is because genetic mutations do not happen in a linear fashion. There are more than 6 billion human beings on this planet, and not a single one will ever experience the same genetic mutations at conception that another does. Millions of mutations happen in every new individual organism -- it's not a controlled aspect of life. Natural selection, or the environment, is the force that weeds out the not-so-helpful genetic traits from the helpful. If evolution were a linear force, then our muskrat-like ancestor would be able to survive in every environment on Earth. But of course that isn't the case. Some mammals have genetic traits that make them much more suited for hot deserts (camels) where vegetation and water is scarce, while other mammals are suited for tropical rain forests (ex. jaguars), and others for colder temperatures (yak oxen).\n \n If life were not diversified, evolution would be in big trouble. One of the specific scientific predictions of evolution is that life will be diversified and suited to the different environments. The fact that life is so diversified is what actually lead Darwin to discover natural selection in the first place. While visiting the Galapagos Islands, Darwin realized on every island, there were different variants of finches, with beaks and size being the primary differences: On some islands, the finches had large, short beaks for cracking large seeds that were only present on that island, while on other islands, the finches were smaller and had longer, narrower beaks for tiny seeds from plans that weren't on the other islands. Diversification is one of the primary pieces of evidence for evolution, not against it.\n \n \n \nEven different enviroments doesn't seem to satisfy the question because that can be expained away with \"adaptation\".\n\n \n Unfortunately for most of the life that has ever been on this planet, adaptation is not very useful in the grand scheme of things. A rat can adapt to slightly colder temperatures by burrowing into the ground, but he's screwed if the environment dips down -40 on a regular basis. You asked why some mammals evolved into whales, and answer seems clear enough when talking about this issue: Muskrats can't well swim 2,000 feet down into the ocean, can they?\n \n Take Darwin's finches again. Unless they have evolved the proper beak, a genetic trait, there would be no way for some of those finches to eat the seeds that other finches eat. They can't adapt to that situation because it's not possible for them to simply grow differently-sized and shaped beaks at will.\n \n Even the ability to adapt is itself an evolutionary trait. We humans heavily rely on adaptation, but we wouldn't be able to do so if we hadn't had our large, complex brains. When we experience a situation like the finches on the Galapagos Islands, we design our own tools or perhaps move to a better environment, but birds don't have the intelligence capacity to do that.\n \n You have stumbled upon a good point, though, and that's that mammals are fairly well adapted for many environments right out of the womb. Mammals live all over the world in all but the very most extreme environments, and mammal-like animals have been around since before the dinosaurs. Like the shark, the mammal is an unusually successful specimen of life. Part of what make mammals so successful are their features: they are warmblooded, so they can generate their own heat and survive in colder temperatures as long as there is food available; hair has become useful in all sorts of ways for controlling the body temperature further; the females protect and produce milk for their young, ensuring a better survival rate for their kin than other animals; and many mammals have much larger, quicker, and more complex brains than their reptilian and water-breathing counterparts.",

   "Before I delve into species, you need a quick and dirty background of evolution:\n \n The following is summarized from the Evolution 101 podcast by Dr. Zachary Moore, PhD and can be found on the learnoutloud dot com.\n \n I. The fact of evolution basically means change of allele frequency of a population over time.1. A loose definition of allele is essential a gene or set of genes responsible for characteristics of an organism. (Example: An allele for blue eyes or the redness of a flower)2. In essence the fact of evolution says that the genes of a population of plants or animals change over time. If the changes help the plant or animal to survive, then the number of animals with the change will increase. 3. Example from Scientific American April 2009: Southern California is seeing a rise in snakebites that is extremely toxic. Why? The normal rattlesnakes in Southern California are the red and speckled rattlesnake. People are killing them off because these two snakes are noisy with their rattles and hiss. As a result the frequency of the Southern Pacific rattlesnake is increasing. The Southern Pacific has an allele that tells it not to hiss and not to rattle so much when they are threatened. It lays low, but the chances of a human encounter is high and the snake bites. The bite of the Southern Pacific is wicked and has three types of toxins. Due to environmental pressures (created by people), there is an increase in the genes or alleles to have snakes that are quieter. It just happens that the quieter snake is more venomous than the ones the humans are killing off. \n \n II. What is NOT evolution? Some people like to say there are different kinds of evolution. This is not true.1. You may hear terms such as:a. Cosmic, Chemical, or Planetary evolution. (Big bang, chemical creation, planet creation)b. Organic evolution: life evolving from non-life or abiogenesis.c. Macro evolution: Changes between kinds of plants and animalsd. Micro evolution: Changes within kinds of plants and animals2. Cosmic, Chemical, Planetary, and organic \"evolution\" has absolutely nothing to do with evolution and serves to bring confusion to the field.3. Some people (especially creationists) like to differentiate macro- and micro- evolution claiming they have different mechanisms. The term \"kinds\" is a biblical term, not a scientific term. The only difference between the two concepts is scale. The same mechanisms apply to both macro- and micro- evolution.4. Some people give poor analogies of evolution or setting up of straw men to easily knock down. There are many variations, but the original one is the watch and the watchmaker. Clearly, a watch cannot come into existence by random chance. It must have a watchmaker and a designer. By analogy, life must have a maker and designer. This analogy misses the point entirely.5. Some ask, what is the goal of evolution. Evolution has NO GOAL. Humans are no more highly evolved than bacteria. Both sets of organisms are adapted to their environment and surviving quite well.\n My next post will delve more into your question of species.",

Is there proof of one species of mammal originating from another? Do we all have some DNA in common? Or something else that links one species to another?\n\n \n I don't know what qualifies as proof in your mind, but there is really strong evidence. Hooved mammals, cats, and dogs are each fairly good examples of clear evolutionary chronologies, in both the fossil record and DNA. Mammals with hooves are good because we see them in all kinds of environments: The first mammals with hooves, tens of millions of years ago, were about the size of a small domestic cat. The various species diversified, and some became about the size of a wolf, while others went on to evolve into mammals that rivaled large dinosaurs. We have horses, donkeys, ox, cows, yak and such today, and then we have the whales, my personal favorite example of evolution in the fossil record. Small, vegetarian hooved mammals started swimming in shallow water and eating underwater vegetation; eventually their bodies became more adept for swimming with arrival of shorter arms and wider appendages; their skulls and bodies became slimmer; eventually their teeth allowed them to eat meat, and by then they looked a lot like a crocodile; finally, with larger and more effective flippers, heavier bodies, and lack of legs allowed them to take to the oceans. \n \n \n \n \nI've heard about the finches in Australia and that was explaned away by \"adaptation\". If that is not true, how is that proven?\n\n \n I'm not really sure how the following kinds of beaks could possibly come about in a single lifetime:\n \n http://moodle.learningnetworks.com/file.php/307/Images/Finches.jpg\n \n If you've ever seen a bird change beak size and shape depending on the food given to it, I'd be excited to hear about that, but I won't cross my fingers. :)",

Or something else that links one species to another?\n \n I've heard about the finches in Australia and that was explaned away by \"adaptation\". If that is not true, how is that proven?\n \n OK.... two questions.emoticon_emb\n\n \n There are multiple threads of evidence.. there is no one piece of evidence that 'proves' that once species share a common ancestor with another. This is known as 'convergence of evidence'.\n \n One of the pieces of evidence is the genetic evidence. Another piece that is important also is the fossil evidence. Now, the media tends to overstate what the scientific claims are, so while it might be a good '90,000 feet' overview , often it is not accurate when looked at closely. For example, the 47 million year old Ida is probably NOT a human ancestor, although it could be considered a 'transitional form', since it has certain traits that distinguish it from older forms that is more 'human' like than older fossils. It is a very important fossil, since it fills in a lot of 'blanks' we have in exactly what happened. However, it isn't nearly as dramatic of a change in thought that other fossils were in the past. It is a pretty fossil, and a dramatic specimen.. but it's importance is hyped up.\n \n Now, when it comes to new species, we can not only see evidence in genetics, and in the fossil record, but by seeing their ability for reproductions. If you look at the donkey and the horse, part of the reason we can guess they are related species, and had a common ancestor is that they can reproduce with each other, although their offspring is sterile 99.xxx% of the time. If you look at tigers and lions, they can produce offspring, however, the males are sterile, and the females usually aren't. \n \n Remember, fossil evidence and morphology (comparing how simularities from skeletons) were the main way for trying to figure out a 'family tree'. It has only been recently through being able to do genetic analysis and figuring out the genome of species that we have further evidence for the commonality of descent for species. Some of the evidence we found when we did that was interesting to say the least.\n Apparently, the split between the chimp line and the human line was a bit messier than thought, and hominids and the chimp ancestors swamped genes for a few hundred thousand years after they started becoming seperate species.",

   "Once again this is a summary of the podcast Evolution 101 by Dr. Zachary Moore, PhD\n \n How does species change from one to another? A species is not as intuitive as one may think. But I am not going into the details of each of the methods of differentiating species. You may do your on research on the four (typology, morphometry, sexual isolation, phylogeny) methods. Humans like to put things in categories (e.g. organisms in categories of species), but nature does not care.\n \n Lets look at one method of defining a species. Sexual isolation: organisms that can mate with each other and give viable offspring. We shall ignore hybrids such as mules and ligers. They are usually sterile. There is a particular set of organisms called ring species that allow us to get s snapshot of speciation in action today. I find them fascinating. Think of a straight line as a circle where G connects back to A. (I am not very good with ASCII art so this will have to work. There are excellent examples on the net, just search for \"ring species\". On youtube: search for: Evolution in Action: Ring Species)\n \n A &#8594; B &#8594; C &#8594; D &#8594; E &#8594; F &#8594; G &#8594; A\n \n One such ring species is Ensatina eschscholtzii. A group of salamanders that live in the mountains which circle the California Simi Valley. The mountain range splits around the valley. As the salamanders moved south, there was a split in lineage from the parent. Some went on the east side of the valley, some went to the west side of the valley. At the southern end of the valley, the daughters of the salamanders meet after about 10 million year split. However, something strange happened. Imagine A and G are the ones meeting in the southern part of California.\n \n Just to keep it simple, I will use A-G instead of their scientific names. Here is the cool thing:\n \n 1. A can mate with B\n 2. B can mate with A and C\n 3. C can mate with B and D\n 4. D can mate with C and E\n 5. E can mate with D and F\n 6. F can mate with E and G\n 7. G can mate with F, BUT NOT A\n \n Each group looks a little different from the one next to it. And A does not look anything like G! At this moment, they are considered the same species. What happens if B-F goes extinct? We now have two separate species! The ring species causes the evolutionary branching effect on the evolutionary tree.\n \n This is one example of evolution in action as predicted by Darwin. Imagine this same process happening for nearly 4 billion years over the entire earth. Mind boggling.\n \n I noticed in your post that you are looking for an example of a mammal. I do not know of a present day ring species of a mammal. (But then I am just a little, country boy from Mississippi, not a biologist.) We must rely on other evidence. As one understands how evolution works, you see the overwhelming evidence in fossil record, DNA research, and in speciation with common ancestors.\n \n Next post, randomness plays a role in evolution, but is not the driving force.",

For example, it is incorrect to assume that a complex structure or biochemical process can function only if all its components are present and functioning as we see them today. Complex biochemical systems can be built up from simpler systems through natural selection. Thus, the 'history' of a protein can be traced through simpler organisms . . . The evolution of complex molecular systems can occur in several ways. Natural selection can bring together parts of a system for one function at one time and then, at a later time, recombine those parts with other systems of components to produce a system that has a different function. Genes can be duplicated, altered, and then amplified through natural selection. The complex biochemical cascade resulting in blood clotting has been explained in this fashion.

Such narrow perspective is arrogance as there is no way man will choose to disassociate his limited intelligence with the obvious all-encompassing intelligence of the Intelligent Designer, be he God or some other name as he is known to himself. Such design would, at the very least, be quite 'natural' to the Designer.\n \n Thus the evolutionist will never accept the possibility of an Intelligent Designer.

   "Not sure what you mean, here. For evolution to take place it needs a system to adapt. It sounds as if you are saying that challenges to IC involve the use of evolutionary theory; but of course they do.\n\n I am saying that they are cheating the implication of the observation. Natural selection selects for functionality, if functionality does not exist is does not select for it. By using pre-existing functionality you are not defeating that observation you are side stepping it.\n \n Therefore you cannot say that an irreducible complex system can be reduced by reducing components with different purposes when it is the function of the system that would allow it to be selected for.\n \n You are moving the \"chance\" factor from the mutation to the chance that existing elements will form the system, natural selection can still not select for what does not function so you are still talking about extreme improbability WITHOUT gradual selection.\n \n For instance if I said cell structure A was irreducibly complex you could say \"well it could have formed in one shot as a massive lucky mutation\" or \"it could have formed from several pre-existing systems that were being selected for\"\n \n I hope you can see that in neither case is structure A being selected for.\n \n \nSorry I cannot see your point here, either. Having a previous system in place for modification is exactly what descent with modification is.\n\n Exactly, so what happens when there is nothing to modify?\n \n \n \nThis is a PRATT (point refuted a thousand times). Before the first cell there was a cell like structure and before that there was a less cell like structure and so on till we get to something so far removed from a cell that you would not call it a cell. \n\n Using the same trick that failed to defeat irreducible complexity, evolution can't reach beyond natural selection and selection works only on what is functional.\n \n Therefore functionality is a pre-requisite to evolution.\n \n \nThe problem you have here is your position that the first life was a modern cell.\n\n The first life form had to have DNA and had to reproduce itself by copying that DNA, if it did not it could not evolve.\n \n \nSee above for why this is false. This is A level information, here (I think that is equivalent to American High School senior year).\n\n You talking about the backs of crystals and the magical liquid body of amino acids and base pairs?\n \n Yea I always got A's in biology but not that part :)\n \n Think about what you are saying, if it isn't a cell it can't reproduce with mutation, no modification with decent which means no evolution, which means it was the random result of atoms and molecules bonding.\n \n \nNo the simplest answer is no designer. You missed one regression.\n\n That regression does not exist if there is a design, and it seems to be taken for granted that there is design. Note how even the most blind evolutionary scientist speaks of how evolution produced \"this design.\"\n \nHere you assume that complexity requires design; ever seen a snowflake? Order by design or naturalist process?\n\n It is the combination of order, complexity, and energy that is specific to life. The number of components is always directly proportional to the chaos except in life. The most orderly crystals have the most homogenous particles (the least different components), the most complex systems appear to be the most disordered (weather), and the most energetic systems are the most chaotic (stars).\n \nYou also assume that life requires design without any reason to suggest that this is so.\n\n It appears to be a design by as sound thinking as a car appears to be a design. Consider for a moment that you did not know that someone designed a car, what would lead you to believe that it was designed if anything?\n \n \nPlease explain the reason for life requiring design (aside from personal incredulity).\n\n Please explain the reason for life being a consequence of the laws of physics?\n \n Or is that the same question?\n \nSimply because there is no evidence to the contrary does not automatically mean that god made it.\n\n That is known, if one wants to speak of false dichotomy stop implying that the only reason one would not believe in evolution is because of religion.\n \nIf the simplest thing is to admit that you don't know (which is what evolution does) then introducing a magical causation with no evidence is false.\n\n Then don't pretend evolution is fact, it doesn't know. I think there has been decent with modification; I think species are descended from one another. I don't think anyone knows how this happens; I think they pretend to know because the religion of atheism must answer the question \"where did I come from?\"\n \nYour error here is to say that no scientific explanation at this moment in time means no scientific explanation ever.\n\n Your error is to say that no scientific explanation can equal a scientific theory.\n \n \nI don't get your point. Who is saying anything other than \"We don't know\"? As far as I'm aware nobody 'knows' exactly how life originated. But what we do know is adding extraneous entities (such as supernatural beings) does not help our understanding one iota. \n\n The people who formed ideas based on a book called \"the origin of species\" and called it science.\n \n They have taken the non-existence of a supernatural or ultra-natural entity as a granted and used that to conclude that the origin of species must have been unintentional.\n \n They are the ones who have injected spirituality into science.\n \n I don't see a reason we separate sections of knowledge except for ignorance and foolish desire. I will apply the scientific method to all knowledge including the hypothesis of ID.\n \n If you have a reason to believe something, then believe it. If you have no reason to believe something do not believe it. Do not say that no reason to believe otherwise is reason to believe.\n \n \nWhen a scientist does not know something they are not 'backed up against the wall'. That is the challenge every scientist revels in. Trying to understand what is yet unknown is the point of science.\n\n They are backed up against the wall if they are claiming they know something that they don't, not before.\n \nGetting to a point where there are questions we can't answer yet (such as the mechanism for the origin of life) is what keeps scientist doing research and hard work to answer those questions.\n\n You can attempt the separate the origin of life from the theory of evolution but I will not accept the claim without some reason.\n \nYou are confusing evolution with Abiogenesis. ToE is not concerned with the Origin question any more than Psychology is concerned with atomic theory. Evolution is taught as fact but the mechanism of abiogenesis is not yet known\n \n The method of evolution is not yet known, it must be a method capable of forming useful functionality without existing functionality. It is extremely cogent thinking to believe that that mechanism would be the same one that formed life, as it is the same outcome (functionality formed), the same subject material (chemicals).\n \n \nYou are indeed showing a lack of education.. evolution IS a fact. It has been demonstrated that there is decent with modification, and that this can \n cause new species to arise.\n\n Begging the question \n \n \nThat is the fact of evolution. The Theory of evolution are models of why it happens , and how it happened in the past.\n\n Exactly\n \nJust like gravity. If you hold a concrete block over your foot,and let go,it will hurt your foot. That is a fact of gravity. The THEORY of Gravity is a model that tries to explain WHY and HOW it happens.\n\n Yes\n \n \n \nRetroviral DNA insertions , and the simularity between the ERV's and Chimps prove your claim is incorrect.\n\n I don't think you got his point, an organism could have 99% base pair identity with you and die from breathing oxygen, very much like computer code a object oriented framework can be used to create many programs but the fact that 90% + of the code needed (including operating system, database functionality ect..) is identical can't tell you much about the programs function.\n \nWell, when it comes to biology, you certainly have a grade school education, because the TOE says nothing about dogs becoming cats, or horses becoming cows. This makes your statement the 'straw man' fallacy.\n\n Um, yes it does. The formation of new species isn't even its problem.\n \n \nMore straw man depictions, and then saying 'schoolboy tactics' is an ad homenin.\n\n I didn't see a strawman but there was an ad hominem, however I note that you threw the first fallacious punch with \"You are indeed showing a lack of education\"",

You don't need a cell to have RNA (or DNA).\n\n You don't need a cell for a great number of biological functions, does that mean life can occur in solution?\n \n \nSo you say that there must be a designer if there is a design? Circular logic.\n\n Argument by definition is more accurate. Design is a verb, the Design the object is an object of design the verb.\n \n 9. an outline, sketch, or plan, as of the form and structure of a work of art, an edifice, or a machine to be executed or constructed. \n 10. organization or structure of formal elements in a work of art; composition. \n 11. the combination of details or features of a picture, building, etc.; the pattern or motif of artistic work: the design on a bracelet. \n 12. the art of designing: a school of design. \n 13. a plan or project: a design for a new process. \n 14. a plot or intrigue, esp. an underhand, deceitful, or treacherous one: His political rivals formulated a design to unseat him. \n 15. designs, a hostile or aggressive project or scheme having evil or selfish motives: He had designs on his partner's stock. \n 16. intention; purpose; end. \n 17. adaptation of means to a preconceived end. \n \n \nWhen scientist talks about a 'design' they do not mean 'made by a designer'. It is a figure of speech. \n\n A figure of speech that includes only life and our creations, I've never heard anyone talk about the \"design\" of a planet, the \"design\" of the clouds, or a \"design\" of volcanoes.\n \n Design it seems is used when something has a purpose and a goal. There is no purpose to a stone, the purpose of life is to live.\n \nAsk yourself why an 'evolutionist' so intent on evolution would actual mean such a thing literally.\n\n Because: \"this random mutation allows the frog to thrive in swamp environments\" sounds ridiculous compared to \"this design allows the frog to thrive in swamp environments.\" \n \n \nSubstantiate or withdraw your assertion.\n\n It was a generalization not an assertion, and it's obviously correct. We cannot predict weather exactly too many components, the sun is superheated chaotic plasma, small number of atoms in molecules produce simpler shaped crystals.\n \n \n \nA car shows evidence of design such as serial numbers. Life does not. Please show evidence of design in something not made by humans.\n\n What's a serial number got to do with it? it's got more numbers than that it's got a computer the manual all the information on the dash. What makes you think that shows it is design?\n \n \nYou are the one adding the extraneous variable into the equation.\n\n Like?\n \n You are the one claiming that a designer must be there for life to work.\n\n Where?\n \nI say life works without one. We already know that life functions; you have to substantiate your claim that it requires a designer.\n\n I didn't make that claim\n \nYou are in a sense asking me to prove a negative.\n\n Evolution is not a negative\n \nThis cannot be done. I'm asking you to substantiate a positive.\n\n What positive?\n \n \nNo idea what you mean by this.\n\n You said it was an error to claim that no scientific explanation means there will never be one, that is true.\n \n It is also an error to claim that no scientific explaintion means science can come to any conclusion on the subject.\n \n \nHave you read it? I can't believe someone who has would make such an assertion. Darwin's book deals with evolution not abiogenesis.\n\n Have you read the title? I know he doesn't deal with the origin of life but the common teaching is that evolution covers that.\n \n \nThe existence of the supernatural is not taken into consideration, either for or against as to science it is not relevant. \n\n Then don't take it into consideration.\n \nEven the Pope believes in evolution.\n\n I doubt that \n \n \nWhat are these scientist claiming? I'm still in the dark.\n\n That the origin and/or advancement of life has been explained scientifically\n \n \n \nYes it is. Imperfect replication and natural selection.\n\n Did nothing of what I said about irreducible complexity make it to your mind? Imperfect replication minus natural selection is what we have in these cases. Evolution as the theory stands cannot explain advancement life.\n \n \n \nThis is not what ToE predicts. You are imagining hopeful monsters.\n\n Then the theory of evolution does not explain new functionality as I claimed.",

That's what I meant.\n \n \nYou said it was an error to claim that no scientific explanation means there will never be one, that is true.\n\n \n Again, sorry if I've misinterpreted you: we currently do not have a complete theory of abiogenesis. But that does not rule out that in the future we may have. Just like at one time we did not have germ theory or electromagnetism; now we do.

Nor does any scientist. It is just not relevant to the research. It is not ruled out any more than Loki is specifically ruled out. It is about as important to science as Zeus.\n \n \nI doubt that\n\n \n You are in for a shock then.\n \n \nIn an October 22, 1996, address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Pope John Paul II updated the Church's position to accept evolution of the human body:\n \"In his encyclical Humani Generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of certain fixed points....Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than a hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines. The convergence in the results of these independent studies - which was neither planned nor sought - constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory.\"[16]\n In the same address, Pope John Paul II rejected any theory of evolution that provides a materialistic explanation for the human soul:\n \"Theories of evolution which, because of the philosophies which inspire them, regard the spirit either as emerging from the forces of living matter, or as a simple epiphenomenon of that matter, are incompatible with the truth about man.\"\n\n \n Catholic Church and evolution - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \nlThat the origin and/or advancement of life has been explained scientifically\n\n \n The origin of life is not ToE and I have already stated that the current knowledge on abiogenesis means the best we can say today is 'we don't know'.\n \n \nDid nothing of what I said about irreducible complexity make it to your mind? Imperfect replication minus natural selection is what we have in these cases. Evolution as the theory stands cannot explain advancement life.\n\n \n But taking out NS does not happen in nature. The only way you could do that would be in an experiment. What would that show us. Every replicator that has to compete for resources and replicates imperfectly has NS acting on it. Even as you read this the words I write are undergoing NS as you select the sentences that are of more interest to you. If I wrote nothing of interest you would not reply and my out put would decline. For my conversation to you to survive I would have to write (by chance) things that catch your attention. This is NS in action.\n \n \nThen the theory of evolution does not explain new functionality as I claimed.\n\n \n Go back to the eye.\n \n Take it easy, freedom",

This is NS in action.\n\n \n All right you clearly don&#8217;t understand what I'm talking about.\n \n Evolution states that mutations occur, the negative ones are eliminated the positive ones are selected for.\n \n Yes selection is not merely a negative force, if it is beneficial mutation the creature will have a higher reproductive ratio and its genes will be spread at a greater ratio. If this last was not the case neutral mutations would drown out beneficial ones like static.\n \n The key to evolution is defeating the odds, by accumulating beneficial mutations over time, natural selection being the filter.\n \n You have (and forgive me if I misunderstood) attempted to refute IC by claiming that it does not make it impossible for an IC system to form. \n \n You are correct, what it does prevent is gradual selection.\n \n That is the key of evolution which means it prevents evolution.\n \n You have said systems could already exist that would form a IC system, that is possible, what is not possible is that those systems were being selected for the functionality of the IC system.\n \n Of course natural selection never stops working, but it never works on what does not exist.\n \n If system A is IC you cannot say it was selected for over multiple mutations because IC means it does not work without all components.\n \n Similarly if a system is IC you cannot say it was formed out of components that were selected for, because that is merely moving the mutation to the preexistence of other elements.\n \n If system A can be made out of systems B and C, and systems B and C are being selected for it does not mean system A is being selected for.\n \n Explain how system A can be selected for if it is IC?\n \n \n\n Take it easy, freedom\n\n Thanks, you too.\n \n Just realized something after I walked into the next room, of course the Catholic Church isn't against evolution, they don't see it as a block to ID, but atheist see ID and evolution as diametrically opposed.",

Evolution does make things more fit by selecting beneficial changes. What's the problem here?\n\n Does evolution explain advancement?\n \n \n \nErosion contains no elements of natural selection or evolution.\n\n I know, read my post.\n \nYou are misrepresenting evolution in an attempt to pick it apart.\n\n No I am not, I pointed out cases which evolution is claimed to explain but on which natural selection is not applicable.\n \n It is not a misrepresentation to say that if natural selection is not causing gradual ordered change, then it is random change; making clear my erosion example.\n \n \nAlso, nowhere have we used the argument that its not impossible as a sole basis for our conclusions.\n\n Scaffolding is an attempt to defeat IC by pointing out that a way can be imagined for an IC system to form.\n On what basis does that show evolution can form an IC system?\n \nIn the case of evolution, it's not only possible, but it is obviously true.\n\n Because it is believed by many or because you need it to be true?\n \nStudy of abiogenesis has a ways to go, but given what we do know, it could be speculated to not only to be possible, but likely. \n\n I don't mind if you separate evolution from the toxic subject of origin, it does not defeat my position.\n \n \nThis demonstrates a huge misunderstanding of evolution on your part.\n\n Forgive me if I don't take your word on it. \n \n \nAgain, systems can change function.\n\n By changing the DNA that constructs the system.\n \nWould you also argue that evolution states that the slow evolution of legs from fish fins was so that kangaroos could jump? Or monkeys could climb trees? I don't think you would. Climbing or jumping legs were not being selected for when fish emerged from the water and no one who truly understands evolution would think so. \n\n You do not understand irreducible complexity; adapted purpose is exactly what I accept natural selection to be capable of.\n \nSo give me one example of a system that has evolved without being selected for.\n\n No I can't.\n \n I can give you examples of systems that couldn't have been selected for before they were formed.\n \n Now I'm sure the examples used by behe are more easily verified, but I think I can name my own to illustrate the point.\n \n The emergence of eukaryotic cells.\n \n \nNotice I left out the term gradual, it is not necessary when the process of evolution as a whole is already known to be gradual. \n\n More than that is must be gradual to defeat the odds, I don't think listing my best points is helping your case....\n \nI guarantee you can't do this.\n\n I guarantee your attempt to show how the above mentioned novelty evolved will not include it being selected for, but will include other systems that will happen to be able to form this one..

   "Does evolution explain advancement?\n\n Yes. Although I may be confused as to what you mean by advancement. If you mean organisms becoming more fit for survival, yes. If you mean a genome becoming more complex, again, yes. \n \n Behe's work on IC has been almost entirely proven false. Many of his examples of IC have been shown not even to conform to his definition of IC. In most of his examples, structures in other organisms have been shown to consist of only a portion of the in question IC structure. These simpler structures still serve a function in the other organism. The classic example of the flagella only took Ken Miller a few days to prove false. He showed that in the same organism there is a syringe structure that consists of the flagella minus 40 parts. It still functions. Other organisms contain this same syringe structure but with only 30 or so missing parts. You can see a clear progression from one structure to the supposedly IC structure. \n \n There is not a single example of a truly IC structure.\n \n \nI guarantee your attempt to show how the above mentioned novelty evolved will not include it being selected for, but will include other systems that will happen to be able to form this one.. In fact it will probably include a spontaneous occurrence as well.\n\n \n As for eukaryotic cells, this is easy to explain. If you had said prokaryotic cells it would have been much more difficult. We have very little information on life before prokaryotic cells but tons of information on the life that existed before eukaryotic cells. That's because many of these examples are still around as bacteria.\n \n Most evolutionary biologists believe that eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiotic relationship between two or more different types of prokarytic bacteria. One type found it was able to live inside the other, maybe parasitic at first. Not very difficult to imagine, right? Of course the parasite had to take care of the host to make its own survival more likely. Eventually, they evolve (independently) to be symbiotic. At this time the original parasite is able to evolve to a much simpler function, say, a single task even. The host provides energy to the parasite in return for it completing its task. This is of course leading to chloroplasts or mitochondria. I add that both carry their own separate DNA today. Why else would these organelles need their own unique copy of DNA? The nucleus is easy to explain too because the cell needed better and better ways to segregate its own DNA from the organelles. There, no dramatic leap, no lack of selection.",

Thank you, you may step down.\n \nBehe's work on IC has been almost entirely proven false. Many of his examples of IC have been shown not even to conform to his definition of IC.\n\n Yes I've read all about it, from his essays to millers reply. I have made my decision on their respective validity why don't you read them and decide?\n \n \nIn most of his examples, structures in other organisms have been shown to consist of only a portion of the in question IC structure.

I have repeated this same point about 10 times now, I think that's enough so I trust you will just repeat it to yourself if that is the proper rebuttal.\n \n \nThere is not a single example of a truly IC structure.\n\n That hasn't been attacked by people who don't understand why IC is a problem... like you.\n \n Again (and for the last time) because a method can be conceived to form an IC system does not mean that it was probable or that evolution could have formed it. Example: I can think of a method right now to form an IC system, a single massive mutation which forms all necessary components.\n \n There problem solved IC not an issue for evolution right? I didn't violate any laws I didn't even have to assume convergent evolutionary pathways.\n \n Behe has apparently not been informed hes been dis-proven, in fact he still seems to be doing that \"science\" thing, or at the very least he is not quoting the bible and yelling like you would have us believe all anti-evolution persons are.\n \n \n\"I would like to pause here for a moment to point out that all three scientists who tried to meet the challenge to Darwinian evolution of blood clotting--Russell Doolittle, Kenneth Miller, and Keith Robison--foundered on exactly the same point, the point of irreducible complexity. Yet they foundered in three different ways. Doolittle mistakenly thought that even the current cascade might not be irreducibly complex, but experimental results showed him to be wrong. Miller either proposed unregulated steps or just waved his hands and shouted \"gene duplication\", avoiding the problem by obfuscation. Robison directly attacked a piece of the problem, but failed to see he was intelligently guiding events in a distinctly non-Darwinian scenario. Perhaps we may be allowed to conclude that when three scientists, highly intelligent and strongly motivated to discredit it, all come up empty, that irreducible complexity is indeed a big hurdle for Darwinism.\"\n\n On attempts to show blood clotting to not be IC, read the rest of his article by google search.\n \n \nAs for eukaryotic cells, this is easy to explain. If you had said prokaryotic cells it would have been much more difficult. We have very little information on life before prokaryotic cells but tons of information on the life that existed before eukaryotic cells. That's because many of these examples are still around as bacteria.\n\n Excuse my ignorance I didn't know there was life before prokaryotic cells\n \nMost evolutionary biologists believe that eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiotic relationship between two or more different types of prokarytic bacteria.\n\n This is exactly what I mean, a story can be told but a story involving slow progress towards an advancement through NS?\n \nOne type found it was able to live inside the other, maybe parasitic at first. Not very difficult to imagine, right? Of course the parasite had to take care of the host to make its own survival more likely.\n\n \"Found\" \"had to\" for a purpose of survival; more of those intelligence implying figures of speech I guess?\n \nEventually, they evolve (independently) to be symbiotic. At this time the original parasite is able to evolve to a much simpler function, say, a single task even. The host provides energy to the parasite in return for it completing its task. This is of course leading to chloroplasts or mitochondria. I add that both carry their own separate DNA today. Why else would these organelles need their own unique copy of DNA?\n\n \n Glad you brought of mitochondria,and chloroplasts both excellent examples of IC. You did not fulfill the requirements for this one but let's see you start on aerobic metabolism and solar energy usage.\n \n I don't mind if you copy paste.\n \nThe nucleus is easy to explain too because the cell needed better and better ways to segregate its own DNA from the organelles. There, no dramatic leap, no lack of selection.\n\n How did it start forming internal membranes? They don't just form from need they are assembled by multiple specific proteins.\n \n No leaps? what about parasitism? at what point before penetrating the cell membranes and using sugars or ATP is it being selected for?\n \n You say the parasite didn't kill the host? then how did it reproduce inside? There is a system that controls cell division that would need to be in place before any successful symbioses.\n \n I wonder if left for reproduction? or did the system of simultaneous reproduction appear from the void as well?\n \n You kind of swept over at the part where it switched from being a parasite to a symbiont, until that happened selection for the host would be to get rid of the thing, do we ignore that part while we let the invader continue it's evolution?\n \n About that, what task could the invader do that the host could not do before? It can't have performed mitochondrial functions outside of a cell, and if it had photo-synthesis why would it have become parasitic when it had such great advantages in energy production?\n \n Oh that reminds me, have they suggested a way for the oceans of primordial earth to be filled with abiotic sugars or ATP?\n \n If they haven't they have a serious problem with cellular metabolism before photosynthesis.\n \n More is coming into my head I don't think you would appreciate it as I am almost certain your comeback is going to be \"just because we don't know everything.\"",

   "Right! Your Bible tells you different so there was no such thing as Neanderthals.\n \n But Neanderthals did exist and they looked a lot like us. Here's a couple of pictures of real Neanderthal fossils.\n \n http://albuga.free.fr/im/prehistoire/patou-mathis/im08y.jpg\n \n http://www.mnh.tau.ac.il/upload/Neanderthal%20burial%20S.jpg\n \n Here's the same fossil as reconstructed.\n \n http://www.modernhumanorigins.net/hominids/kebara2.jpg\n \n If you check in the Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human Origins there is a picture of what may be a burial of a mother and child. They are both complete down to the fingers and toes. I can't find a link on line, which is sad since I know that you don't read books. It seems that if it isn't in your Bible or on the Internet, it isn't true.\n \n But Neanderthals aren't our ancestors. Here's a fossil that is very likely to be a member of a species that is our ancestor (or very close to our lineage).\n \n http://humanorigins.si.edu/ha/images/15000.jpg\n \n That's not a Neanderthal and it's not a modern human. It may belong to a species that is ancestral to both.\n \n What does it matter whether or not a complete skeleton has been found. There have been enough Neanderthal skeletons found that the physiology, in fact a range of physiology that demonstrates variation through time and space, can be reconstructed. There are also lots of other hominid specimens that enable paleontologists to reconstruct lots of our ancestors.\n \n How intentionally blind can one be to refuse to consider incomplete fossils because you have no understanding of physiology or morphology and because your book of superstition and mythology leads you to believe that they don't exist.\n\n \n You seem to carry the same stunted method of argument as you do on other subjects., making the same gross assumptions about whom you are responding.\n \n I daresay I read more books than you, old boy, and among far more diverse subjects so get off you pedestal before it falls out from under you.\n \n I have never said neanderthals do not exist, only whether their reconstruction is fully authentic. \"Neanderthals\" are just another human. Even today there are vastly different facial shapes and physiology's throughout the spectrum of humanity. Why not 10,000 years ago?\n \n The problem comes in when anthropologists find bits and pieces of simian skulls and claim that they are precursors to humans. Don't get started on the hoaxes. In fact there is plenty of conjecture still going around because science does not have to 'prove' anything.\n \n And I have seen every one of those photos above. The 'reconstructed' fossil looks a bit different in placement than the original, however, if you look at the jaw, you will see that there is practically no difference in that jaw and modern humans.\n \n And if you have the complete inability write a response without the ad hominem horesecrap, do not address a response to me.",

   "It's so easy when they defeat their own arguements. Thank you, you may step down.\n\n What? You think you've proven something here?\n \n \n \n\n You don't know why IC is a problem then, it is not a stumbling block because there is no way it could be formed it is a stumbling block because NS doesn't effect the formation. I have repeated this same point about 10 times now, I think that's enough so I trust you will just repeat it to yourself if that is the proper rebuttal.\n\n Yeah, you keep saying that but have yet to demonstrate an example of this.\n \n \n \n\n \n Again (and for the last time) because a method can be conceived to form an IC system does not mean that it was probable or that evolution could have formed it. Example: I can think of a method right now to form an IC system, a single massive mutation which forms all necessary components.\n\n \n Problem, Genious. That's never happened! The whole argument is whether IC systems by Behe's definition actually exist. Why are you now creating hypothetical ones?\n \n \n\n Behe has apparently not been informed hes been dis-proven, in fact he still seems to be doing that \"science\" thing, or at the very least he is not quoting the bible and yelling like you would have us believe all anti-evolution persons are.\n\n Yeah, another creationist in delusion is all. He's been informed. He lost Dover vs BoE. He's been ridiculed by scientists who actually understand evolution.\n \n \n \n \n\n Excuse my ignorance I didn't know there was life before prokaryotic cells\n \n\n If you think I am constrained by the classic definition of life, you are wrong and excused.\n \n \n \n\n \"Found\" \"had to\" for a purpose of survival; more of those intelligence implying figures of speech I guess?\n\n Terminology, actually. They work quite nicely.\n \n \n\n Glad you brought of mitochondria,and chloroplasts both excellent examples of IC. You did not fulfill the requirements for this one but let's see you start on aerobic metabolism and solar energy usage.\n\n Argument from ignorance. Some of the first self-replicating molecules to exist were surely photosynthesizes. On some level they constructed higher energy molecules from solar energy. It's not a stretch to put this as a precursor to the function of chloroplasts. The same can be said with mitochondria. The original function of mitochondria was probably not the same as it is seen today. Again, functions change and I fall back on my argument from before that the organelles evolved through a symbiosis. \n \n \n\n I don't mind if you copy paste.\n\n I didn't copy and paste anything.\n \n \n\n How did it start forming internal membranes? They don't just form from need they are assembled by multiple specific proteins.\n\n \n Do I need to spell this out completely? Do you have no speculative abilities at all? Look, we see varying degrees of all of these structures in many different microbes. A common designer would suggest that all would be the same, instead we see increasing complexity in these structures that perfectly matches the time line of when the fossil record suggests they first emerged. (I know you are going to try and get me on the increasing complexity comment)\n \n \n\n No leaps? what about parasitism? at what point before penetrating the cell membranes and using sugars or ATP is it being selected for?\n \n You say the parasite didn't kill the host? then how did it reproduce inside? There is a system that controls cell division that would need to be in place before any successful symbioses.\n \n I wonder if left for reproduction? or did the system of simultaneous reproduction appear from the void as well?\n \n You kind of swept over at the part where it switched from being a parasite to a symbiont, until that happened selection for the host would be to get rid of the thing, do we ignore that part while we let the invader continue it's evolution?\n \n About that, what task could the invader do that the host could not do before? It can't have performed mitochondrial functions outside of a cell, and if it had photo-synthesis why would it have become parasitic when it had such great advantages in energy production?\n \n Oh that reminds me, have they suggested a way for the oceans of primordial earth to be filled with abiotic sugars or ATP?\n \n If they haven't they have a serious problem with cellular metabolism before photosynthesis.\n \n More is coming into my head I don't think you would appreciate it as I am almost certain your comeback is going to be \"just because we don't know everything.\"\n\n \n Not quite. You seem to forget again that the mitochondria has surely mutated and the function of ATP production is certainly not its original function so there didn't necessarily need to be sugars to metabolize. Further, why couldn't there already be sugars produced by photosynthesizers? Who said anything about cellular metabolism before photosynthesis? I think you made that up.\n \n It would have started as a parasite and reproduced on its own, possible even free to leave the cell if it chose. At some point it would have become unable to leave its host and have been perfectly happy staying inside multiplying as the host multiplied. After being in such a system for so long, organisms become reliant on the system. This can be seen across the spectrum of evolutionary biology, zoology etc. As soon as they are reliant on each other, they begin evolving together as a benefit in one must benefit both or both die. This leads to the fine tuning of things like meiosis.",

   "I'm a bit hesitant to weigh in here. Not because Freedom has anything even resembling a good argument, but because he doesn't and doesn't realize it.\n \n Freedom, if I am not mistaken, you have claimed that IC presents a problem for evolution because producing an IC system requires selection for a system that doesn't yet exist.\n \n Let's take a look at what IC is. You've posted Behe's original definition from his book. Did you know that he later \"updated\" his definition to include reference \"core\" components?\n Did you know that Dembski later took it upon himself to re-redefine IC? Did you notice that Dembski's re-redefinition actually gutted the entire concept?\n \n The original intent of introducing IC as a hurdle for evolution is essentially what you have claimed: that natural selection could not produce a structure that could not function without each component in place; that removing even one piece destroyed the functionality of that system. This is an entirely conceptual idea: unguided, stepwise evolution cannot produce such a system.\n The problem is that unguided, stepwise evolution can produce such a system. Once the underlying concept -- that unguided, stepwise evolution cannot produce such a system -- has been refuted, the claim falls apart. It's not even a question of finding such a system (although it has been done plenty). Busting the idea busts the \"problem.\" Conceiving of any way that unguided evolution can produce an \"IC\" system disproves the entire point.\n \n Scaffolding can do this. Scaffolding HAS does this. Consider the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. This protein has three domains, two of which are homologous; one of these domains is a duplication of another, and one of those two domains has experienced enough mutation to have a slightly different function than the original. The pre-duplication protein had two functions; the post-duplication and post-mutation protein had three functions, yet it's all one piece. A second, different protein that formerly performed the \"newest\" (third) function could be lost without imparting a selection pressure upon the possessing species.\n But the IC approach declares that the system is now irreducibly complex. Removing one component of the system -- the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase -- removes functionality of that biochemical pathway. The protein that formerly performed the same function as the new (third) domain of CPS made the evolution of the current form of CPS possible without losing functionality of the system, but a current snapshot of the system would make the IC-believer conclude that the system could not have evolved.\n \n Even if this situation were entirely hypothetical, it refutes the ability of the concept of IC to be effective in showing the impossibility of an evolutionary pathway. And it's not even hypothetical.\n \n \n You have claimed that IC produces a problem because there can be no natural selection for a system that does not exist. There can be no natural selection FOR a system that does not exist, but there can be natural selection OF a system that does not exist in that there can be selection FOR parts that can end up forming that system. This is the case for the allegedly IC bacterial flagellum. Components that were useful to the organism were combined in previously nonexistent ways that were also useful to the organism. The \"guts\" of the flagellar mechanism is a secretory system, and the \"tail\" is the same stuff as cytoskeleton. There's no reason at all that the parts could not exist (and be selected FOR) before the flagellum existed. (This is co-option or exaptation.)\n \n Behe then changed his definition to overcome the problem of having systems that fit the original definition but whose evolution could be explained by scaffolding and co-option/exaptation. The problem was that the redefinition didn't do anything, it just pushed the requirement back a bit to what Behe arbitrarily called the \"irreducible core.\" It essentially said, \"Go back far enough, and you'll not have an explanation for some things.\" Such an argument falls prey to the very same reasoning that doomed his original definition.\n \n Dembski tried to save IC by redefining it again. He used Behe's original example of a three-legged stool to demonstrate his redefinition. Behe considered a three-legged stool irreducibly complex: remove any leg or the seat, and the stool fails to function. (Nevermind that the pieces might be somehow useful elsewhere, because that has been addressed.) Dembski pointed out that a simpler system would serve the same function: a seat being held up by a block. Thus, a three-legged stool is not IC, but a block that can serve as a butt-rest is. In order for something to be IC, Dembski said, there can't be any simpler system that serves that function.\n \n What Dembski is too dumb to understand is that his re-redefinition entirely abandons Behe's original intent, requires proving a universal negative (that no simpler system can serve the same function) to show that something is IC, and still doesn't sidestep the refutations of exaptation!\n And if you don't believe my characterization of Dembski's re-redefinition, look it up on Dembski's blog!\n \n Arguing that the arising of an IC system via either scaffolding or exaptation is improbable is insufficient for maintaining that IC (of any definition!) presents a problem for modern evolutionary theory. It's equivalent to arguing that because the probability of hitting the Powerball jackpot is so low, nobody ever hits the Powerball jackpot.",

   "I'm a bit hesitant to weigh in here. Not because Freedom has anything even resembling a good argument, but because he doesn't and doesn't realize it.\n\n I still don't realize it even after that brilliant attempt to enlighten me, I suppose I'm hopeless emoticon_cry\n \nFreedom, if I am not mistaken, you have claimed that IC presents a problem for evolution because producing an IC system requires selection for a system that doesn't yet exist.\n\n You got it.\n \nLet's take a look at what IC is. You've posted Behe's original definition from his book. Did you know that he later \"updated\" his definition to include reference \"core\" components?\n\n No I didn't I posted my definition, it probably looks very similar.\n \nDid you know that Dembski later took it upon himself to re-redefine IC? Did you notice that Dembski's re-redefinition actually gutted the entire concept?\n\n No\n \nThe original intent of introducing IC as a hurdle for evolution is essentially what you have claimed: that natural selection could not produce a structure that could not function without each component in place; that removing even one piece destroyed the functionality of that system.\n\n Yes, or more precisely that there was no intermediate functionality for NS to work on to arrive at modern complexity.\n \nThe problem is that unguided, stepwise evolution can produce such a system. \n\n You can't prove it so we are left with data analysis and thought exercise, all of evolution consist of those two things. Why can't the same be used to refute it?\n \n \nOnce the underlying concept -- that unguided, stepwise evolution cannot produce such a system -- has been refuted, the claim falls apart. It's not even a question of finding such a system (although it has been done plenty). Busting the idea busts the \"problem.\" Conceiving of any way that unguided evolution can produce an \"IC\" system disproves the entire point.\n\n Conceiving of a way evolution could produce an IC system disproves the entire point conceiving of a way a IC system could be produced doesn't.\n \n\n Scaffolding can do this. Scaffolding HAS does this.\n\n Scaffolding assumes that selection is not necessary for interaction, scaffolding takes it as a granted that systems will change function because of mutation, why is this different from mutation?\n \n \nConsider the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. This protein has three domains, two of which are homologous; one of these domains is a duplication of another, and one of those two domains has experienced enough mutation to have a slightly different function than the original.\n\n 1) link to data?\n 2) relevance?\n \nThe pre-duplication protein had two functions; the post-duplication and post-mutation protein had three functions, yet it's all one piece. A second, different protein that formerly performed the \"newest\" (third) function could be lost without imparting a selection pressure upon the possessing species.\n \n But the IC approach declares that the system is now irreducibly complex. Removing one component of the system -- the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase -- removes functionality of that biochemical pathway. The protein that formerly performed the same function as the new (third) domain of CPS made the evolution of the current form of CPS possible without losing functionality of the system, but a current snapshot of the system would make the IC-believer conclude that the system could not have evolved.\n \n Even if this situation were entirely hypothetical, it refutes the ability of the concept of IC to be effective in showing the impossibility of an evolutionary pathway. And it's not even hypothetical.\n\n \n I was responding to each paragraph individually when I realized that the main point I was making was going to be lost in the smaller ones and that you would feel safe attacking those.\n \n How did the CPS protein acquire the third piece of functionality? If your answer is a single mutation that is exactly what IC predicts is neccessary.\n \n \nYou have claimed that IC produces a problem because there can be no natural selection for a system that does not exist. There can be no natural selection FOR a system that does not exist, but there can be natural selection OF a system that does not exist in that there can be selection FOR parts that can end up forming that system.\n\n You are using the arguements I have identified several times and refuted.\n \n Natural selection of a system that does not exist, what do you mean by that? What gradual change can be effected when no genes are being selected for?\n \n Second by moving the burden of randomness from the mutation to the parts of a system it appears as if you have solved the odds problem, but you haven't. NS cannot work on parts that aren't yet functioning any more than it can work on a mutation that has not yet occurred. Parts can be refined for a function but the direction of that refinement CANNOT be towards a system that does not exist except by random chance.\n \n \n \nThis is the case for the allegedly IC bacterial flagellum. Components that were useful to the organism were combined in previously nonexistent ways that were also useful to the organism. The \"guts\" of the flagellar mechanism is a secretory system, and the \"tail\" is the same stuff as cytoskeleton. There's no reason at all that the parts could not exist (and be selected FOR) before the flagellum existed. (This is co-option or exaptation.)\n\n No reason at all, but we aren't talking about them being selected for are we? we are talking about the flagellum.\n \n \nBehe then changed his definition to overcome the problem of having systems that fit the original definition but whose evolution could be explained by scaffolding and co-option/exaptation. The problem was that the redefinition didn't do anything, it just pushed the requirement back a bit to what Behe arbitrarily called the \"irreducible core.\" It essentially said, \"Go back far enough, and you'll not have an explanation for some things.\" Such an argument falls prey to the very same reasoning that doomed his original definition.\n\n Sounds like he let people like you confuse him, his original definition was sound except that he should have clarified that it is not the functionality that is irreducible but the selection for that functionality.\n \n \nDembski tried to save IC by redefining it again. He used Behe's original example of a three-legged stool to demonstrate his redefinition. Behe considered a three-legged stool irreducibly complex: remove any leg or the seat, and the stool fails to function. (Nevermind that the pieces might be somehow useful elsewhere, because that has been addressed.) Dembski pointed out that a simpler system would serve the same function: a seat being held up by a block. Thus, a three-legged stool is not IC, but a block that can serve as a butt-rest is. In order for something to be IC, Dembski said, there can't be any simpler system that serves that function.\n\n Ok, I'll take your word on it.\n \n \nArguing that the arising of an IC system via either scaffolding or exaptation is improbable is insufficient for maintaining that IC (of any definition!) presents a problem for modern evolutionary theory.\n \n It is sufficient to me. Do I need to find a way to disprove evolution by showing it is absolutely impossible to convince you?\n \n \n It's equivalent to arguing that because the probability of hitting the Powerball jackpot is so low, nobody ever hits the Powerball jackpot.\n\n I am glad you realize probability is the core of my arguement, do you realize anti-probability is the core of evolution?\n \nHi Freedom, do you want to continue our discussion?\n\n Sure\n \nWhy can't I use words the way they were meant to be used? You know full well that I have never claimed evolution to always evolve more complex or always evolve less complex. Show me where I said that please. This is a debating tactic you are using to try to misrepresent what I have said. \n\n You didn't say that, my comment was about differentiating between theory and what the theory claims to have happened.\n \n So if you said evolution explains increasing complexity but does not necessarily mean increasing complexity, that would not necessarily imply increasing complexity.\n \n However since complexity has increased (see fossil record) then evolution must necessarily imply increasing complexity if it claims to explain it.\n \n \nSuch an event does not need to be selected for. You clearly do not understand evolution if your contention is that no function can arise without first being selected for. \n\n Ah! that is exactly my contention, this is an equivalent of ceding my point but I don't believe you will do so until it has been thoroughly explored.\n \n If you deny this then your contention is that evolution can give rise to function without selecting for it. Now read the theory and explain.\n \n \nWhat happens when the organelle doesn't make it to both sides? One side lives and one dies. This is easy to see how evolution could perfect the system.\n\n Assuming that the host required to invader to live. If it did require it before synchronized division, then it would die at a higher rate than those that did not require the invader and those genes that caused it to be dependant would be selected against.\n \n \nYou could have only synchronized meiosis first, selected for because it increase the chances that both dividing halves of the cell get the organelles they need - but no separation mechanism.\n\n Possibly, I am not sure meiosis is the correct term for prokaryotes.\n \nOne cell would die if it didn't get any organelles and the living cell would have to grow and try again. \n\n See above, this is why no one puts together an evolutionary timeline to refute IC.\n \nThis wouldn't be very good for survival, but all that has to happen to improve the system is the separation mechanism.\n\n 'try again' it sounds like this \"symbiosis\" has been a very bad selective force on the host cell (about 50% dead), have we conveniently forgot about the cells not infected? or are there none left?\n \nAlso, it is very likely that whatever was triggering the meiosis was very similar for both organelles and host cells. \n\n And that it could pass through the cell membrane of the invader?\n \n \nFurther, at the time these functions were first evolving, there could have been many more organelles than current cells have. This would have been true so that both halves would surely get some. As soon as cell division became more efficient, the number of organelles would have been reduced. \n\n Yea too many, how did you solve the parasite not reproducing until it kill the host again?\n \nThere is no such thing as IC. If Behe can't come up with an IC system, why do you think that you can?\n\n Because I have (so far), he has.\n \n \nI have been sitting here reading this stuff and wondering what would happen if ID and IC was accepted by the scientific community, what then?\n\n I don't care.\n \nHow would they test the theory?\n\n They can't test it right now except by analog, I hope it's apparent that the same is true for evolution.\n \nIs it just to be considered proved based on what appears to be something resembling philosophy?\n\n It's not a hypothesis itself, it is a challenge to a hypothesis.",

   "\n\n \n \nYes, or more precisely that there was no intermediate functionality for NS to work on to arrive at modern complexity.\n\n Right: according to the ID caricature of stepwise evolution, an IC system can't be built stepwise because the reduced system allegely has no functionality. Even if we assume that the reduced IC system has no functionality, it does not follow that the components have no function. Thus these structures are prone to selection pressures.\n \n It seems that your argument is that without natural selection driving the formation of the IC system from pre-existing components, the probability of the system being built from those otherwise non-interacting components is very small. But so is hitting the Powerball jackpot, and there are only two per week. See law of large numbers.\n \n \nYou can't prove it so we are left with data analysis and thought exercise, all of evolution consist of those two things. Why can't the same be used to refute it?\n\n Either could be used to refute it if either has any meat to it. Yours doesn't. \n Not all of evolution consists of those two things. Statements like that make me want to stop treating you as someone who is capable of understanding this topic. You claim that we can't prove that evolution is capable of doing this, but even the thought experiment shows that it can. Nevermind that we have the evidence that it has happened.\n \n \nConceiving of a way evolution could produce an IC system disproves the entire point conceiving of a way a IC system could be produced doesn't.\n\n If I've interpreted this mess of English correctly, then I agree! The issue is that I have conceived of a way that evolution could produce an IC system. (Okay, I wasn't the first person to do this, but still...) You object because it doesn't involve natural selection selecting FOR that system, and you think that this missing characteristic means that evolution can't do it. In reality, it means nothing of the sort.\n \n \nScaffolding assumes that selection is not necessary for interaction, scaffolding takes it as a granted that systems will change function because of mutation, why is this different from mutation?\n\n Hey, I agree that scaffolding can take place with mutation of components and without selection FOR a system that doesn't exist. Are you agreeing with me?\n Additionally, it's possible that the system might change function without even a mutation in a coding sequence of any of those components but via a mutation in any targeting system.\n \n \n1) link to data?\n\n Sorry, got this from a real book: Biochemistry, Berg, J.M., et al, 5th ed. Freeman. (p 695)\n \n \n2) relevance?\n\n Real world example of conceptual disproof of IC \"hurdle.\" Aren't you paying attention?\n \n \nI was responding to each paragraph individually when I realized that the main point I was making was going to be lost in the smaller ones and that you would feel safe attacking those.\n\n I feel safe attacking any idiocy.\n \n \nHow did the CPS protein acquire the third piece of functionality? If your answer is a single mutation that is exactly what IC predicts is neccessary.\n\n My answer is not a single mutation, it is a number of mutations. Either way, though, your assertion is purely false. IC doesn't predict anything. Why would a single mutation difference either support or challenge claims of IC?\n \n \nYou are using the arguements I have identified several times and refuted.\n\n Bullspit. You say that you've identified these arguments and refuted them, and then you say,\n \nNatural selection of a system that does not exist, what do you mean by that?\n\n which shows that not only have you not refuted it, but you haven't identified it because you don't even understand it. Having this discussion without understanding the difference between selection FOR and selection OF is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. A pocketknife. A mini pocketknife.\n \n Let's use a very simple model. Suppose that allele A imparts characteristics X and Y upon the possessing organism. Suppose characteristic X presents a favorable selection pressure upon that organism. Characteristic X is selected FOR, meaning that allele A is selected FOR. But because allele A is selected FOR, characteristic Y experiences the same effect of being selected for even though there was no selection for characteristic Y. Characteristic Y has been selected; i.e. there was selection OF Y.\n \n \nSecond by moving the burden of randomness from the mutation to the parts of a system it appears as if you have solved the odds problem,\n\n I've done neither, exactly. Mutation of some sort can still play a part, but we don't need the multiple simultaneous mutations that the IC proponent claims are needed. Odds were never a problem; people still play Powerball.\n \n \nNS cannot work on parts that aren't yet functioning any more than it can work on a mutation that has not yet occurred.\n\n 1. NS (+RM) isn't the only mechanism of evolution.\n 2. The parts are functioning, just not originally as the new system.\n \n \nParts can be refined for a function but the direction of that refinement CANNOT be towards a system that does not exist except by random chance.\n\n I agree with what you mean but not with one interpretation of what you have said. NS cannot direct refinement based on the fitness conferred by a nonexistent system, but it can direct refinement (1) based on fitness conferred by an existing system and (2) in a way that happens to lead to new function. I explain this because there is not necessarily no relationship between the two, meaning that the \"random chance\" here is not very similar to the \"random chance\" of multiple simultaneous mutations or even of a single point mutation in \"just the right spot.\"\n \n \nNo reason at all, but we aren't talking about them being selected for are we?\n\n Yes, we are. There is a fitness benefit to having these structures that IC proponents argue can't be expected to confer a fitness benefit because the IC system isn't fully built.\n \n \nhis original definition was sound except that he should have clarified that it is not the functionality that is irreducible but the selection for that functionality.\n\n I agree that his first definition was the least troublesome of the three (for the IC/ID proponents), but that doesn't make it any less flawed. I understand perfectly what his point was/is. The fact that it was (is) flawed is what led to his redefinition. Seriously: even Behe realized that his original definition was insufficient for proving his point.\n \n \nOk, I'll take your word on it.\n\n But you don't have to. You can look it up right on his blog. Of course, Dembski's being an XXXXX doesn't really refute Behe's original idea, but the fact that Dembski felt the need to re-revise Behe's definition might be interpreted as being indicative of a problem.\n \n \nIt is sufficient to me.\n\n Of course it's sufficient for you. You can't connect dots. You say that NS can't favor nonexistent or nonfunctional systems, which is true. You conclude that evolution can't build systems that have intermediate or incomplete forms that are nonfunctional. We provide examples of ways that evolution can do this, and you hand-wave it away.\n \n \nI am glad you realize probability is the core of my arguement, do you realize anti-probability is the core of evolution?\n\n Yes, and no. Yes, probability is the core of your argument, meaning that it's an argument from incredulity, as others have already pointed out. And no, anti-probability is not the core of evolution. It's pretty damn dumb to make that argument, too, as if there's no positive evidence for evolution. This is why many educated people can't take evolution deniers seriously. The sheer abundance of the obtuse character of your argumentation is difficult to stomach.",

   "Right: according to the ID caricature of stepwise evolution, an IC system can't be built stepwise because the reduced system allegely has no functionality.\n\n You are determined to talk about ID, in your mind after that happens all you have to do is ignore my arguments as religious bias. You will fail.\n \n I am not interested in talking about anything but evolution in this thread.\n \nEven if we assume that the reduced IC system has no functionality\n\n I do not assume that, simply that the reduced system does not have the functionality of the system.\n \n \nit does not follow that the components have no function. Thus these structures are prone to selection pressures.\n\n Correct, note that the selective pressure cannot be towards the final system.\n \n Repeatedly the understanding of my opponents is shown to be sufficient to see what I am saying yet you seem to blocking it out of your mind why?\n \n \nIt seems that your argument is that without natural selection driving the formation of the IC system from pre-existing components, the probability of the system being built from those otherwise non-interacting components is very small.\n\n Exactly\n \nBut so is hitting the Powerball jackpot, and there are only two per week. See law of large numbers.\n\n Calling upon probability to accomplish advancement in evolution is the equivalent of me citing genesis.\n \n The probabilities of IC forming mutations are almost certainly a thousand orders of magnitude less likely than anything that has actually happened.\n \n Take even the most simple example of IC, identify all proteins required (not including ones that are used unmodified from existing systems), count the number of amino acids total consider how likely it is that that many base pairs would mutate at the same time in the correct order in the correct place on the gene.\n \n There is a good reason \"evolutionary\" biologist don't ever publish those kinds of figures.\n \n If you want to believe that such mutations did occur I will not argue with you, one cannot argue with faith. I am concerned with the theory of evolution whose core and base is the mechanism by which random mutation accumulates benefit over a long time, not how random mutation forms a machine in one incredibly lucky shot.\n \n I don't know if you were here for my erosion analogy, but it is clearer now how it is applicable: If massive mutations forming specific novel functionality are part of evolution, than the fact that a mountain could erode into the exact shape of the statue of liberty is part of geology.\n \n Databed pointed out that there is no natural selection in erosion; my point has always been that there is no natural selection in single mutations.\n \n \nEither could be used to refute it if either has any meat to it. Yours doesn't. \n Not all of evolution consists of those two things. Statements like that make me want to stop treating you as someone who is capable of understanding this topic. You claim that we can't prove that evolution is capable of doing this, but even the thought experiment shows that it can. Nevermind that we have the evidence that it has happened.\n\n Interesting, what evidence? Not \"micro-evolution\" which a misnomer for explained natural selection I hope.\n \n Such things are examples of the definitional tricks that are played, in fact post the definition of evolution you are using if you come with any examples.\n \n \nIf I've interpreted this mess of English correctly, then I agree! The issue is that I have conceived of a way that evolution could produce an IC system. (Okay, I wasn't the first person to do this, but still...) You object because it doesn't involve natural selection selecting FOR that system, and you think that this missing characteristic means that evolution can't do it. In reality, it means nothing of the sort.\n\n I have addressed your treatment of evolution as \"what ever the hec happened to make all these life forms, as long as it wasn't ID\" I am not dealing with it.\n \n Evolution does deal with natural selection, it means nothing without it.\n \n \nHey, I agree that scaffolding can take place with mutation of components and without selection FOR a system that doesn't exist. \n\n I should hope you do, changes in genetic code do not happen without mutations ;)\n \nAre you agreeing with me?\n\n I am afraid I am not clear on that, that mutation changes systems? Yes I agree.\n \nAdditionally, it's possible that the system might change function without even a mutation in a coding sequence of any of those components but via a mutation in any targeting system.\n\n It is possible.\n \nSorry, got this from a real book: Biochemistry, Berg, J.M., et al, 5th ed. Freeman. (p 695)\n\n Alright, was the book talking about an observed mutation or an example of how evolution might work?\n \n \nReal world example of conceptual disproof of IC \"hurdle.\" Aren't you paying attention?\n\n It would not, by throwing in a single mutation which forms new functionality you have by passed IC and evolution. Evolution speaks about selection for many mutations resulting in improvement so does IC. You want to talk about events outside of that selection there is no way to reach your position. Do not think I care to try or that it matters to my belief that evolution fails to explain the advancement of life.\n \nI feel safe attacking any idiocy.\n\n Don't think I am so desperate to change your mind that I will endure insults in the process.\n \n \nMy answer is not a single mutation, it is a number of mutations. Either way, though, your assertion is purely false. IC doesn't predict anything. Why would a single mutation difference either support or challenge claims of IC?\n\n Because a single mutation does not deal with natural selection and IC cannot say that is impossible because it deals with natural selection.\n \n If it was not a single mutation then either the function did not exist on the first mutation or it was not IC. (Speaking of the protein in question not the one whose functionality it was replacing)\n \n \nBullspit. You say that you've identified these arguments and refuted them, and then you say,\n\n I meant for most of what you said.\n \nwhich shows that not only have you not refuted it, but you haven't identified it because you don't even understand it.\n\n Correct, I do not see the difference between for  and of, it sounds like a word game to me possibly a red herring.\n \nHaving this discussion without understanding the difference between selection FOR and selection OF is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. A pocketknife. A mini pocketknife.\n\n You are a very bad shot emoticon_xagree\n \nLet's use a very simple model. Suppose that allele A imparts characteristics X and Y upon the possessing organism. Suppose characteristic X presents a favorable selection pressure upon that organism. Characteristic X is selected FOR, meaning that allele A is selected FOR. But because allele A is selected FOR, characteristic Y experiences the same effect of being selected for even though there was no selection for characteristic Y. Characteristic Y has been selected; i.e. there was selection OF Y.\n\n So in essence when you said something that does not exist can be selected of, you were making the argument that even though natural selection was not selecting the elements of an IC system it could have formed it because other parts might have formed it that were being selected for a different purpose.\n \n Well it turns out I did identify and refute this argument after all, that is a \"might\" that is equivalent to the \"might\" of mutation.\n \n \nI've done neither, exactly. Mutation of some sort can still play a part, \n\n It's very odd that you should accuse me of not understanding evolution and then make a statement like that. You implied you read a book on bio-chemistry, did you notice the part where DNA/RNA defines all proteins formed by a cell?\n \n \nbut we don't need the multiple simultaneous mutations that the IC proponent claims are needed.\n\n Why not? Mutation in genetic structure will not take ordered shape except under the influence of selection, do you deny that?\n \n \n1. NS (+RM) isn't the only mechanism of evolution.\n\n No of course not, there is MM (magical mutation).\n \n2. The parts are functioning, just not originally as the new system.\n\n Then why would the genetic material be pushed towards the new system?\n \n \nI agree with what you mean but not with one interpretation of what you have said. NS cannot direct refinement based on the fitness conferred by a nonexistent system, but it can direct refinement (1) based on fitness conferred by an existing system\n\n Yes\n \nand (2) in a way that happens to lead to new function.\n\n Thank you for being clear, that \"happens\" is a probability independent of natural selection and so subject to random mutation, therefore the odds of it happening are roughly similar to pure mutation to form the new system.\n \n If your claim is that every simple system is predefined to lead to more advanced systems that is an argument for ID.\n \n \nI explain this because there is not necessarily no relationship between the two\n\n Who is tangled in English now? :p No there isn't a relationship, my contention is there must be unless one claims chance; chance that there is a mutation to form a system or chance that other components form the system.\n \n \nmeaning that the \"random chance\" here is not very similar to the \"random chance\" of multiple simultaneous mutations or even of a single point mutation in \"just the right spot.\"\n\n Because it's easier for you to imagine components which are not being selected to form a new system happening to form a new system, I don't have that faith.\n \n \nYes, we are. There is a fitness benefit to having these structures that IC proponents argue can't be expected to confer a fitness benefit because the IC system isn't fully built.\n\n I did not argue that, I argued that it isn't a flagellum until it's a flagellum, so how could mutations gradually move towards a flagellum?\n \n Or to look at the inverse, without random chance, how do you explain the reason why we don't see a perfectly refined secretary system instead of a motor system?\n \n \nI agree that his first definition was the least troublesome of the three (for the IC/ID proponents), but that doesn't make it any less flawed. I understand perfectly what his point was/is. The fact that it was (is) flawed is what led to his redefinition. Seriously: even Behe realized that his original definition was insufficient for proving his point.\n\n I have not appealed to behe's authority as a scientist.\n \n \nBut you don't have to.

Of course, Dembski's being an XXXXX doesn't really refute Behe's original idea, but the fact that Dembski felt the need to re-revise Behe's definition might be interpreted as being indicative of a problem.\n\n I don't have to but I will. You of course can interpret it as you want.\n \n \nOf course it's sufficient for you. You can't connect dots.\n\n I can connect dots, just not across the street onto another sheet of paper.\n \nYou say that NS can't favor nonexistent or nonfunctional systems, which is true. You conclude that evolution can't build systems that have intermediate or incomplete forms that are nonfunctional. We provide examples of ways that evolution can do this, and you hand-wave it away.\n\n You provide examples of ways that these things can happen, for it to be evolution you would need to follow the mechanism of evolution.\n \n \nYes, and no. Yes, probability is the core of your argument, meaning that it's an argument from incredulity, as others have already pointed out.\n\n You are using that fallacy incorrectly and I challenged the others to disprove my leaf and brick theory to show you why.\n \nAnd no, anti-probability is not the core of evolution. It's pretty damn dumb to make that argument, too, as if there's no positive evidence for evolution.\n\n Anti-probability is the core of evolution, the entire construct is to explain how probabilities (specifically those of random mutation) are filtered to form new probabilities (survival of beneficial mutations) which increase the organisms ability to survive. Evolution would be meaningless if it was simply \"whatever mutations formed everything we see in life\" it would not attempt to explain it anymore than \"Niagara falls is simply the one in a million chance of a waterfall forming that way\" instead of the geological reasons behind its formation.\n \n \nThis is why many educated people can't take evolution deniers seriously.\n\n That's what they said about anthropomorphic climate change deniers and abolitionist too.\n \nThe sheer abundance of the obtuse character of your argumentation is difficult to stomach.\n\n Then ignore it.\n \nWhere did he do that??

   "I followed every link you provided, except for the first one they talked about natural selection.\n\n The first one (the youtube video) also talks about natural selection - see 0:36. \n \n Why is this a reason to discard the other four links? The others all use a fitness function for their natural selection - the fact that this is not a 'natural' just shows that they are using the principles of natural selection to create their own, artificial selection.\n \n \nThe youtube video has more problems than can be counted not the least of which is that is about a clock.\nSomeone else's strawman, not his.\n \n \nSimply put this algorithm was designed to succeed, note when he called people who thought this ignorant. Insults are usually targeted towards the threat.\nFirstly, 'you're ignorant' is not an insult - it's simply saying that someone has a misunderstanding of the situation, which appears to be the case here.\n Secondly, as the video explains, you're now discussing Creation/abiogenesis, not evolution. An Intelligent Designer could have created the universe with the 'intent to succeed' - this would not change the fact that evolution is a valid theory, simply that the Designer is a lot smarter than all of us - something which I suspect most ID proponents would be willing to agree.\n \n \n1.) Functionality already existed\n Whats that? he didn't start it off as a clock? no but every single permutation told time, or else he could not calculate which one told it the worst. In fact his code doesn't even allow clocks that don't tell time through the evolution matrix.\nAgain, this is not the case. 3:59 (and onwards) says \"we start with a pool of 10,000 completely random clocks. 98% do absolutely nothing... this is exactly what you would expect\". That kinda directly contradicts what you are saying here.\n It's true that, in the described simulation, 2% do start off with some functionality. But that is simply because he used such a large sample size. If he'd only done 100 clocks then it would simply have taken him much much longer to get to that first step of 'functionality' because there would have been mutation, but nothing which provided a like-a-clock advantage - after this point, the rapid transition seen in the simulation would have occurred (4:36) and we would be still on track.\n \n \n2.) Functionality was predefined, note how he had components and random elements but that the randomness never extended beyond scalars.\nAnd evolution has (to our knowledge so far) only dealt with organic molecules. That there are some sort of limits to the simulation does not discredit it. This is also a return, again, to a discussion of Creation/abiogenesis. \n \n \nI will some day create a algorithm of my own to prove to myself one way or the other. It will consist of random base code and the final result will not be predictable by the simplest analysis.\n \n The clock example was somewhat hard to comprehend in relation to evolution, let me identify a program that would show the same result for the same reasons.\n \n A series of 250 numbers are generated called number A, a second number B is generated, number B is copied twice forming two permutations changing one digit for each, the permutation which is less numerically identical to number A is deleted and the other is copied again.\n \n This will continue until number A equals number B, that will not convince me evolution is true, nor does it account for IC.\nI'll give you another example, then; copied from a book, hence the many ... snips and the occasional paraphrase, because I don't want to copy out three pages of text word-for-word. The source is The Science of Discworld (Pratchett, Stewart, Cohen) - please read it through, as it doesn't end as you might expect.\n \n \"Evolutionary pathways do not always direct themselves along pathways that are neatly comprehensible to humans. ... To show how bizarre evolutionary processes can be, even in comparatively simple circumstances, we must not look to animals or plants, but to electronic circuits.\n \n Since 1993 an engineer named Adrian Thompson has been evolving circuits. The basic techniques, known as 'genetic algorithms', is quite widely used in computer science. ... Thompson wondered what would happen if you used the genetic algorithm approach on an electric circuit. Most electronic engineers, thinking about such a project, will quickly realise that it's silly to use genuine circuits; instead you can simulate the circuits... and do the whole job more quickly and more cheaply. Thompson distrusted this line of argument, though: maybe real circuits 'knew' something that a simulation would miss.\n \n He decided on a task - to distinguish between two ... different frequencies, 1 kHz and 10kHz ... a low tone and a high tone. The circuit should accept the tone as input signal, process it in some manner to be determined by it's eventual structure and produce ... any two different steady [output] signals.\n \n It would take forever to built thousands of trial circuits by hand, so he employed a 'field-programmable gate array'. This is a chip that contains a number of very tiny transistorised 'logic cells' whose connections can be changed by loading new instructions into the chip's memory. ... These instructions are analogous to an organism's DNA code, and can be cross-bred. That's what Thompson did. He started with an array of one hundred logic cells and used a computer to randomly generate a population of fifty instruction codes. The computer loaded each set into the array, fed in the two tones, looked at the outputs and tried to find some feature ... to begin with, that feature was anything that didn't look totally random. The 'fittest' individual in the first generation produced a steady five-volt output no matter what tone it heard. The least fit instructions were then deleted, the fit ones were copied and recombined and the process was repeated.\n \n What's interesting about the experiment is ... how the system homed in on a solution, and the remarkable nature of that solution. By the 220th generation, the fittest circuit produced outputs that were pretty much the same as the inputs, two waveforms of different frequencies. The same effect could have been obtained with no circuit at all, just a bare wire!\n \n By the 650th generation, the output for the low tone was steady, but the high tone still produced a variable output signal. It took until generation 2800 for the circuit to give approximately steady, and different signals for the two tones; only by generation 4100 did the odd glitch get ironed out, after which little further evolution occurred. [NB: the final solution was: high tone = 0V output, low tone = steady 5V output]\n \n The strangest thing about the eventual solution was it's structure. No human engineer would have invented it. Indeed, no human engineer would have been able to find a solution with a mere 100 logic cells. The human engineer's solution, though, would have been comprehensible - we would be able to tell a convincing 'story' about why it worked. For example, it would include a 'clock' - a circuit that ticks at a constant rate. That would give you a baseline to compare the other frequencies against. But you can't make a clock with 100 logic cells. The evolutionary system didn't bother with a clock. Instead, it routed the input signal through a series of loops. These presumably generated time-delayed and otherwise processed versions of the signals, which eventually were combined to produce the steady outputs. Presumably. Thompson described how it functioned like this: 'Really, I haven't the faintest idea how it works'.\n \n Amazingly, further study showed that only 32 of it's 100 logic cells were actually needed - the rest could be removed from the circuit without affecting it's behaviour. At first it looked as if five other logic cells could be removed - they were not connected electronically to the rest, nor to the input or output. However, if these were removed, the circuit ceased to work. Presumably these cells reacted to physical properties of the rest of the circuit other than electrical current - magnetic fields, say. Whatever the reason, Thompson's hunch that a real silicon circuit would have more tricks up it's sleeve than a computer simulation turned out to be absolutely right.\n \n The message for basic evolutionary theory is ... important. In effect, it tells us that ... an evolved system may 'work' without it being clear how it does whatever it does. It may not follow any 'design principle'. ... Instead, it can follow ... emergent logic.\"\n \n That would be a situation starting with random base code and with a remarkably unpredictable outcome.",

   "No you couldn't. You clearly don't know what scaffolding is.\n\n Define it.\n \nWrong. It is exactly the latter. Back, again, to my argument. Scaffolding is the removal of features that are no longer necessary for the function of the system in which they are connected. This creates the illusion that parts were added just as they appear, but really the most recent change is not the addition of any one part, but the removal of an unnecessary part. Again, the flagellum has been shown to not comply with any of the definitions of IC. The removal of parts does NOT render it functionless. This can be seen in structures that exist in the very same microbe that Behe used in his example of the IC flagellum. \n\n It does not matter if it renders it functionless, so long as it renders it unable to perform the function in question.\n \n \nFreedom, you have nothing. You are so convinced to validate your religion that you are determined not to accept this theory. Evolution has no holes in it. It is a solid theory with mountains of evidence for it. Face it, your religion has NO evidence just as your brick and leaf example has NO evidence. Your examples of IC have no substance and have already been refuted by evolutionary scientists which lead to Behe abandoning his IC definition for a completely different one which actually made his argument even worse. Get over yourself and your argument for something that you can't even come close to showing one iota of evidence for.\n\n After reading that I am convinced only of one thing, you are giving up.\n \n \nThe first one (the youtube video) also talks about natural selection - see 0:36. \n \n Why is this a reason to discard the other four links? The others all use a fitness function for their natural selection - the fact that this is not a 'natural' just shows that they are using the principles of natural selection to create their own, artificial selection.\n\n I am not disputing natural selection.\n \n \nSomeone else's strawman, not his.\n\n Not mine.\n \nFirstly, 'you're ignorant' is not an insult - it's simply saying that someone has a misunderstanding of the situation, which appears to be the case here.\n Secondly, as the video explains, you're now discussing Creation/abiogenesis, not evolution.

These instructions are analogous to an organism's DNA code, and can be cross-bred. \n\n I have noticed this in many cases, sexual reproduction is included in attempted evolutionary simulations, it is not necessary as a proof of concept. Obviously if evolution is true then there was a great amount of evolution before sexual reproduction.\n \n \nThat's what Thompson did. He started with an array of one hundred logic cells and used a computer to randomly generate a population of fifty instruction codes.

The 'fittest' individual in the first generation produced a steady five-volt output no matter what tone it heard. The least fit instructions were then deleted, the fit ones were copied and recombined and the process was repeated.\n\n In evolution this is the equivalent of initial functionality, the fittest individual produced a steady 5 volts correct?\n \n If the function being selected for is to tell the difference between two frequencies this would not accomplish it.\n \n He must have written code searching for characteristics of order for it to be selected as fittest for it certainly doesn't accomplish it's function of differentiation.\n \n If his program searched only for a circuit that could tell the difference\n \n There are several examples of functionality that is formed from the first mutation in evolution. Evolution explains these.\n \n \nWhat's interesting about the experiment is ... how the system homed in on a solution, and the remarkable nature of that solution. By the 220th generation, the fittest circuit produced outputs that were pretty much the same as the inputs, two waveforms of different frequencies. The same effect could have been obtained with no circuit at all, just a bare wire!\n\n Proving that functionality here is not irreducably complex but most simple. This does not work for biology, many systems appear complex, but that is due to refinement; some systems (IC) are complex and cannot be simplified and perform the same function.\n \n \nBy the 650th generation, the output for the low tone was steady, but the high tone still produced a variable output signal. It took until generation 2800 for the circuit to give approximately steady, and different signals for the two tones; only by generation 4100 did the odd glitch get ironed out, after which little further evolution occurred.

If there is an unbroken chain of such happenings I would consider it evidence for ID.\n \n It would mean that there is a definite chain of coninsiding functionality not guided by natural selection but by their own properties, by the nature of carbon based life.\n \n What are you trying to prove here?

You say, \"that is highly unlikely, therefore, this\" or, more specifically, \"I cannot imagine how this evolved by shear chance and natural selection alone, thus violating my faith, therefore, it didn't evolve AND it was created instead.\"\n\n Strawman \n \n \nAn evolutionist says, \"I have no reason not to believe what this evidence is obviously telling me, therefore evolution is true.\" Or perhaps a rational creationist says, \"I did not realize the evidence was THIS complete. I was always told it was full of gaps and fallacies, but on the contrary, this is obviously telling me evolution really happens and this old book I was taught was magical from a very young age is simply what it looks like: an old book.\"\n\n I have always tried to take what an opponent says seriously, but considering the thoughtful nature of your previous posts, I am quite sure that this was written in a state of emotional instability. I really think the only appropriate response would be laughter, I do not feel amused.\n \n I repeat my claim that I have won, the sure sign is when the opponents stop arguing and starts attacking.\n \n \nQuite correct.

You will not convince me nor anyone who does not already believe it that I have evaded questions or the substance of the debate.\n \n \nand you totally ignore the point that such structures at the bacteria flagellum were pre-existing for other structures and function. \n\n I have not ignored I have ceded; you have pretended that such a fact matters to my argument.\n \n \nYou also did not respond to any of the peer reviewed scientific articles. Gasp..I am so not surprised you ignore evidence. That would be just terrible \n for your world view, so you ignore it.\n\n At least ignorance (and I am not admitting to it) would be better than this mindless attack you are carrying out.\n \n If what you linked to is a peer reviewed paper, then I really must chastise the peers.\n \n For one thing it is a scientist responsibility to understand the terms they use\n \n \"The evolutionary events linking flagella and T3SSs are not clear, but the homology between them is a devastating blow to the claim of irreducible complexity. This requires that a partial flagellum should be of no use whatsoever - but clearly it is\"\n IC does not require that a partial flagellum should be of no use whatsoever, just not use as a flagellum. So this is an example of a Srawman (assuming they knew what they were talking about)\n \n Second by referencing homology as evidence they are clearly attempting to link IC with the denial of obvious facts... some what like you.\n \n Recall what I said early in this thread, all evidence put forth by evolution consists of life being similar to life.... homology.\n \n \"Again, homology is the key. By scouring a large number of bacterial genomes looking for genes that encode flagellar proteins, you can see which genes are related and the nature of their connection. It is rather like compiling a family history using DNA samples from its living members.\"\n \n The point I have been making is that this does not change the nature of IC, the evolution of either system can be explained once that system begins to function but how can natural selection go from one to the other when it's not being selected for?\n \n Do you think they know?\n \n How does scaffolding help if the more complex item came first?\n \"Most researchers think the best options are flagellum-first or parallel evolution. One fact in favour of the flagellum-first view is that bacteria would have needed propulsion before they needed T3SSs, which are used to attack cells that evolved later than bacteria. Also, flagella are found in a more diverse range of bacterial species than T3SSs. \"The most parsimonious explanation is that the T3SS arose later,\" says biochemist Howard Ochman at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\"\n \n I have repeated several times that it is pure chance not selection that must give rise to new functionality, what does your peer reviewed paper say?\n \n \"This is an opportunity for some serious evolutionary innovation: the \"redundant\" duplicate escapes the selection pressure acting on the original gene and is free to accumulate new mutations and will sometimes, by pure chance, evolve useful new functions.\"\n \"Taken together, this abundance of homology provides incontrovertible evidence that bacterial flagella are cobbled together from recycled components of other systems - and vice versa - through gene duplication and diversification. In other words, they evolved.\"\n This is their argument why have you not taken it up?\n \n Or is it too obvious that this does nothing against IC and my arguments?\n \n \nHow about backing up your claims with some sources, and actually respond to the evidence provided.\n\n I do not disputed the evidence provided, as it has been so far merely the analysis.\n Finnaly I have pointed to no facts that have been contended so I do not need to point to a source.\n \n Would that be too much to ask (rhetorical question, I know).\n\n No",

   "Science can show some of the laws of physics and can harness those laws for use in technology.\n Even Newtonian physics allows for the possibility of a black hole .\n Current physics predict that the universe was once a singularity.\n All of the above can be calculated through observation and mathematics.\n \n None of the above can answer the question of ID.\n Science does not need the possibility of ID to progress.\n \n ID is an opinion elevated by the holders of that opinion to a philosophy.\n \n Believers in God have no doubt that there is intelligent design.Athiests have no doubt there was not ID and scientists care not one way or another until the question effects science.\n Debating ID is for fun not for profit.\n\n Most true, I just came in here to get some argument points so I can debate about something I actually care about :)\n \n Not to imply I am not disturbed by the perpetuation of ignorance I have observed.\n \nThat is correct. You basically are admitting right there and then that \"ID\" is not science. Philosophical musings where the premise is ultimately not testable is not science.\n\n I did not have any premises that were not observable, if you noted.\n \nI am an atheist and I don&#8217;t rule out the possibility that a creator might exist.\n\n Then you are not an atheist\n \nWe have come to the conclusion that evolutions is true based on the fact it always agrees with experimental and observed data. Here is an experiment:\n\n Only observed data, no experimental data.\n \n \nHypothesis: the earliest organisms were living in water. This can be seen by dating the fossil layers in which they are found and comparing their structure to today's creatures of the sea. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the first emergence of legs would be found in layers above that of the earliest aquatic organisms. Take it further, the emergence of wings would be found above the earliest land walkers. What do you know, hypothesis is verified. One point for evolution. \n\n One point for common descent.\n \nA better experiment can be performed when you look into ERV mapping, especially in primates and hominids. You come up with a hypothesis, knowing from fossil records that humans probably evolved from a common ancestor as monkeys, that you should find ERV's matched in the two that aren't found in any other animals (except for those who also evolved from the common ancestor of course). You should also hypothesize that there won't be any ERVs that humans and dogs have, but monkeys do not (sometimes you do see deletions, but this is obvious based on the surrounding DNA.) Both assumptions are verified no matter where you look. Another point for evolution.\n\n Another point for common descent.\n \nID cannot make such predictions. It is more philosophy (really religion, but I will steer away from that). It can only be assumed true based on what a person chooses to believe, but never on data or experiment.\n\n I am not interested in what ID would predict.\n \nI never claimed to be either. You are blind to reality because you choose to believe something simply because you were told it is true at a very young and impressionable age. If I said, \"Why do you believe in your faith?\", what would you think? Probably one of the following - \n\n You summed it up perfectly, for yourself as well.[*]Because so many people can't be wrong.[*]The scientific community is always right and anything that opposes the scientific community is wrong.[*]Because history supports common descent, therefore any theory which predicts common descent must be true.[*]I don't want to risk not being atheistic\n \nBecause I know its true\n\n For you it would be \"Because I want it to be true\", this is evidenced by the fact that you consider the burden of proof on me, it is for me to disprove evolution and since I can only say that it is extremely unlikely I have nothing....

I have usually heard the term \"atheist\" in the context of those who claim with certainty that the supernatural does not exist. However, after having looked it up on Wikipedia, it seems that the broader definition also includes those who do not claim certainty. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism :\n \nPhilosophers such as Antony Flew,[33] Michael Martin,[25] and William L. Rowe[34] have contrasted strong (positive) atheism with weak (negative) atheism. Strong atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Weak atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. \n ...\n Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as weak atheists.\n\n \n \n Given that broader definition, I would agree that you are not necessarily being contradictory by calling yourself an agnostic atheist.",

   "Let me ask you a question my friend, what is there to lose?\n\n The truth\n \nIf you seek God and you don't find Him you have lost zero but when you seek and find then you'll never be the same!\n\n I was born into a catholic family and spent 11 years of my childhood searching for God, I found contradiction.\n \n Every single religion has two things in common, contradiction and consequently faith to counter that contradiction.\n \n Christianity is riddled with contradictions at the most basic level.\n \n Why would God not speak to each man directly if he had something to say?\n \nIts only been a year since I met Jesus and I feel that I just started living my life!\n\n You have not met Jesus; you are undergoing a self-reinforcing delusion. That warm fuzzy feeling you call God, it's your mind giving up and you have said as much yourself.\n \n \"There have been those in the past who have been brave enough to let go of control in order to reach for truth.\"\n This is a contradiction; rational faculty is what allows one to reach truth not lack of control.\n \n \"I thought with who I was behind closed doors that there was no way for me to live up to this thing called Christianity but what I found is that I didn't have to.\"\n Because someone would do it for you; you say live up to this thing called Christianity, I hear simply live.\n \n \nI don't understand your question, but explain it to me and I will be more than happy to answer you.\n\n Let's start at the beginning why do you think faith is a virtue?",

The truth of the matter is you seem to be missing some key things yourself on how to make God available to you. I only know this because the Holy Spirit Himself has revealed them to me. You have to be willing to discard all prior beliefs you may have about the Bible and Choose to accept it as truth, Complete truth! God cannot occupy where doubt lives. The righteous shall live by faith the word says and until you humble yourself and realize you need God is when He shows up. I can't interpret my experience for you but I can only tell you that He speaks to me and until you take those steps to make yourself available to Him then the fault is only yours.

   "Originally Posted by Riverarod \n How do you say that the Lord has not met with me when you nothing of which I am talking about? Originally Posted by Freedom\n I do not; I ask why he would not speak to me if he had something to say?\n It is the fact that there is no plausible answer to that question that leads me to the conclusion that he does not (if he exists in the sense being spoken of) communicate to humans.\n There is indeed an answer. And I can almost promise that you have heard it, and just don't like it, therefore you consider it not an answer. Your conclusion is based on a given understanding of the nature of God. We understand the nature and purposes of God differently. If what we believe (and feel that we know,) is true, then God exists, and that purpose of life is a test to see if we can live by faith. This means God will not prove Himself to exist. A belief means that we must first open our minds to the possibility of its reality. Then we experiment with the idea. I submit this as an excellent (and fairly short,) discourse on the subject of experimentation of faith with an open mind: Reference Search: Alma 32:26-40 \n The language used is fairly archaic, but you seem to me intellectual enough that it shouldn't be a problem.\n One must also ask oneself how God may respond. If you are looking for big, shining messages written in the sky, then good luck. This life is based on faith, so it will be something that is possible to disbelieve. A feeling. A strong feeling, but a feeling. If you go with the feeling, you get a stronger reassurance, then stronger still, and so on. \n \n I know, it is very easy to protest, and explain this all away with psychological principles of reinforcement. That's the point. It's all based on faith. If what we believe is true, then if you want to believe it, God reinforces it. If you don't want to, then God does not force you to. \n \n The bottom line is that faith is a choice. \n \n \nWhat does allowed God to speak to you consist of?\n\n According to me, it would be being willing to change your life, even in the most difficult of ways, based on the answer you get. Asking God if He exists, and sincerely, deeply wanting to know. A casual approach rarely gives results. God is not interested in casual followers. You have to work really hard to open the account before He will make a deposit. It's called a \"leap of faith.\" Sincerely giving yourself the possibility that He exists. Fully opening one's mind AND one's heart to the idea.\n \n \nWhy is it not the healthy conscious state of a human being that God would wish to speak to, he created us right?\n Perhaps a Buddhist meditation belt or some South American trance drugs could help?\n Lol, I wouldn't recommend the drugs... Hey, if you like the belt, why not? But srsly, He does speak to the healthy conscious state, when you put yourself into one by realizing how very little we know. We like to think we're pretty smart, but God will not force faith on people who think they know He doesn't exist. He won't try to pour anything into a cup that you have already filled. You must be willing to relearn what you think you know, and admit to yourself that you might be mistaken. \n \n \nTrying hard enough consists of telling yourself something so many times that you form the illusion its happening.\n Yup. But what makes you say it's an illusion? Like I said, if we are right, then God will always leave you some other way to explain it; an out that allows you to disbelieve. It seems to me that He gives ten reasons to believe and one not to. It's up to you which way you go.\n \n Yes, it's easy to say, \"Keep telling yourself that fairy tale if it makes you feel better.\" That's funny though, because that's exactly how we believers feel about your position. I think you will agree when I say that it all boils down to faith, and how badly you want to believe in God. (We just have different opinions about what exactly that means. I say it means you must allow God to convince you. You say it means that you must allow you to convince yourself.)\n \n I have no empirical evidence that God exists. God planned it that way. Yet I submit that you have no empirical evidence that He doesn't. When I say that, I mean empirical. I am not a sophist. Mere talk will not convince me, just as it will not convince you. All I can really say is that I believe in Him. He has taught me to love all people for the spark of divinity that we all carry as children of God. He has taught me that every one is my brother or sister. He has taught me not to judge, because I am so very imperfect that I would not want to be judged. I don't pretend to be perfect, or remotely close. I am not a very good example of a follower of Christ. I make mistakes like anybody else. I just believe that God's and Christ's teachings make bad men good and good men better. I'm somewhere on the road after \"bad man,\" and trying to make it to \"good man.\" Where I am now, who knows. I just know that I make fewer mistakes than I used to. To you, this is probably all just emotional, deluded babble. Sorry if it comes across that way.\n \n Even if somebody were able to prove to me that it was all untrue, (which, because of the metaphysical nature of the topic is just as impossible as proving it untrue,) I would still follow it, because living the way I believe now makes me happier, more at peace than I was before. I believe it. Yet I cannot blame you for not believing it. Religion is, and always will be, a personal choice.",

cause it makes no sense. in simple english, it's saying 'i believe in the understanding of knowledge.'\n\n I did not say of I said in.\n \n In because rationality is a type of epistemological belief.\n \n and that is not what it says in 'simple English'.\n \n epistemology - a branch of philosophy that investigates the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge. \n \n rationality - 1. the state or quality of being rational. \n 2. the possession of reason. \n 3. agreeableness to reason; reasonableness. \n 4. the exercise of reason. \n 5. a reasonable view, practice, etc. \n \n reason, philosophy - \n a. the faculty or power of acquiring intellectual knowledge, either by direct understanding of first principles or by argument. \n b. the power of intelligent and dispassionate thought, or of conduct influenced by such thought. \n \n Believing in rationality in epistemology means:\n \n \n Believing that in the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge; only the exercise of the faculty or power of acquiring intellectual knowledge, either by direct understanding of first principles or by argument /||/ the power of intelligent and dispassionate thought, or of conduct influenced by such thought.\n \n Since science at a fundamental level is based on the fact that true knowledge is logically obtained science is rational.\n \n One must believe that rationality can produce knowledge therefore in order to even consider science as a valid method.\n \n Believing anything is a path or source of knowledge is a philosophical belief of the branch epistemology.\n \n \nhonestly, i fking hate arguing with you. you know so little about science yet you think you know so much and you try to convince everyone that you have all the answers. you also make up random BS that doesnt make any sense, and try to convince us that it actually does make sense.\n\n I agree only to the last.\n \n \nyou apply your own definitions to things even though they are wrong\n\n I do not, I have seen what happens to a debate when debaters use the same word with different definitions in their mind.\n \n It is as close to utter chaos as any communication can get.\n \n I avoid this by stating the definition I am using when I feel there is more than one way to interpret the meaning given the context.\n \n This is not inferior to doing the same minus the clarification.\n \n I do not pull definitions out of the hat unless I am creating a new phrase to represent a new concept.\n \n \nweve all proved that youre wrong in explaining that science is based on belief, yet youre unrelenting.\n\n Yes, I am unrelenting.\n \n When I do relent it happens so quickly that no one notices or cares.\n \n \ntalking to you is never decent. its like talking to someone whos read nothing but 'green eggs and ham' for the last 15 years.\n\n Well I can't say the same about you, I have no idea what you have been reading but I can understand your posts.\n \n \ni dont like arguing with creationists in general, but at least its possible to communicate with ones that make sense. this fartingle dude is a relief.\n\n He is a relief because he fits your thought pattern about who and what you are arguing against.\n \n That you find me hard to understand but not him when he maintains young earth creationism and I do not is solid evidence that a great deal of your interpretation of my posts and others is due to the biases you have established.\n \n You look for patterns in other posters and try to categorize them so you know what you are to say to win a debate.\n \n It works most of the time because most of the opponents you are likely to encounter are doing much the same thing except on a different side.\n \n Once they categorize you and you categorize them you are then free to repeat the same 'party line' that is carried out in a thousand other debates to no avail.\n \n This has been in great evidence by the way on several occasions you responded to me assuming things that I did not say (I will find the examples if you request it).\n \n I don't believe in irrational evolution which makes me a creationist to you and I don't believe in a mystical God so that makes me an evolutionist and an atheist to fartingle.\n \n You have both said things to me that imply a position I do not hold.\n \n You seem to have taken the gloves off at this point but I never put them on. Since you are now on the subject of what one thinks of opponent debaters I will tell you that I think you need to be more concerned with understanding the posts you respond to and less concerned about what you can classify your opponent as.\n \n It has certainly happened to me that I simply cannot understand what someone else has posted, there are a myriad of possible reasons not the least of which is that people often have unspoken (or typed) thoughts that complete the context of a sentence or phrase.\n \n In this case I say something radical like 'I do not understand'.\n \n You have correctly noted that I believe that I know what I'm talking about, I know what science is, I know what I am saying, and most unusually I am certain enough about many things to say it to others without fear.\n \n You can repeat for eternity that I am ignorant of something, but I will simply ignore you; Just as I would expect to be ignored if I asserted you were incapable of thinking at my level so you cannot understand my posts.",

ID proponents have done neither of those, just continuously push the idea of IC in different forms, all of which being disproven almost immediately as soon as they arise. this is another point as to why ID has no scientific validity - it doesnt follow the scientific method.\n \n if you would like to be vigilant for the truth and never surrender to ignorance, then read up on evolution before defending ID. have you read Origin of Species yet? you cant blame me for thinking that youre lying in saying that you are content to never surrender to ignorance. you havent read the main evolution literature, leading me to believe that you havent read any published evolutionary literature at all, yet you defend ID as if it is a valid theory that contends to Darwin's. that is ignorance in a nutshell, freedom. all creationists do the same.\n \n im not saying that ID is not a valid hypothesis, it isnt a valid scientific theory. i told you before that ive read a creationist book before (Darwin's Black Box by Michael Behe, in my naivety thinking it was a pro-evolution book, but i bit my tongue and read it anyways.) and evolution completely kills it.\n \n if i was talking about the scientific method, i would have said 'the scientific method is fundamentally true' which wouldnt make sense. but talking about science as a whole, it does make sense, as ive explained above.",

IC can be disproven by tracing back the evolutionary process. you said yourself that the IC argument is that certain things could not have come about by a process, but as ive shown you, we can trace back the process of the evolution of the eye to more basic forms - thus IC is wrong in saying that the eye did not form by a process.\n \n thank you for asking about the flagellum. the flagellum evolved from something called a bacterial syringe:\n http://cdn.physorg.com/newman/gfx/news/hires/1-howbacteriam.jpg\n this is the one example i gave that is missing 40 of its 50 parts. its missing the hook, tip, junction, filament, and the parts that makes it rotate. it doesnt function the same say as a flagellum does, but the flagellum can be reduced to it. there are also intermediates, like the cilia; the flagellum rotates in a circular patter whereas a cilia moves back and forth. it isnt missing 40 parts, but it is still missing parts of which Behe says are essential to function, yet the cilia and the bacterial syringe are perfectly functional. i suggest researching Ken Miller's explanation of the evolution of the bacterial flagellum.\n \n simplicity does not cause confusion, freedom. we use simplicity to avoid confusion. what Behe did was make tangents. the mouse trap analogy is just silly. i agree, Behe made things complicated in his book, but not for describing things in simple terms.\n \n reptiles and birds would fall into the MHC class 2 with mammals. i was giving examples of both in saying fish and mammals.\n \n if we trace back the evolutionary process of these systems, we can see that they can be broken down into other simpler mechanisms, and that disproves IC which states, as you put it, that evolution could not have caused the development of such complex systems. from what ive seen, the argument is one of two - that either there are no intermediates, like the eyeball which is incorrect, or that if you remove one part, the system is completely non functional like the flagellum which is incorrect. the same goes for both examples; there are intermediates between the flagellum and the bacterial syringe, and if you remove one part of the eye, it is still functional.",

We are not using the same meaning for the phrase belief system, or even the word belief.\n \n 2. You are deliberately playing mind games for some alterior motive.\n \n 3. You haven't a clue what I am saying and are merely contradicting me on the premise that if I think it, it's wrong.\n \n \nyes, i was overjoyous but ashamed because as i said in another thread, people who value science should be ignoring ID. but whatever, you asked.\n\n If you were content with ignoring criticism of irrational evolution you wouldn't have signed up on a political debate forum and proceed to post in threads on the topic.\n \n \ni assume you are referring to Darwin's tree of life, where the lines are straight. we have found that evolution is not a ramp from one species to another, but a staircase with intermediates on each step. the reason is because each step is going to be better at surviving than the previous one. in a ramp illustration, the process would be unstable, but in the way evolution works, a species is maintained for a while before a variation arises and after maybe a couple decades the entire species has developed this feature. also, if Darwin's tree of life were correct, we would see one species branching off into a million different directions, seeing as different variations arise that may all be an advancement.\n\n That point is incorrect.\n \n Continuous or steady 'progress' from one species to another does not imply that new species will be formed along the way and certainly doesn't imply that new species will survive.\n \n \nso to continue with the eye as you asked, this 'complex of proteins on the cell membrane' ie patch of light sensative skin... no need to complicate things for no reason... developed a variation to be concave - thus differentiation between light and dark as well as knowing the general direction of which the light source or shadow is coming from. the edges of the skin folded over the opening of the concave structure giving a very blurry image to form on these light sensative cells. liquid and a rudimentary lens formed inside and provided a much clearer image... the process continues.\n\n Uh maybe we should complicate things for a reason.\n \n A cell membrane is not a patch of skin.\n \n From this post I am sure you are talking about a multicellular life form even though you said: \"a patch of skin on a single celled eukaryotic organism\"\n \n Now, assuming you mean multi-cellular organism you may repeat 'developed a variation' but again since this is the actual process in question it simply isn't helping the way you seem to think it is to repeatedly assert it happened.\n \n \nIC can be disproven by tracing back the evolutionary process. \n\n Except that this action of tracing consists of looking for similarity and telling a story.\n \n Bad form for science to be as valid as the imagination of the scientist.\n \n I could tell you a story about how flukes evolved from nose muscles, the key to these evolutionary stories is making is sound plausible which is a problem because there is no standard for actual truth in the matter because the proposed explanation does not apply and cannot be checked against the proposed occurrence.\n \nyou said yourself that the IC argument is that certain things could not have come about by a process, but as ive shown you, we can trace back the process of the evolution of the eye to more basic forms - thus IC is wrong in saying that the eye did not form by a process.\n\n No you can identify more basic forms, that does not mean you identified a process it means your mind is conjecting that some occurrence must have happened.\n \n Please don't feel offended because this is quite normal. This is in fact exactly why so many evolutionist have thought I was in contradiction accepting common descent without accepting irrational evolution.\n \n Common descent says that creatures came from common ancestors, life has advanced so then I must accept that something is causing life to advance over generations.\n \n Yes I do, that does not specify what I must accept though, you are basically pointing out 'common descent' for functions and conjecting that some process must have happened.\n \n \nthank you for asking about the flagellum. the flagellum evolved from something called a bacterial syringe:\n\n Ah, here is the good stuff.\n \n Another evolutionist (I don't remember who but will look it up) tried to use the secretory system as a proposed precursor as well, as evidence he posted a link to an article discussing the similarities between them.\n \n The most interesting thing after reading that article, however; was not the similarities but the fact that the article had good reason to think that the secretory system was a decomposition of the flagellum, i.e. the secratory system evolved from the flagellum.\n \n I suspect this circular descendancy comes from that fact that similarity ~~ descent connection but that does not specify the direction so often 'scientist' simply choose which ever happens to be more convenient for their paper.\n \n \nthis is the one example i gave that is missing 40 of its 50 parts. its missing the hook, tip, junction, filament, and the parts that makes it rotate. it doesnt function the same say as a flagellum does\n\n If it does not function \"the same say as a flagellum\".\n \n It is not a flaggelum.\n \n You may now see the relevance of my opposition to the notion that every biological system is merely a permutation of some other system.\n \n On that premise you will be hard pressed to understand IC because you will only see one actual system in life, this blurring is objectively flawed.\n \n \nbut the flagellum can be reduced to it. there are also intermediates, like the cilia; the flagellum rotates in a circular patter whereas a cilia moves back and forth. it isnt missing 40 parts, but it is still missing parts of which Behe says are essential to function, yet the cilia and the bacterial syringe are perfectly functional. i suggest researching Ken Miller's explanation of the evolution of the bacterial flagellum.\n\n I have, the video you linked to surmised ken miller's argument precisely I think.\n \n Are you suggesting the cilia has any connection with a flagellum besides they do the same thing for the cell?\n \n \nsimplicity does not cause confusion, freedom. we use simplicity to avoid confusion.\n\n I am not suggesting that one attempts to make things complicated but trying to simplify something beyond the level made possible by the number and the meaning of the terms will omit information and necessarily cause confusion.\n \n \nif we trace back the evolutionary process of these systems, we can see that they can be broken down into other simpler mechanisms, and that disproves IC which states\n\n It does not.\n \n Again I have gone through these arguments before on this very forum, since you do not wish to read what I have argued perhaps I should give you a primer.\n \n ON TYPES OF SYSTEMS:\n I concluded all systems in biology are either IC or HIC\n \n HIC = hybrid irreducibly complex, meaning as system which contains both necessary parts and unnecessary but merely helpful parts.\n \n HIC is a favorite escape for arguing against IC, examples of HIC are given in which the necessary component becomes necessary, it then becomes IC.\n \n It is then asserted that since an HIC system can be converted to an IC system and IC system is not IC.\n \n The blade cuts both ways though, an IC system may be converted to an HIC system and every system has an IC core which means that all novel function is IC.\n \n ON INTERMEDIATES:\n I made detailed arguments from many directions on the invalidity of association any function with a specific selection pressure.\n \n This is the mistake that ken miller made in the video you posted for me, He used Behe's definition of IC which has some terms implied that should not be.\n \n Most important of these being when he says 'function' he does not mean any function he means the function of the said system.\n \n The ability to decompose a system into systems with different function does not mean the system was not IC because you in fact are not able to remove and of the parts and retain the function, merely a function.\n \n Further the ability to compose a system into simpler systems with the same function does not mean the system was never IC, it means it is HIC now.\n \n ON GUIDED MUTATION:\n The tool previously mentioned is a formula for identifying the concept IC is talking about.\n \n I do not wish to restate it's definition if you are not interested.\n \n I can summarize what it does, it returns a boolean value which is an absolute measure of whether a genetic change is produced by evolution or pure chance.\n \n true = guided = the result of natural selection + random mutation = rational evolution.\n \n false = unguided = luck = irrational evolutions production of novelty\n \n Using this function one can define IC in another way:\n \n An IC system is one which returns false when measuring from any previously existing genetic code to the systems minimal functional form (IC core).\n \n Since nearly axiomatic that all systems have an IC core the analysis seems silly to take to see if an IC core is IC but it will still return the correct value, it is much more useful to see if a proposed IC system is just IC or HIC.\n \n It's primary purpose however is it's extreme convenience at defining the difference between creating an IC system (novel system) and improving an existing one.\n \n At the risk of sounding arrogant Behe's book 'the edge of evolution' could be reduced to two pages of explaining this tool and would stand some improvement for the lack of puzzle fitting one would have to do.\n \n \n from what ive seen, the argument is one of two - that either there are no intermediates, like the eyeball which is incorrect, or that if you remove one part, the system is completely non functional like the flagellum which is incorrect. the same goes for both examples; there are intermediates between the flagellum and the bacterial syringe, and if you remove one part of the eye, it is still functional.\n\n No intermediates and 'you can't remove a part without removing the function' are equivalent.\n \n The eye is a system of compound IC improvements, as opposed to the flagellum which as far as I can tell is actually IC. (or very slightly HIC).",

This is in fact exactly why so many evolutionist have thought I was in contradiction accepting common descent without accepting irrational evolution.\n \n Common descent says that creatures came from common ancestors, life has advanced so then I must accept that something is causing life to advance over generations.\n \n Yes I do, that does not specify what I must accept though, you are basically pointing out 'common descent' for organisms and conjecting that some process must have happened.\n \n \n Ah, here is the good stuff.\n \n Another evolutionist (I don't remember who but will look it up) tried to use the secretory system as a proposed precursor as well, as evidence he posted a link to an article discussing the similarities between them.\n \n The most interesting thing after reading that article, however; was no the similarities but the fact that the article had good reason to think that the secretory system was a decomposition of the flagellum, i.e. the secratory system evolved from the flagellum.\n \n I suspect this circular descendancy comes from that fact that similarity ~~ descent connection but that does not specify the direction so often 'scientist' simply choose which ever happens to be more convenient for their paper.\n \n \n If it does not function \"the same say as a flagellum\".\n \n It is not a flaggelum.\n \n You may now see the relevance of my opposition to the notion that every biological system is merely a permutation of some other system.\n \n On that premise you will be hard pressed to understand IC because you will only see one actual system in life, this blurring is objectively flawed.\n \n \n I have, the video you linked to surmised ken miller's argument precisely I think.\n \n Are you suggesting the cilia has any connection with a flagellum besides they do the same thing for the cell?\n \n \n I am not suggesting that one attempts to make things complicated but trying to simplify something beyond the level made possible by the number and the meaning of the terms will omit information and necessarily cause confusion.\n \n \n It does not.\n \n Again I have gone through these arguments before on this very forum, since you do not wish to read what I have argued perhaps I should give you a primer.\n \n ON TYPES OF SYSTEMS:\n I concluded all systems in biology are either IC or HIC\n \n HIC = hybrid irreducibly complex, meaning as system which contains both necessary parts and unnecessary but merely helpful parts.\n \n HIC is a favorite escape for arguing against IC, examples of HIC are given in which the necessary component becomes necessary, it then becomes IC.\n \n It is then asserted that since an HIC system can be converted to an IC system and IC system is not IC.\n \n The blade cuts both ways though, an IC system may be converted to an HIC system and every system has an IC core which means that all novel function is IC.\n \n ON INTERMEDIATES:\n I made detailed arguments from many directions on the invalidity of association any function with a specific selection pressure.\n \n This is the mistake that ken miller made in the video you posted for me, He used Behe's definition of IC which has some terms implied that should not be.\n \n Most important of these being when he says 'function' he does not mean any function he means the function of the said system.\n \n The ability to decompose a system into systems with different function does not mean the system was not IC because you in fact are not able to remove and of the parts and retain the function, merely a function.\n \n Further the ability to compose a system into simpler systems with the same function does not mean the system was never IC, it means it is HIC now.\n \n ON GUIDED MUTATION:\n The tool previously mentioned is a formula for identifying the concept IC is talking about.\n \n I do not wish to restate it's definition if you are not interested.\n \n I can summarize what it does, it returns a boolean value which is an absolute measure of whether a genetic change is produced by evolution or pure chance.\n \n true = guided = the result of natural selection + random mutation = rational evolution.\n \n false = unguided = luck = irrational evolutions production of novelty\n \n Using this function one can define IC in another way:\n \n An IC system is one which returns false when measuring from any previously existing genetic code to the systems minimal functional form (IC core).\n \n Since nearly axiomatic that all systems have an IC core the analysis seems silly to take to see if an IC core is IC but it will still return the correct value, it is much more useful to see if a proposed IC system is just IC or HIC.\n \n It's primary purpose however is it's extreme convenience at defining the difference between creating an IC system (novel system) and improving an existing one.\n \n At the risk of sounding arrogant Behe's book 'the edge of evolution' could be reduced to two pages of explaining this tool and would stand some improvement for the lack of puzzle fitting one would have to do.\n \n \n No intermediates and 'you can't remove a part without removing the function' are equivalent.\n \n The eye is a system of compound IC improvements, as opposed to the flagellum which as far as I can tell is actually IC. (or very slightly HIC).\n\n \n yea. see you dont quite understand how evolution works still. first of all, evolution is far from constant and gradual. we can see some organisms evolve in our life span whereas some organisms can stay unchanged for thousands of years. evolution is very much time based, and whether a variation comes about or not in an organism is dependant on a number of variables - which could lead to evolving really quickly or very slowly. like i said previously, it could take mere decades for a species to fully develop an upgraded feature, so Darwin's original tree of life is wrong. in the one we acknowledge now, there are much more horizontal and vertical lines, and of course certain variations will not survive, that's obvious when were talking about natural selection.\n \n i think your main argument is that a feature with one purpose cannot evolve from a feature with a different purpose. this cannot be a better example of how little you know about evolution. it is very easy to draw the evolution of the hands and arms from chimpanzee to human; a chimp will use its hands and arms to aide it in walking, whereas we use our arms and hands universally, but certainly not for walking. take the feet of the chimp and compare it to that of a human; again very easy to draw similarities, but chimps use their feet for climbing trees and hanging - even using them in the same way they use their hands. we do not - we have a different purpose for our feet.\n \n those are extremely easy examples which show that you are infact wrong in saying that one feature cannot evolve from a similar feature with a different purpose. ive explained to you already one possible way of how the stomach could have developed - through the esophogus, which has a very different function than the stomach.\n \n even the evolution from fin to limb is very well documented; one is used for swimming, one is used for walking. i read somewhere that creationists love to view features as something designed with a purpose in mind. this is not how evolutionists think. if a feature is good at doing something, it will use that feature for that purpose and therefore develop it further. if we find that our hands are not so good for walking, we wont use them for walking anymore.\n \n the bacterial syringe, although it does not have the same function as a flagellum, thus it is not a flagellum as i did not claim, IS a simpler version of the flagellum. lets look at the specifics of both. both the flagellum and the syringe have rings (M,S,C,P, and L rings). the syringe uses these rings to inject host cells with a virus whereas the flagellum uses its rings as a motor. again, the features have not been designed with a purpose in mind, they use the same features for two different purposes.\n \n about this eyespot on the skin (or membrane if you prefer), i gave the example of the euglena bacterium which is a single celled eukaryotic organism with an eyespot on it's membrane:\n http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/Biology/PGclass/donna/2euglena.JPG\n i wont dispute you when you say that multi-celled organisms can have such eyespots, they do; but single celled organisms can have similar eyespots.\n \n why the hell arent we allowed to trace back the evolution of a feature to simpler features and use that as evidence of the evolutionary process? thats exactly the kind of thing we WOULD use as evidence in any process in which time is involved. evolution is heavily based on time, so why cant we use time to explain it happening?\n \n also, you will never hear any evolutionist talk about 'luck' as you have described them doing when outlining irrational evolution. from what you say about rational evolution (minus the guided part) is what every evolutionist thinks. so irrational evolution is...well, irrational. you can just use 'evolution' from now on. no more strawmen, please. i will ignore any response to this.\n \n we can argue about the differences between no intermediates and removing a part of a function, but that would be off topic.\n \n ive already explained to you how the eye could have evolved - and we can look at simpler forms of it (this time with similar functions) in other organisms to get an idea of the process; ie the retina evolved first via the eyespot, cornea second etc. ive also explained to you that the flagellum is not irriducibly complex, seeing as we can reduce it to other, simpler forms to get an idea of how it evolved, too.",

I attacked the implications you claimed that fact had.\n\n \n ill start with reasons for your ignorance. saying that a feature cannot come about from a similar feature with a different purpose is simply incorrect. almost all of the features in biological systems are an evolved version of a different feature with a different function at some point or another. evolution 101 will tell you this. another thing evolution 101 can tell you is the process in which evolution works - natural selection. ill get back to that.\n \n i apologize for the confusion, i said 'certain eukaryotic flagellum'... but then started talking about the syringe missing 40 of 50 parts, but you thought i still meant a flagellum. the argument that the flagellum and syringe use the same set of rings to perform two completely different functions indicates that the syringe is a rudimentary flagellum that performs a different task. so, the flagellum could have easily evolved from the syringe, instead of providing a tool for injection of a virus, providing a mode of efficient transportation. one cell could carry many syringes on it's membrane, but if just one were to evolve into a simple cilia or flagellum, the result would be very very harmful to the host cell. selection pressure would encourage the syringe to evolve into a mechanism for movement, which, with it's rings are capable of doing. \n \n like i said, multi-cellular organisms can employ the same type of eyespot that single cellular organisms can, and with multi-celled organisms, the eyespot can become concave, but not so with single-celled.\n \n i think the euglena uses chemical reactions in its cytoplasm to provide communication between eyespot and nucleus, all of it's organelles do. its such a simple mechanism that it doesnt need an optic nerve like in a more advanced eye.\n \n it most likely knows to swim where it is light, i assume. do you mean using its energy at night time and storing it when its daytime?\n \n decendency connections? what more do you need to outline the evolutionary process? by tracing back a feature to earlier evolutionary stages we can see that selection can advance a feature - not necessarily with the same function, but advance it nonetheless. most people think of selection as predator-prey relationships, but selection doesnt necessarily mean just that. for example, lets say an organism has a basic concave eye, but no real predators. it's still able to find food better than it's cousins who have a simple eyespot.\n \n if you mean that we have intermediates but not enough of them, we should have a smooth transition from one to the other, that is incorrect. evolution is not smooth or gradual or constant.\n \n similarly, not all organisms are in the same stage of development. for example, humans are just as modern as a gobbie, but a gobbie is most likely in a much early evolutionary stage. a link between tracing and evolution is this; that comparing an organism's feature that is in an early stage of development to a different organism's feature, we can see a general progression from more basic forms (early in evolutionary stage) to a more advanced form (late in evolutionary stage) which hints to us that a process of evolution must have taken place in the later, more advanced forms of that feature. the eye is a great example; we can see the nautilis' eye which is in its earlier stages and quite basic compared to the eye of an octopus, and since the two organisms are very similar, we can conclude that the eye of the octopus evolved from a form very similar to that of the more basic nautilis eye. both nautilis and octopus are part of a classificiation of animals called mollusks, and the mollusks are interesting because within that class contains every stage of eye development. snail will have a more basic eye than the nautilis for example, so it can be concluded that the nautilis' eye developed from the more basic and thus earlier in it's developmental stage, snail eye.",

   "saying that a feature cannot come about from a similar feature with a different purpose is simply incorrect.\n\n I did not say that.\n \n \nalmost all of the features in biological systems are an evolved version of a different feature with a different function at some point or another.\n\n That is an assertion.\n \n \nthe argument that the flagellum and syringe use the same set of rings to perform two completely different functions indicates that the syringe is a rudimentary flagellum that performs a different task.\n\n It is not a rudimentary flagellum, to be flagellum it would have to fit the definition of flagellum.\n \n \nso, the flagellum could have easily evolved from the syringe\n\n That is an assertion.\n \n \ninstead of providing a tool for injection of a virus, providing a mode of efficient transportation. one cell could carry many syringes on it's membrane, but if just one were to evolve into a simple cilia or flagellum, the result would be very very harmful to the host cell. selection pressure would encourage the syringe to evolve into a mechanism for movement, which, with it's rings are capable of doing. \n\n Wait why would a flagellum be harmful to a cell?\n \n \nit most likely knows to swim where it is light, i assume. do you mean using its energy at night time and storing it when its daytime?\n\n I would suspect it's more simple than that, like 'swim when you don't detect light'.\n \n \ndecendency connections? what more do you need to outline the evolutionary process?\n\n A process, not proposed results.\n \n \nby tracing back a feature to earlier evolutionary stages we can see that selection can advance a feature - not necessarily with the same function, but advance it nonetheless.\n\n how?\n \n Remember I predicted that the answer is going to be along the lines of 'well it must have happened'\n \n \nmost people think of selection as predator-prey relationships, but selection doesnt necessarily mean just that. for example, lets say an organism has a basic concave eye, but no real predators. it's still able to find food better than it's cousins who have a simple eyespot.\n\n I do not think like most people.\n \n \nif you mean that we have intermediates but not enough of them, we should have a smooth transition from one to the other, that is incorrect. evolution is not smooth or gradual or constant.\n\n \n The number of 'intermediates' must equal or be greater than the number of selection events.\n \n The span between selection events is unguided by definition, therefore if any one of these spans is practically impossible (due to the odds of spontaneous generation) the entire formation is practically impossible.\n \n The actual minimum size for this span to be so is insanely small for most populations, 5, 6 base pairs.\n \n The is in direct contrast to full guidance, i.e. every mutation was selected for which means many many intermediates.\n \n Smooth change implies constant guidance.\n \n I am not saying we 'should' have more or less than anything.\n \n I am pointing out the process of evolution can never produce any genetic change that evaluates false on the guided mutation test.\n \n What we are calling intermediates here are genetic sequences that would cause that test to evaluate true if they are on the interval.",

PCBs bind poorly to the mutated receptors, apparently blunting the chemicals' effects.\n \n The adaptation occurs almost universally in Hudson River tomcod, but crops up only infrequently in two other tomcod populations-in Connecticut's Niantic River and the Shinnecock Bay at Long Island's south shore. The fact that it exists at all in those nearby populations leads the researchers to believe the Hudson Bay tomcod had the mutation at least to a low degree before the PCB onslaught. In a classic case of natural selection, the fish with the mutated genes survived.\"\n \n So we actually have all three common themes, the mutation was small, it was a deletion, and the adaptation already existed.\n \n How many of these will it take to convince me that complex systems can be generated by variation plus natural selection?\n \n No amount will be sufficient because they don't show that happening.

   "i think the problem with the IC argument, at its core is that the supporters are thinking of nature as being design oriented, an architectural work, or an engineer's play-thing. it isnt. all biological systems can potentially be good at doing a lot of functions, and thats an indication that they either a) can be universal and do a lot of things well, b) used to be good at one function, but no longer - its better at doing something else now, c) is a near perfect example of one specific function, but does nothing else very well (ie. flagellum), or d) have become vestigial.\n \n man-made objects were designed with function in mind - biological systems were not, and that is very evident when observing not what a system can do, but how it does it. a flagellum (there are many different kinds, the bacterial one is not the only one) is extremely good at locomotion, however something like parts of our digestive system are extremely bad at digesting food (eating tube is directly connected to breathing tube and sinuses, causing extreme death by choking). another example would be our hands. they were not \"designed\" to assist in walking, but they can be used as such. this would be an example of b) above, in evolutionary terms.\n \n so, a Behe analogy would be that a mouse trap is very good at catching mice, but it can also squash grapes to make grape juice. now, if you change one part of a mouse trap at a time, you may be able to find a gradual increase in the grape-squashing function. eventually, after slowly working with the mouse trap, you can get to point a), which is a good medium between catching mice and squashing grapes. some more tweeks and youll get to position b), where it kinda sucks at catching mice, but is really good at the grape thing. and after many years of tinkering with the original \"design\" of the mouse trap, you have a fully functioning grape-squasher that no longer catches mice. in the natural world, catching mice may have been good at one point, but the environment now demands that one squashes grapes in order to increase reproductive success. luckily for our example, the mouse trap can do that, albiet poorly at first. it is already equipped to do the new task. swap grape-squashing for making noise; being aesthetically pleasing; having a certain smell (obtained by swapping the wooden base for a nice hickory); cutting up folliage; gripping things; even swimming or walking, due to a flat surface and a rotating hinge; our hypothetical organism is already equipped to perform a large number of tasks - it just may need some modifications to become better at a specific one. this is how co-option works.",

Remember: the almost infinite majority of conceivable mappings preserve no homologies whatsoever; you can make no statistical appeal here.\n\n I don't need to, none of my assertions require that they are thrown out merely that no one has any reason why they should.\n \n It is the exact same situation with mutations, I cannot give a reason why a single mutation event could not form a flagellum; I don't need to to say it is unlikely.\n \n I can easily make a statistical appeal here, most sequences by far are non-functional. This not only means it is easy to damage functional sequences but it more importantly indicates large distances between functional sequences in the DNA sequence space.\n \n \nWhat is random about the fact an excellent screwdriver makes an indifferent hammer? Or that an excellent knife makes a passable screwdriver? Or that a sharpened spoon will suffice for a knife - or a hammer for a spoon? These truths are entirely lawful. Indeed I would find it more difficult to think of an example of something with only one conceivable conceptual function.\n\n That is because you are thinking of applications not functions, Observe:\n \n A plane has many functions, it can carry people to both Sweden and detroit. It can bomb or spy.\n \n Or does it?\n \n A plane functions as a flying vehicle.\n \n A true example of multiple functions in a plane would be taxing around on the ground and being therefore a giant car.\n \n Now lets look at your examples. What is random about it? Nothing, these things can be used for multiple functions because what they are is essentially the same, that is equivalent to saying their DNA is the same.\n \n For a screwdriver vs a knife you would tell a blacksmith to make a flat metal object with a handle.\n \n To illustrate why advancement is an objective measurement let's assume we had a screwdriver.\n \n A screwdriver is missing something essential in a knife, a blade. Since this screwdriver is a screwdriver and would be selected based on it's function as a screwdriver why would you expect it to get sharper? What is lawful about such an expectation?\n \n \nI could equally say that it is a matter of comfort for you that you have chosen to believe in the existence of this unlikelihood, and that you hold fast to it despite evidence to the contrary.\n\n Present the evidence.\n \n \nFor a given conceptual function.\n\n For a function.\n \n \nThis is simply not true. Plausible, independently selectable intermediate systems have been presented. You cannot stamp your foot and say you don't think they should exist, or that appealing to them is cheating.\n\n Who says I say they should not exist, but you cannot present them and say \"look they exist so my explaination for why must be correct\".\n \n You consider the fact that no one has disproved the idea that a flagellum could arise by random processes proof that it did so. Such is an appeal to ignorance.\n \n I have only even been interested in disproving that a non-random process (like rational evolution) explains these systems.\n \n \nBy all means, make your case that co-option should be the exception rather than the rule - thus far you have not done so - but even if you do you only demonstrate that the flagellum is just such an exception. Which would in itself be highly significant.\n \n The existence of such paths for the flagellum is more than an assumption. They have been found.\n\n I have made the case, but it was a different case than the one against irrational evolution.\n \n No path for the flagellum has been found in my opinion, if you think it has you can post the genetic differential and force the admission out of me.\n \n \nOn the contrary: under evolution we should expect them to explain the construction of all extant systems, even if that is a tiny subset of all possible systems.\n \n Assuredly, most possible biological systems don't exist. Why does this alone not satisfy your demand that co-option be the exception?\n\n That is merely the application of databeds 'million systems' explaination which proposes it is just inevitable that a mutation forms a function.\n \n It simply does not match reality.\n \n That is an escape from the duty of explaination not an explaination. Further it is an assumption by definition unless you happen to know how many possible biological systems there are.\n \n \nWhy does a knife function as a screwdriver?\n\n Because it is a variant of the same shape, just like a fluke and a leg are variants of the same limb organs and bones.\n \n Why doesn't a car function as a plane?\n \n \nI read a fascinating e-book a while ago in which someone described how, seemingly for all iterative rule-sets above a certain minimum, there existed a minority of starting conditions from which those rules would generate startling complexity.\n\n In case you didn't hear I offered to build a software simulation of evolution testing out my conclusions. I offered to do so if someone who opposed my conclusions worked with me on it so as to be satisfied it is proper.\n \n \nWhat better explanation can there be than inevitability?\n\n Any answer would be speculation.\n \n \nMoreso even than that, I feel.\n \n When you think about it, the ultimate and indeed only possible satiation of 'why' is the understanding of why things could not be otherwise. I do not present co-option as such a solution - there remains whatever deeper principle ingrains it in everything from bacteria to cutlery - but I do not think its existence can be denied.\n\n Yet until those principles are identified they cannot be used as an explaination.",

It could be a vestigial useless piece of junk DNA or the crux of the organism, the only difference is the possibility that function can be increased due to similarity with final is if the current is performing the same function.\n \n Now what you say is true, if selective pressures are strong keeping a sequence a certain way that would stop it's evolution but that is another layer and certainly not why novelty is a problem.\n \n If you insist on invoking co-option for an existing useful function you will have to throw in the random generation of differentiation systems (to build a flagellum one place and a secretory system in another), but compared to the actual fairy dust of the advancement itself that is small change.\n \n \ni suppose what i mean to say - and what i forgot to mention earlier - is that us taking a mouse trap and making a grape squasher out of it would be the opposite of what nature does. we would be creating the grape squasher with a design and a destination in mind; nature does not. an organism possessing a mouse trap is not in trouble once the environment decides catching mice is not necessary anymore, but squashing grapes is to be selected for, because the organism can already squash grapes with it's mouse trap. the feature has already co-opted without any mutations happening at all!\n\n How optimistic!

You have assured me you do not believe co-option to be impossible, merely rare and unlikely. Presumably very rare, although you cannot support this claim. \n\n I can support it by the same token I can deny there is a god, I haven't seen any evidence to make me think they are common.\n \n \nVery well.

If you're right, and opportunities for co-option are so rare that, out of all possible biological systems, only a tiny minority could ever be realised through co-option, the discovery of such a path for the flagellum would be hugely significant, yes? Because if nature didn't depend on co-option for the evolution of its systems, it would be impossibly unlikely that any given system would, purely through chance, present itself as amenable to gradual development.\n\n You misunderstand, co-option is purely through chance until someone of us comes up for a theory why it should be any particular way or in any pattern.\n \n By the nature of DNA mathematically the calculation of the odds for co-option and the odds for a mutation performing the same function are equivalent. Without that fact I could hardly keep arguing.\n \n Since DNA is in a nice linear matrix for us we know that differences between sequences can be measured in a single scalar value. (The odds of which increase exponentially with the size of the difference)\n \n Provided that there is no axiomatic patterns to be expected of co-option it is perfectly legitimate to consider the odds of two systems being similar the inverse of their difference-odds. (the closer they are the more unlikely it is) Now obviously the chances that a mutation would convert one one sequence to another is the difference-odds it self (the farther away they are the more unlikely it is).\n \n Clearly the odds of mutation times the odds of co-option must equal a constant ratio. It is therefore my conclusion (and I have said all this before) that the odds are not variable by the concept of co-option that this is just conceptual shuffling and that necessarily claiming co-option doesn't help the odds in the slightest.\n \n It helps the way you think about it because you aren't considering co-option in the terms of probability but you are doing so for mutations.",

Cars can't gradually evolve into planes - not because acquiring a new function by gradual steps is impossible, as you insist, but because the gradual steps by which it would be possible are being strongly selected against by the aforementioned need to carry humans.\n \n \nSo for reasons which must be admitted are totally irrelevant to flight, which can never be demonstrated to have any relationship except coincidental similarity the car gains all the necessary elements for flight and thereby a novel system is evolved.\n\n \n No; that's a distortion of what I wrote.\n \n I said that the car could evolve to be smaller and lighter. Mass decreasing by the cube, area by the square; it's why mice can survive a fall that would kill us outright, and it's why mice (or something similar) could evolve flight and elephants could not.\n \n \nWhat about this, one car's offspring is an ultra light.\n \n Impossible or just unlikely, and heres the biggie, is that evolution?\n\n \n What's impossible or unlikely about a mammal evolving to be smaller and lighter, and thus becoming susceptible to selection for improved falling, gliding and eventually flying performance?\n \n \nThat does not mean every system is merely variant shapes of each other, as you would have to admit if you looked at some.\n\n \n Not direct variants, certainly. But I can't help remembering my Theory of Computability, and how no computer, physical or electrical, possesses any more utility than a Turing machine, though it may certainly possess less. I suspect the same argument could extend to physical function.\n \n \nSure I can, and I will tell you why.\n \n The category of thing is not arbitrary nor are their functions imagined.\n\n \n All a biological system has to do to be selected is 'aid survival and reproduction'. We can have a stab at understanding how it aids survival and reproduction but we will almost certainly miss some nuance, and our categorisation will therefore be in error. Hence, arbitrary.\n \n \nIt will never be selected on a function that it is not performing, that is not arbitrary it is simple extension of the law of cause and effect projected onto the concept of natural selection.\n\n \n I've never tried to argue otherwise.\n \n \nSure, but since the object is a screwdriver that means a sharper edge is making it a better screwdriver.\n \n If it is now cutting it has changed or added a function has it not, and is it not now being selected based on it's function as a knife?\n\n \n You're so close, but no. In being selected as a screwdriver it inevitably acquires a minor secondary ability to cut - and hammer, and all kinds of other misuses. If these minor abilities prove beneficial, modifications favouring them will be selected - providing the benefit outweighs any coincident loss of 'screwdriver-ness'.\n \n I think it would be very hard indeed to argue that improvement in function ever - let alone usually - leads to the elimination of all potential secondary or tertiary uses. And since that is critical to your hypothesis, you don't seem to have much of a leg to stand on. Or kick a football with. Or press an accelerator pedal. Or trip up a moose.\n \n \nIt is then being selected by the standard of it's function as a hammer which makes it a hammer.\n\n \n This determination to rigidly compartmentalise is... unhelpful. A tool or system can be tugged in many directions, not all of them contradictory. A bat's forearms are primarily wings, but it can also use them to climb. A flying fox's limbs are primarily for climbing, and its skin primarily for keeping its insides in a comfortable configuration, yet these primary functions brought the whole close enough to 'gliding' for selection to favour further modifications in that direction.\n \n \nWhat purpose do these intermediate systems [of the flagellum] serve in the explaination?\n\n \n They counter your assertion that nature could not rely upon the existence of such alternative-function intermediates to give rise to the flagellum. The absurd odds calculated for its spontaneous formation reduce to the chances of organisms possessing one intermediate system encountering an environment in which the next was beneficial.\n \n \nNo guided path can bridge a change in function,\n\n \n There you go again, trying to cut the world up into distinct functions.\n \n Obviously you accept that functionality is analogue, else evolution of any kind would be impossible, yes?\n \n So what on earth makes you think that systems, as a matter of course, can possess an analogue amount of only one 'kind' of functionality? Can you even give a single concrete example of that being the case? Given that your hypothesis depends upon it almost always being the case, for every system, it would seem appropriate to provide some.\n \n \n \nYou misunderstand, co-option is purely through chance until someone of us comes up for a theory why it should be any particular way or in any pattern.\n\n \n We don't know why gravity behaves as it does. Is that 'chance' too?\n \n \nBy the nature of DNA mathematically the calculation of the odds for co-option and the odds for a mutation performing the same function are equivalent. Without that fact I could hardly keep arguing.\n\n \n Then you really ought to stop :) \n \n You have no odds representing the chances of co-option. Whether or not our arbitrarily chosen 'fitness-to-a-function-we-think-we-understand-but-probably-don't' gradients form a mesh is an intrinsic property of gene-space, like the very existence of fitness gradients themselves. Can you calculate the odds of the existence of fitness gradients? Not meaningfully: as I keep pointing out the near-infinite majority of mappings do not preserve homologies; the odds of genes consistently exhibiting fitness gradients by chance approaches zero. Since we see them, clearly they don't exist by chance; clearly there is something lawful at work. Meanwhile, you have neither theory nor evidence to support compartmentalisation according to our arbitrary and probably incomplete assessment of function.",

   "No, you're still missing the point.\n \n You've said that since the majority of DNA sequences are non-functional, functional DNA sequences must be assumed to be widely separated.\n \n But we know this not to be the case. Functional DNA sequences cluster. If that were not the case, no fitness gradients of any kind could exist. Therefore we know gene-space exhibits pattern and continuity. How can you justify your assumption that this continuity is, or should be expected to be, compartmentalised in a way that suits your argument?\n\n Clustered around the same function because we are looking at variations of the same shape.\n \n You seem to have misunderstood my comment about DNA for what of your baseless assertions about sequences I could only assume exist.\n \n I am saying that since the majority of mutations are neutral and negative we know that the systems of life are isolated in the gene space. There are no if ands or buts about it, if they were truly clustered as you hope they are mutations would oft as not fall upon another function or system.\n \n You are asking us to believe that this is inded the case but we simply can't observe it. You are asking us to believe in the most unlikley patterns that could exist, singular strings connecting different functions which are too small to be noticed in all the mutations we have ever observed but real enough for co-option to explain advancement, not only this but these strings connect every known function since it is your replacement for evolutionary theory.\n \n Simply making generalizations about observations is all I have done, it is that wishful thinking above which requires support.\n \n \nThen I cherry pick \"aids survival and reproduction\" as the most generic possible description of any biological structure or system's function, and thus remove any obstacle to co-option.\n\n Lol, nice try but again biology is against you. Many things can aid survival and reproduction. They all do it in various ways though, it is that very reason why selection pressure is always based on the system in quesiton and how it is benefiting the organism. The how is the function not the do.\n \n To illustrate the absurdity of your claim, does a flagellum have co-option with extra cellular nerve ending complexes?\n \n They both aid in survival and reproduction. It of course would be the same sort of magic to say that a flagellum modification generates nerve endings in a non-random manner as the rest but since you walked right into most obvious and extreame case of the fallacy I will let you see what you can do.\n \n \nToo simplistic. Imagine functions A, B and C, and a structure that strongly satisfies the requirements of A and weakly those of B. If satisfying B becomes strongly selected for, the structure can, through improvements to its B function, acquire slight C functionality, which can then in turn be selected for. My earlier example illustrates this: a hammer is no use whatsoever as a screwdriver, but can eventually evolve into one via intermediate steps.\n\n Why would improving B form C functionality?\n \n It is the inability to answer that question with anything more than 'just because' that neccesitates my conclusion that this is no more an explaination for life than a 'just because' in the case of mutation.\n \n \n \nIt isn't; that's the point. Cars can't gradually evolve into planes - not because acquiring a new function by gradual steps is impossible, as you insist\n\n Impossible as a result of a process, not impossible as an unpredictable chance.\n \n \nWhat's impossible or unlikely about a mammal evolving to be smaller and lighter, and thus becoming susceptible to selection for improved falling, gliding and eventually flying performance?\n\n Answer the question please.\n \n \nAll a biological system has to do to be selected is 'aid survival and reproduction'.\n\n Obviously, and just as obviously it needs to in some way do this. That is the function.\n \n \nWe can have a stab at understanding how it aids survival and reproduction but we will almost certainly miss some nuance, and our categorisation will therefore be in error. Hence, arbitrary.\n\n We know many functions, that aside our inability to categorize them all means absolutely nothing to the fact that they must exist to aid in survival and reproduction by definition.\n \n \nYou're so close, but no. In being selected as a screwdriver it inevitably acquires a minor secondary ability to cut - and hammer, and all kinds of other misuses. If these minor abilities prove beneficial, modifications favouring them will be selected - providing the benefit outweighs any coincident loss of 'screwdriver-ness'.\n \n I think it would be very hard indeed to argue that improvement in function ever - let alone usually - leads to the elimination of all potential secondary or tertiary uses. And since that is critical to your hypothesis, you don't seem to have much of a leg to stand on. Or kick a football with. Or press an accelerator pedal. Or trip up a moose.\n\n Why in the world would you think the idea that everything or anything has only one use is a premise to any of my arguments?\n \n \nThis determination to rigidly compartmentalise is... unhelpful. A tool or system can be tugged in many directions, not all of them contradictory. A bat's forearms are primarily wings, but it can also use them to climb. A flying fox's limbs are primarily for climbing, and its skin primarily for keeping its insides in a comfortable configuration, yet these primary functions brought the whole close enough to 'gliding' for selection to favour further modifications in that direction.\n\n It is helpful to a proper analysis, I am glad to see you thinking of it correctly, i.e. as directions which mutations move a system.\n \n \nThey counter your assertion that nature could not rely upon the existence of such alternative-function intermediates to give rise to the flagellum. The absurd odds calculated for its spontaneous formation reduce to the chances of organisms possessing one intermediate system encountering an environment in which the next was beneficial.\n\n Do they?\n \n Let's take a chess board, there is one particular set of peice locations that happens to be desired. From the starting positions it takes 114 moves to reach this position.\n \n A young chess player comes and insists he can do it in 4.\n \n They ask him how, he answers that he will start with a board that only requires four moves.\n \n Then they break the news to him, they aren't going to tell him what the desired peice-locations are, but there are some other peice locations that are helpful although they will not tell him if any of these have a relationship with the desired arangement.\n \n What use are the helpful sets then he asks?\n \n Oh well normally you would have to start from the standard setup, but once you find a helpful set you may start from there in a new round.\n \n Do you think his odds of finding the desired set are any higher? Think about this before you answer, do you know where the helpful sets are compared to the desired one? For all you know they could be farther away than the starting positions.\n \n The point, MY POINT is that you just don't know and so you can't claim to explain the discovery of the desired set as anything but dumb luck, no matter how many helpful sets you set up.\n \n Yes the genetic differential between an intermediate and a proposed novel function could be less, that is a chance which as of right now you can't predict just like it is a chance that a mutation would render that advantage pointless. The source material for either calculation is the same.\n \n \nThere you go again, trying to cut the world up into distinct functions.\n\n Just biology for now :p\n \n \nObviously you accept that functionality is analogue, else evolution of any kind would be impossible, yes?\n \n So what on earth makes you think that systems, as a matter of course, can possess an analogue amount of only one 'kind' of functionality? Can you even give a single concrete example of that being the case? Given that your hypothesis depends upon it almost always being the case, for every system, it would seem appropriate to provide some.\n\n I don't rely on any system only having one function, but I do rely on the fact that any system which has the function may be ruled out from the list of canidates to be used in any explaination of the formation of the function.\n \n I was merely pointing out that trying to posit examples in which co-option is meant to be supported by having a system not change functions but emphazie one or the other, or otherwise modify a function that already exists is self-defeating.\n \n \nWe don't know why gravity behaves as it does. Is that 'chance' too?\n\n Of course not, but no one is claiming to explain where gravity comes from, and if they tried to do so with an appeal to odds then that I would 'cry chance'.\n \n \nYou have no odds representing the chances of co-option. Whether or not our arbitrarily chosen 'fitness-to-a-function-we-think-we-understand-but-probably-don't' gradients form a mesh is an intrinsic property of gene-space, like the very existence of fitness gradients themselves.

Since we see them, clearly they don't exist by chance; clearly there is something lawful at work. Meanwhile, you have neither theory nor evidence to support compartmentalisation according to our arbitrary and probably incomplete assessment of function.\n\n I see, so in the absence of a theory we are too assume these things are not by chance as would be any sane persons first impulse but by unknown laws which escape us but may still be relied upon.\n \n Sounds like another sect who claims to have a scientific explaination for life I know of.",

It could be a vestigial useless piece of junk DNA or the crux of the organism, the only difference is the possibility that function can be increased due to similarity with final is if the current is performing the same function.\n \n Now what you say is true, if selective pressures are strong keeping a sequence a certain way that would stop it's evolution but that is another layer and certainly not why novelty is a problem.\n \n If you insist on invoking co-option for an existing useful function you will have to throw in the random generation of differentiation systems (to build a flagellum one place and a secretory system in another), but compared to the actual fairy dust of the advancement itself that is small change.\n \n \n How optimistic!

   "now youre just being obtuse, not to mention contradictory. my mousetrap is not a co-option, although it changes function, because it already had the potential to perform this function (duh. if it performs a function that it did not previously, that is a co-option. it has nothing to do with what the feature can potentially do previous to the co-option.), whereas the syringe example is also not a co-option, but the fact that it is not only potentially able to perform the new function, but it also does (i thought specifics were not considered - \"As many things as a fast triggered snapping action can be useful for.\" remember? - rotation is rotation. how many things can a rotating secretory system be used for? as many things as a rotating mechanism can be useful for. propulsion is a specific.) makes it somehow different.\n\n Rofl, powered rotation is powered rotation. A pepple falling from a cliff is not a car wheel spinning.\n \n A rotating socket has absolutely no ability to produce propulsion.\n \n \ni would disagree. something is not IC if an evolutionary pathway can be drawn between one thing and another - the basis of the IC argument, afterall is that something performing a function which could not have evolved, as it is too complex. thus, providing an evolutionary pathway would null the basis of the argument. even the fact that it could have evolved in such a way is enough to discount the IC argument, seeing as the argument is an absolute.\n\n The argument allows 'cannot' only as final evaluation of the odds. No one can claim something cannot happen unless they put some sort of laws on what sequences mutation can form (which no one has done).\n \n However what is very clear after the conclusion of the IC analysis is that natural selection is doing about zero in the way of producing novel systems which means you actually have to start considering the odds (You didn't need to before as natural selection filtered uncertainty to inevitability). It is very easy to say therefore if a system is complex enough the odds are practically impossible. It is even easier to say that the total complexity of all life is several orders of magnitude greater than any individual system.\n \n This is fully realized by at least Behe as his second book concentrates entirely on the odds. He wouldn't do that if he thought IC had discarded random formation.",

   "I hope you don't mind if I address points in a different order than they were presented; I think it makes for clearer reading.\n \n \nI see, so in the absence of a theory we are too assume these things are not by chance as would be any sane persons first impulse but by unknown laws which escape us but may still be relied upon.\n \n Sounds like another sect who claims to have a scientific explaination for life I know of.\n\n \n If fitness gradients in gene space were arranged by chance, it would be impossible to locate them via any means other than a brute-force search of gene space.\n \n Since you do not seem to be advocating any kind of infinite universe/multiverse explanation for the existence of life, it follows you are (at least unconsciously) assuming some lawful pattern to their arrangement permitting shortcuts to their discovery.\n \n So, given that we both require some unknown law to arrange gene-space to suit our hypotheses, you may want to reconsider your implication that this implies insanity.\n \n \nI am saying that since the majority of mutations are neutral and negative we know that the systems of life are isolated in the gene space. There are no if ands or buts about it, if they were truly clustered as you hope they are mutations would oft as not fall upon another function or system.\n\n \n I don't know why you think you can change my argument to suit yourself. I surmise that functional genes are sufficiently clustered as to explain the existence of life in its current forms, no more, no less. I neither expect nor require mutations to 'as oft as not' fall upon another function or system.\n \n \nYou are asking us to believe that this is inded the case but we simply can't observe it. You are asking us to believe in the most unlikley patterns that could exist, singular strings connecting different functions which are too small to be noticed in all the mutations we have ever observed\n\n \n Functional gradients are not single strings, and individual mutations are often observed to affect multiple aspects of an organism, proving beyond doubt the reality of co-option. And again, I remind you that to describe something as 'unlikely' you must be able to demonstrate the extent to which the phenomenon is subject to chance. Since postulating a 'chance' arrangement of functional gradients in gene-space is fatal to all hypotheses of non-brute-force exploration, I wish you luck in that :)\n \n \nnot only this but these strings connect every known function since it is your replacement for evolutionary theory.\n\n \n Connect or bring within plausible reach, yes. Nor is this a 'replacement' for evolutionary theory, any more than the supposition that the gene-function mapping preserves homologies 'replaces' evolutionary theory. It is merely a prerequisite; context - just as the details of carbon-based chemistry are part of the context - within which evolution is possible.\n \n \nLol, nice try but again biology is against you.\n\n \n I'm playing by your explicit rules here. You stated that your categorisation of selectable function was not arbitrary, but was the most general possible description of what a biological system achieved. That is, without exception or question: \"Aids survival/reproduction[/i].\"\n \n If you wish to disagree, then you must either show how a system which does not aid survival or reproduction may be consistently selected for, or give a still more generic description of functionality.\n \n \nMany things can aid survival and reproduction. They all do it in various ways though, it is that very reason why selection pressure is always based on the system in quesiton and how it is benefiting the organism. The how is the function not the do.\n\n \n You're starting to trip yourself up. In your discussion with Benedict, you insist that it is not the specific ways in which a system actually helps an organism that define its function, but what it is in capable of, regardless of whether that functionality is leveraged.\n \n Earlier you cherry-picked 'flying vehicle' as the most generic description for a plane, because you have (for some reason) decided that flight constitutes a 'new function' which is not allowed to evolve stepwise (although you have been very quiet on the subject of small ground-based mammals gradually improving their ability to leap and glide through adaptations to their limbs and skin). \n \n But why not 'vehicle'? Vehicles of many kinds can take you all over the world, helping in exactly the same way as planes. Perhaps not to the same degree or with the same level of convenience, but degree doesn't constitute a change in function, right?\n \n \n \nTo illustrate the absurdity of your claim, does a flagellum have co-option with extra cellular nerve ending complexes?\n\n \n Not directly, to my knowledge.\n \n \nThey both aid in survival and reproduction. It of course would be the same sort of magic to say that a flagellum modification generates nerve endings in a non-random manner as the rest but since you walked right into most obvious and extreame case of the fallacy I will let you see what you can do.\n\n \n You recall the screwdriver/knife/spoon/hammer analogy from before? Not all functions need directly support co-option for them to be ultimately linkable.\n \n \nWhy would improving B form C functionality?\n\n \n It is the inability to answer that question with anything more than 'just because' that neccesitates my conclusion that this is no more an explaination for life than a 'just because' in the case of mutation.[/QUOTE]\n \n It's hard to answer that question when it's unclear what, to you, constitutes the 'forming' of C functionality.\n \n For instance, take a mammal evolving smaller and lighter (in the pursuit of some ecological niche) such that its surface area becomes capable of significantly slowing its fall. Does this constitute the formation of new functionality (gliding, the prelude to flight), or would you say that, since the surface area of a creature always provides air resistance, it 'always' possessed that functionality, albeit in a quantity too small and too swamped by other selection factors to itself be selectable?\n \n \nAnswer the question please.\n\n \n My question was my answer. You keep going on about how unlikely this all is, yet you refuse to provide a single example where co-option is impossible - or even unlikely. Thus I ask again: if your objection to co-option is that it's unlikely, how unlikely do you think it is for (say) mammals to evolve smaller in pursuit of an ecological niche, and thus encounter an opportunity to evolve flight?\n \n \nWe know many functions, that aside our inability to categorize them all means absolutely nothing to the fact that they must exist to aid in survival and reproduction by definition.\n\n \n Thank you for validating my choice of 'most generic' function.\n \n \nWhy in the world would you think the idea that everything or anything has only one use is a premise to any of my arguments?\n\n \n Because you keep saying co-option is unlikely. \n \n \nLet's take a chess board, there is one particular set of peice locations that happens to be desired. From the starting positions it takes 114 moves to reach this position.\n \n A young chess player comes and insists he can do it in 4.\n \n They ask him how, he answers that he will start with a board that only requires four moves.\n\n \n We might as well stop there. By specifying a single goal at the outset you invalidate the analogy. In evolutionary theory the flagellum was not an 'ultimate goal'. It's merely something which turned out to be possible to reach. You call that 'chance'; I have already explained why that cannot be the case regardless of how you believe the flagellum came to pass.\n \n \nI don't rely on any system only having one function, but I do rely on the fact that any system which has the function may be ruled out from the list of canidates to be used in any explaination of the formation of the function.\n\n \n Again, it's hard to know how to respond to that until you clarify what you mean by a system 'having a function'.\n \n \nOf course not, but no one is claiming to explain where gravity comes from, and if they tried to do so with an appeal to odds then that I would 'cry chance'.\n\n \n My only appeals to odds here are that:\n \n 1. A chance arrangement of functional gradients is not navigable by anything other than a brute force search.\n \n 2. The more rare you insist instances of co-option must be, the more profoundly significant empirical examples of sequential evolutionary function changes such as the flagellum becomes, since if nature did not have to rely upon co-option to form novel systems we would never expect to see a false positive by chance.",

   "Sorry for the long response time. I too will do some rearranging.\n \n \nI don't know why you think you can change my argument to suit yourself. I surmise that functional genes are sufficiently clustered as to explain the existence of life in its current forms, no more, no less.\nOn what evidence? That life exists?\n \n \n \nFunctional gradients are not single strings\n \n If fitness gradients in gene space were arranged by chance, it would be impossible to locate them via any means other than a brute-force search of gene space.\n \n I neither expect nor require mutations to 'as oft as not' fall upon another function or system.\n\n I see some contradiction on the fitness landscape here, if you neither expect nor require mutations to 'as oft as not' fall upon another function or system and thereby accept that the ratio we observe is more or less correct you are forced to admit not only that the vast majority of sequences are non-functional but also that the vast majority of known functional sequences are isolated in most directions from other systems.\n \n In the fitness landscape this along with the assumption of co-option allows only one class of terrain, a web of well strings. These strings may be far wider than just one sequence at a time but they would be strings.\n \n I do not assume that gradients themselves have no pattern, I have said explicitly before that I think it is eminently predictable that slight modifications of an existing system would most likely produce a variant system, this is not a rule there are obviously exceptions but it can still be assumed. In the fitness landscape that is like saying that (lets just take higher to mean greater fitness) we can count on functions being more or less hill shaped.\n \n The fact that mutations most often are neutral or negative means that we are not dealing with a giant mountain in which it's always up up up. Neutral means no change in height, i.e. a plateau. Negative means a loss in height, i.e. a valley.\n \n Co-option means that functions are connected by fitness gradients, so then we are talking about ridges in which the local path is high fitness but also the direction along the ridge is steep enough to move the sequence to another function.\n \n Your assumptions and accepted facts are working together to give you a pretty clear picture of the general geology of your fitness landscape and it does have 'strings'.\n \n While we are talking about this my point about co-option is that unlike the hills you are claiming that we have mountain ranges (i.e. a specific placement of functional gradients) but with no justification.\n \n \nFunctional gradients are not single strings, and individual mutations are often observed to affect multiple aspects of an organism, proving beyond doubt the reality of co-option.\n\n Correlation of structure is fully accounted for in the fitness landscape as you would simply me observing valleys or heights that are the result of multiple structures.\n \n \nAnd again, I remind you that to describe something as 'unlikely' you must be able to demonstrate the extent to which the phenomenon is subject to chance.\n\n As I have said before co-option is at least as unlikely as equivalent mutation. That is not a specific number because the odds would change from system to system.\n \n Odds of mutation = 1/4^difference\n \n Odds of perfect co-option = 1/4^sequence length\n \n Difference < sequence length\n \n Therefore odds of mutation are always < odds of perfect co-option.\n \n Clearly imperfect co-option + odds of mutation = odds of perfect co-option as every degree (base pair) of imperfection in co-option is the same degree increase in differential.\n \n Clearly this assumes that the odds of co-option = 1/4^sequence length, that is a purely random view of the distribution of functions.\n \n \nSince you do not seem to be advocating any kind of infinite universe/multiverse explanation for the existence of life, it follows you are (at least unconsciously) assuming some lawful pattern to their arrangement permitting shortcuts to their discovery.\n \n So, given that we both require some unknown law to arrange gene-space to suit our hypotheses, you may want to reconsider your implication that this implies insanity.\n\n How am I unconsciously assuming some lawful pattern? If I am does that exempt my point that no one has found one from validity? and finally what hypothesis are you talking about? My hypothesis is that evolution doesn't explain what people claim it explains.\n \n \n\n Connect or bring within plausible reach, yes. Nor is this a 'replacement' for evolutionary theory, any more than the supposition that the gene-function mapping preserves homologies 'replaces' evolutionary theory. It is merely a prerequisite; context - just as the details of carbon-based chemistry are part of the context - within which evolution is possible.\nIt is not just a prerequisite, if co-option is as you think of it, the traditional evolutionary mechanism is just a train that creeps along tracks of co-option. Still a factor of course but not the source of the so called 'information'. Theistic evolution supporters would just love this idea because it would mean that the 'information' for life was 'coded' into the universe.\n \n All of that is irrelevant at this point however because I am merely talking about the notion that the evolutionary mechanism (mutation + natural selection) is responsible for the advancement of life. If you manage to (I don't think you will) set up patterns of co-option as the explanation I will consider that a new theory or at least a substantial expansion of the theory.\n \n \nI'm playing by your explicit rules here. You stated that your categorisation of selectable function was not arbitrary, but was the most general possible description of what a biological system achieved. That is, without exception or question: \"Aids survival/reproduction[/i].\"\n \n If you wish to disagree, then you must either show how a system which does not aid survival or reproduction may be consistently selected for, or give a still more generic description of functionality.\n \n You're starting to trip yourself up.

Vehicles of many kinds can take you all over the world, helping in exactly the same way as planes. Perhaps not to the same degree or with the same level of convenience, but degree doesn't constitute a change in function, right?\n\n Alright, I am sorry if this seems like mincing words but I really did rely on such shades of meaning when in my original quote.\n \n I did not say the most general description of of what a biological systems achieves, you made that up. I said the most general description possible of a function. You are talking about the purpose of a structure, and in life it either aids in survival or is vestigial.\n \n A function in engineering and biology has a specific meaning, it is a process with an aim (to aid in survival) but the actual function part is the process which implies two things, what is done and how it is done.\n \n What is done need not be the ultimate purpose of the function and in life it cannot be, there is no structure that directly 'aids in survival' they all happen to do specific things that contribute to survival. It would by si-fi to imagine a system that generated some mystical life force.\n \n I would like to note that it is partially my fault if you misunderstood because my own example did a poor job illustrating this because obviously 'a flying vehicle' is not the function of a airplane; it's definition is:\n \n a heavier-than-air aircraft kept aloft by the upward thrust exerted by the passing air on its fixed wings and driven by propellers, jet propulsion, etc. \n \n The function is the what is done as well as how it is done, a plane is not a helicopter nor a airship. Furthermore this is in fact not the most general description of the function possible, because this still leaves the propulsion system undefined, a plane that has the propulsion of a propeller is not just another shape of a plane with a jet propulsion system.\n \n So another way you might define the difference between functions is that a function may have many variants but they are all just shapes of each other (I call these applications nowadays). A different function however, regardless of whether it happens to do the same thing must at least do so in a different way.\n \n Now I don't know how much of this thread you have read but the above including the comments about 'most general' are post hoc english extrapolations of the concept. In my guided mutation test the word 'function' doesn't even appear. The important part in that test is 'whether a mutation is selected due to similarity in the final'.\n \n Conceptually that is only possible because of converging on a biological function so that is why there is all this blabing about what functions are, if however you are going to get so precise with the wording I would just refer you to the definition that a function is a set of sequences with the same selection pressures (direction not magnitude). i.e. you can tell if you have left the function if the selective pressure being experienced is no longer based on how the structure used to aid in survival whether positive or negative.\n \n \n \nNot directly, to my knowledge.\nHow is it possible that a function does not have co-option with itself?\n \n \nYou recall the screwdriver/knife/spoon/hammer analogy from before? Not all functions need directly support co-option for them to be ultimately linkable.\n\n I am not sure what that means\n \n \nIt's hard to answer that question when it's unclear what, to you, constitutes the 'forming' of C functionality.\n\n If satisfying B becomes strongly selected for, the structure can, through improvements to its B function, acquire slight C functionality\n \n The 'acquire C functionality' would be the formation, degree is important only if it is too slight to experienced selection and that is not an assumption that can really be made in general.\n \n \nFor instance, take a mammal evolving smaller and lighter (in the pursuit of some ecological niche) such that its surface area becomes capable of significantly slowing its fall. Does this constitute the formation of new functionality (gliding, the prelude to flight), or would you say that, since the surface area of a creature always provides air resistance, it 'always' possessed that functionality, albeit in a quantity too small and too swamped by other selection factors to itself be selectable?\n\n \n It's always possessed air resistance that is true, however the smaller and lighter selective force has nothing to do with that (I assume); in the guided mutation test it would fail the 'selected for similarity with B' so regardless of whether the function could be said to exist or not it would not being selected so it could not be guided. i.e. it is a coincidence that being smaller and lighter has brought the creature closer to flight.\n \n The formation of a new function would be before the moment when the first selection occurs due to the ability to glide by definition, however that selection is the proof that the function does exist.\n \n So the creature always possessed air resistance but not always the ability to glide.\n \n The ability to glide is formed when the creature doesn't just fall slow, when it actually travels distance, and the proof that this function exists to evolution is when it can select for it.\n \n I hope you can see the difference between this and the hypothetical cases that bennedict brought, in which the function already existed and merely became more useful (therefore selectively emphasized) due to some environmental shift. That would be in this example that the mammal could already glide but for some reason it was more important to run quietly until it migrated to somewhere with tons of trees or cliffs. i.e. just because the function is not being used does not mean it does not exist, however the inability to select for the function despite it's potential usefulness is proof that it does not exist yet.\n \n \nMy question was my answer. You keep going on about how unlikely this all is, yet you refuse to provide a single example where co-option is impossible - or even unlikely. Thus I ask again: if your objection to co-option is that it's unlikely, how unlikely do you think it is for (say) mammals to evolve smaller in pursuit of an ecological niche, and thus encounter an opportunity to evolve flight?\n\n Is it impossible or just unlikely that a mammal to have an offspring which has gained the use of flight which it's parents did not have?\n \n \n \nBecause you keep saying co-option is unlikely. \n\n Ah but for that I only need to assume forward connections are unlikely not backward connections. I think most systems preserve old functions to some degree easily, that does not mean that the old functions have anywhere near sufficient sequence homology with the new ones.\n \n For instance (I don't remember who gave this example) someone on this forum came up with the example of QWERTY key arrangement on a keyboard and a type writer, noting that a keyboard has preserved the 'functionality' of QWERTY is easy, it is like saying that a section of the DNA for a keyboard codes for the QWERTY system; that in no way however proves that any amount of finagling with a type writer will produce a computer system.\n \n This is a very important part of the claimed co-option method of generation referred conveniently as 'association' in which control systems gene expression and luck all combine to allow elements from all over organisms to combine to form a new function, this is the height of the unlikeliness I am talking about.\n \n \n=Peeling;425400We might as well stop there. By specifying a single goal at the outset you invalidate the analogy. In evolutionary theory the flagellum was not an 'ultimate goal'. It's merely something which turned out to be possible to reach. You call that 'chance'; I have already explained why that cannot be the case regardless of how you believe the flagellum came to pass.\nBy specifying a single goal I am reflecting that the flagellum or the piece setup is claimed to have evolve, it is perfectly legitimate in every way. If you want to consider every system and not just one that is fine, but then we will consider the odds of producing every system in life and not just one. How are you going to do that besides breaking it into individual chances?\n \n \n \n1. A chance arrangement of functional gradients is not navigable by anything other than a brute force search.\n\n and so?\n \n \n2. The more rare you insist instances of co-option must be, the more profoundly significant empirical examples of sequential evolutionary function changes such as the flagellum becomes, since if nature did not have to rely upon co-option to form novel systems we would never expect to see a false positive by chance.\nSo you are saying that the more rare I insist co-option is the more important it is that you find examples of it because we would not expect examples to exist?\n \n You realize that it is precisely the failure to predict the phenomenon that is the basis for my dismissal of the concept right?",

I've always found the conservative Christian emphasis on obedience to be quite out of sync with their rhetoric of liberty.

However information can be subtracted ex: wolf (canine) domesticated to dog (canine).\n \n A change in species does not require a loss or gain of information even it could be so. I advise you to steer away from an information theory perspective. There is much information reflected by natural selection, most of it temporary shifts in environment. A genome could in a very real sense gain gigabytes of data that has nothing to do with any real advance in biological systems.\n \n \n2)This is not a debate of science vs religion. This is the debate of the science of one religion vs the science of another religion. Religion by definition is a cause, principle or belief held to with faith or ardor. Science by definition is knowledge attained through study or practice. Because \"macro-evolution\" takes so much time according to evolutionists, and because you cannot observe the past and only the present, you cannot observe \"macro-evolution\" and thus it requires just as much faith as any other religion.\n\n That is not true, a direct observation is not required to make conclusions about something. All history, archeology, paleontology, geology; and even network news agencies would be on unsure footing if conclusions could not be made indirectly.\n \n When you read an ancient wall with a dead language you are not observing some ancient event which it records, you are concluding that it is unlikely they made it up.\n \n It requires no more faith to believe that something happened when you were not there to see it than it does to believe that the moon is round though all you ever see is a partially shaded disk.\n \n \n3)No true transitional fossils have been found. And before you people go and use that dinosaur bird against me that is exactly what it is, a dinosaur bird. It is a dinosaur with bird feathers nothing more, nothing less.\n\n Define a true transitional fossil and you will see that the term is inapplicable or most certainly has been found.\n \n Evolutionary theory holds that there will be millions of transitional forms, at least one for every selected mutation.\n \n How many of those selected mutations do you need to find before you consider it a complete transitional record?\n \n \nContinuing with transitional fossils, the odds of a single protein, the most basic unit of life, forming by chance is 1/20^300.\n\n Which one?\n \n That calculation doesn't seem to follow. If the 20 is meant to be the sequence length it should be a dimensional increase (an exponent). The number of basepairs in the strand determine the number of different combinations that could be had for a sequence that length.\n \n If on the other hand 20 is to represent the different types of amino-acids, is 300 meant to mean the length of the polypeptide? If so you must realize that that is not nearly the smallest they can be. I don't think treating the odds in terms of amino acids is a good idea anyway. It assumes mutations happen in the form of codon shifts and they don't need to. I think it generally muddies up the concept.\n \n For instance if a sequence was 6 base pairs (2 codons) not including control sections the odds of any given sequence of base pairs is 1/4^6, the odds of any given sequence of codons (aminoacids) is 1/20^2.\n \n That is 400 possibilities (codon analysis) vs 4096 possibilities (base pair analysis). Can't you see that the vast difference in possibilities?\n \n This is because four values in groups of three can have 64 permutations while 20 in groups of one can only have 20.\n \n \"But freedom pretty much all of the 64 codons specify a amino-acid so shouldn't it balance out with the AA view?\"\n \n No it shouldn't, because insertions and replacements disrupt the codon pattern. It can change the amino acids until the next intron. In other words the base pair permutation does matter.\n \n \nand a single DNA strand requires thousands. The odds of a new DNA strand forming by chance is 1/10^400,000.\n\n A strand of DNA doesn't require any proteins but the ones that copy and read it. How can you give a single number for a 'strand' as if it was a standard unit?\n \n \nNow let me ask you, in all the \"transitional fossils\" we have found they are all perfect, to say, no consistent genetic deformities.\n\n If they are transitional fossils, they are genetic deformities from their ancestors. What makes you think complete DNA can be extracted from fossils?\n \n \nHow could something with the odds of 1/10^400,000 form on the first and every try? You answer that.\n\n What are you talking about? There is no only one try, a fatal mutation effects only one organism.\n \n \n4)Why evolve skeletons? According to evolutionary scientists we started out with exoskeletons similar to insects. Insects are still around and are thriving, so why \"evolve\" something you don't need?\n\n I see now what they mean when they say 'why' is not the question. While I asked 'why' to unjustifiably assumed and arbitrary patterns... you ask 'why' to natural selection and mutation. Mutation doesn't answer to why. Natural selection will answer to any benefit whether we think it was needed or not.\n \n \nOh and if we are \"evolving\" then every human is \"evolving\" at the same pace with the same mutations, the odds of that are impossible.\n\n No, we don't have the same mutations. If evolution was operating on humans as we understand it the people with the favourable mutations will have more kids than those without. Eventually those genes would be prevalent. So the entire species would 'evolve' at one rate. You must realize of course that mutations that are inheritable occur when your organism is constructed, at any other point it would exist in but one cell and have no chance of representing your DNA in the form of gametes.\n \n \n5)What is your ultimate authority? A group scientists that are biased, mortal, non-omniscience and fallible, or a supreme being that is unbiased, eternal, omniscience, and infallible aka God of the bible.\n\n You omit reason. You ask a real scientist, a good scientist and they will not use themselves as the authority for their proclamations. They will say the 'evidence'. It is not truly the evidence alone that they invoke as authority but the premise that through reason there is but one conclusion. That is given the evidence logic has dictated something. (Note when someone can prove something with just logic and no more evidence than a chalk board and notation)\n \n If the choice was between reason and an infallible god, I would answer that it matters little which you trust because they must agree.\n \n Reason is the essence of truth, the axiom of all facts and before it even the premise of an infallible god must melt away when confronted with contradiction.\n \n Yet the choice is not as you presented it even if updated with reason instead of a scientist authority. God is not speaking to me nor to anyone I know about, nor has the claims that god has spoken to them been supported by anyone that has ever existed (to our knowledge). The god you would cite as authority has not the presence of authority to match a meek undergrad doing research in their basement. The bible is no more proof of god than the iliad is proof of Zeus.\n \n \nI welcome any rational response related to this post. Thank you\n\n You have one, and I pray you recognize it for what it is; because you have just made yourself a lighting pole for personal assault by more than a few and you won't get much better.",

   "The bee sting, the bee's self defense tool for survival, but it comes at a cost, as a result the bee stinger is pulled out of the body,and the bee eventually dies because the muscles are pulled out. Why would evolution produce a self defense tool that kills the animal. Hornets, wasps and yellow jackets all have stings, but their stings don't get pulled out. Why would the bee not evolve to make the necessary changes for survival?\n\n \n Look into the unusual genetics of the entire hymenopteran order (wasps, ants, bees), and you'll quickly realize that there can in fact be an advantage here. Worker bees are more closely related to their sisters than to their mothers. Among the numerous side effects of this is that suicidal defense of the hive can be advantageous: doing so allows them to help their sisters survive. At the very least, so long as there's not a selective disadvantage -- and again, those unusual genetics are at play -- the feature can persist even if it's not advantageous.\n \n It's also good to remember that just because an adaptation could be selectively advantageous, this doesn't mean it will evolve. Sometimes, creatures fail to adapt, and their species is driven to extinction.\n \n \nAlso,the peacock, why would evolution produce something that requires six foot tail feathers to mate? Really, those things are like giant target signs for predators. Most birds mate based on size, strength, or talons. The peacocks survival rate is not very high, so why not evolve so it can have a better survival rate?\n\n \n Did it occur to you that the plumage is an indicator of \"size, strength,\" or general fitness? As Amotz Zahavi has put it in his formulation of the \"handicap principle,\" the extravagant signal does make males more vulnerable -- but those who are fit enough to make desirable mates are able to survive despite their plumage. Those are the individuals that females want to mate with.\n \n Additionally, there is evidence that plumage qualities may indicate capacity to resist parasites and pathogens. Mangy peacocks don't do well with the peahens.\n \n \nYou know all those experiments that supposedly \"supported\" evolution. They did absolutely nothing! Because, according to evolution their is no intelligence guiding it, its just random genetic mutations.\n\n \n No according to evolution, adaptations come about through a combination of variation and natural selection. Variations includes mutations, and they're random in the sense that it they're not necessarily advantageous to the individuals that possess them. If such random variation were all that evolution involved, adaptation would never happen.\n \n But natural selection is not a random process. What Darwin first explained (along with Wallace, really), and what subsequent research has shown time and again, is that the non-random survival and reproduction of random variants is quite enough to explain the diversification of life over time.\n \n Note further that the science of evolution does not claim that intelligence is not involved with the process. It just does not claim that intelligence is involved with the process, either. What the evidence supports is the process itself. It doesn't support any metaphysical claims about whether the process is or isn't the product of a designer's intentions. Theism and atheism can both be consistent with evolution.\n \n In sum, I would suggest that you have misunderstood evolution on a number of fronts. You don't seem to understand what evolution actually says, either in terms of general principles or specific problems. You don't seem familiar with evidence in favor of it, insofar as you emptily declare that it all amounts to nothing without specific references to experiments or their failings. And you don't seem to have considered the relationship of evolution to religion in much depth at all.\n \n Please study the subject in a bit more detail.",

   "Back on topic, here is some additional thoughts on the subject.\n \n The bee sting, the bee's self defense tool for survival, but it comes at a cost, as a result the bee stinger is pulled out of the body,and the bee eventually dies because the muscles are pulled out. Why would evolution produce a self defense tool that kills the animal. Hornets, wasps and yellow jackets all have stings, but their stings don't get pulled out. Why would the bee not evolve to make the necessary changes for survival?\n\n \n The bees that sting are sterile. It is more beneficial to the drone bees' genes to die protecting its relatives (sister bees, etc.) than to continue living itself. Social insects are very interesting...\n \n \nAlso,the peacock, why would evolution produce something that requires six foot tail feathers to mate? Really, those things are like giant target signs for predators. Most birds mate based on size, strength, or talons. The peacocks survival rate is not very high, so why not evolve so it can have a better survival rate?\n\n \n It's sexual selection, first of all. Maybe originally a larger tail was a sign of verility or something, and since the hens would choose the one with the longer tail, this trait spread and the tails got bigger... \n \n But aside from that, the tail also gives the appearance of a bigger animal when spread, and has what looks like eyes all over it that would scare off some predators. \n \n A better question would be this: How would a trait that hurts an animal's survival chances be evidence that God created it? Wouldn't he make an animal that was perfectly suited for its environment? \n \n \nYou know all those experiments that supposedly \"supported\" evolution. They did absolutely nothing! Because, according to evolution their is no intelligence guiding it, its just random genetic mutations. Those experiments had an intelligent design to them (humans,computers).

   "No that is not at all what I am saying, their are several other fish that have \"limbs\" the tripod fish for example has three \"limbs\". What I am saying is that evolutionary scientists interpret the data by saying that a fish similar to this existed millions of yrs ago and evolved into an amphibian, but they lack the evidence to make that conjecture.\n\n \n This is balderdash. The fossil record of the fish/tetrapod transition is amazing, and growing all the time. Acanthostega, Icthyostega, Tiktaalik, to name but three important fossils.\n \n There's a ton of evidence. It needs \"interpretation,\" I suppose. But that seems to me an unhelpfully broad use of \"interpretation.\" The ages and sequences of the fossils work, and what one winds up with upon full consideration is not empty speculation, as you seem to think, but an inference about what did in fact happen.\n \n Check out Carl Zimmer's book At the Water's Edge. It looks at the huge quantity of evidence for a group of fish becoming amphibians - and also for a lineage of land mammals returning to the sea and becoming cetaceans. If you think there's no evidence, you're in for a surprise!\n \n You had mentioned trusting scientists or God. But keep in mind that on matters of evolution, creationists are relying on the authority of some of the interpreters of God's will and word, not on God himself. And those interpreters simply have no idea what they're talking about when the topic is science. They seem to, but only if one doesn't look at what non-creationist scientists actually say. Then their arguments fall apart in short order. The fact that they never change the failed arguments is quite indicative of their intellectual honesty. Bluntly: you have been lied to, my friend.",

   "I agree with micro-evolution (adaptation). I do not agree with macro-evolution (the change from one species to another, or more plainly put, the adding of information).\n\n \n There is no difference. Speciation comes about as different members of the same species adapt to different environmental conditions. As long as gene flow continues across the entire group, there will simply be different varieties of the same species. If one part of the group becomes isolated from the rest, the remaining two groups will evolve independently. If their isolation ends, they may have evolved beyond the ability to continue inter-breeding even though they're together again. Voila: two species.\n \n In short, if you accept micro-evolution (as you say), and if you accept that environments change across space and time (which I would hope is pretty obvious), then macro-evolution is to be expected.\n \n \nHowever information can be subtracted ex: wolf (canine) domesticated to dog (canine).\n\n \n First, information can in fact be increased via evolution, through any number of ways (gene duplication, e.g.). Creationists using information theory don't understand what they're talking about. Bill Dembski has suckered a whole lot of people.\n \n Second, why does a dog contain less information than a wolf? It seems rather arbitrary to claim so without presenting evidence of there respective genomes.\n \n \nThis is not a debate of science vs religion. This is the debate of the science of one religion vs the science of another religion.\n\n \n No, it's a debate between pseudo-science offered by partisans of one form of religion, and real science that is independent of any religious faith.\n \n \nReligion by definition is a cause, principle or belief held to with faith or ardor.\n\n \n This is far too broad. By this definition, political parties are religions. So are the professional ethical codes held by doctors or lawyers. Metaphorically, okay. But as a literal definition of religion, this is poor.\n \n \nScience by definition is knowledge attained through study or practice.\n\n \n Again, far too broad. In the ancient world, when the entire term \"science\" was used differently, okay. But not in the modern world. Science involves searching for natural explanations for natural phenomena, and requires empirical evidence. By your definition, a Shakespeare scholar is a scientist. And that's ridiculous.\n \n Defining religion and science in these incredibly broad ways serves a rhetorical purpose for creationists. Unlike most definitions, they make the terms less clear, rather than more. But therein lies their rhetorical utility, of course.\n \n \nBecause \"macro-evolution\" takes so much time according to evolutionists, and because you cannot observe the past and only the present, you cannot observe \"macro-evolution\" and thus it requires just as much faith as any other religion.\n\n \n There is no requirement of direct observation for knowledge. Note that all of history would be invalidated by what you here claim. So would forensics.\n \n It's not a matter of faith, but of inference. Big difference.\n \n I find it very ironic, by the way, that creationists simultaneously claim that their position is true, while adopting cognitive relativism in defense of it.\n \n \nNo true transitional fossils have been found. And before you people go and use that dinosaur bird against me that is exactly what it is, a dinosaur bird. It is a dinosaur with bird feathers nothing more, nothing less.\n\n \n So why would dinosaurs have feathers? Come on. This \"no transitional fossils\" mantra is absolutely absurd. There are lots of transitional fossils, for birds, for humans, for more.\n \n \nContinuing with transitional fossils, the odds of a single protein, the most basic unit of life, forming by chance is 1/20^300. That is just a single protein, and a single DNA strand requires thousands. The odds of a new DNA strand forming by chance is 1/10^400,000.\n\n \n With all due respect, DNA is not made of protein.\n \n Regardless, it's also worth noting that no one claims proteins form by chance. The natural selection under which proteins evolve is not a chance process.\n \n \nNow let me ask you, in all the \"transitional fossils\" we have found they are all perfect, to say, no consistent genetic deformities.\n\n \n What is a \"consistent genetic deformity?\" It's hard to figure out what you're even demanding here.\n \n Or why you're demanding it.\n \n \nHow could something with the odds of 1/10^400,000 form on the first and every try? You answer that.\n\n \n Why do you think evolutionists claim such complexity happened spontaneously? No evolutionist has ever claimed that nature moved from random chemicals to an organized protein in a single step. Evolution has been going on for billions of years. It isn't starting from scratch, and it isn't making such huge leaps. But its effects are cumulative.\n \n All these arguments from vanishingly small probabilities are deeply flawed. Nonetheless, creationists keep using them, to sucker people who don't know evolution well enough to spot the straw man. Deliberate use of such a fallacy is, quite frankly, dishonest.\n \n Don't fall for it.\n \n \nWhy evolve skeletons? According to evolutionary scientists we started out with exoskeletons similar to insects. Insects are still around and are thriving, so why \"evolve\" something you don't need?\n\n \n Our lineage evolved from invertebrates, it's true. But we did not evolve from insects or any other arthropod. The split between insects and their kin (including most other invertebrates) and vertebrates and their kin (including us humans) is very ancient.\n \n In fact, based on developmental evidence we appear more closely related to echinoderms such as starfish! And interestingly, echinoderms have an endoskeleton, as we do.\n \n The earliest chordates (which include us vertebrates) appear to be wormlike creatures possessed of a notochord, a primitive internal backbone (e.g. Haikouella or Haikouichthys). At no stage does it seem we possessed exoskeletons such as those of insects.\n \n \nOh and if we are \"evolving\" then every human is \"evolving\" at the same pace with the same mutations, the odds of that are impossible.\n\n \n We are still evolving as a species. This does not mean that every individual comes to possess the same mutations. Again, you don't seem to understand how evolution works.\n \n \nWhat is your ultimate authority? A group scientists that are biased, mortal, non-omniscience and fallible, or a supreme being that is unbiased, eternal, omniscience, and infallible aka God of the bible.\n\n \n Except that your authority on these matters is not God but creationists and their interpretations of the Bible and God's will. And they are as fallible as any other mortal, plus more dishonest than most.\n \n I repeat: Don't fall for it. Start looking at evolution for yourself, rather than through the lens of what creationists say about it. You'll soon realize, creationists don't represent evolution accurately at all. And despite being called on it many, many times... they keep repeating their misrepresentations. Liars, one and all.",

Where Freedom disagrees is his notion that random mutation plus natural selection is not an adequate model of evolution, even just as a basic way of putting it.\n\n No you don't understand. Evolution is not an event or occurrence that is either impossible or possible. It is a naturalistic process. It's only two premises are already proven facts so it ia quite impossible for it not to occur, and on a regular basis. The question with me has always been what exactly will/can the process produce (what the theory will predict), what constitutes evolution as an explainable process and what is being lumped in as evolution when it is in fact a total chance and unexplainable as anything but a change. Life and the idea that species are linked by ancestor species are also facts. One could not claim that life or common descent is impossible as that contradicts reality.\n \n What's my problem then? I have identified it by defining two terms, rational and irrational evolution. Rational evolution is the processes we know about (RM+NS) and anything it can produce by the laws and patterns we can verify and understand. Irrational evolution in a pseudo-magical entity that is treated almost as an intelligent designer itself, it contains the idea of NS and RM but doesn't limit it's claims to it's means. It can accomplish anything based on whether NS would select for that thing not based on whether RM+NS could assemble it. You have no idea how many times I have heard 'but if X does show up NS will select it, therefore it was evolved'. It blurs the difference between theory and fact, observation and explanation; since it claims to explain life and common descent, these fact of life is supposed to mean it itself is a fact.\n \n I claim that irrational evolution is impossible, not unlikely; impossible. It is scientific embarrassment and a mess. I saw no hint of it's fallacy in OOS and I fully suspect it is completely the construct of a counter-movement to creationism. It is a history which is hard to sort from the actual science because of the fact that the creationism - atheist struggle was going on even before OOS was published. In short irrational evolution is the result of atheists getting over excited, and pushing a theory past it's limits in an attempt to put it into the 'ring' with genesis. They wanted desperately to have a complete theory of life. First of all motivation is no excuse, second of all the motivations were ill-informed. Genesis is absolute and complete that is true, but it's also mystical non-sense, it 'required' no rival. Secondly since it is mystical non-sense it is unbound by that annoying thing we call reality, complete true theories do exist in the real world but they are rare. To find the final answer to life is incredibly exciting but it simply isn't here yet and the fuel of creationist for the past 100 years has been that fact, not their belief or faith; but the fact, that just for once they have a chance to 'beat science' because the gun was jumped. Notice that geology contradicts genesis just as surely as evolution does, yet young earth creationist are a hundred times more rare than just creationist.\n \n \nHe thinks that IC diagnoses a deep problem, but not one that rules evolution out or deities in.\n\n IC diagnoses a deep problem, but not with rational evolution. Fallacies are often provable as such in different ways. IC is merely a name for a specific analysis i.e. a certain approach to the concept of evolution. What distinguishes it is the fact that it contradicts irrational evolution. It is fear driven propaganda to try to link IC with the denial of rational evolution as the analysis is of evolution and therefore assumes evolution and is built off it's premises. Rational evolution could be completely wrong and IC would 'never know' because it is a derived concept, the only thing it does is expose inconsistency with the theory as presented and what it's supposed to explain. It's analogous to reading a cook book and deciding that the recipe is for bread not pie despite the fact that people assumed it must be pie because pie came out of the oven. You can't read a recipe and deny the cook book!\n \n \nI could be wrong about his general position as described above, and I'm sure he or someone else will correct me if I am.\n\n I probably corrected more than needed. Although I do appreciate what honesty you've shown, I am disappointed to be reminded that admitting the plain and obvious truth (obvious because I have been completely open about all my views) is only a peculiar distinction because so many have been dishonest and don't feel inclined to contemplate the existence of someone with my views. The reason why is obvious, they have built their shield out of propaganda that states only the biased irrational mystics could possibly have a motivation to contradict irrational evolution. It blinds them to the simplest of facts, simplest of these being that one does not need a motivation to doubt besides love of truth.",

   "Matthew what experiments or models were used in the books you mention?\n\n \n Any number of experiments, from the ongoing Lenski experiment at Michigan State to experiments about the evolution of ultraviolet vision in birds. As for the model...\n \n \nIf they are merely arguments for random chance...\n\n \n They are not arguments for random chance. They do presume -- indeed, explain -- what is meant by calling mutation \"random.\" Coyne actually suggests that \"indifferent\" would be a much better way of describing mutations, i.e., they occur indifferent to the needs of the organism in which they occur: they might help, they might hurt, they might do nothing, but they occur regardless of their consequences.\n \n No, the model being defended is that populations evolve -- not that individuals mutate, but that populations evolve -- thanks to the combined impact of random mutation AND natural selection. Let me jump ahead in your post a moment:\n \n \nWhat's my problem then? I have identified it by defining two terms, rational and irrational evolution. Rational evolution is the processes we know about (RM+NS) and anything it can produce by the laws and patterns we can verify and understand. Irrational evolution in a pseudo-magical entity that is treated almost as an intelligent designer itself, it contains the idea of NS and RM but doesn't limit it's claims to it's means. It can accomplish anything based on whether NS would select for that thing not based on whether RM+NS could assemble it. You have no idea how many times I have heard 'but if X does show up NS will select it, therefore it was evolved'. It blurs the difference between theory and fact, observation and explanation; since it claims to explain life and common descent, these fact of life is supposed to mean it itself is a fact.\n \n I claim that irrational evolution is impossible, not unlikely; impossible. It is scientific embarrassment and a mess.\n\n \n Which is to say, the books above are using what you call rational evolution as their model. They are including both random mutation and natural selection as parts of the model.\n \n What I still don't understand is (a) who has ever argued that random mutation without natural selection is evolution, or (b) who has ever argued that there can be natural selection on something that hasn't already come to be through variation ultimately derived from random mutation, or (c) who has ever claimed that because something could have happened according to mutational and selective steps x and y and z, it did happen according to mutational and selective steps x and y and z. I have simply never seen anyone claim (a) or (b). The standard model is and always has been that both random mutation and natural selection are necessary for evolution, at least insofar as evolution is a matter of adaptation.\n \n And while I have seen claims about (c), every author I've ever seen do this in the popular literature points out that such-and-such is a hypothesis, possibly even a highly speculative one at present. They are trying to provide plausible reconstructions of how this or that phenomenon evolved. So what they do is try to figure out what sorts of mutations and selective conditions would do it. That mutations and selection could do it, however, is something for which they argue only against those who think that they couldn't, e.g. Behe.\n \n All in all, I don't see the distinction between RE and IE, as you're trying to make it, because I have no idea who has ever argued for IE. Evolutionists are all claiming that both random mutation and natural selection, together, are what produce evolutionary change in populations over time. So while I appreciate that you aren't doing so deliberately with any sort of malicious intent, I think you've constructed a straw man.\n \n Back to the earlier part of the post:\n \n \nThat is what IC blocks not the odds themselves, it is saying the odds as they first appear are unmitigated by an ordered process lie NS.\n\n \n But as near as I can tell, everyone is saying this! Random mutation alone is just random mutation, not evolution. Natural selection alone is just natural selection, not evolution. In order for a population to evolve, random variants must be subject the non-random process of natural selection. I just don't know who is claiming otherwise. You say:\n \n \nGiven how consistently this is the case...\n\n \n But I can't think of any cases at all! Show me the published authors who are making the argument you're trying to counter. Until then, I really don't get it.\n \n And I certainly don't see how IC helps, even on your own terms, because...\n \n \n...you can surely understand why Behe & friends think they have found a problem with evolutionary theory. If people had said 'oh yea we understand that' to his IC analysis he wouldn't have written a book I'm sure.\n\n \n ...Behe is arguing that random mutation plus natural selection is not sufficient to explain how complex features evolve, at least at the cellular level. That's why he's part of the Intelligent Design movement. He thinks that if there's something irreducibly complex, the process of random mutation plus natural selection couldn't have produced it -- only an intelligent designer could.\n \n It is abundantly clear that you are not a creationist. Nonetheless, the concept you are defending seems to be that of Behe, who uses it to argue that RM+NS is not a good enough model for how adaptive evolution occurs, at least at the level of cells and biochemistry. So I believe we can be forgiven if a lot of us find your view rather confusing.\n \n Just some thoughts. Still have no idea what you think is the problem with evolution, such that it needs to be distinguished into an RE and an IE model, since no one has ever used the IE model. And still have no clue what is right about IC, such that it will explain how RM and NS jointly produce evolutionary change, since other exponents of IC use it to argue against RM+NS accomplishing anything at all.",

It's what makes the complexity allegedly irreducible: if the complex phenomenon can't be reduced in complexity without being rendered useless. It's not just the idea of a complex feature evolving in a single-stroke that he's trying to rule out. It's the idea of stepwise mutations and selection events being capable of evolving complexity that he's trying to eliminate.

If they would admit that natural selection cannot mitigate the odds of forming a novel system then your claim would have merit; but they won't. The reason they won't is because then people like behe will bring them a flagellum and a simple odds calculation which they refuse to deal with. The reason I asked about the books you referenced was because I am interested in an analysis of the odds, but not more denial founded in ignorance intentional or otherwise.\n \n \n...Behe is arguing that random mutation plus natural selection is not sufficient to explain how complex features evolve, at least at the cellular level. That's why he's part of the Intelligent Design movement. He thinks that if there's something irreducibly complex, the process of random mutation plus natural selection couldn't have produced it \n\n Right, the key word is 'process'. Just because there is no process does not mean something cannot happen, it just means you can't have a theory which predicts the outcome. Could a mutation that created a flagellum have happened? Technically yes, but that is hardly an explaination and every time you insist evolution can't be 'just' mutation you back me up.\n \n IC helps explain evolution in a more precise way than the descriptions which inevitably intentionally ignore any kind of temporal analysis of selection.\n \n-- only an intelligent designer could.\n\n He's making the same mistake they are and you know I've said it. \n \n \nIt is abundantly clear that you are not a creationist. Nonetheless, the concept you are defending seems to be that of Behe, who uses it to argue that RM+NS is not a good enough model for how adaptive evolution occurs, at least at the level of cells and biochemistry.\n\n Adaptive evolution vs ? If a system can be modified to work better in different conditions it can happen by rational evolution and it is adaptation. There is nothing wrong with that model.\n \n Further IC is not restricted to bio-chemestry but is less intuitive at larger levels because by definition larger levels are abstract derivations of smaller patterns. The functions on the macroscopic level far fewer than they are made out to be hence the massive number of strawmen against IC. For instance wings, legs, and flukes are all quite diverse in their application but the function is the same, a limb held rigid by bones and motivated by contracting muscles tied to central control system.\n \n \nSo I believe we can be forgiven if a lot of us find your view rather confusing.\n\n It's not confusing unless you assume the same dichotomy that behe does, and that implicitly atheist do.\n \n \nAnd still have no clue what is right about IC, such that it will explain how RM and NS jointly produce evolutionary change, since other exponents of IC use it to argue against RM+NS accomplishing anything at all.\n\n To me it seems the fact that I constantly use terms like novel system and unique function, while evolutionist always use terms like evolutionary change and adaptation is somewhat like an ongoing strawman or attempt at equivocation. What is it that makes you think IC invalidates change qua change? IC isn't a theory of life, it doesn't explain how RM and NS jointly produce anything, it identifies the possible interactions of NS and RM which indicates what they will produce and why (or why not).\n \n \nIf the passage quoted here is all that IC is saying, then here's what it means: random mutation is not evolution.

   "If they are using rational evolution as their model they cannot claim to have demonstrated a process that creates novel functions.\n\n \n Sure they can. It's called mutation. If you don't think that mutations can create novel functions, then I really don't what to say. They can cause enzymes to change their shapes in such a way that the cleave molecules they couldn't do anything with before. They can cause pigments to become sensitive to light wavelengths they couldn't detect before. (See Carroll's discussion of birds and ultraviolet vision, of which more later. Again, sorry I can't provide the page number, since I lost the book.) And more and more.\n \n Unfortunately, mutations can also cause novel failures of function, often with lethal results. If a mutation enables an enzyme to cleave something it couldn't before, but disables it from doing something absolutely vital to the organism, then this is a problem.\n \n But that, of course, is where natural selection kicks in. To say that mutation can produce a novel function (or failure of function) for a single individual is not to say that the function has \"evolved.\" For that, we need to show that random mutation plus natural selection made the function common amongst an entire population (or made it uncommon, or even drove the population extinct).\n \n (And let me just reiterate that I believe there is a great deal of vagueness surrounding the use of terms like \"novel function\" and \"creates.\")\n \n And by way of clarification and segue: while random mutation can produce novel functions, random mutation by itself is not evolution.\n \n \nAnyone who has argued against IC eventually implies one or the other as they must (unless they give up).\n\n \n This is just false. No one says that random mutation is evolution, or that it can produce complex structures at a single stroke. No one says that natural selection even has anything to work on without variations ultimately derived from mutation, and it certainly doesn't call forth mutations of either a helpful or hurtful kind.\n \n If you think that there are people who say these things, then provide your evidence. You won't find them in the literature, even the popular literature, and you won't even find them on this board.\n \n As for giving up, well, people often opt out of arguments when, no matter how many times they say x, they are chastised for not saying x.\n \n Only random mutation plus natural selection qualifies as adaptive evolution (more on the qualifier in a moment, since it was evidently confusing). Only random mutation plus natural selection can produce complex features, and it needs a lot of time (generation time, not necessarily a fixed measure) to do so.\n \n I know of no evolutionary biologist who claims otherwise. It's time for you to put up or shut up on this score.\n \n Meanwhile, on the matter of arguing that something could happen according to a given sequence, therefore it did happen according to a given sequence, you offer the following individual as an exemplar:\n \n \nkenneth miller.\n\n \n I presume that you are referring to his suggestion of an evolutionary relationship between the flagellum and the type III secretory system, or TTSS. I would suggest that you don't understand his argument. Why would I suggest this? In part, because he explicitly states that he is not arguing that because one of these structures could have evolved from the other, it did. On page 58 of Only a Theory, he notes that some proponents of intelligent design\n have pointed to speculation that the TTSS evolved from the flagellum as proving that the smaller system couldn't be the actual ancestor of the flagellum. That might be so, but other scientists have suggested quite the opposite, and in any case, it actually doesn't matter if today's TTSS is the ancestor of anything. It is absolutely correct to argue to that the existence of the TTSS today doesn't answer the question of how the flagellum actually evolved. But that overlooks why the ID camp believed that irreducible complexity was so critical in the first place: They thought it proved that the flagellum couldn't have evolved. It doesn't. [boldface added]\n He is not trying to argue that the flagellum evolved from the TTSS, and he certainly isn't claiming so on the basis of the fact that it could have. Nor is he arguing the opposite on the same absurd basis. He is arguing that it is in fact possible for a part of the flagellum to have had a different but selectively advantageous function, such that a subsequent mutation could alter the structure and hence its function -- and therefore the claim that this could not happen is false.\n \n \nMore importantly though the term 'could' is quite useless in the context of probabilities. Anything can happen because there is no limitation on what mutations can happen.\n\n \n First, is the phrase \"could not\" similarly useless? Because that's what Behe is saying about evolution: evolution could not produce the structures that he calls \"irreducibly complex.\" Since that's what he claims for IC, why is it useless to consider what \"could\" happen?\n \n Second, it is not the case that \"there is no limitation on what mutations can happen.\" There are only 20 amino acids to code for. There are only 4 DNA bases to arrange into the triplets that will do the coding, and the code is degenerate. Some mutations are even functionally invisible. All in all, there are only so many ways for a mutation to happen, given the genes that are already present. It is not the case that mutation means just anything can happen.\n \n And in any event, without natural selection, whatever does happen thanks to mutation wouldn't lead to the evolution of a population.\n \n \nIC proves that selection has nothing to do with it...\n\n \n Wait a minute, selection has nothing to do with what, exactly? I thought that \"rational evolution\" meant random mutation, plus natural selection? A rather confusing way of putting it.\n \n \nIt is the case, as I said by miller; and others. Certainly those who have argued against IC on this forum. If they would admit that natural selection cannot mitigate the odds of forming a novel system then your claim would have merit...\n\n \n What does that even mean? Natural selection does not \"form novel systems?\" Blech. Just more vagary. And yes, I know you've tried to explain it before, I just don't think you've succeeded.\n \n Random mutation in genes can lead to the development, in an individual, of a simple feature that is new. If it's a helpful feature, natural selection will cause that individual's advantage-conferring genes to spread through the population, at a rate and to a degree depending upon how great the advantage. If it's hurtful, natural selection will purge those genes from the population in the same way -- perhaps even by purging the population itself.\n \n This -- random mutation plus natural selection -- is evolution. Now, of course, nature isn't static, so what's advantageous or disadvantageous can vary. Still, that's the basic model, as I understand it. For complexity, all that's needed is whole series of mutations and their selection events. That's what needs to be reconstructed.\n \n \nbut they won't. The reason they won't is because then people like behe will bring them a flagellum and a simple odds calculation which they refuse to deal with.\n\n \n They won't deal with that odds calculation because it's a straw man. The odds are insurmountable, if and only if one presumes that one goes from not even one component of what is now the flagellum to the flagellum. But since no one makes this presumption, that odds calculation is irrelevant.\n \n \nThe reason I asked about the books you referenced was because I am interested in an analysis of the odds, but not more denial founded in ignorance intentional or otherwise.\n\n \n I wold highly recommend them, especially Carroll's The Making of the Fittest, especially his discussion of the evolution of ultraviolet vision in birds. I'd also recommend Dawkins' discussion of the Lenski experiment in The Greatest Show on Earth, noting particularly that one strain of the bacteria developed the ability to feed on citrate while the others did not.\n \n UV vision in birds and citrate-feeding: novel functions that initially occurred in an individual via random mutation and subsequently spread through whole populations via natural selection. Novel functions, in short, that evolved, by our very definition of evolution in terms of the combination of random mutation and natural selection.\n \n But don't take my word for it. Read the books.\n \n \nRight, the key word is 'process'. Just because there is no process does not mean something cannot happen, it just means you can't have a theory which predicts the outcome. Could a mutation that created a flagellum have happened? Technically yes, but that is hardly an explaination and every time you insist evolution can't be 'just' mutation you back me up.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean by \"prediction\" in the context of reconstructing past events.\n \n Beyond that, all I can say is, we are clearly in agreement that a single random mutation cannot create something as complex as a flagellum. All I'm trying to argue, and all that evolutionary theorists argue too, is that an entire series of random mutations, each of which is subject to natural selection, can eventually produce a complex feature like a flagellum as a feature of a whole species of organisms.\n \n What Behe claims is that such a sequence of mutational and selective events can not bring about a flagellum. Unfortunately for his argument, \"irreducible complexity\" fails to prove anything of the kind.\n \n \nIC helps explain evolution in a more precise way than the descriptions which inevitably intentionally ignore any kind of temporal analysis of selection.\n\n \n And this is one of those moments where I just have no idea what you're even talking about. By trying to understand whole series of mutations and selective conditions, evolution is always a temporal analysis. Mutations are events in time; just look at how the Lenski experiment figured out when not one but two mutations occurred to enable citrate consumption. Selective conditions change over time; just look at how paleontologists try to explain why legs would be advantageous for early tetrapods before they even left the water. It's always a matter of temporal analysis.\n \n If anything is non-temporal, it's IC. This is exactly why Behe uses it to support the intervention of an intelligent designer. It's not a process occurring over time. Poof! The designer produces instantaneously the complexity that random-mutation-plus-natural-selection cannot.\n \n \nHe's [Behe is] making the same mistake they are and you know I've said it.\n\n \n Except that you're using exactly Behe's conceptual weapon. In his hands, it is a weapon to argue that random-mutation-plus-natural-selection cannot produce complex biological phenomena from simpler precursors over time. In your hands, I can't see it working any differently.\n \n I realize that you say \"rational\" evolution is RM+NS. What's consistent with this is denying IC, not defending it. So, I don't think you're being consistent.\n \n \nAdaptive evolution vs ?\n\n \n Vs. non-adaptive evolution. Genetic drift, which isn't a matter of natural selection at all, but has nothing to do with adaptations to an environment, is a real feature of evolution. Particularly in small populations, it is very important.\n \n \nIf a system can be modified to work better in different conditions it can happen by rational evolution and it is adaptation. There is nothing wrong with that model.\n\n \n Agreed. I wouldn't call it \"rational\" evolution. All that evolution means is genetic change within a population over time. This doesn't have to involve adaptation, as in genetic drift. But RM+NS is indeed a fully adequate model for explaining how organisms come to be adapted to their environments.\n \n \nFurther IC is not restricted to bio-chemestry but is less intuitive at larger levels because by definition larger levels are abstract derivations of smaller patterns. The functions on the macroscopic level far fewer than they are made out to be hence the massive number of strawmen against IC. For instance wings, legs, and flukes are all quite diverse in their application but the function is the same, a limb held rigid by bones and motivated by contracting muscles tied to central control system.\n\n \n So wings, legs, and flukes are also irreducibly complex? Come on, Freedom. Adopt a !@#% consistent position. Is it possible for a wing to come about through an entire sequence of random mutations, subject to natural selection? If so, then IC is baloney, because it says such things are too complex to have evolved.\n \n You can't say \"RM+NS produces IC systems.\" That makes a mockery of the whole argument.\n \n \nIt's not confusing unless you assume the same dichotomy that behe does, and that implicitly atheist do.\n\n \n I'm not even raising Behe's false dichotomy of evolution and design. I'm raising the logical dichotomy of RM+NS being sufficient to account for complex biological phenomena or not being sufficient to account for them.\n \n What you seem to be saying is, RM+NS are sufficient, and that IC proves it -- which is confusing insofar as the entire point of IC is to show that RM+NS are not sufficient.\n \n \nIC isn't a theory of life, it doesn't explain how RM and NS jointly produce anything, it identifies the possible interactions of NS and RM which indicates what they will produce and why (or why not). None of those selections do anymore to explain the system or reduce the odds of it's formation than random mutation does because with respect to the system they are just as random.\n\n \n So your IC means something completely different than what Behe's IC means?\n \n Beyond that, I just don't understand what you're driving at here. Selection isn't supposed to reduce the odds of a system's formation. It's supposed to take the genes that formed a system and promote them through or purge them from a gene pool.\n \n Moreover, it isn't random with respect to the system, insofar as whether the system gets promoted or eliminated is determined by the system itself at work under the selective conditions. The appearance of the system in the first individual is random; whether it spreads through or disappears from the population is not.\n \n How does any of this have anything to do with IC?!?\n \n -sigh-\n \n This is why I quit with you before, Freedom. I can't see how you're being consistent. I cant even see what your point is anymore. What's wrong with evolutionary theory? And how does irreducible complexity save it rather than defeat it?",

   "On average, siblings only share 50% of their genes with each other. That's significant. \n\n What is that supposed to prove?\n \n \nThose combinations of 'sets' of chromosomes can number into the billions, though. Whole chromosomes don't stick together and recombine with each other... they split up into many, many bits when they recombine. You either don't know what you are talking about or you're just arguing nonsense for the sake of arguing. \n\n Yes there are many combinations, and that matters, but there are only a certain number of pieces. Thus there will be for all practical purposes millions of repeated phenotypes.\n \n \nSure they can. It's called mutation. If you don't think that mutations can create novel functions, then I really don't what to say.\n\n They can, it's just not evolution (as we both agree).\n \n \nThey can cause enzymes to change their shapes in such a way that the cleave molecules they couldn't do anything with before. They can cause pigments to become sensitive to light wavelengths they couldn't detect before. (See Carroll's discussion of birds and ultraviolet vision, of which more later. Again, sorry I can't provide the page number, since I lost the book.) And more and more.\n\n All the examples that have ever been brought to my attention (and I think I know what enzyme you are talking about) have been vastly hopeful in their proposed implications. For instance if we are talking about the same enzyme it function was to cut the types of molecules it did, all the excitement was over a adaptation to a new variant of chemical.\n \n It's like saying a human can eat a dish he never has before has just evolved a novel function.\n \n \nBut that, of course, is where natural selection kicks in. To say that mutation can produce a novel function (or failure of function) for a single individual is not to say that the function has \"evolved.\" For that, we need to show that random mutation plus natural selection made the function common amongst an entire population (or made it uncommon, or even drove the population extinct).\n\n I do not claim that the fact that benefit becomes prominent is unexplained. As I explained in my posts on guided genetic change/ guided mutation natural selection post production is useless to explain production, and thus no single mutation can be produced by evolution even if it was selected.\n \n \nThis is just false. No one says that random mutation is evolution, or that it can produce complex structures at a single stroke. No one says that natural selection even has anything to work on without variations ultimately derived from mutation, and it certainly doesn't call forth mutations of either a helpful or hurtful kind.\n\n The only other alternative is that no one has argued against IC, which you might be able to convince me of given the right definition of argue :p\n \n\n I know of no evolutionary biologist who claims otherwise. It's time for you to put up or shut up on this score.\n\n ... No. I am owed much explanation on this subject, far too many have quit and never retracted their assertions. I maintain that those things have been implied to me several times in an attempt to defend against IC, if you want to argue about IC you can but if you just want to argue about who said what you can go find one of the half a dozen threads in which I have said the exact same thing consistently in as many ways as I could think of. If you think you can argue against IC without implying one of those fallacies then it wouldn't matter if anyone else said them would it, that would just mean they were wrong if they did.\n \n \nhave pointed to speculation that the TTSS evolved from the flagellum as proving that the smaller system couldn't be the actual ancestor of the flagellum. That might be so, but other scientists have suggested quite the opposite, and in any case, it actually doesn't matter if today's TTSS is the ancestor of anything. It is absolutely correct to argue to that the existence of the TTSS today doesn't answer the question of how the flagellum actually evolved. But that overlooks why the ID camp believed that irreducible complexity was so critical in the first place: They thought it proved that the flagellum couldn't have evolved. It doesn't. [boldface added]\n\n Hey thanks for finding that, databed didn't believe me when I told him some thought the ancestry was the reverse.\n \n \nHe is not trying to argue that the flagellum evolved from the TTSS\n\n Good, then tell that to all those who brought his dialog to me to to answer 'how'. If he was not claiming that a flagellum could have evolved the way he described then I have no problem with him but that would mean those who posted his dialog as support were mistaken about what he was saying (as well as I).\n \n \n, and he certainly isn't claiming so on the basis of the fact that it could have. Nor is he arguing the opposite on the same absurd basis. He is arguing that it is in fact possible for a part of the flagellum to have had a different but selectively advantageous function, such that a subsequent mutation could alter the structure and hence its function -- and therefore the claim that this could not happen is false.\n\n I know that, but it betrayed a misunderstanding of that which he was arguing against. IC doesn't say that co-option or mutation could not happen they are just saying they are random and useless to explain the system any more than random mutation alone would.\n \n \nFirst, is the phrase \"could not\" similarly useless? Because that's what Behe is saying about evolution\n\n That's because evolution isn't \"anything that produces A\" it's an explainable process which produces viable biological structures.\n \n You can make a dent in a car by hitting it with a rock or by smashing it with feathers. If someone says smashing it with feathers won't do it; and in response someone tells him 'but you admitted a rock could do it!'\n \n \nSecond, it is not the case that \"there is no limitation on what mutations can happen.\" There are only 20 amino acids to code for. There are only 4 DNA bases to arrange into the triplets that will do the coding, and the code is degenerate. Some mutations are even functionally invisible. All in all, there are only so many ways for a mutation to happen, given the genes that are already present. It is not the case that mutation means just anything can happen.\n\n I repeat there is no limitation on what mutations can happen.\n \n \nWait a minute, selection has nothing to do with what, exactly? I thought that \"rational evolution\" meant random mutation, plus natural selection? A rather confusing way of putting it.\n\n The random appearance of a novel function through any combination of random occurrences in any order.\n \n \nWhat does that even mean? Natural selection does not \"form novel systems?\" Blech. Just more vagary. And yes, I know you've tried to explain it before, I just don't think you've succeeded.\n\n Have you read my posts on guided genetic change/ guided mutation?\n \n \nThis -- random mutation plus natural selection -- is evolution. Now, of course, nature isn't static, so what's advantageous or disadvantageous can vary. Still, that's the basic model, as I understand it. For complexity, all that's needed is whole series of mutations and their selection events. That's what needs to be reconstructed.\n\n Complexity matters to the odds, not the nature of the process. I have also had this discussion on what evolution means a half dozen times, wrote paragraphs on why 'a change in allele frequencies' is a double standard definition, and even more on why no single mutation selection pair is explained by the process (i.e. the odds have to be considered). I would do is copy that and paste it here, but since you can go read it without the confusion of duplicating information (which is actually against forum rules I think) I won't.\n \n \nThey won't deal with that odds calculation because it's a straw man. The odds are insurmountable, if and only if one presumes that one goes from not even one component of what is now the flagellum to the flagellum. But since no one makes this presumption, that odds calculation is irrelevant.\n\n As far as I am concerned you just implied (b).\n \n \nI wold highly recommend them, especially Carroll's The Making of the Fittest, especially his discussion of the evolution of ultraviolet vision in birds. I'd also recommend Dawkins' discussion of the Lenski experiment in The Greatest Show on Earth, noting particularly that one strain of the bacteria developed the ability to feed on citrate while the others did not.\n \n UV vision in birds and citrate-feeding: novel functions that initially occurred in an individual via random mutation and subsequently spread through whole populations via natural selection. Novel functions, in short, that evolved, by our very definition of evolution in terms of the combination of random mutation and natural selection.\n\n Doesn't sound worth it. For one your sad attempt to label them novel functions is a count against them, and I suspect they do the same.\n \n I am only going to say this once in this string: A modification of a function which allows another application is not a novel function. If you think it is I point you to the immune system and bacteria which constantly change, mutations which allow the bacteria to infect new hosts and the immune systems to fight new contagions. Novel application? Yes, Novel function? No.\n \n \nI'm not sure what you mean by \"prediction\" in the context of reconstructing past events.\n\n A theory has predictions, it doesn't matter if the results have already happened; it is a prediction in the context of a proposed set of causes.\n \n \nBeyond that, all I can say is, we are clearly in agreement that a single random mutation cannot create something as \n complex as a flagellum.\n\n That's the easy part. Now you have to realize that co-option does not alter the odds.\n \n \nAll I'm trying to argue, and all that evolutionary theorists argue too, is that an entire series of random mutations, each of which is subject to natural selection, can eventually produce a complex feature like a flagellum as a feature of a whole species of organisms.\n\n And a whole series of random mutations each, which didn't really have any selection could do it too with the exact same probability. Why? because any selections that happened to occur before the system existed were, what did you like to say? 'indifferent' to the non-existent (system to be explained).\n \n I see no purpose in separating a string of unselected mutations, it simply doesn't matter if 25 mutations ended up in some sequence or 10 slightly larger ones. I refer to them collectively as a mutation.\n \n \n \nWhat Behe claims is that such a sequence of mutational and selective events can not bring about a flagellum.\n\n No he argues, as I argue; that the selection events are irrelevant and anyone who comes up with any explaination is claiming the exact same thing as someone who omitted the meaningless selection events. (spontaneous generation)\n \n \nIt's always a matter of temporal analysis.\n\n All IC does is prevent someone from contradicting this premise.\n \n \nExcept that you're using exactly Behe's conceptual weapon. In his hands, it is a weapon to argue that random-mutation-plus-natural-selection cannot produce complex biological phenomena from simpler precursors over time. In your hands, I can't see it working any differently.\n\n Why is that an exception? It's the false dichotomy that's the mistake not IC :p\n \n \nI realize that you say \"rational\" evolution is RM+NS. What's consistent with this is denying IC, not defending it. So, I don't think you're being consistent.\n\n lol, I must not know what I'm saying? Not going to buy that any time soon. I am talking about IC, IC is not a 'problem' for rational evolution; the only way I see that happening is redefining one of those terms, which isn't really changing my position it would just make me pick new words.\n \n \nVs. non-adaptive evolution. Genetic drift, which isn't a matter of natural selection at all, but has nothing to do with adaptations to an environment, is a real feature of evolution. Particularly in small populations, it is very important.\n\n Ah, the old change in allele frequencies definition :p\n \n \nAgreed. I wouldn't call it \"rational\" evolution.\n\n I wouldn't either if so many people didn't use evolution to mean irrational evolution.\n \n \nAll that evolution means is genetic change within a population over time.\n\n Then it's a description of a phenomenon and not an explanation.\n \n \nSo wings, legs, and flukes are also irreducibly complex?\n\n No, muscles, bones, and nervous systems are.\n \n \nIs it possible for a wing to come about through an entire sequence of random mutations, subject to natural selection?\n\n Yes, and everything is subject to natural selection, that doesn't mean selection will explain anything. There can be pressure without elements it applies to, elements which trigger no pressure, and irrelevant pressures.\n \n \nbecause it says such things are too complex to have evolved.\n\n No it says novel functions can't evolve, and armed with that premise behe makes an argument that the odds without evolution are pretty bleak.\n \n \nYou can't say \"RM+NS produces IC systems.\" That makes a mockery of the whole argument.\n\n Good thing I didn't say it. RM + NS is the explainative non-random process. RM which happens at the same time as natural selection is not necessarily that process.\n \n Simple categorical differentiation.\n \n \nI'm not even raising Behe's false dichotomy of evolution and design. I'm raising the logical dichotomy of RM+NS being sufficient to account for complex biological phenomena or not being sufficient to account for them.\n\n If by complex biological phenomenon you mean the formation of a novel function, than it is not sufficient to account for them. You must make an argument to the odds if you can because the evolutionary process is powerless to explain in such cases.\n \n \nSo your IC means something completely different than what Behe's IC means?\n\n No it's exactly the same. Now I have added a few concepts of my own which more precisely model the IC argument, and give more rigorous definition to the analysis. A further provision I demand is that IC means what it's defined as in his books, not what he or anyone else might mistakenly say about it in a live conversation or how they might try to redefine it in some delusional fit.\n \n \nBeyond that, I just don't understand what you're driving at here. Selection isn't supposed to reduce the odds of a system's formation.\n\n True, at worst it; like random mutation; would be indifferent to their formation.\n \n \nMoreover, it isn't random with respect to the system\n\n To the existing system.\n \n \nWhat's wrong with evolutionary theory?\n\n Nothing, the problem is what people claim it explains.",

   "All the examples that have ever been brought to my attention (and I think I know what enzyme you are talking about) have been vastly hopeful in their proposed implications. For instance if we are talking about the same enzyme it function was to cut the types of molecules it did, all the excitement was over a adaptation to a new variant of chemical.\n \n It's like saying a human can eat a dish he never has before has just evolved a novel function.\n\n \n Which just goes to show how vague and arbitrary the delimitation of \"novel function\" is.\n \n First, the analogy. If someone has never eaten blueberries or bok choy before, and then he does, I can see no reason to call this a \"novel function\" in evolutionary terms; these are perfectly normal foods for a human being, regardless of whether this or that individual happens to eat them. If, however, no one has ever eaten nightshade berries or rhubarb leaves without lethal consequences before, and then someone does, it seems to me that this is a \"novel function\": a function that is new to any member of the species. If it provides a fitness benefit, then it will spread, and the species has evolved.\n \n Now similarly, if a microbe develops the capacity to subsist on citrate rather than just glucose thanks to an enzymatic mutation, why shouldn't this be thought of as a \"novel function?\" Yes, it had the capacity to eat already, in an entirely general sense of \"eat.\" But it could not eat citrate -- note: it's not merely the case that this microbe did not eat citrate, but that no microbes of its kind could eat citrate. We are talking not about a mere incidental change in the details of an individual's life history, but of a change in capacities for any member of that species. Seems novel to me.\n \n And similarly again, if a bird develops the capacity to see ultraviolet light because one of its opsin proteins has mutated, why shouldn't this too be thought of as a \"novel function?\" Yes, the bird could \"see,\" speaking generally. But it could not see in the ultraviolet spectrum at all, and now it can. This is not just a change in what the bird does see, as a matter of fact, but a change in what it can see, as a matter of capabilities. Quite novel.\n \n (And again: I highly recommend Carroll's book. This discussion is quite, ahem, illuminating, if you'll pardon the pun. All that has to happen for a bird to see ultraviolet light is a single change in a single protein, and there are multiple ways that the relevant gene can mutate in order to code for that change in the protein. Factor in generation time and fecundity, and it's pretty clear how random mutation will provide the change eventually. -- Which is probably why the evolution of ultraviolet vision appears to have happened independently in a dozen or so separate lineages of birds.)\n \n In short, I think the distinction of what is and what isn't a \"novel function\" is being made arbitrarily.\n \n \nI do not claim that the fact that benefit becomes prominent is unexplained. As I explained in my posts on guided genetic change/ guided mutation natural selection post production is useless to explain production, and thus no single mutation can be produced by evolution even if it was selected.\n\n \n And here I think we're back to my ongoing complaint about the vagueness of \"production.\"\n \n For starters, no one claims that evolution \"produces\" mutations. That's actually backwards: mutations, when they are selected, produce evolution.\n \n As for the beneficial feature itself, it is \"produced\" in an initial individual by mutation, as I already noted. (\"Sure they can. It's called mutation.\") The enzyme necessary for an E. coli to eat citrate is produced by a mutation. The opsin necessary for a bird to see ultraviolet light is produced by a mutation.\n \n Further, the beneficial feature is \"produced\" as a feature of the species by subjecting that initial mutation to natural selection. Since eating citrate and seeing ultraviolet evidently enable the organisms with such capacities to survive and reproduce more effectively than those without them, the features spread through the population. \n \n If what you're concerned about is explaining why a given mutation itself occurs, in a given individual, well, this is not what evolution even attempts to explain. Molecular genetics is working on it, though.\n \n If what you're concerned about is why a beneficial mutation is in fact beneficial, evolution can seek to explain this. It can attempt to show how a given feature affects fitness, given the actual environmental conditions in which that feature occurs.\n \n I guess I don't see why any of this presents some grand problem for evolution, such that it doesn't explain how features get \"produced.\" In individuals, explaining how mutations occur is a task for genetics. In populations, explaining how an initially aberrant feature becomes a normal feature of the species is a task for evolution. Where's the problem?\n \n Ultimately, it seems like a semantic point, concerning \"produce.\" Evolution -- random mutation plus natural selection -- \"produces\" the features of species. It does not \"produce\" the features of individuals, save insofar as they are typical members of their species.\n \n \nThe only other alternative is that no one has argued against IC, which you might be able to convince me of given the right definition of argue :p\n\n \n Actually, there is at least one other alternative: Perhaps you haven't understood what others are saying as well as you think you do.\n \n Perhaps?...\n \n \n... No. I am owed much explanation on this subject, far too many have quit and never retracted their assertions.\n\n \n Perhaps they never retracted their assertions, because they felt no need to, insofar as they did not say what you thought they said.\n \n Perhaps?...\n \n \nI maintain that those things have been implied to me several times in an attempt to defend against IC, if you want to argue about IC you can but if you just want to argue about who said what you can go find one of the half a dozen threads in which I have said the exact same thing consistently in as many ways as I could think of.\n\n \n Actually, I'll provide as much evidence for my claim as you just did for yours by saying that I don't think other people -- not you, but other people -- were saying what you thought. And they've done so at least half a dozen times.\n \n Moreover, I would really appreciate it if you would provide me some direct quotations of published authors in the field to give me an idea of what experts you're talking about. People on this board are one thing. Professional biologists (some on this board are, I gather, but the great majority are not) are another. Show me what experts in the field say what you charge them with saying.\n \n \nIf you think you can argue against IC without implying one of those fallacies then it wouldn't matter if anyone else said them would it, that would just mean they were wrong if they did.\n\n \n Indeed. But the fact is, I don't think you have shown that anyone is guilty of such fallacious reasoning in criticizing IC. Not even once. In fact, your use of Ken Miller as an example of it was entirely erroneous, for example. I think the passage I quoted amply demonstrates your mistake. Confronted with it, you respond:\n \n \nHey thanks for finding that, databed didn't believe me when I told him some thought the ancestry was the reverse.\n\n \n Well, great, databed made a mistake about the ancestry -- maybe. But the plain fact is, you've misunderstood Miller's argument. And still do (which is why I'm loathe to attribute an error to databed):\n \n \nGood, then tell that to all those who brought his dialog to me to to answer 'how'. If he was not claiming that a flagellum could have evolved the way he described...\n\n \n Actually, he was claiming that it could have evolved that way!\n \n Or that it could have evolved in a similar way, maybe even in the reverse sequence. Regardless of which sequence is right, he is arguing that the flagellum could have evolved via such a sequence, against someone, namely Behe, who claims that it could not have evolved according to any such sequence. But he still isn't arguing that the hypothetical sequence he offers is the way the flagellum did evolve, just because it's a way the flagellum could have evolved. Meanwhile...\n \n \n...then I have no problem with him but that would mean those who posted his dialog as support were mistaken about what he was saying (as well as I).\n\n \n It is great that you admit being mistaken about Miller here. But you're actually mistaken about the nature of your mistake, as indicated in my preceding paragraph.\n \n So I actually think that those who've been posting about Miller on this thread in the past -- including databed, for example -- probably understand his argument better than you do.\n \n \nI know that, but it betrayed a misunderstanding of that which he was arguing against. IC doesn't say that co-option or mutation could not happen they are just saying they are random and useless to explain the system any more than random mutation alone would.\n\n \n And that's an utterly preposterous claim. Dawkins defeated it in advance 25 years ago with with his discussion of the \"methinks it is like a weasel\" program in The Blind Watchmaker.\n \n At every single step, any beneficial random mutation will be preserved and/or promoted by non-random natural selection. The final outcome -- which can only be described as \"final\" with hindsight -- is the result of a whole sequence of mutations and selections occurring over vast stretches of time with huge numbers of generations.\n \n \nThat's because evolution isn't \"anything that produces A\" it's an explainable process which produces viable biological structures.\n \n You can make a dent in a car by hitting it with a rock or by smashing it with feathers. If someone says smashing it with feathers won't do it; and in response someone tells him 'but you admitted a rock could do it!'\n\n \n Ah, so evolution does \"produce\" after all!... And indeed it does, with precision. It isn't just \"anything,\" as you note.\n \n Behe, however, is claiming that evolution cannot be productive, at least at the level of biochemical pathways and cellular ultrastructure.\n \n \nI repeat there is no limitation on what mutations can happen.\n\n \n And I repeat that this is not true. Mutations are always constrained by real circumstances. If you want to claim that there is no limitation, fine, in an abstract logical sense, there is none. But I'm not talking about speculative metaphysics. I'm talking about real material genes, subject to real material conditions around them. There are only so many ways a given gene can actually mutate.\n \n \nI have also had this discussion on what evolution means a half dozen times, wrote paragraphs on why 'a change in allele frequencies' is a double standard definition...\n\n \n Sorry, but it's not. Evolution in general just means change in allele frequencies in a population over time. Many such changes are adaptive, in that they have a bearing on the fitness of the members of the population; these changes are where natural selection is relevant. But not all changes in allele frequency are adaptive. They're evolution, just not adaptive evolution.\n \n If you have a problem with calling genetic drift \"evolution\"... well, this does seem to be about semantics, at times....\n \n \n...and even more on why no single mutation selection pair is explained by the process (i.e. the odds have to be considered).\n\n \n What does this even mean? That evolution is somehow supposed to explain why a mutation occurred as it did, and was subject to the selective conditions that it was?\n \n I'm sorry, Freedom, but I just don't see what you're even demanding of evolution. What should it explain that it fails to explain?\n \n As I've already said, explaining mutations is a task for genetics. Explaining how selective conditions affect mutations is a task for evolution. Not sure what the problem is.\n \n \n[Quoting me:]\nThey won't deal with that odds calculation because it's a straw man. The odds are insurmountable, if and only if one presumes that one goes from not even one component of what is now the flagellum to the flagellum. But since no one makes this presumption, that odds calculation is irrelevant.\nAs far as I am concerned you just implied (b).\n\n \n And as far as I am concerned you completely misunderstand how natural selection works.\n \n There is no claim at any point in what I wrote that natural selection is working on anything that does not yet exist. Mutation A occurs, and natural selection can act on its product(s). If it gets preserved, for whatever reason, then when mutation B occurs, natural selection can act on its product(s), too -- and on the combination of its product(s) and A's. And when mutation C occurs... and so on and so on.\n \n The odds against mutations A, and B, and C, and D, E, F, ..., Z all occurring in one fell swoop are astronomically high, especially if the idea is that their end result is selectively beneficial. The odds of A occurring at one time and being beneficial, however, are much better. Still small, but over enough generations, quite likely. If it occurs, then natural selection kicks in, preserving and spreading it through the population over time, if it's beneficial. And once that happens, A is no long merely a possibility whose odds of occurring are relevant any longer: it's a fact with probability 1/1. It is against this backdrop that we must then consider the odds of B occurring. This is again going to be a small probability, but as with A, over enough generations, the odds are surprisingly good. If B occurs, then natural selection again kicks in, preserving and spreading it if beneficial. Odds now no longer relevant: it's a fact with probability 1/1. Consider this against C.\n \n It is always possible for a further mutation to come along and undo A and its benefit. If such a mutation occurs, however, natural selection once again kicks in. If A is indeed beneficial, then there will be selection against mutations that undo it, and they'll get purged from the gene pool, often quite hastily.\n \n This is just the standard evolutionary account of how random mutation and natural selection work together over time to produce complex adaptations in whole species of organisms. It does not presume (b), i.e., that natural selection can operate on something that doesn't even exist yet. In each case, the mutation must happen first in order for natural selection to begin.\n \n To say otherwise is a patently absurd misrepresentation of the entire model.\n \n \nDoesn't sound worth it. For one your sad attempt to label them novel functions is a count against them, and I suspect they do the same.\n\n \n I repeat that I think your characterizations of what does or doesn't qualify as a \"novel function\" are completely arbitrary. You provide no rationale, just a declaration that my characterization is sad.\n \n \nI am only going to say this once in this string: A modification of a function which allows another application is not a novel function. If you think it is I point you to the immune system and bacteria which constantly change, mutations which allow the bacteria to infect new hosts and the immune systems to fight new contagions. Novel application? Yes, Novel function? No.\n\n \n And I am going to say this as many times as necessary in this string: Your use of \"novel function\" is totally arbitrary. This just recapitulates the problem in terms of a distinction between function and application.\n \n Are herbivory and carnivory functions, or just applications of the function of heterotrophy? Are heterotrophy and autotrophy functions, or just applications of the function of producing organic compounds?\n \n I don't think this distinction, as you've drawn it, holds up to an ounce of scrutiny.\n \n I would say that if the members of species can't do x, but then some individual member of the species gains the ability to do x, then x represents a quite \"novel function\" with respect to that species.\n \n \nThat's the easy part. Now you have to realize that co-option does not alter the odds.\n\n \n Natural selection alters the odds, according to exactly the model laid out a few paragraphs above. You don't just multiply all these improbabilities against each other and wind up with an impossibly improbable event. You take an improbable event, select for it once it occurs so that it goes from improbable to normal, and then repeat.\n \n The odds calculations don't work anything like you seem to think they do.\n \n \nAnd a whole series of random mutations each, which didn't really have any selection could do it too with the exact same probability.\n\n \n Not true, for exactly the reasons outline above. The mutations do get selected, just not according to what their \"final\" product will be. To wit:\n \n \nWhy? because any selections that happened to occur before the system existed were, what did you like to say? 'indifferent' to the non-existent (system to be explained).[boldface added]\n\n \n Suppose, for simplicity, that a flagellum needs mutations A, B, and C to occur. Until A, B, and C have all occurred, there is indeed no selection on a flagellum.\n \n But if mutation A occurs, while B and C have not yet, there can certainly be selection for whatever A's own benefits are. Then, if and when B occurs, there can be selection for B's benefits, as well as for any benefits that might accrue to A+B. And if and when C occurs, there can be selection for C's benefits, as well as for any benefits from A+C, from B+C, or from A+B+C.\n \n It is certainly possible that, prior to A+B+C's existence, there is already a selective condition that would make having a flagellum an advantage. But to say that a selective condition already obtains is not the same as saying that natural selection is already operating. If the relevant mutations don't occur, then whatever the conditions, there's nothing for them to work on.\n \n I repeat: I do not know of any evolutionary biologist who has said otherwise. I do not even know of any anti-IC poster on this board who has said otherwise.\n \n In my view, the fact that you think people are saying otherwise indicates a serious misunderstanding on your part. It in no way indicates a problem with evolutionary theory or the critique of IC.\n \n \nI see no purpose in separating a string of unselected mutations, it simply doesn't matter if 25 mutations ended up in some sequence or 10 slightly larger ones. I refer to them collectively as a mutation.\n\n \n But Freedom, each mutation in the string is selected!!!\n \n Please note: they are only selected after they occur, not before. This is why it is illegitimate to lump them as simply \"a mutation.\" You can't collapse time like that! Each mutation in the string must be selected on its own merits or on the merits of how it works in combination with previously selected mutations.\n \n \nNo he argues, as I argue; that the selection events are irrelevant...\n\n \n Sorry, but again, the selection events are not irrelevant. They have a huge effect on how the probabilities work, whether you and Behe like it or not.\n \n \n...and anyone who comes up with any explaination is claiming the exact same thing as someone who omitted the meaningless selection events. (spontaneous generation)\n\n \n Meaningless? Pshaw.\n \n The sequences of random mutations and non-random selection events is precisely what renders evolution meaningful. You are the one ignoring the selection events as irrelevant and then collapsing whole sequences of mutations into \"a mutation.\" If anything qualifies as \"spontaneous generation,\" that's it.\n \n \nAll IC does is prevent someone from contradicting this premise.\n\n \n Ridiculous. All you've done above is taken an entire sequence, cut out the half that is selection, and then condensed it into \"a mutation.\" IC is completely atemporal. Your own unwillingness to consider sequences of mutations as sequences, as you did above, is a perfect demonstration.\n \n \nAh, the old change in allele frequencies definition :p\n\n \n Like it or not, that's the general definition. Some of those changes are adaptive, and some aren't. Both are evolution.\n \n If you think genetic drift is a crock, then I welcome your careful analysis of why.\n \n \nNo, muscles, bones, and nervous systems are.\n\n \n Really? Gee, why not muscle cells and bone cells and nerve cells? This is just more arbitrariness.\n \n \nNothing, the problem is what people claim it explains.\n\n \n And I don't think people are claiming what you think they are.\n \n -----\n \n I'm going to quit here.

The centrifugal force would have been enormous, and the winds would have been 5,000 miles per hour from the Coriolis effect! (From -Astronomy Magazine 1992.)\n\n Alright, how much longer is a day getting per unit time, what is the cause and is it constant. Provide data not just references.\n \n \n 10. The Sahara desert has a prevailing wind pattern which almost always blows in the same direction, west. This wind pattern blows the hot air next door and kills all the plants creating more desert. After studying it for years the scientist say the Sahara desert is probably 6,000 years old. If the Earth is millions of years old, why is the largest desert only 6000 years old? Not a problem if you believe in creation. Its a problem for evolution because they believe the Earth is billions of years old, so why is their not a larger desert? (From- HBJ Earth Science)\n\n Scare tactics, deserts aren't contagious. Surface geology comes and goes at a much faster pace than the age of the system or the planet.\n \n \n 11. Did you know oil is under extreme pressure? Sometimes 20,000 pounds per square inch. The people who study this say the oil has pressure because of the weight of the rocks above it. However the oil pressure is greater than the the weight of the rocks, so this should have cracked the rock and equalized the pressure in less that 10,000 years. Why do we still have oil pressure if the Earth is millions of years old? The answer, it is not, the Earth is less than 10,000 years old, which is what the bible says. This is a serious problem for evolution which states the Earth is billions of years old. (From- Creation Ex Nihilo) \n\n You expect me to believe that the oil pressure exceeds the rock pressure yet the system is still static for 10,000 years?\n \n \n 13. The oldest living tree (and organism) in the world is a bristle cone pine in southern California and it is about 4000 year old. If the Earth is billions of years old, why is the oldest organism only 4000 years old? I believe that a little less that 6000 years ago their was a flood, and that tree could not grow until that flood was over. (From- Science text book)\n\n That is the silliest in a line of very silly claims. Living organisms die... of old age. That we have such an amazing organism as these such ancient plants is the unusual part, not that there isn't anything older.",

According to the links Stonewall provided, the average age of a spiral galaxy is 1-2 billion years, however the age of our galaxy has been estimated at 5 billion years old, which according to your science it should not be a spiral galaxy anymore, so maybe you should not trust your sources Matthew.\n 2. Stonewall, your link says that Davis was wrong about the age of the universe, when your scientists are missing 988 second stage stars, and 5033 third stage stars!? Davis' calculation might have not been perfect, but according to your link's data, the universe can only be 20,000 years old at the maximum, far closer to the biblical time line.

It would not prove that God made everything, but it would prove that it does not take 100,000 years for stars to evolve. Freedom, if their was a red star in between it, where did it go?\n 4. Because Stonewall, according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy. By now the Earth's molten core should be cool by now (and Ganymede' should too even with the sacrificing of orbital potential energy ) if the solar system is billions of years old.\n 5.

   "Freedom, yes every supernova has not been observed and supernova explosions don't stay that way forever, but the amount of observable supernova should be far, far greater than it is.\n\n Please demonstrate that.\n \n You need to show that supernova's occur (within detectable distance) at a known rate. This is important because the bright flashes which indicate a super-nova anywhere, even in other galaxies do not necessarily constitute the gas clouds we can see; the stellar clusters in other regions of space in other galaxies and even our own could be much more prone to super nova due to their age or composition.\n \n Then you need to establish how fast they cool, which again is not necessarily constant; the famous supernova they show you at the observatory could be young or they could be from very large heavy super nova with lots of thermal inertia.\n \n Only with both the local(observation range for the gas clouds) explosion rate and cooling time could you predict how many clouds would still be glowing at any given time. Since you say this number is greater than expected I suppose you have the data I have mentioned.\n \n \nFreedom, if their was a red star in between it, where did it go?\n\n Our system is moving and so are other objects in our galaxy. Such an alignment is no more permanent than mars and Jupiter appearing in the same sky. I hope you realize it was just a hypothesis. I did not say red star I said red gas, an object the size of a star would have the most appalling odds of ever eclipsing another star much less for any significant time.\n \n \nBy now the Earth's molten core should be cool by now (and Ganymede' should too even with the sacrificing of orbital potential energy ) if the solar system is billions of years old.\n\n I heard that there was excessive nuclear decay in earths core, and again you will have to demonstrate that gravitational tides aren't 'good enough' for Ganymede.\n \n \n6. Yes Freedom I was assuming the rate was constant, and I gave you the max distance from the Earth with it, but if you don't want to to assume the rate was constant the according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy, so the moon would have been traveling even faster away from the Earth, meaning that it would be in the Earth at the minimum distanced.\n\n Wait, so you are saying that if the rate isn't constant it's increasing? If that is the cause then it follows it could have a root or a constant asymptote much later than 1.3 billion years ago. I don't want to go down that road however because I still have not heard your explaination for this effect, what does the loss of energy have to do with anything?\n \n \n 8. Once again the law of Thermodynamics states an object losses energy so the Earth's magnetic field should to weak to support life. \n\n It also states that object may gain energy if another object transfers it. You are not applying the laws correctly if you think it means every phenomenon slowly decays to zero. You can have two completly dead hulks orbiting each other forever in space without ever losing any of the potential energy between them.\n \n \n 9. Stonewall, let me point out that your link says the their was a 14 hour day 4.6 billion years ago, then it says it was a 22 hour day 370 million years ago, so which is it?\n \n Why can't it be both? A trend of longer days is not inconsistent because 24 hours is greater than both those points.\n \n \n 10. They are if their is a prevailing wind pattern.\n\n Why don't you pick a patch of windy ground, and dump 10 tons of dry sand on it. I assure you that if it wasn't desert it won't become desert just because you did that. A desert isn't defined by sand or wind but a lack of moisture. No moisture leads to no or few plants, no or few plants means no top soil which means dust and sand due to wind. You are basically identifying a result of a desert as it's cause.\n \n Now in the Sahara there is too much sand to shake a stick at and you do see it burying previously 'nice' places, but they are equivalent to a square mm in the example above, if a bad sandstorm hit the Nile the Nile would simply wash the sand out to sea and if you look at the size of the underwater sand back in the mediterranean you might suspect that has happened.\n \n \n 13.

It wasn't. It formed slowly just like everything else in the universe, and looked very different in the distant past. \n \n By the way, our galaxy is more like 13 billion years old. \n \n \n2. Stonewall, your link says that Davis was wrong about the age of the universe, when your scientists are missing 988 second stage stars, and 5033 third stage stars!?

Freedom, yes every supernova has not been observed and supernova explosions don't stay that way forever, but the amount of observable supernova should be far, far greater than it is. \n\n \n Davies' work was a complete sham, making up numbers that would fit his pre-determined conclusion. \n \n And it's obvious you didn't read the entire link at all (probably because you don't actually care). But read section 10.3 that explains why we can't see all the remnants (the number one reason being dust and interstellar matter blocking them.)\n \n Supernovae, Supernova Remnants and Young Earth Creationism FAQ\n \n \n \n3. Your link's only plausible explanation is that everyone saw it on the horizon and made it look red ,and that is a huge assumption. And what about the ones that did see it red? Where they all wrong? It would not prove that God made everything, but it would prove that it does not take 100,000 years for stars to evolve. Freedom, if their was a red star in between it, where did it go?\n\n \n How are the other answers not plausible? \n \n \n1. The ancient astronomers who described Sirius as red were looking at it when it was low on the horizon, so its reddening was due to the earth's atmosphere. The \"red Sirius\" refers to observations made at the heliacal risings and settings of the star in Greek and Roman society (Ceragioli 1996; Whittet 1999).\n \n 2. Not all ancient astronomers recorded that Sirius was red. Many ancient sources confirm that it was white or bluish white 2,000 years ago (van Gent 1984, 1989).\n \n 3. The bright star visible without a telescope, Sirius A, is not a white dwarf. Sirius A has a white dwarf companion star, Sirius B, which has nothing to do with what ancient astronomers saw. Hovind did not check the facts behind his claims.\n \n 4. Even if Sirius had changed color, it would not support creationism or a young earth in any way. It would simply mean that one observation was unexplained. \n\n \n And you already answered your own question... yes, if they saw it as red, they were incorrect, because it was only the earth's atmosphere causing the reddening. And even if it changed, it wouldn't prove anything at all about the evolution of stars.\n \n \n4. Because Stonewall, according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy. By now the Earth's molten core should be cool by now (and Ganymede' should too even with the sacrificing of orbital potential energy ) if the solar system is billions of years old.\n\n \n Says who? You are basically saying that 4+ billion years is such a long time that anything should have cooled off by now, but you have done absolutely no calculations. Why don't you show the calculations? Make sure to factor in the initial temperature, external energy sources such as the sun and collisions, and the insulating effects from the cooling of the crust.\n \n And so what? Am I to believe that Adam and Eve were trotting around on a big, molten fireball?\n \n \n5. According to you scientist the rings of Saturn formed several billion years ago when a moon like object broke up and formed he rings, yet the rings according to your link can only be 100 million years old.\n\n \n It also says that the age of the rings has nothing to do with the age of the planet. I ask again, so what? Here is the whole answer, since you seem to have had trouble reading it the first time:\n \n \n Saturn's rings may be less than 100 million years old (Cuzzi and Estrada 1998). However, that says nothing about the age of the planet. The rings could have formed when Saturn captured a small moon that fell within the Roche limit (the distance below which moons will be pulled apart by tidal forces). This could have happened any time in Saturn's history.\n \n Saturn's moons shepherd the particles that make up the rings, preventing them from drifting and maintaining the gaps between the rings. This shepherding may allow the rings to be much older than 100 million years. (However, the color of the rings suggests not much more than 100 million years' worth of accumulated dust.) \n\n \n \n6. Yes Freedom I was assuming the rate was constant, and I gave you the max distance from the Earth with it, but if you don't want to to assume the rate was constant the according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy, so the moon would have been traveling even faster away from the Earth, meaning that it would be in the Earth at the minimum distanced. \n\n \n You used terrible creationist math. 3 inches/year = .25 feet/year.\n \n Minimum current distance from earth to moon: 221,208 miles = 1,167,978,240 feet.\n \n 1,167,978,240/0.25 = 4,671,912,960 years. That is the number of years you would have to go back (assuming a constant recession rate) to see the moon at earth's surface, not 1.3 billion. \n \n Since Earth is only 4.54 billion years old, you have no argument.\n \n \n7. Stonewall, your link is using a argument similar to saying that a watermelon is blue on the inside until you cut it open. You can't prove the Oort cloud exists, and I can't prove it doesn't exist, and I have a question, if the Kuiper Belt gets it's supply from the Oort cloud, where does the Oort cloud get it's supply from?\n\n \n They come from the same place that planets come from. Clouds of dust and matter left over from supernovas. Gravity causes the matter to collapse into bigger and bigger rocks... when closer to the sun, there is going to be a greater amount of these rocks, and they will collide and form planets, but farther from the sun (where the Oort cloud is), there is less matter, and you will have a lot of smaller rocks instead of a few big ones. At that distance, they are going to be ice balls, and as the link says, it's only when gravity throws them into a weird orbit that they get close enough to the sun to start melting (that's what the tail is... the comet melting). \n \n \n8. Once again the law of Thermodynamics states an object losses energy so the Earth's magnetic field should to weak to support life. \n\n \n Once again, you are just throwing around 'thermodynamics' like nobody is going to question you. I'm an engineer and very familiar with thermodynamics. It doesn't help you in this case. You haven't established a rate of 'energy loss', you haven't shown what strength is actually needed for life, you haven't shown what the initial strength was...\n \n And again, you failed to acknowledge the link I gave, which shows that there is no exponential decay of the magnetic field as well as all the mistakes made in the model you are referencing. \n \n \n9. Stonewall, let me point out that your link says the their was a 14 hour day 4.6 billion years ago, then it says it was a 22 hour day 370 million years ago, so which is it? \n\n \n Uh, both. It says that the rotation of earth has slowed down, so of course the day would have been shorter in the past. Also, keep in mind, the 'seconds' in the link I gave are 'arc-seconds.'\n \n \n10. Why is their no evidence of a larger desert? They are if their is a prevailing wind pattern.\n\n \n The earth is always changing. From climate and weather to continental drift. The age of the Sahara has nothing to do with the age of the earth as a whole, just like the age of a wart has nothing to do with the age of the person who has it.\n \n \n11. No, I don't, because you won't consider anything that suggests a creator. Stonewall, once again your link has made many assumptions, with no supporting facts. \n\n \n A more detailed answer, with references (all you had to do was click the hyperlink on the original page I gave you):\n \n How Good are those Young-Earth Arguments: Hovind's 'Proofs' (continued)\n \n \n12. So I guess in those millions of years of sitting up right, nothing (earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, dinosaurs) moved it?\n\n \n Millions? It wasn't even thousands! Why bother responding when you don't read the links?\n \n \nAs for Malone's \"problem\" with the \"thousands of years\" for the tree to remain upright for \"slow accumulation\" to occur, it is a non-problem - he is simply interpolating the average depositional rates for an entire formation down to the scale of metres. This is not the correct way to do it, because individual beds can be deposited rapidly (say, sands and mud during a levee breach), and then little deposition can occur for a long time (e.g., a soil horizon), as is observed in modern river floodplain environments where trees commonly occur. In short, he is assuming conventional geologists would interpret the occurrence the simple way he has interpolated - they do not. \n\n \n \n13. Then why is their no unbroken record for several million yeas, since no major disaster occurred?\n\n \n Are you really asking why there aren't any living creatures that are millions of years old? \n \n And what is this about no 'major' disasters occurring in the last several million years? There are natural disasters all the time, in every part of the world... and creatures in the wild don't generally last very long (and definitely not THAT long) because future generations would have evolved to be better adapted to the environment and more efficient at using resources. These generations would out-compete the old organisms until the old ones died. That's why you don't see thousand year old trees and other plants/animals very often.\n \n Also, nice job avoiding my link again, as it showed the example of the King Clone creosote bush in the Mojave Desert which is 11,700 years old.",
