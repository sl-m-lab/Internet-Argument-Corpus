   "In 1987, Dr. Stephen Rubin of Whitman College conducted a ten-state study of sex abuse cases involving school teachers. He studied 199 cases. Of those, 122 male teachers had molested girls, while 14 female teachers had molested boys. He also discovered that 59 homosexual male teachers had molested boys and four female homosexual teachers had molested girls. In other words, 32 percent of those child molestation cases involved homosexuals. Nearly a third of these cases come from only 1-2% of the population.\n \n Dr. Judith Reisman, in her book, Kinsey, Crimes & Consequences, describes the research done by Dr. Gene Abel. This researcher compared the molestation rates of self-confessed homosexual and heterosexual child molesters. In a sample of 153 homosexual molesters, they confessed to a total of 22,981 molestations. This is equivalent to 150 children per molester. Self-admitted heterosexual molesters admitted to 4,435 molestations. This comes to 19.8 victims per molester. Dr. Abel concluded that homosexuals \"sexually molest young boys at an incidence that is occurring from five times greater than the molestation of girls.\"\n \n This high rate of molestations by homosexuals is consistent with other studies conducted during the past several decades. Here are just a few studies that show homosexuals molesting children at epidemic rates:\n \n In 1984, a Vermont survey of 161 adolescents who were sex offenders found that 35 of them were homosexuals (22%). (Wasserman, J., \"Adolescent Sex Offenders-Vermont, 1984\" Journal American Medical Association, 1986; 255:181-2) \n \n In 1991, of the 100 child molesters at the Massachusetts Treatment Center for Sexually Dangerous Persons, a third were heterosexual, a third were bisexual, and a third were homosexual. (Dr. Raymond Knight, \"Differential Prevalence of Personality Disorders in Rapists and Child Molesters,\" Eastern Psychological Association Conference, New York, April 12, 1991)\n \n Drs. Freund and Heasman of the Clark Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto reviewed two studies on child molesters and calculated that 34% and 32% of the sex offenders were homosexual. In cases these doctors had handled, 36% of the molesters were homosexuals. (Freund, K. \"Pedophilia and Heterosexuality vs. Homosexuality,\" Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, 1984; 10:193-200)\n \n Exposed: Homosexual Child Molesters",

   "Did you miss the big picture here. If 32% of them were homosexual that means 68% of them were heterosexuals which means that heterosexuals are a very big threat to children. The only thing you have done here is point out the threat to society posed by heterosexuals. Maybe we should keep those sick heterosexuals away from children. Not only are they trying to recruit children into the destructive heterosexual lifestyle but they are the vast majority of child molesters.",

   "Why repeat a proven lie? Because it suits your bigoted agenda.\n \n \"Lou Sheldon proves that &#8216;preachers do lie&#8217;\n \n Traditional Values Coalition continues to use studies it acknowledged as wrong\n April 8, 2005 --Recently, Traditional Values Coalition head Lou Sheldon gave a speech to Kingdom Builders Christian Center, a predominantly African-American church in Norcross, GA. During this speech, he remarked that &#8220;preachers don&#8217;t lie.&#8221; He also accused the gay community of exploiting the civil rights movement for its own purposes, claiming that they have &#8220;highjacked the freedom train to Selma.&#8221;\n Lastly, Sheldon encouraged members of the congregation to buy his book, The Agenda, which speaks of a supposed gay conspiracy.\n \n However, there are questions, not only about some of sources in The Agenda but also about whether or not the Traditional Values Coalition has been citing work it acknowledged as incorrect.\n \n In various parts in The Agenda, Sheldon cites work from Paul Cameron. Cameron is a researcher who was dismissed from the American Psychological Association in 1984 after it was discovered that he was misrepresenting the work of his colleagues to demonize the gay community.\n Last year, when confronted by its usuage of Cameron&#8217;s work by the Boston Globe, the Traditional Values Coalition removed his work from its webpage. According to the Boston Globe, Traditional Values Coalition spokesperson Daniella Lopez said Cameron&#8217;s work was mistakenly placed on the organization&#8217;s webpage. However, Sheldon has made no effort in removing Cameron&#8217;s work from The Agenda. In one chapter, Sheldon cites Cameron&#8217;s discredited studies on four occasions even mentioning Cameron by name. Copies of The Agenda, complete with Cameron&#8217;s citations are continuing to be sold even now. \n Also, a quick look on the Traditional Values Coalition webpage brings up even more questions. Comparisons between passages in the TVC report Exposed: Homosexual Child Molesters and Cameron&#8217;s piece, Child Molestation and Homosexuality, show that they are oddly similar: ... \"\n \n \n http://www.freewebs.com/palmettoumoja/Lou%20Sheldon%20proves%20that%20pastors%20do%20lie.pdf",

   "More from the OP link:\n \n Homosexuals seldom openly admit that they want to sexually assault children, but their literature and their actions tell another story. In the January 1-8, 2001 issue of The Weekly Standard, author Mary Eberstadt exposed the clear link between homosexual activism and the growing North-American Man- Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) movement. Writing in \"'Pedophilia Chic' Reconsidered: The taboo against sex with children continues to erode,\" Eberstadt notes:\n \n The reason why the public is being urged to reconsider boy pedophilia is that this 'question,' settled though it may be in the opinions and laws of the rest of the country, is demonstrably not yet settled within certain parts of the gay rights movement. The more that movement has entered the mainstream, the more this 'question' has bubbled forth from that previously distant realm in the public square.\n \n Eberstadt notes that the book, Male Inter-Generational Intimacy: Historical, Socio-Psychological, and Legal Perspectives edited by pedophile Edward Brongersma is currently available in the \"gay/lesbian\" sections of bookstores like Borders. This book, which openly promotes pedophilia, was first published in the Journal of Homosexuality in 1990. The Journal is edited by John DeCecco, a psychologist at San Francisco State University. DeCecco is a board member of the Dutch pedophile journal, Paidika.\n \n The homosexual magazine Guide published a pro-pedophile editorial in its July, 1995 issue. In referring to pedophiles as \"prophets\" of sexual freedom, the Guide editorialist wrote: \"We must listen to our prophets. Instead of fearing being labeled pedophiles, we must proudly proclaim that sex is good, including children's sexuality. . . . Surrounded by pious moralists with deadening anti-sexual rules, we must be shameless rulebreakers, demonstrating our allegiance to a higher concept of love. We must do it for the children's sake.\"\n \n Parents are correct to be concerned about homosexuals sexually assaulting their children. The Boy Scouts of America, for example, is right to prohibit homosexuals from membership or leadership positions. It is evident from the statistical evidence and news reports of child molestation cases, that homosexuals pose a clear and present danger to children. Our laws and social policies should protect children, not cater to the whims and sexual desires of sexual predators. We must oppose homosexual activism \"for the children's sake.\" \n \n Beware of homosexual pedophiles.",

   "So, now the myth that homosexuals cannot be pedophiles has been summarily demolished. \n \n Add that to the thread that the data that indicates that rates of HIV infection among gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are more than 44 times higher than rates among heterosexual men and more than 40 times higher than women, and you have a very disturbing picture of homosexuality in America.\n \n U.S. Gay Men's Astonishing HIV/STD Rates | The Bilerico Project\n \n And we're just beginning to paint the mosaic of the unhealthy homosexual lifestyle.\n \n People need to wise up and teach these issues in high school and college so that the politically correct crowd doesn't get away with any more of their lies to impressionable young adults who might be considering dabbling in gay sex hedonism.",
