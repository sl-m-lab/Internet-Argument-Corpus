However, between those two statements and Bush's record with Iraq and N. Korea, I don't see how Iran can interpret it in any other way than \"Get nukes now.\" If Iran wasn't already scouring the black market for nukes, or trying to cut a deal with some friendly nuclear capable country, than this should push them over the edge.",

The primary argument against it seems to be that there are not enough Euros floating around out there to rpelace the dollar as the petro trading currency of choice. \n \n I keep hearing \"The burden on the EU would be more than it could take\".\n \n While I certainly am no expert in EU monetary policy, it seems to me that being forced to print (generate) trillions of Euros without inflationary pressure is the kind of \"burden\" the EU can take. I would even go so far as to say that the generation of a trillion or more high value Euros would be seen in some quarters as a benifit for the EU. Look what it did for the US. It allowed us to trade worthless bits fo paper for goods. Anymore, we don't even bother with the worthless bits of paper.",

   "I've read the Scoop essay at George's link. I found the thesis plausible, well referenced, and well written.\n \n I've snipped the following bit because I don't believe this claim:\n \n Recent research has shown that the Bush administration was deeply implicated not merely in permitting the attacks of September 11, 2001 to happen, but in actually organizing them. \n \n That's an allegation too far for me.\n \n \n The rest of a long and complex argument seems to boil down to the following:\n \n 1). The American government believes that development of a nuclear capability by Iran, is a challenge to the security of the United States and a threat to 'world peace'. \n \n 2). If Iran abandons the petrodollar and sets up an oil bourse in euros, the American economy will suffer a crippling hit.\n \n 3). For these reasons the United States, in partnership with Israel, intends to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iran. \n \n 4). This will take the form of an air attack using tactical nuclear weapons. \n \n 5). Turkey will be bribed by promises of US economic and technological assistance to allow the strike force to take off from its airfields.\n \n I've oversimplified, but these 5 points seem to summarise the plot.\n \n Should all this come to pass, a severe political and economic crisis affecting the entire world could rapidly transpire.

Whether its pure author speculation or an extension of theory based on the US government removing Saud elite, including members of Bin Laden's family from the US following 9/11, I don't know, I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist, but this administration is so secretive and has such a long list of revealed lies to the public at this point nothing would surprise me. \n \n With Bush public popularity so low and opinion on his handling of Iraq even lower, current White House propaganda on the military option for Iran seems to be falling flat on its face. I have no doubt that such a plan is in place, we have a large enough military to have such plans for every nation not kowtowing to US demands, but considering world economic and political chaos such an attack would create, it would take lunatics to make such an attack. Unfortunately, based on our invasion of Iraq and other foreign policy, US leadership hasn't been playing with a full deck for quite some time. \n \n The Petrodollar issue is pure fact.",
