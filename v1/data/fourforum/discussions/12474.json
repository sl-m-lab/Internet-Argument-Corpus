By the mid 1830s temperance had become a mass movement of the middle Class. Temperance was not, as is sometimes thought, the campaign of rural backwaters; rather, temperance was on the cutting edge of social reform and was closely allied with the antislavery and women's rights movements. Always very popular, temperance remained the largest enduring middle-class movement of the nineteenth century ('Leaven 1978, 1984; Tyrell 1979; Gusfield 1986; Rumbarger 1989; Blocker 1989).Temperance, Prohibition, Alcohol Control\n \n As you can see, some ministers were involved in the movement, but in no way was religion the reason or basis for the movements growth or the ultimate passage of the 18th amendment.",

I don't know what your point is by bringing up those issues, but feminists of the time were indeed a big part of the prohibition movement.
