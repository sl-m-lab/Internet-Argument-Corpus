   "Tomorrow--Wednesday, April 13--a Senate subcommittee is holding the first hearing this year about marriage between same-sex couples. \n \n They will be hearing from biased witnesses about how marriage between same-sex couples will hurt our country. Senators will also be hearing a story from a woman who lost health care insurance for her partner because of the passage of a state constitutional amendment defining marriage. \n \n Please, let them also hear from YOU. Click here today to ask your Senator to recognize the dangerous and hidden consequences of writing discrimination into the Constitution, and remind them to vote NO on any legislation that will discriminate against same-sex couples. \n \n And, if you have a personal reason why you are involved in this fight, this is the time to tell it! Personal stories make a huge difference to legislators by not only setting your message apart from all of the other, identical messages, but also by reminding our leaders that their actions have an impact on real people every day. Click here to take action and tell your story. \n http://www.hrcactioncenter.org/campaign/Stop_FMA_05\n \n Some background about tomorrow's hearing: The hearing will be held by the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, led by the new chairman Sam Brownback (R-KS). The hearing is focused on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and, for all practical purposes, on the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA) as well. While the Republican leadership in the Senate has indicated that a vote on the FMA will not come until next year, this may be the first in a series of several hearings that the Republican leadership will call in preparation of the vote and to gauge how this issue plays with their constituencies. That's why our strong response is so critical. \n \n Senator Brownback hails from Kansas, the 17th state in the nation to pass legislation banning marriage between same-sex couples. It is in these states where our fight for equality is most heartrending--where neighbors are pitted against one another, and the struggle happens over dinner tables and in school yards. And it is also where we have the our greatest opportunity: for discussion and understanding, for introducing ourselves to one another, for telling our stories. \n \n Just as we will continue to fight and win national battles as we did last year when we defeated the Federal Marriage Amendment, we must also bring our actions and resources to bear in states and cities across the country. \n \n So, today, please let the Senator from Kansas know that fair-minded people across the country are standing up against discrimination. Your voice and your actions today will continue a record of testimony that will ensure that the hateful rhetoric we expect tomorrow will not go unanswered. \n \n Thank you for continuing the fight against discrimination. Your responsiveness to our e-mails about taking action truly makes a difference.\n \n \n Sincerely,\n \n \n Joe Solmonese\n HRC President",
