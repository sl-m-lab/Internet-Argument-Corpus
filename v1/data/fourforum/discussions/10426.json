Currently I would liken us to squabbling infants.\n\n i wouldnt speculate too much about looking forward, but we can compare where we are today to where we were a few hundred years ago. there was an age past when we would link the presence of an old woman in a town to the crops being diseased, and drown or hang her. there was an age when diseased people were treated by burning them and there belongings. there was an age when your success in life was solely dependant on the family you were born into. so where we are today is definitely a step in the right direction.\n \n generally, the people today with the most influence are those who are highly motivated by self improvement and charity. there are more people who make a positive impact on the trends and culture of the world than those who make a negative impact, and there are far more people who have good intentions for the future of humanity than those who aim to see it destroyed. i would dare say that the very attitude of seeing the world as a bad place instead of a good place is the perspective that the destructive few adopt. how mature or childish the world is will always be a matter of opinion, and it reflects the character of the person with that opinion rater than the reality of the world itself\n \n \nIf in your second para, you are believeing the bible as being literally true then I sympathise with you and there is not a lot of point about arguing as to who and how it was written for what purposes.
