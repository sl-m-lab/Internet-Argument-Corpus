   "  Ohio joins states declaring gun independence \n Ohio has joined with several other states, including Montana and Tennessee, in asserting independence from federal gun laws with the introduction of House Bill 315. This bill, sponsored by Representatives Morgan and Martin, would make all guns manufactured wholly within the state of Ohio exempt from federal gun regulations provided sales are within state boundaries.\n \n The Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco, and Explosives has claimed that they have the authority through the right to regulate interstate commerce because even exclusive intrastate sales of guns have an effect on gun sales nationwide.\n \n With two states already having passed similar bills, and many more being considered, this will not be an issue that can be ignored much longer and will likely head for the courts as the issue of states rights vs federal authority are ironed out.\n \n HB 315 OHIO FIREARMS (Morgan, Martin) To provide that ammunition, firearms, and firearm accessories that are manufactured and remain in Ohio are not subject to federal laws and regulations derived under Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce and to require the words \"Made in Ohio\" be stamped on a central metallic part of any firearm manufactured and sold in Ohio. \n\n This isn't really about guns, it is about Congress usurping authority that belongs to We the People or the States through the Commerce clause.",
