   "Human evolution - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n 'The dominant view among scientists concerning the origin of anatomically modern humans is the \"Out of Africa\" or recent African origin hypothesis, which argues that H. sapiens arose in Africa and migrated out of the continent around 50-100,000 years ago, replacing populations of H. erectus in Asia and H. neanderthalensis in Europe. Scientists supporting the alternative multiregional hypothesis argue that H. sapiens evolved as geographically separate but interbreeding populations stemming from a worldwide migration of H. erectus out of Africa nearly 2.5 million years ago.'\n \n What do they mean by: '...that H. sapiens arose in Africa...'?\n \n Interesting map:\n http://www.scotese.com/satlanim.htm",

I mean, sprouting a feather is a small change, right?\n \n Well, no. As he went on to point out, a feather is a pretty complex structure. It's not going to form all in one go. The best evidence we have points to a gradual evolution of the skin, with horny platelets developing progressively elongated spines - most likely useful for heat retention, a bit like mammalian hairs - which as time went on became more and more barbed and complex, their branches interlocking to hold in more heat and repel water. Their use in flight almost certainly came very late in the day: feathered dinosaurs diversifying into birds rather like mammals diversified into bats.\n \nside note: Every time I look at a bird, I can't help but feel that something is missing - hands. \n\n Good point. There's no good reason why at least some birds couldn't have been designed with hands - but there is every reason, from an evolutionary perspective, to predict that we will never ever find a species of bird with hands as well as wings, because birds' wings are their hands (just like bats' wings are theirs). Evolution works by tweaking and distorting what's already there, and a bird sprouting an extra pair of fully formed limbs doesn't count as 'tweaking' :)\n \n Now, I'm sure that statement is ringing all kinds of alarm bells, right? If evolution can't be expected to cause a creature to sprout fully-formed extra limbs, how did creatures get their limbs in the first place?\n \n The key here is to understand that the basic body plans formed very, very early on, when the differentiation of creatures' bodies was much simpler. Wiggly worms with wiggly legs, so to speak. Around about the Cambrian a riot of bodyshapes burst onto the scene, most of them dying out leaving only a few to inherit the earth in various descendant forms, with those crude wiggly appendages refined into fins, limbs, feet, hands...\n \n The wonderful thing about evolution, to me, is that it means you can look at any animal and say \"I know why you are the way you are, rather than something else.\" Nothing is arbitrary. The giraffe's neck has the same number of bones as yours for a reason. Animals with four legs have four legs for a reason. We suffer from scurvy if we don't eat fruit for a reason (at some point our distant ancestors - long before we diverged from the other apes - lived on such a fruit-rich diet that the loss of a critical Vit-C manufacturing gene went unnoticed by natural selection, and now we're stuck that way). The idea that evolution somehow diminishes the wonder of the natural world strikes me as simultaneously ludicrous and deeply sad.",

   "What sort of geological changes would have made dinosaurs change into birds?\n Why would they need to go from ground dwelling to avian?\n\n \n Have you read Origin of Species? The language is a bit old-fashioned but I found it very illuminating, particularly when it comes to thinking about the forces driving diversification. The essential point is that diversification maximizes the biological potential of any given habitat. For instance, X amount of savanna can only support Y buffalo before they start to starve, but the same savanna can also support Z gazelle, because gazelle can eat shorter grass. Not to mention giraffe which can feed off the trees.\n \n In other words, it might not be a question of dinosaurs needing to change into birds, but of those dinosaurs which became more bird-like being able to exploit an otherwise empty ecological niche, allowing them to flourish alongside and diverge from their cousins.",

   "Yeah, that graphic struck me as odd...\n but, I don't think it's 'fiction', just incomplete...sort of like the biblical explanation of 'The Beginning' in Genesis. :p\n \n Sort of but not exactly because the graphic is based on scientific evidence whereas the bible is here-say.\n \n What doesn't make sense to me is the 'fact' that 99% of life on earth was wiped out by some event 65 million years ago but it took several billion years to get to that stage of evolution.\n How was it possible to not only reclaim that level of life on Earth in so short a period of time but for such an 'advanced' animal as humans to come into existence?\n\n \n A lot of time in those billion years was making the earth actually habitable by anything. There are several theories what caused the extinction 65 million years ago (@60% of living things died) from meteor impact, volcanic eruptions to name a couple. 250 million years ago @ 90% of life was wiped out and there have been at least 3 other mass extinctions. In each instance the earth didn't go back to a swirling mass of molten rock. Some of the repercussions of these events while taking out a large chunk of existing life helped the evolution of new life once things settled down.\n \n As for fish becoming mammals below are several links on both\n \n The Great Mystery: Current Arguments\n \n The Great Mystery: Background\n \n \n West Australian Fossil Find Rewrites Land Mammal Evolution\n Early Whales Gave Birth On Land, Fossil Find Reveals\n Details Of Evolutionary Transition From Fish To Land Animals Revealed",
