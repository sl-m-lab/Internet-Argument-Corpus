   "I want to apologize for my behavior recently in this forum. I had \"plagiarized\" some internet material on the myths and wrongfulness of same sex marriage and homosexuality (as Ladywolf discovered about 2 weeks ago). Most of the time I try to \"use my own words\", but there have been instances where I have failed to do this. I ment nothing bad by this (I felt like some of these assertions were written better than I might have done). I will not do this anymore. Again, I apologize to all involved.PS: I have come to really enjoy coming to this board. The wide variety of opinions and stands here make this a very interesting place to come to. emoticon_xgood ",
