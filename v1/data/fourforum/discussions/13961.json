   "City of Beverly Hills Shuns Pageant Queen Lauren Ashley - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n \n A day after an interview with Miss Beverly Hills 2010 Lauren Ashley was published on FOX News in which she said she opposed gay marriage and said gays should take heed of what it says in Leviticus, the city of Beverly Hills says she is a fraud and disavows any connection with her, the L.A. Times reports:\n \n Laurenashley \"In a statement Wednesday, the city said it was shocked by Ashley's description of herself as 'Miss Beverly Hills.' The city 'does not sponsor a beauty pageant and has no association with Miss California USA,' the statement said. 'As such, there should be no individual claiming the title of Miss Beverly Hills.' The city's statement said Ashley lives in Pasadena and 'does not represent Beverly Hills in any capacity.' ... 'We are dismayed by any potential association with the city of Beverly Hills, which has a long history of tolerance and respect,' Mayor Nancy Krasne said....Beverly Hills said it had contacted pageant officials to determine how to prevent any future beauty contestants from claiming the title of Miss Beverly Hills.\"",
