   "KOPEL: Sotomayor targets guns now - Washington Times\n \n \nPerhaps the most startling aspect of the Supreme Court opinions in McDonald v. Chicago was the dissenters' assault on District of Columbia v. Heller. Not only did Justice Stephen G. Breyer vote against extending the Second Amendment to state and local governments, he also argued forcefully and at length for overturning Heller and, therefore, for turning the Second Amendment into a practical nullity. Ominously, Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined the Breyer dissent - contradicting what she told the U.S. Senate and the American people last summer.\n \n Regarding the key issue in McDonald - whether the 14th Amendment makes the Second Amendment enforceable against state and local governments - Justice Sotomayor resolutely refused to tell the senators how she might vote. So in voting against incorporating the Second Amendment, Justice Sotomayor was not inconsistent with what she had told the Senate. But regarding Heller, her actions as a justice broke her promises from last summer.\n \n The Breyer-Sotomayor-Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissent urged that Heller be overruled and declared, \"In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self defense.\"\n \n Contrast that with her Senate testimony: \"I understand the individual right fully that the Supreme Court recognized in Heller.\" And, \"I understand how important the right to bear arms is to many, many Americans.\"\n \n Yet her McDonald opinion shows her \"understanding\" that those many, many Americans are completely wrong to think they have a meaningful individual right.\n \n To the Senate Judiciary Committee, Justice Sotomayor repeatedly averred that Heller is \"settled law.\" The Associated Press reported that Sen. Mark Udall, Colorado Democrat, \"said Sotomayor told him during a private meeting that she considers the 2008 ruling that struck down a Washington, D.C., handgun ban as settled law that would guide her decisions in future cases.\"\n \n So by \"settled,\" she apparently meant \"not settled; should be overturned immediately.\"\n \n In the McDonald case, the Breyer-Sotomayor-Ginsburg dissent recapitulated various arguments that had been made in Heller by the dissenting justices. The dissenters also said Heller should be overturned because some law-review articles had criticized Heller. If criticism by a handful of law-review articles were the criterion for overturning a precedent, almost every major Supreme Court precedent would be overruled.\n \n Besides, there also are plenty of law-journal articles that praise Heller and point out serious logical and historical errors that the anti-Second Amendment dissenters made in Heller.\n \n Another argument that Breyer-Sotomayor-Ginsburg made for getting rid of Heller pointed to a McDonald amicus brief by some legal historians. That brief discussed the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which was enacted by Parliament after the despotic Stuart monarchs were ousted in the Glorious Revolution. The Declaration guaranteed \"[t]hat the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\" This guarantee was an ancestor of the Second Amendment.\n \n According to the historians, the declaration didn't actually mean that Protestants (98 percent of the population) could have arms for their defense. It meant that Parliament could arm the militia.\n \n Those English parliamentarians apparently had great difficulty in straightforwardly expressing what they meant, as they forgot to say \"Parliament\" and \"militia\" in their new law about Parliament arming the militia.\n \n It's a creative argument, but it's not new. The same theory had been presented to the court in the Heller case.\n \n Justices Breyer and Ginsburg should be free to rail against Heller all they want. They never promised anyone that they considered Heller to be \"settled law.\" To get confirmed to the court, they never touted their understanding of \"how important the right to bear arms is to many, many Americans.\" Sonia Sotomayor, however, promised to do one thing and then did the opposite.\n \n The Sotomayor switcheroo highlights the necessity for the Senate to conduct a serious inquiry into Solicitor General Elena Kagan's views on the Second Amendment. Later this week, I will testify to the Judiciary Committee about Ms. Kagan's record on guns during her service in the Clinton administration. That record hardly inspires confidence that she has any respect for the rights of gun owners, but perhaps she has changed.\n \n The Senate should not let itself by pacified with non-answers, platitudes and evasions.\n \n Heller is one vote away from being overruled. Many senators from both parties strongly support the Heller decision and the right to bear arms. That's why 58 of them joined an amicus brief in McDonald urging that the Chicago handgun ban be declared unconstitutional.\n \n With four justices over the age of 70, President Obama may have several more Supreme Court appointments in the next two to six years. The Sotomayor experience shows why it's crucial for senators to demand serious answers about where a nominee stands on the Second Amendment.\n\n \n Nice to know the enemy is showing their true colors. Unfortunately the enemy in question is in too high a position of authority to be dealt with effectively.",

   "The holding in Heller was based largely on historical analysis by non-historians.\n\n \n How about the historian who said gun ownership in Colonial America was extremely rare, almost nonexistent, based on his record searches, and then refused to turn over his research notes, claiming the records had been destroyed.\n \n \nStates have a long history and tradition of exercising legislative power over firearms.\n\n \n They also had a long history and tradition of exercising legislative power over blacks and freed slaves.

[the NRA has] misled the American people and they, I regret to say, they have had far too much influence on the Congress of the United States than as a citizen I would like to see -- and I am a gun man. I have guns. I've been a hunter ever since I was a boy.\" \n (The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, December 16, 1991)\n\n \n AND post an unprovable quote:\n http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndfra.html\n \n David Kopel puts Burger's words in the proper context:\n Warren Burger Second Amendment\n \n \n The idea that the Second Amendment guarantees the right of an an individual to own a gun is a \"fraud\" according to the late Supreme Court Justice Warren Burger. Burger's pronouncement is quoted prominently in current advertising by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, the tax-exempt arm of Handgun Control, Inc.\n \n Not surprisingly, the advertisements don't cite the place where the former Chief Justice set forth his analysis of the Second Amendment. \n \n Because the Chief Justice never said anything about the Second Amendment when he was actually on the Supreme Court. (Half a dozen Supreme Court decisions affirm that the Second Amendment is an individual right.) THE SUPREME COURT'S THIRTY-FIVE OTHER GUN CASES: WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID ABOUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT\n \n Nor did Mr. Burger write anything about the Second Amendment in scholarly legal or historical journal. (The scholarly consensus is virtually unanimous that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right).\n \n No, the Chief Justice wrote about the Second Amendment in Parade magazine, in a short article in January 1990. (A shorter version was later printed in some newspaper editorials.) This article represents, in a sense, the high-water mark for anti-Second Amendment \"scholarship.\" Because the gun prohibition lobbies will continue to promote the late Mr. Burger's \"research\" about the Second Amendment.\n \n Most of the late Mr. Burger's Parade essay was devoted to the historical background of the Second Amendment. He offered a useful and generally accurate history of the Second Amendment, and explained that the authors of the Second Amendment believed that America should rely for its defense on \"a well-regulated militia\" of individual citizens, rather than upon a professional uniformed standing army.\n \n Justice Burger then stated that today, \"sadly, we have no choice but to maintain a standing national army while still maintaining a 'militia' by way of the National Guard...\" Here, Justice Burger's reasoning stumbled.\n \n First of all, the National Guard is plainly not the \"militia\" envisioned by the Second Amendment. The Guard was created by Congress' war power, not by its militia power. National Guard weapons are directly owned by the federal government, which means that the Guard firearms cannot be the \"arms\" protected from federal interference by the Second Amendment. \n \n More fundamentally, the National Guard is a uniformed, elite force. A \"select militia\" was precisely what the authors of the Second Amendment intended to avoid; they instead wanted a militia made up of all able-bodied males.\n (SNIP) continue article...\n \n Yet the anti Constitutionalists quote only part of the magazine article and ignore the racist comments, much like the KKK would use, which would show exactly where and why those anti gun, anti 2A are headed with their agenda.\n \n Hey brady and star gazer, how many members do you have left now after HELLER AND MCDONALD?\n \n How long before you start using Kagan quotes or are you afraid her words would disqualify her? Why don't you post her thesis and other comments as a recommendation of her acceptance to the SC? Is it because you know it is a disqualifying factor and not advantageous?\n \n Why don't you quote the \"wise Latino\"? hummmmmmm\n Maybe some more Kagan?",

   "Let me put in my two cents on this thread. The thread started IMO by raising a question for me: Can you square what Sotomayor said during the confirmation process with what she says in McDonald? I can&#8217;t do it, and I invite anyone here to try to do so for me. \n \n I watched some of her confirmation hearings, and I thought we had some certainty when Sotomayor said she understood the individual right recognized in Heller. Of course many people were biased against her from the start, and they claimed that she would try to overturn Heller at her first opportunity. I feared she would try to do so, although no one really knew because ever since the Bork nomination candidates feel empowered to hide their beliefs from the Senate. So I watched closely as Sotomayor repeatedly assured her skeptics that she considered Heller &#8220;settled law.&#8221; Consider some of what she said: \n \n \n\"I understand the individual right fully that the Supreme Court recognized in Heller,\" she testified. \"I understand how important the right to bear arms is to many, many Americans.\"\n\n \n Justice: Impeach Sotomayor? | Richmond Times-Dispatch\n \n Now in response you may say, correctly, &#8220;understanding it&#8221; is not saying that one agrees to be bound by it. So see the following:\n \n \nTo the Senate Judiciary Committee, Justice Sotomayor repeatedly averred that Heller is \"settled law.\" The Associated Press reported that Sen. Mark Udall, Colorado Democrat, \"said Sotomayor told him during a private meeting that she considers the 2008 ruling that struck down a Washington, D.C., handgun ban as settled law that would guide her decisions in future cases.\"\n\n \n KOPEL: Sotomayor targets guns now - Washington Times (emphasis added)\n \n See also:\n \n \nSen. Patrick Leahy asked her, \"Is it safe to say that you accept the Supreme Court's decision as establishing that the Second Amendment right is an individual right?\" \n \"Yes, sir,\" she replied&#8230;. \n\n \n Jonah Goldberg: &#8216;Kagan the UnBorkable&#8217; shows why process a sham - Omaha.com\n \n And remember that her claimed respect for Heller and the individual RKBA it recognized were certainly sold to us by her ardent supporters:\n \n \n\"I do not see how any fair observer could regard (Sotomayor's) testimony as hostile to the Second Amendment personal right to bear arms, a right she has embraced and recognizes,\" he (Leahy) said.\n\n \n Jonah Goldberg: &#8216;Kagan the UnBorkable&#8217; shows why process a sham - Omaha.com (emphasis added)\n \n (I encourage you to read this article in full. You may not agree with the conservative slant of the op ed, but ask yourself whether he is spot on about how much of a sham the nomination process has become) \n \n These are the answers&#8212;and the spin put on them by her ardent supporters&#8212;that secured her elevation to the purple (or, in this case, the black robe). Contrast the above with what she said in McDonald (through concurrence with Justice Breyer):\n \n In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self-defense. There has been, and is, no consensus that the right is, or was, &#8220;fundamental.&#8221; No broader constitutional interest or principle supports legal treatment of that right as fundamental. To the contrary, broader constitutional concerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against that treatment. McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 31 (2010)\n \n Now let me say that I do not like the confirmation process we now have. Ever since Bork&#8217;s nomination fight candidates (and their handlers) have been scared to reveal what the person actually thinks. I would prefer that a nominee actually be required to answer questions that give us insight into how they will rule rather than claiming a right to hide their true views from us. But if we do keep the current system of hide-and-seek (in vain) for a nominee&#8217;s views&#8212;then the system should at least demand that when a nominee is forced to answer questions that he or she does not lie to us. \n \n So, is it fair to say Sotomayor lied to us during the nomination process? I think it is. It&#8217;s one thing to say &#8220;I made a mistake, I now believe my earlier views were wrong, and others have convinced me that I was wrong and I have changed my mind.&#8221; But, to my knowledge, since donning the black robe Sotomayor has not claimed to have had a &#8220;road to Damascus&#8221; style epiphany that caused her to doubt the convictions she claimed during her nomination. So is there any way to say it other than she lied to gain confirmation?\n \n Elena Kagan just ended her successful evasion of Senate inquiry, and she is now a SCOTUS justice. During the confirmation process she also said the following:\n \n \n\"I think that Heller is settled law and Heller has decided that the Second Amendment confers such an individual right to keep and bear arms,&#8221; she said, citing a Supreme Court decision that overturned D.C.&#8217;s handgun ban.\n\n \n Kagan presents a test for the NRA as Senate confirmation assured - TheHill.com\n \n The $64 question now is: Has she lied to us like Sotomayor did? \n \n I hope not, but only time will tell&#8230;.",
