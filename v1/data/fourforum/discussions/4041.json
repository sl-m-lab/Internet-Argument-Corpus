   "This is the current slogan of the Maryland school system. I think it's a load of BS. Since when is school about acheivment? I thought we were supposed to be learning. I know plenty of kids who got straight A's last year who couldn't even PASS last year's exams. The point is that they didn't master the material or have any foundation of understanding on it, they just knew enough to pass the tests, and that's all the school system cares about.\n \n Tests:\n Obviously tests were created with good intentions. The school system wanted to be able to know and report how much a student was learning. The problem, along with the ones above, is that the focus of school is now tests. Instead of tests testing what we learn, we are taught what is on the test. I will routinely ask a question and be told, \"that won't be on the test so you don't need to know that\". So I'll tell them I'd still like to know and they'll be like \"but, but, you don't HAVE to know it\". Not all teachers are like that but most are. And last year's French teacher routinely said, \"don't ask questions, if you listen to me, you'll pass French, I'm trying to help you pass\". So I asked her what if we don't want to just pass, but actually be able to speak the language better at the end of her course. She was speechless :)\n \n Then there's the way we do grades. In a good grading system, 'C' is supposed to be average. But now 'B' is average and an 'A' isn't all that good. Teachers are pushed to give A's because that's what kids want and now that 'A' doesn't mean so much. And then there's the BS of anything between 90% to 100% being counted as an 'A' regardless for each particular assignment (new grading policy in effect starting this year for us here in Montgomery County, MD).\n \n More on the grading policy:\n The way grading worked before was like this: We were given grades during the year. The teacher could weight tests, homework, etc. if they wanted to and then the final percentage each quarter was either an 'A', 'B', etc. After 2 quarters we took a final exam and the average of the 3 grades (2 quarter grades are weighted at 75% of total) is all that goes on your transcript. Now with computers I thought if they had a new grading policy, why not at least put the one percentage of the final weighted grade down, so it shows up as 84.5 or 100% or show all 3 grades. Of course they go the other way. Now each assignment is either an 'A', 'B', 'C', etc. One kid came up with a saying \"if you get a 95%, that's 5.5% too much effort.\" Why do kids, parents, board members, etc. want colleges to know less. Shouldn't colleges know if you were consistently getting 91's or 100's? I think my work during a whole semester is worth more than 1 of 5 letters (really only 2, either A or B). At least I could get a percentage, but of course grades aren't really a reflection on how much you learn anyway, they're based on tests. So you see how I feel when the solution to all these problems with NCLB is ... more tests? Bull$hit. I wonder if the people making these policies has ever actually been to a school before.",

There is always the possibility of continuing one's education on a lifetime basis and as a private activity, if so inclined.

   "The main purpose of high school education is not really to give people knowledge. This knowledge is important, of course, but could be learned elsewhere by anyone who wanted to know.\n \n The real purpose is to help people learn how to think.\n \n That may seem odd at first but the ability to take information, decide how accurate it is and then make conclusions based on that information is not something we naturally know, and there are a great many people who aren't capable of this.\n \n Everyone knows that guy who doesn't have his own opinions and just listens to Rush Limbaugh or Al Franken and regurgitates what was said. Well, maybe you don't but I know several, both conservative and liberal. \n \n The natural result of learning how to think is a desire to have as much information as possible so you have good opinions. Ignorance is bliss only if you also remain ignorant of your ignorance. After you begin to desire more information, you begin to see what you enjoy be it English, science etc. So school helps you determine what you want to do with your life.\n \n With that in mind, \"achievement\" as a focus is incredibly detrimental to education. As an example of this I will use the TAAS test (now TAKS) issued in Texas to high school students. Likely something similar is in the works nationwide as part of Bush's No Child Left Behind.\n \n I really love writing. Just the act of putting words down is a joy (as you can see by the length of this post). As a result, English was one of my favorite subjects. Then I moved to Texas and took 8th grade English. The entire year that class consisted of \"how to write a TAAS paper.\" This was the most constricting and detrimental set of lessons I was ever given, but it sure got us a high score on the TAAS test.\n \n Focusing on achievement as the top priority in school creates a self-defeating cycle where students learn how to properly take tests and little else. I've met people who could ace math tests but didn't know any algebra because they knew how work backwards from multiple choice questions and that's all they needed to know.\n \n Schools are not teaching us how to think, however. They need to free the minds of their students rather than indoctrinating them.",

Without a teacher, I'll bet you I could learn far more than anyone in public schools learn in the same amount of time. We spend so much time learning how to ace tests than learn. If it isn't on the test, we don't need to learn it. Seriously, if a teacher gave students a book of math problems in a math course and told them there would be no tests and no homework from the book, they wouldn't open it. Even if the teacher suggested problems to do. In my old school (a private school) they did just that and students did them. Know why? They taught us to have fun learning and to explore a subject.\n \n Another thing: what I think the teacher should be able to do:\n Any time in the year, give a pop exam. A 25 page test taking the whole period with no studying. If it were truly a fair test kids should be able to do good on it without having to study. That's the point of tests, to evaluate what you've learned, not to provide a guide on what to learn. And how much do you learn when you know exactly when you need to know stuff. Why remember it past the day of the test? I would bet you 99% of the kids in our grade don't remember a thing from last year's required physics course. Most of them got A's, but that doesn't matter, because they don't remember anything now. It has got them absolutely no benefit.\n \n In French this year we have spent the last 3 weeks preparing for the final. We have also spent 3 separate weeks preparing for 3 separate oral exams.

   "Either you misunderstood what I said or I'm not understanding correctly your latest post.\n You posted that the duty of the public school is to teach students how/what to think. I claimed that the public schools try to make each student turn out as a 'worker' who just goes and finds a job and that they should allow students to think for themselves.\n \n \nI find it disturbing you suggest that classes should be voluntary. Some things you just need to know even if you don't want to.\n \n I don't mean all classes. Classes such as elementary mathematics, basic social science, overview of history, science basics, and english are necessary no matter what. I was speaking of other courses like fine arts, higher math, other science (biology, chemistry).\n Like I said, if a student is ignorant enough to not choose a class, he/she will regret it later and hopefully learn the material.",
