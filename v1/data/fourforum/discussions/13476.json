   "S.C. needs to stop the stupidity\n By Brian Hicks\n Sunday, October 11, 2009\n Let's get this straight: The White House has allowed first lady Michelle Obama to tool around Moscow, the Czech Republic and even Ghana in the past year, but officials are a little worried about her coming to South Carolina.\n \n They consider the atmosphere here too dangerous.\n \n Just when it seemed the summer of shame was over, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn dropped this bombshell on The Post and Courier's Yvonne Wenger on Friday. Clyburn says the White House is wary of bringing the first lady to the state because of the attitude of some of its residents. \n\n S.C. needs to stop the stupidity The Post and Courier - Charleston SC newspaper\n \n But then this is the state that elected Jim DeMint, Lindsey Graham and Joe Wilson, not to mention notable incompetent and cheating on his wife Mark Sanford.",
