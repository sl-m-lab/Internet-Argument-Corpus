I agree with you regarding employment. If a person stays out of trouble for seven years then they should be allowed to rebuild a productive life. And did it say anything about the felons voting rights which are currently lost also ?",

Recidvism rates go down.\n Thoughts?\n\n \n Of course it would be better. Any person who committed crime, spent time and has not repeated in seven years has obviously overcome his past. \n Employers should in fact give serious consideration to hiring ex-cons without the seven years for a number of reasons. If they are looking for work, they understand that work is important to their mental well being and re-acclamation into society. \n If they won't hire someone until seven years after release, the ex won't, can't make it without being a burden in some form on society. \n Except of course molesters and rapist.

That has served me well over the years. I think the bottom line is that convicted felons should have to be honest and forthright about their past. The real place we need change is with societies general attitude towards ex-cons...that their are many who are good and decent people out there (like Bassman....even though he is a Sabres fan), however you cannot legislate this kind of change.",

   "Personally I don't think this bill goes nearly far enough. IMO ten minutes after you finish serving your sentence the record should be closed from public view. In our justice system we punish people ONCE for comitting crimes. We do not punish them once and then keep punishing them for the rest of their lives which is what the current practices amount to.\n \n \nIsn't this just big brother stepping in and telling us that we have no right to view the whole truth about someone? I don't like it. The individual company has a right to know who they are hiring. But then again, I think there would be easy ways around this. All it takes would be to make applicants write down a entire adult work history with their application. A 6 year gap in work should be enough to make the employer ask some questions. \n\n \n No. This is not just big brother stepping in and telling us anything. This is the government, which controls all that information, telling you what information they will and will not provide. I don't agree with the part of the bill that prohibits employers from asking, it just needs to be made crystal clear that there is no way that they can possibly verify whatever you tell them. \n \n \nTo all of the naysayers out there, let me throw this at you. If an ex-offender is unable to obtain employment outside of the burger flipper jobs, then society has only itself to blame.\n\n \n You might also point out to the naysayers that criminal background checks by employers are a fairly new thing. Until 15 or 20 years ago, a criminal background chedck on somebody was a massive affair. Only the DOJ really had the resources to carry out a complete background check on individuals on a routine basis because there was no central clearing house for the data. Often times the only way to determine a persons criminal history was to go to everyplace they have ever lived and pull the local court records. Today all that information is centralized and it takes 2 minutes on the internet and a paid subscription to a web page and you can have a persons entire cirminal history.\n \n The #1 compnent in determining whether a person is going to be a repeat offender or not is their ability to get a good job. A lot of people come out of jail with their outlook changed. They don't want to go back. Then they end up flipping burgers for minimum wage because they can't get a job anywhere else and they become disillusioned. They end up commiting a crime and end up back in jail.\n \n For the first roughly 210 years of this nations history people could do their time, get out of jail, and start over....move to a new town if they had to. Today MOST of our criminals are repeat offenders. Prior to the 1980's, VERY few of our criminals were repeat offenders. People got out of jail, went \"####....I am never going to do that again\", and built a new life. What we do by giving employers access to a complete criminal history on people is ensuring that individuals today can not do that. Once you take away a persons ability to start a new life and move ahead based on hard work, what is left for them?\n \n Personally, I have hired a LOT of people in the past and have never run a criminal background check on any of them. My applications did not even have a place for \"criminal history\". It has never caused me any problems. I had an accountant at my business who 2 years after I hired him told me that he had been convicted of a felony. Embezzlement, no less. When I hired him he was working at the local meatopacking plant which was a little unusual since he had a degree in accounting and a lot of experience in that field, but not unusual enough to really throw any red flags. I figured he was a corporate burnout. I thappens. I once had a framing carpenter who worked for me that had a PhD and had been a VP at a fortune 500 company. He burned out and ended up framing houses for about 6 years, then he went back into the corporate world. \n \n The accountant never stole from me, and I don't regret having hired him. He apparentyl figured I knew about his conviction, but I didn't. He assumed I did a criminal background check. I didn't. I figure that crimes that people have committed are none of my business if they have already served their sentence. That is the way it is supposed to be.",

If the crime rate for such felons is not much different than for the general population, then I would agree with the \"Second Chance Act of 2007\" - give them that essentially clean slate. However, if the recidivism rate is still high, then I think that employers have a right to know.",

   "The #1 compnent in determining whether a person is going to be a repeat offender or not is their ability to get a good job.\n That is not exactly true. The #1 component in determining if someone will repeat is the crime itself. \n \n \nToday MOST of our criminals are repeat offenders. Prior to the 1980's, VERY few of our criminals were repeat offenders.\n I'd like to see some data on this... I know this isn't true for some crimes such as sex offenders.\n \n \nThe accountant never stole from me, and I don't regret having hired him. He apparentyl figured I knew about his conviction, but I didn't. He assumed I did a criminal background check. I didn't. I figure that crimes that people have committed are none of my business if they have already served their sentence. That is the way it is supposed to be.\nAnd what if he did steal from you? The instance of one not happening doesn't help. The point is if you had one person that had a conviction for that and another who didn't, all else being equal I'd pick the one without the conviction. Surely you are familiar with the concepts of risk. \n \n Anyway, Another Opinion makes a pretty good argument and I wouldn't mind changing it to that system. For example certain sex offenders have a high rate of repeating while other types of sex offenders don't. Likewise, some felonies aren't repeated very often and perhaps they should be left alone.",
