   "When I heard about the unknown plane that \"trespassed on the White House airspace\" I nearly died... laughing. Constantly they frighten us with acts of terrorism and want to turn us all into paranoiacs. Just think of it! A bedraggled Cessna so scared all top officials and special services that there was announced evacuation of Capitol and Supreme Court and Department of Labour... It was real havoc with people running and police and special service knowing a sh-t. It seems to me that it was a well-staged performance to show us that there is a terroristic threat but our services are in full control. But they proved only their absolute incompetence and lack of coordination. Maybe they couldn't warn all participants in time. Can you imagine what awaits us if there's a real terroristic attack and terrorists (bad, bad boys!) won't share their plans with our security services?",
