   "The gene is dead and so is Darwinism. (edit: oops...I see WW already posted this.)\n \n It's pretty clear that everything science thought it knew about genes is false. Genes do not work in isolation. They do not perform only one function or code only one protein. Heck, the concept of the \"gene\" is being shattered. Science has so consumed itself looking at genes (or what they thought were genes) for the past century that they have lost sight of the fact that the genome is a functional unit, and cannot be broken apart and analyzed in bits and pieces without considering the context of the organism. And up until just a few years ago scientists thought there were over 100,000 genes in the genome -- now we know there are less than 25,000...but they still don't exactly how many! Does that give anyone else confidence that these guys have a freaking clue if they don't even know how many there are? \n \n http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070908/bob9.asp\n \n The gene is dead\n \n \"The same sequences are being used for multiple functions,\" says Thomas R. Gingeras of Affymetrix. That introduces complications into the evolution of the genome, which had until recently been assumed to act through single DNA mutations affecting single genes. Now, \"a mutation in one of those sequences has to be interpreted not only in terms of [one gene], but [of] all the other transcripts going through the region,\" Gingeras explains\n \n More fundamentally, it muddies scientists' conception of just what constitutes a gene. In the established definition, a gene is a discrete region of DNA that produces a single, identifiable protein in a cell. But the functioning of a protein often depends on a host of RNAs that control its activity. If a stretch of DNA known to be a protein-coding gene also produces regulatory RNAs essential for several other genes, is it somehow a part of all those other genes as well? \n \n To make things even messier, the genetic code for a protein can be scattered far and wide around the genome. The ENCODE project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes. Many scientists now argue that this overlapping and dispersal of genes, along with the swelling ranks of functional RNAs, renders the standard gene concept of the central dogma obsolete. \n \n \n Long live the gene\n \n Offering a radical new conception of the genome, Gingeras proposes shifting the focus away from protein-coding genes. Instead, he suggests that the fundamental units of the genome could be defined as functional RNA transcripts. \n \n Since some of these transcripts ferry code for proteins as dutiful mRNAs, this new perspective would encompass traditional genes. But it would also accommodate new classes of functional RNAs as they're discovered, while avoiding the confusion caused by several overlapping genes laying claim to a single stretch of DNA. The emerging picture of the genome \"definitely shifts the emphasis from genes to transcripts,\" agrees Mark B. Gerstein, a bioinformaticist at Yale University. \n \n Scientists' definition of a gene has evolved several times since Gregor Mendel first deduced the idea in the 1860s from his work with pea plants. Now, about 50 years after its last major revision, the gene concept is once again being called into question.\n \n The funny thing about all this, and the oh-so-ironic thing is this: what is the ONE thing that darwinists have always pointed to to show evidence of materialism -- evidence that we're merely an assortment of \"things?\" It's the GENE! And now -- of all things -- it's the gene that seems to have no physical reality! The \"gene\" is just a figment of people's imagination and subject to opinion and guesswork!",

   "Nope the simple concept of genes in a simpler era is dead. Its been dead a long time and the concept advances with our continued scientific progress. Such is the way of the world and it always has been. After all the original concept of gene was totally abstract and not linked to any molecular architecture at all. It was an element of inheritance and it still is!\n \n And by the way Darwinism in its original form did not employ the concept of discrete heritable elements at all!\n \n \nDarwin proposed a theory of evolution in 1859 and one of its major problems was the lack of an underlying mechanism for heredity. Darwin believed in a mix of blending inheritance and the inheritance of acquired traits (pangenesis). Blending inheritance would lead to uniformity across populations in only a few generations and thus would remove variation from a population on which natural selection could act. This led to Darwin adopting some Lamarckian ideas in later editions of The Origin and his later biological works. Darwin's primary approach to heredity was to outline how it appeared to work (noticing that traits could be inherited which were not expressed explicitly in the parent at the time of reproduction, that certain traits could be sex-linked, etc.) rather than suggesting mechanisms.\n \n Darwin's initial model of heredity was adopted by, and then heavily modified by, his cousin Francis Galton, who laid the framework for the biometric school of heredity. Galton rejected the aspects of Darwin's pangenesis model which relied on acquired traits.\n \n The inheritance of acquired traits was shown to have little basis in the 1880s when August Weismann cut the tails off many generations of mice to find that their offspring did continue to develop tails.\n \n The idea of particulate inheritance of genes can be attributed to the Moravian[1] monk Gregor Mendel who published his work on pea plants in 1865. However, his work was not widely known and was rediscovered in 1901. It was initially assumed the Mendelian inheritance only accounted for large (qualitative) differences, such as those seen by Mendel in his pea plants - and the idea of additive effect of (quantitative) genes was not realised until R.A. Fisher's (1918) paper on The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance. For the subsequent history of genetics, see history of genetics.\n \n In the 1930s, work by Fisher and others resulted in a combination of Mendelian and biometric schools into the modern synthesis of evolution.\n \n Trofim Lysenko however caused a backlash of what is now called Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union when he emphasised Lamarckian ideas on the inheritance of acquired traits. This movement affected agricultural research and led to food shortages in the 1960s and seriously affected the USSR.\n",

   "And here is an interesting footnote and something which I at least was not aware of - Mendel had studied both physics and the concepts of good experimental design of his day. The paper by the way is well worth reading - its astounding that it was not recognized in its day, these days it would likely be front page nobel prizewinning work!\n \n \n \nMendel's idea of a correct, or well-formed, experiment seems to have come largely from his formal studies of experimental physics. In 1851, eight years after entering the Augustinian monastery in Brno, Mendel was sent to the University of Vienna, to study physics at an Institute directed by Professor Christian Doppler -- the same Doppler known to students of modern physics because of the effect that bears his name. In addition to taking more than half his courses in the areas of physics, mathematics, and chemistry, Mendel enrolled in a special seminar, conducted by Doppler, concerned with the proper design and demonstration of experiments in experimental physics. (for more on Mendel's education at the University, see Orel [1984], ch. 3).\n \n Mendel used the term \"korrekt\" only once in his paper; elsewhere, when Bateson used the word \"correct\" to translate the German (e.g. \"correct assumption\"), Mendel had used the term \"richtig\" (\"right\") or one of its cognates. For Mendel, a \"correct\" experiment was one precise enough to clearly answer a narrow, well-formed question. Unlike most of his predecessors and contemporaries, Mendel investigated plant hybrids by performing experiments that focused on the behavior of single traits. Similarly, these experiments were designed to answer elementary questions about how the particular characteristics of individual plants were inherited from one generation to the next. \n",

If you were more familar with the true range of complexity which matter exhibits you would be aware that the division is rather arbitrary. For example people have much difficulty on agreeing on whether viruses are living or non-living matter. And its clear that while you cannot analyze complexity in matter that it does exist.

Each tentacle is covered with cells called cnidocytes, that can sting or kill other animals. Most jellyfish use these cells to secure prey or for defense. Others, such as Rhizostomae, do not have tentacles at all.\n \n Jellyfish lack basic sensory organs and a brain, but their nervous systems and rhopalia allow them to perceive stimuli, such as light and odor, and respond quickly. They feed on small fish and zooplankton that become caught in their tentacles. Most jellyfish are passive drifters and slow swimmers, as their shape is not hydrodynamic. Instead, they move so as to create a current forcing the prey within reach of their tentacles. They do this by rhythmically opening and closing their bell-like body. Their digestive system is incomplete: the same orifice is used to take in food and expel waste.\n A jellyfish detects the touch of other animals using a nervous system called a \"nerve net\", found in its epidermis. Touch stimuli are collected by nerve rings, through the rhopalial lappet located around the animal's body, to the nerve cells. Jellyfish also have ocelli that cannot form images but are sensitive to light; the jellyfish can use these to determine up from down, basing its judgement on sunlight shining on the surface of the water.\n \n \n",

Many animals navigate in part using similar magnetic sensors.\n \n Organisms have to be sensitive to -- if you prefer, conscious of -- their environment.

   "Since the study of biochemistry, my field, is the study of the chemistry of life, I'd certainly dispute it is now or ever has been outside the possibility of empirical study. \n \n Biochemists have reconstituted many individual parts of living systems in the test-tube, up to the replication of DNA and the transcription and translation of genes. So no, there isn't any particular mystery about what makes life different from non-life. We understand the biochemistry of it pretty well.\n \n\n \n true but we don't know everything. It's like we know the car, all it's mechanisms and functions, but not the driver and why he is going where he is going.\n \n \nHere you skip from \"life\" to \"consciousness\". The initial question was about the telling the difference between living and non-living systems. The answer to that is known: it's chemistry. Some chemistries allow for metabolism, replication and evolution... most do not, but they are all different aspects of chemistry. Not all life, my friend, is conscious. Plants, viruses and bacteria are alive, but few would argue, today, that they are conscious.\n\n \n \n it depends on how you see consciousness, I tend to see it as a particular quality or energy that life tunes in to to variyng degrees. Not as something produced by brain cells as you take for granted. \n \n \n\n Now, you ask, how does chemistry account for consciousness? Well, it doesn't as yet. So far as we know, consciousness is what they call an emergent property of the physicochemical system of the brain. What's an \"emergent property\"? It's a phenomenon we know has physical reality based on some material phenomenon, but which we do not yet understand.\n\n \n this is just one theory out of many, based on several preconceptions (ie all life can be explained via physicochemical mechanisms, consciousness is produced by the brain) The problem remains: as consciousness just \"emerges\" magically without any known mechanism my view is just as valid.\n \n \n\n We know that many animal brains result in consciousness. We know that brains are physicochemical machines. We understand some things about how they work. We know that physical (a cosh) or chemical (drugs) disruption of the machine disrupts consciousness, but we don't know yet how the machine generates consciousness.\n \n So we don't know everything. That is hardly reason to appeal to some miraculous and vitalistic forces. This is no more than the usual appeal to the God of the Gaps, where every gap in physical knowledge is presumed to be filled by a divine miracle. Doesn't make scientific sense. besides, the gaps keep getting filled in with science. What are you going to do when science explains consciousness, eh? Find some new gap?\n\n \n I tend to value personal experience more than scientific theories. Unlike you i don't base my metaphysical beliefs (if i have any, i am more of a total agnostic) on grand theories supported by scant empiri. If there are vital enegies (and from my experience there is) they are most certainly compatible with physics and chemistry, they are just not dicovered yet in the lab. So what?",
