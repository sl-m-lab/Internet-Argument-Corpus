Deal with it. Discuss. Or Defend. - poet\n\n \n Was there a point to changing what is called favoritism to white privilege other than to try and make it something unique to the US and whites? Guess what, it happens everywhere amoung all races. Whenever you have two groups you are going to run into this. \n \n I question anything that becomes a loaded question leaving only to agree or by disagreeing becoming something not necessarily true. Like \"Do you still beat your wife\" or \"When you rape your neighbors pets do like the dog or cat better?\" Theories like this think they are the only possibility and while they may hold some valid pieces they rarely make up the whole puzzle.\n \n LET\"S BE CLEAR. I don't agree with or support or look to justify or validate favoritism or racism. Because I disagree with the interpretation and use of the \"white previlige\" concept does not mean I don't see that it has some truth to it. \n \n This idea tries to absolve minorities from any responsibility while placing all the blame on the white majority. If you look at other countries where whites are not a majority you will find a favoritism within the various segments of the population. You can find it here in the US between different minority groups and between men and women and even among the same group using social or economic characteristics as the point of division. \n \n If minorities are only in the position they are in and whites in the position they are in because whites intentionally kept opportunities away from minorities has some truth to it but can not be considered the dominate cause. If it was the world would look very different.\n \n It is good that socioeconomic problems are getting the attention as a cause to the problems that give ammunition to negative racial perceptions. Instead of saying cops are racist and that is why more minorities end up in jail looking at what is causing more minorities to accept crime as an alternative.There isn't some crime gene that is missing in white people. This tries to identify the reasons for the socioeconomic issues that push people to cross the line of what is acceptable behavior and what is not, but ultimately I think it accepts to much of the why and inadvertantly contributes to the problem\n \n Maybe I am wrong or don't get what this is concerning, but getting me to understand better is your burden",
