The first amendment applies to the federal government. Now if this bill gives any special treatment to Christians besides simply recognizing their religion as the \"official\" religion, then I would say it is unconstitutional. I think this is very stupid and simply is wrong. How can a state have a religion? This goes against everything the United States stands for and one of the main reasons it was founded (religious freedom, a fight against a state religion). The main reason most people wanting Ten Commandments, etc. in public is that the first amendment only prohibits a state religion. Now again, this is only one state, so technically not under jurisdiction of the first amendment (\"Congress shall make no law...\"), but I can only hope it never passes, and I would go crazy if people here (MD) tried to pass a law like this and I hope many people from Missouri are too. Even if you are Christian, you would have to arrogant to try to pass a law like this.",

   "It still says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.....\n\n Stuck on the concept of Congress not changing the wording of amendments superceeded by later amendments huh? Consider another example.\n \n Consider the text of the 14th Amendment \u00a7 2:\n \nRepresentatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age,* and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\n \n At the time the 14th Amendment was passed, 1868, male inhaitants, twenty-one years of age and older, represented all of the legal, federal voters. This clause species that if a portion of them are disenfranchised in any federal election in any State then the enumeration of representatives for that State shall be reduced proportionately. It is clearly intended to hold the State accountable for the disenfranchisement of legal, federal voters.\n \n Now consider Amendment 19 passed in 1920:\n \nThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\n \n Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n\n \n This gave women the right to vote but Congress did not go back and change the 14th Amendment to hold the States accountable if this new class of voters was disenfranchised. \n \n Then in 1971 we have the 26th Amendment:\n \n\n Section 1.The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.\n \n Section 2.The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n \n\n \n And yet the 14th Amendment still says, \"....male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age,* and citizens of the United States...\"\n \n Now, will you claim that the States are not accountable for disenfranching voters protected by the 19th and 26th Amendments just because Congress did not re-write the 14th Amendment when these later Amendments superceeded it's wording of protecting on male voters, 21 years or older?\n \n You might take notice that Congress never goes back and rewrites any amendment. Even in the case of the 18th Amendment prohibiting alcohol, they simply used a later amendment, the 21st, to repeal it, instead of just striking the text of the 18th Amendment.",

It's like the bible, there are so many different sects of Christianity who all \"know\" what the bible means. I think we should actually follow the Constitution, not what it meant. Along with the 14th amendment, we should have amended the 1st amendment to actually give a freedom of speech. Of course now that I think about it, the wording actually implies that there is in fact a fundamental free speech, and the Constitution is simply stopping the government from infringing on it. With that reading it becomes clear that the 14th amendment probably would protect the freedom of speech. I still say we need to ammend the Constitution to be more clear. There are arguments on whether the 2nd amendment written as it is implies that only the militia can bear arms or whether that's just the dependant clause so isn't part of the actual statement. If they had made it clearer, it would have been nice. We will never come to a 2/3 agreement to amend the 2nd amendment one way or the other, but we can do that for the 1st.
