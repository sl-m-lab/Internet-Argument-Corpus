   "On the site Uncommon Descent Dembski said,\n \nI've pretty much dispensed with the EF. It suggests that chance, necessity, and design are mutually exclusive. They are not. Straight CSI is clearer as a criterion for design detection.\n\n In other words, EF always has been unable to eliminate false positives and false negatives.\n \n Scientists like Wesley Elsberry (also at The Panda's Thumb) have been pointing that out since 1999 in reviews of Dembski's book, The Design Inference.\n \n I find it interesting, as Elsberry points out, that EF was proposed as a means of identifying CSI (Complex Specifed Information) in the first place. It now seems that CSI is self evident can somehow be used to detect design without any need to identify CSI.\n \n Just more of the same. As Mark Perakh pointed out in his book, Unintelligent Design, Dembski couldn't settle on a definition for his EF in the first place. Between his first version in The Design Inference and his later version in No Free Lunch, Dembski actually removed some of what he called \"essential elements\" of his definition.",
