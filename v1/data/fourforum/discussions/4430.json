   "A majority of New York City voters would support a law allowing gay marriage, according to a poll released Thursday.\n But by a slim margin, they also back Mayor Michael Bloomberg's decision to appeal a recent court ruling supporting same-sex unions, the Quinnipiac University Poll found.\n \n In the poll, 51 percent of respondents said they favored legalizing gay marriage, while 40 percent were opposed. White voters were much more likely to back the law than black voters - 61 percent of whites wanted the law, compared with just 36 percent of blacks.\n \n \"There's a big split between black and white voters over gay marriage,\" said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \n \n By a margin of 49 to 44 percent, voters said they agreed with Bloomberg's strategy of appealing a state Supreme Court decision last month that the state's refusal to grant marriage licenses to gays was unconstitutional.\n \n Bloomberg has said he personally supports gay marriage but wants to test the court ruling to avoid the \"chaos\" San Francisco experienced last year when it issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The marriages were later ruled invalid.\n \n The poll surveyed 1,435 New York City registered voters between February 22 and March 1. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points. \n \n \n http://www.nydailynews.com/front/breaking_news/story/286372p-245209c.html",

They were bound by freedom and equality.\n \n \nLiberalism today has abandoned a lot of what Jefferson believed, kept what they prefer, and changed it. There are many aspects of HIS liberalism I would agree with: I like their focus on domestic social issues such as taking care of elderly, making sure there is fairness, freedom for black people, etc. But liberalism as embodied today by the Democratic party has become anti-religion, over-regulatory, and it's been taken over by extremist special interest groups such as the gay lobby and others (much the same way the Republicans were taken over by the religious right in the 80s). It's a political favor game now, not honest advocacy for the people as Jefferson would have had it.\n\n \n Jefferson was not a liberal, he was an anti-federalist. All founders were liberal in their time. Pretty much all of America's conservatives and liberals would have been called liberal during our founding. Although Jefferson held some values of current-day liberals, he was not considered any more liberal than another American in his day, and his values do not directly translate to modern day liberals, so claiming that liberals have abandoned his principles does not make too much sense because they were never really based on his principles. I should also point out that some of Jefferson's principles lost, in a sense, with the passage of the Constitution.\n \n Anyhow, your claim that liberalism today has been taken over by extremists is an invalid one, perhaps planted in your mind by extreme conservatives on radio stations. Making such a claim both does not support the battle against gay rights and it perhaps makes your arguments seem far less credible to every liberal. Allow me to explain. It is true that liberalism agrees with gay rights. But gay rights is just about the most highly controversial issue out there. Because it is so highly controversial and because so many people exist on both sides of the view, it is highly illogical to claim that supporters of gay rights are \"extremists\" in any fashion. It is absolutely no less logical to claim that conservatives have been taken over by extremist groups such as those who wish to deny gay rights. \n \n Because you have been willing to make the statement that liberals have been taken over by extremist special interest groups and because any objective evaluation of liberalism shows that this is absolutely not true, it sounds to others as though you are simply labeling any group which disagrees with you as \"extremist\".\n \n Hmm, it also sounds as though you believe Republicans are not controlled by the religious right today. I'm not certain that is the case at all; look even at the other thread that was recently posted in which republicans passed a law allowing government employers to discriminate based on religion and sexual orientation. Is that conservative principles at work, or is it the influence of the religious right?",

The most we can really say is that it indicates there may be biological influences involved. Jefferson was no fool--he would have known of the existence of people who engaged in homosexual behavior.\n\n \n Jefferson did not specifically speak out against denying rights to homosexuals, but he did propose an act that would prevent the government from granting special rights based on one's religion. He proceeded to pass the act, have the fact that he wrote the act put on his tombstone, and its text is written in the Jefferson memorial. We are dealing with a very similar situation here; those of the belief that same-sex couples are capable, loving parents are being denied rights. Jefferson would never have approved of such special benefits for living a certain way or believing a certain thing.\n \n It's true Jefferson didn't speak on homosexual rights, but homosexual rights were not an issue during his lifetime. Remember that when he lived, the government did not grant marriage benefits, it did not prevent homosexuals from speaking their orientation in the military, and homosexuals simply had equal rights in every way. On a side-note, supporting gay rights would have been committing political suicide, I'm sure. Regardless, it was not an issue at the time. Jefferson did speak out a set of values which, when applied to gay rights, result in no other possible conclusion except that he would have supported them. Jefferson would have been absolutely disgusted at the fact that government has all the power it has now, and he would have been even more disgusted that government has taken it upon itself to decide how people should live, granting them benefits if they live in the approved manner.\n \n \nFair enough, it's just that some liberals seem to feel he embodies modern liberal thinking, since they quote him and seem to champion his views. I'm just saying there are big differences between modern liberalism and Jefferson's view (whether you think of it as classical liberalism or anti-federalism).\n\n \n I quote Jefferson because he was a strong supporter of individual rights, he authored the Declaration of Independence, and he aligns with me on a lot of views. But in truth, I would quote Lincoln, Hamilton, Madison, and Franklin just as much if I thought such a quote would hold as much weight. They were Federalists, Constitutionalists, and my views align with theirs much more closely. Other liberals probably quote Jefferson regarding civil rights issues because Jefferson probably would have agreed with them on those civil rights issues and it is very persuasive to do so. I don't know if this clears anything up or not...\n \n \nI think you are wrong, and BOTH political parties are controlled too much by their special interest benefactors. When it comes to the WAY they operate and the fact that the extremist elements of each has too much control, Ralph Nader is right when he says there is not that much difference in the two parties.\n\n \n Well, I don't think it is extremist elements so much as the individual beliefs of those involved. The Democratic party tends to take the beliefs that most Democrats hold. The Republican party does the same of Republicans. The interest groups side with whichever side best supports them. Interest groups may try to influence the vote and the decisions of individual politicians, though I really don't see how that would be different if a different party existed. Interest groups control a lot of votes, and they are experts on a specific issue. If Bush tells me that he supports civil unions, but HRC tells me he doesn't, you can sure bet that I'm going to trust HRC.\n \n \nNo, I don't listen to the radio.

   "Jefferson would have had no more understanding of what scientists, researchers and doctors now refer to as \"sexual orientation\" than he would have of computers. To make an issue out of the fact that he never expressed his views on the topic is absurd.\n \n What is abundantly clear from our knowledge of Jefferson, however... as it is expressed over and over in his writings... is that he exalted reason and logic, and disdained those who wanted religion to guide our laws. He admired Christ as a teacher, but his own edition of the New Testament eliminated every supernatural event, and he was excoriating in his negative opinion of that author of the Biblical \"clobber\" passages, Paul.\n \n I think it far more likely that Jefferson would have taken our relatively recent scientific and medical discoveries in sexual identity seriously and expanded his knowledge on the subject, rather than be guided by 1800-year-old pre-scientific writings by someone he held in contempt.\n \n\"They [preachers] dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subversions of the duperies on which they live.\" -- Thomas Jefferson\n \n \"Shake off all the fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for every fact, every opinion.

Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him by his biographers, I find many passages of fine imagination, correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence; and others, again, of so much ignorance, so much absurdity, so much untruth, charlatanism and imposture, as to pronounce it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same being. I separate, therefore, the gold from the dross; restore him to the former, and leave the latter to the stupidity of some, the roguery of others of his disciples.

I suspect he might not have been for ANY marriage benefits at all.\n\n \n Yes, I very much doubt any of the founders would have supported marriage benefits.\n \n \nYou could say that though, about anything--it's easy to apply a set of values to whatever you want if you decide beforehand you'll have too wide-open of criteria as to what it can be applied to. For example I could just as easily say he would have supported a 25 year old man who who knows he will die soon trying to get social security benefits--after all that's not an example of equality either.\n\n \n Well, I don't think he would have supported social security either. Regardless, it would be difficult to say that such an example is consistant with Jefferson's logic because such a case could be as easily be called unequal treatment. In this example, a 25-year-old man is given the benefits of social security when all other 25-year-olds are denied it. The logic he used to support same-sex marriage directly correlates to the logic used to support religious freedom.\n \n \nGuess you've never heard of Arnold Schwarzeneggar, Rudy Guiliani or Arlen Specter.\n\n \n Certainly you do not deny the existence of exceptions in the Democratic party as well.\n \n \nBetter keep that to yourself--you might bust their bubble . . .\n\n \n Careful; agreeing with your ally by issuing a sarcastic comment regarding the response of your opponents is seen as condescending.\n \n \nBut these are very different issues in so many ways, it's silly to think one can analogize the other very well.\n\n \n Are they really that different? Do most arguments against same-sex marriage simply boil down to it being \"immoral\" or somehow worse than opposite-sex marriage? Is that immorality not based on a religious belief? Is favoring one religious belief over another not the denial of religious freedom? Which argument against same-sex marriage are you thinking of that is not based in maintaining traditional religious beliefs over modern ones? As I see it, it is just as Jefferson said: My neighbor's religion does not harm me. In the same effect, the person my neighbor loves and marries does not harm me.",

Very few people want to deny gays from being together, living how they want, doing whatever they want to do. Environmentalists often want to stop private property owners from living how they want, doing what they want to do.\n\n \n Gay marriage will result in ceremonies, but not public ones. In today's society, I barely know when my neighbor gets married, let alone when some couple I've never met does. What public references would be created by the institution of same-sex marriage that do not exist today? What financial debates would arise if same-sex marriage is instituted? Would we not be clearing up the financial debates that exist today by applying a clearly-defined set of rules? What effect would this have on public schools except to promote the idea that gays should not be attacked? Precisely how would the public be affected in a negative way by any of these? I challenge you to explain it because I believe that it absolutely would not.\n \n The only claim that I can sort of agree with is the effect on churches. However, if the beliefs of some members of a church are changed by granting equal rights to same-sex couples, then the church is going to have to deal with it. Frankly, a church does not have moral justification to deny equal treatment to some unrelated group of people because it is afraid it will lose members or its views will change. I might as easily strip you of the right to marry because my religious belief states that you should not be allowed to marry. More realistically, you should be allowed to marry, and my religious belief should put up with it because I am morally wrong for denying you marriage.\n \n Again, tell me how society is affected in a negative way by same-sex marriage.\n \n Moving on, although very few people want to deny gays from being together, living how they want, and doing whatever they want to do, many people do want to discourage people from doing so. People today say, \"You can live the way you want, but if you do, we will punish you. We will not give you the benefits of an opposite-sex couple, even if you choose to raise children.\" So how much are people really accepting homosexuals? They truly are not. They are saying that homosexuals can live as they please, they just have to pay some extra money, live without health care, and suffer the burdens of raising children more than opposite-sex couples.\n \n \nSocial equality isn't a goal, because there is no defined point of completion.\n\n \n Social equality may not be a goal, but equal treatment under the law is. Equal treatment under the law may not be an achievable goal, but it is one we should work towards achieving and come as close to achieving as possible. We cannot allow one group of people to be elevated over another, to recieve benefits and bonuses just for living in the government-approved fashion.

Not only is Affirmative Action an absolute destruction of equality, but so long as we treat different races and different genders differently under the law, how can we expect our citizens to treat them the same? As long as the law discriminates, then so shall the people.\n \n Progressive income taxes and hate laws I do not work against.\n \n Progressive income taxes, although in a sense attack equality, also defend equality. Furthermore, progressive income taxes defend happiness, in a sense. Allow me to explain: progressive income taxes, although on the surface take more money from one man than the next, they help protect the concept of one man making less money than the next for putting in the same amount of work. We cannot all be successful business men or billionaires, no matter how hard we may work or try at it, and those who fail often fail because of bad luck or simply not being smart enough. This does not mean they deserve less money. If we can help these people while still preserving the draw of capitalism, then we should do so; they have worked just as hard. Now, progressive taxes do not attack this problem as directly as they could because they are more focused on happiness. The simple truth is that taking more money from people who have more money does not hurt the happiness and livability of those people as much as it would hurt those with less money. Finally, on an economic level, a flat income tax reduces the demand of the lower and middle class citizens on the market and creates excessive demand of the upper class, who have a lot of money to spend. This can result in too much development aimed toward the super-rich instead of the average person, and may eventually hurt the standard of living for us all.\n \n As for hate laws, well that is not a matter of treating people differently under the law, it is a matter of punishing different motives for crimes differently. If one person murders a man in self defense, another murders a man in a heated rage because his wife was cheating with that man, and another murders a man because he is an African American, then the third deserves the worst punishment. The third man has committed the crime with the most malicious and evil intent, and the third man is the most dangerous to put back on the street. \n \n If I implied that we should punish all crimes the same, then I did not mean to. I meant to say that we should treat people of all beliefs, lifestyles, actions, and traits the same under the law, provided they do not hurt anyone. Hopefully that definition is more accurate...",

   "What one person or company does on one piece of private property doesn't effect everyone. \n \n\n \n Are you kidding me? Are you trying to tell me that global warming doesn't affect me? If there's a factory next door to me are you saying the smoke doesn't affect my breathing?\n \n \n \n\n Gay marriage throughout an entire society, with it's public references, ceremonies, financial debates, and influence in public schools and churches, effects the public at large a lot more than environmental actions of private property owners, especially since there's really no way to define \"cleanliness\". Very few people want to deny gays from being together, living how they want, doing whatever they want to do. Environmentalists often want to stop private property owners from living how they want, doing what they want to do.\n \n\n \n Gay marriage does not affect the entire society. Gays will live together and there will be public references no matter what. Outlawing gay marriage won't keep gays out of public schools or churches either. And there certainly is a way to define \"cleanliness\". The less polution in the air, the less clean it is. I'm sure there are scales for measuring just that, I can find them if you want. And I'm sure that if they could many people would want to stop gays from living together. But they know that'll never fly.\n \n In terms of gay marriage being publicized: If they just legalized it and didn't argue with it there would be a lot less publicity than now where they are fighting for their right to get marrried.",

You (or someone) implied that the actions of one property owner effects EVERYONE.\n \n \n \n \nAnd I'm sure that if they could many people would want to stop gays from living together. But they know that'll never fly.\n\n \n That's exactly right - no one can legally stop gays from living together, or invade their home because they're living together, and I'm sure that will never change. Environmentalists CAN legally invade private property (not just huge factories, ANY commercial or non commercial private property even if it involves only one person on a huge amount of land, and stop him from doing a very small, insignificant landfill operation. I\\'ve seen it happen.\n \n The post I originally responded to implied that conservatives are more of a threat to individual liberty than are liberals. I just can\\'t believe anyone could seriously think that.\n \n \nIn terms of gay marriage being publicized: If they just legalized it and didn\\'t argue with it there would be a lot less publicity than now where they are fighting for their right to get marrried.\n\n \n That\\'s like saying once blacks get the right to vote, there will be a lot less publicity about racism.",
