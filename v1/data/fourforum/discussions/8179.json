   "It seems to me that the Federal officials will lose on this one. Wicca, as a religion, has been reconized in federal court.\nTrue. At least in one case the courts decided that it was a violation of the 1st Amendment for the military to prohibit the practice of Wicca on military property (Ft. Sill as I recall) when other religious practices were allowed. The answer would be to ban all religious observances of any kind on military property (probably more in line with the 1st Amendment anyway) or to allow Wiccans to meet like other religions.\n \nI see Wicca as a poorly strewn together fad, but as far as I'm concerned, if that's what he wanted on his tombstone, let him have it.\nProbably also true. Just like fundamentalist christianity, they claim ancient foundations. Unlike fundamentalist christianity, there isn't any evidence that it is older than about the early part of the 20th century. Fundamentalist christianity however, can be traced to an anti-science movement at about the same time. Fundamentalist christianity can be shown to be less that 100 years old. The actual age of Wicca cannot be determined.\n \n I suspect that it isn't the \"Department of Veteran Affairs\" but some fundamentalist christian in a position of authority who thinks that he lives in a \"christian nation.\"\n \n The Free Exercise clause of the 1st Amendment prohibits the government from outlawing or seriously burdening a person's pursuit of whatever religion, and whatever religious practices, he chooses. It seems to me that preventing a symbol of ones personal religion from being placed on a tombstone violates the Free Exercise clause, especially since the display of that symbol would be a passive practice with no moral impact on anyone or anything else.",

   "Wel, I know where he is coming from. For there not to be religious discrmination , no religiosu symbol should be allowed. However, if any religious symbol is allowed, they all should be.\nThanks. At least one person understood. Nevertheless, I'll explain what I think I was thinking at the time.\n \n The 1st Amendment has two clauses that pertain to religious freedom. The first is referred to as the Establishment clause. The Establishment clause prohibits any law \"respecting an establishment of religion.\" The purpose of the clause is to prevent government from endorsing or supporting religion. It has been proposed by fundamentalist christians that the appointment of military chaplains, and the providing of buildings owned by the military for the purpose of worship is an endorsement of religion by the military, and therefore by the government of this country. They reason that this is evidence that this is a \"christian nation.\"\n \n That was the basis of my remark. It is true that the appointment of military chaplains and the provision of military facilities for the practice of religion is an approbation of religion. It is, therefore, a violation of the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment. Will even a federal district court propose such an opinion? Not on your life.\n \n The second point should have been obvious. If christianity, judaism, islam, and others are provided for on a military base, then the Free Exercise Clause requires the same consideration by the government (military).\n \n An Army Sgt friend of my son's (also a Sgt) once told me that the Army encouraged three things; Patriotism, Religion (especially christianity), and alchoholism.
