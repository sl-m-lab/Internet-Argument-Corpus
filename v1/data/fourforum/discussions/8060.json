   "From the Wall Street Journal:\n \n Visiting a Civilization Gone With the Wind\n By NAOMI SCHAEFER RILEY\n April 13, 2006; Page D8\n Charleston, S.C.\n It was 145 years ago today Union troops defending Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor surrendered to Confederate forces, offering the South the first victory of its eventually losing cause. Sociologists may debate what hints of the stratified antebellum civilization continue to exist in the South today, and which are \"gone with the wind.\" But for history buffs, there is no more interesting evidence left than Southern plantations.\n \n On a recent sunny day, I drove about 20 minutes from downtown Charleston, turned onto a tree-canopied road and found myself at Drayton Hall, completed in 1742. Like many of the original Southern colonists, John Drayton wanted to prove to his European contemporaries that he did not live in a barbaric wilderness. The beautiful Palladian architecture of his home, that he sent his sons off to Britain for their educations, and the many luxuries the Draytons enjoyed were meant to drive home this point. John Drayton owned more than 20 other plantations, as well as a few hundred slaves.\n \n Seven generations of Draytons changed remarkably little in the 230 or so years they lived here before the final descendant gave it over to the National Trust in 1974. They didn't add plumbing or heat, and the trust has since removed all of the furniture and decorations. The bare rooms allow for a close inspection of the architecture and encourage a focus on the history of the house and its family. Standing on the third-floor balcony, Drayton Hall director George McDaniel explains that the biggest difference between the environment now and in the 1800s may be the noise level. What seems like a peaceful place today was once a bustling business.\n \n Through a door off the dining room you can see the back stairs the slaves used to carry food up and bring waste down. The slaves' lives are virtually invisible on the second and third floors, but on the ground floor giant fireplaces reveal the amount of labor that made the house run. \"This beautiful house was also like a gulag or a concentration camp. People's lives were circumscribed by these walls,\" Mr. McDaniel says. The National Trust has gone to great lengths and expense to give visitors a sense of the lives of slaves and masters.\n \n The trust runs only six plantations. Some of the states and the National Park Service run a few as well, but the vast majority are in private hands, including nonprofit foundations. James Vaughan, the vice president for stewardship of historic sites for the National Trust, estimates that several hundred plantations have some remnants of their original structure and farmland intact and probably a couple hundred of those are open to the public. The experts I spoke with agree that the biggest concentrations of the best preserved and most interesting plantations are on the James River in Virginia, the Mississippi outside of New Orleans and the Ashley River in and near Charleston.\n \n Luck and economics are the main reasons that these homesteads survive. Luck in that the Union troops simply did not wreak the destruction on these areas that they did near Atlanta and Savannah, Ga., for instance. The economics is more complicated. In some parts of the South, the poverty that set in after the Civil War and lasted through the 1940s meant old buildings just deteriorated over time, but historian Erskine Clarke, author of \"Dwelling Place: A Plantation Epic,\" suggests that poverty in places like Charleston \"actually was a kind of preserving force.\" No one had the money to tear down these historic structures and build new ones.\n \n By some measures, though, Charleston was fortunate. When slavery ended and families could no longer raise labor-intensive crops, some plantations found other sources of income. Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant, S.C., which had farmed cotton, became home to the world's largest pecan grove. Drayton Hall itself was once mostly a rice farm but later became a site for phosphate mining. Some plantations were bought by Northerners and used as hunting lodges, and many are still vacation homes.\n \n But even families able to hold onto their homes well into the 20th century found themselves facing steep tax bills in the past few decades. Charles Duell, a descendant of the family that owned Middleton Place in Charleston, thought he would have to sell the plantation to pay the millions of dollars of estate taxes he would owe upon inheriting the land from his grandfather. When it turned out that his grandfather was just a tenant on the land, Mr. Duell was off the hook. But there was no way he could afford the upkeep of Middleton on his own. So in 1973 he formed a nonprofit foundation, which runs the site.\n \n Thanks to Mr. Duell's forethought, the ticket prices (about $40 per adult) and the beauty of the site, Middleton Place appears to be thriving. Walking through its gardens, which are arranged according to the principles of Andr\u00e9 LeN\u00f4tre, who laid out those at Versailles, one again has the feeling that the owners were trying to keep up with Europe. Indeed, it would be easy to imagine, say, a 19-year-old Union soldier from the New York regiment assigned to the area coming upon this landscape and thinking: \"This is a different country!\"\n \n (More)",

   "As it happens, the Union army burned most of the structures at Middleton Place. Williams Middleton had signed the Ordinance of Secession and an example was made of his family home. Today, an interesting collection of family possessions can be found in what used to be the library, but the plantation's presentation of slave life at Middleton is the reason to visit.\n \n A guide explains the \"task system\" in which slaves were assigned a particular job for the day; if and when it was complete, they could do their own work. For an adult male, one task was tending to a quarter of an acre of rice. The guide will show you a paddy of that size and explain what had to be done to grow the rice and harvest it. The stable yards have been re-created to show how a plantation was self-sustaining, with slave carpenters and blacksmiths on the premises. There are even extensive records of when each slave was bought and sold, and for how much.\n \n That the lives of the slaves and the masters are two separate tours at Middleton is perhaps supposed to show how little the two groups interacted (the plantation was really run by overseers). But it makes a visitor wonder what the Middletons really thought about slavery in general and their own slaves in particular, how the slaves were treated and even whether the masters later had any regrets.\n \n If Middleton leaves a tourist mostly sated, though, Boone Hall, a few more miles from Charleston, leaves one largely baffled. Privately owned, though not by descendants of the original family, Boone is a plantation whose presentation is wanting. The most impressive aspect of the property are the original slave cabins that line one side of the Live-Oak alley leading up to the main house. Because these were brick they survived long after most similar structures fell apart. Indeed, black sharecroppers actually lived in these one-room structures with no plumbing and no electricity into the 1940s.\n \n How do the guides explain slavery using these buildings? Aside from a few excavation sites, where archaeologists dug under the floor to find artifacts, there is little of interest in any of them. In one, disturbingly, an older black woman is making and selling sweet-grass baskets. Our guide tells me they are planning on changing the slave-cabin exhibits soon and are also hiring an improv troop to tell stories in the Gullah language.\n \n The original main house was torn down decades ago and a lavish mansion was built in 1935 by Thomas Stone, Canadian ambassador to the Netherlands, who owned the property until the outbreak of World War II. If you were wondering what Stone thought of the black families living in dire poverty on his property, you won't find out here. Nor will you learn much of anything about the Boone family, including Edward and John Rutledge (signers of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, respectively); the Houlbec family, which owned the property for much of the 19th century; or anyone's slaves. The tour guide mostly offered details about the antiques and architecture and the movies that have been filmed in the mansion.\n \n There remains on some plantations today the \"old 'Gone With the Wind' image of plantation life with very little mention of the harshness of slavery,\" author Erskine Clarke explains. (At one I visited outside of New Orleans, there was a surprising amount of commentary on the silverware but next to nothing on slave life; my teenage guide in period dress was a little unclear on the dates of the Civil War.) Mr. Clarke does not expect this shoddy history to be able to continue much longer. For one thing, he notes, African-Americans who go on tours with their churches, for instance, \"are interested in seeing historic sites that are able to portray the way the world looked from a slave perspective.\"\n \n Ms. Riley is the Journal's deputy Taste page editor and the author of \"God on the Quad.\"",

   "Get Off the Veranda and See the Plantation\n Naomi Schaefer Riley's April 13 Leisure & Arts article on Charleston's plantations was a welcome change from the usual crinoline and julep approach to antebellum history. Particularly telling was her observation that the evidence of slavery, the grim economic engine of the \"Gone With the Wind\" South, seems to have been edited out of plantation life. As Ms. Riley suggests, the archeological and social history of the South too often ignores the role of the slaves who made the bricks, forged the ironwork, built the great houses and grew the crops. As a result, our view of antebellum plantation life becomes a sort of cultural Potemkin Village that is all front veranda and no back stairs.\n \n This one-dimensional view of Southern society is terribly unfair to today's African-Americans who, until recently, were often ignored as participants in our nation's history. In Charleston County, there are dozens of historically \"significant\" sites, but not a single monument or plaque to the silent generations of slaves who built and tended Charleston's architectural treasures. Today there is only a single plantation left to tell their story, and it is threatened.\n \n One organization, the Friends of McLeod, has forged an alliance embracing a mosaic of racial and cultural groups determined to save McLeod Plantation, a Sea Island plantation standing only five minutes from historic Charleston. McLeod is the last plantation in metropolitan Charleston. For more than 300 years, it has been a focus of African-American history. Slaves cleared the land and built the buildings, the famous 54th and 55th (black) Massachusetts regiments were headquartered there during the Civil War, and at war's end a regional Freedmen's Bureau was located at McLeod. The row of slave cabins along the oak allees were home to African-Americans until the 1970s, and the overgrown cemeteries are the last resting place of long generations of slaves and free men.\n \n Today, though, McLeod's identity is in peril. Willie McLeod, the last of the line, directed in his will that the plantation be open to the public, but the city of Charleston has rezoned the property to allow development in and around the buildings and in the last remaining field. They're wrong, of course, but only articles such as Ms. Riley's can explain in detail why African-Americans must have the opportunity to preserve their culture, too.\n \n The Friends of McLeod will continue to keep fighting in the courts and in the larger arena of public opinion to save this icon of local history. It was not too long ago that our African-American countrymen were denied recognition as equals. Progress has been made in many areas, but their distinct history still remains almost invisible.\n \n Carol S. Jacobsen, Vice Chair\n Friends of McLeod Inc.\n Charleston, S.C.",
