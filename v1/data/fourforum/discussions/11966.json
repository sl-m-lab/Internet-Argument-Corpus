   "With all of the technology and resources of the 1st world countries in the 21st century, how is it that we are unable to pull the approximately 1 billion people who are starving and dying of treatable diseases out of their desperate situations? Here are some statistical facts to start with\n Health Issues\n Author And Page Information\n by Anup ShahThis Page Last Updated Monday, October 27, 2008\n This page: Health Issues ? Global Issues.\n To print all information e.g. expanded side notes, shows alternative links, use the print version:\n Health Issues ? Printer friendly version ? Global Issues\n Despite incredible improvements in health since 1950, there are still a number of challenges, which should have been easy to solve. Consider the following:\n \n One billion people lack access to health care systems.\n Around 11 million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition and mostly preventable diseases, each year.\n In 2002, almost 11 million people died of infectious diseases alone, far more than the number killed in the natural or man-made catastrophes that make headlines. (These are the latest figures presented by the World Health Organization.)\n AIDS/HIV has spread rapidly. UNAIDS estimates for 2007 that there are roughly:\n 32.8 million living with HIV\n 2.5 million new infections of HIV\n 2 million deaths from AIDS\n There are 8.8 million new cases of Tuberculosis (TB) and 1.75 million deaths from TB, each year.\n 1.6 million people still die from pneumococcal diseases every year, making it the number one vaccine-preventable cause of death worldwide. More than half of the victims are children. (The pneumococcus is a bacterium that causes serious infections like meningitis, pneumonia and sepsis. In developing countries, even half of those children who receive medical treatment will die. Every second surviving child will have some kind of disability.)\n Malaria causes more than 300 million acute illnesses and at least 1 million deaths, annually.\n More than half a million people, mostly children, died from measles in 2003 even though effective immunization costs just 0.30 US dollars per person, and has been available for over 40 years.\n These and other diseases kill more people each year than conflict alone.Health Issues ?

   "It just seems to me, and has been apparent for decades now, that the 1st world countries are capable of transferring our knowledge of crop rotation, storage of foods, distribution and farming expertise and equipment evenly across the globe to third world countries, in addition to training locals in basic medical and health care, so that had we been doing this over the past 30 years, we could have wiped out these realities by now. \n \n I don't believe it's necessary at all to bankrupt one country in order to lift another country out of abject poverty. I'm not so naive as to not understand that in many African countries where starvation is rampant, the responsibility lies directly with the local governments which actually encourage and cause much of the suffering due to the local dictators greed. So the leaders seem to be the problem in so many cases. \n \n The question is then, what to do about them as we try to create opportunities for the citizens to pull themselves out of this hopeless situation. We in the west have shown that creating wealth, both personal and national, is possible. So why can't we teach National leaders in the tribal societies that they too will prosper by lifting up their citizens standards of living also? It makes no sense to me at all.",

I say this because if you were correct, then we would have your socialist and communist strongholds putting we capitalists to shame with all of the good works they are doing to rid the world of the scourge of this perpetual underclass.\n \n But no, none of that is true at all. It can be proven that America is the most charitable and generous country on Earth giving an average of 300 BILLION dollars a year out of our personal pockets, and of that, conservatives give 30% more than liberals. Here's evidence of that fact. http://www.4forums.com/political/abortion-debates/5447-new-person-here-3.html#post332614 I've been through this before.\n \n But this giving is disorganized and could be much better spent if a plan was in place to organize the distribution to serve specific needs in specific ways specific places in a protected way that guaranteed the types of results we get here at home. The fact is that there is no reason for starving people to still exist in this world today. I'm seeking practical solutions and ideas here; not another blame game so as to excoriate one government/political system, or the other.\n \n The reality is though that socialist countries and communist countries don't do more to feed and clothe the unwashed masses; they do less than we do, so to claim its just western corporations to blame is ludicrous. Especially since I know that major corporations all have massive budgets for consistent charitable giving. This problem is prioritized placement of resources, not a lack of resources. \n \n Corporate Giving: The Views of Chief Executive Officers of Major American Corporations.",

   "\"The US, the world's biggest economy, gives aid to African nations. This is a welcome development when one realises that a huge gap exists between the US and Africa. But the aid thing is becoming a gift with the right hand and taking it back (even more than gift)with the left. How else can one explain a situation where America closes part of its market to African exports? Apart from crude oil, which it desperately needs, no manufactured or agricultural commodity from Africa is `good enough` for the American market. The few items that get in are dropped out of the market by high tariffs. As if there are not enough subsidies received by the farmers there (the West), it makes these African commodities stand no chance in arguably world's most profitable market!\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Trade Malpractices: The Bane of Africa, by Mac-Edwin Obi",
