   "I would be interested to hear criticisms/affirmations/thoughts in general on the following article, in particular the section on \"X is the fact that a fetus is not alive\" discussing substance and accidents:\n \n\n \n The author stumbles into skepticism, and but obviously doesn't see the logical conclusions that abound from it. My guess is the author exhibits \"selective skepticism\", which is unfortunate.\n \n We can start with the ending, that way I keep the post short. Here is his \"conclusion\" which he claims has not been logically or rationally rejected. I find that hard to believe:\n \n The fact is, of course, that there is no x, and thus no substantial difference between abortion and infanticide.  \n \n The author poses the question \"what is X\", then claims there is no X, as fact, which is the same as his conclusion, there is no difference between abortion and infanticide. \n \n That's got two prominent problems. First, it's just a restatement of his premise twice. That's not a logical conclusion, sorry, we all see that right? Further, it's a statement not backed by justification. His justificiation is his claim that what he says, is fact. Well, OK, but others may want to see some reason behind your claim of truth...you know...reason...that thing that is mutually exclusive to faith.\n \n I won't even get into the issue per se, we don't really need to. Casual examination of the authors reasoning leaves us without anything substantial to discuss in the way of his conclusion. He did provide a nice summary of what an \"X\" is, and that can of course be debated.\n ===============\n Regarding: Is \"X\" a life?\n \"A life\", and \"living\", have two different connotations.\n \"Living\" applies to our tissues, our cells, anything we ARBITRARILY define as \"life\". in short, anything comprised of living cells, is \"living\".\n \n Now, is it \"a life\"? Define \"a life\". If you define \"a life\". The debate often seems to take the form of logical fallacy, and it doesn't need to. You can have an abortion debate from BOTH sides, without being illogical, I don't know why that's so hard.\n \n -Mach",
