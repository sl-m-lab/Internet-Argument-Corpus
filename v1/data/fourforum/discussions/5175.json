   "Just looking at the other country we occupy:\n \n By CARLOTTA GALL\n Published: May 12, 2005\n \n KABUL, Afghanistan, May 11 - Four protesters were killed and more than 60 injured Wednesday in the eastern city of Jalalabad as the police and troops struggled to contain the worst anti-American demonstrations in Afghanistan in the more than three years since the fall of the Taliban.\n \n Government officials said the violence appeared to have been planned and that religious hard-liners and armed men had usurped what had started as a student protest.\n \n At least a dozen buildings were ransacked and burned, including the governor's office, several other government buildings, the United Nations mission compound and a number of offices belonging to aid groups.\n \n Afghan policemen and troops, together with some American forces, eventually quelled the riots, but not before opening fire on protesters, who numbered in the thousands, residents said. Foreigners were evacuated from the city as their offices came under attack, and the air filled with smoke and gunfire, but no injuries to foreigners were reported.\n \n The demonstrations were started on Tuesday by students angered by a report in Newsweek that American interrogators at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention center had desecrated the Koran by flushing a copy down the toilet.\n \n It was unclear how the protesters got word of the report, but many Afghans receive their news from radio programs broadcast in local languages by Voice of America, the BBC and Radio Liberty, which often broadcast foreign news reports.\n \n They carried banners condemning the reported sacrilege, chanted anti-American slogans and burned President Bush in effigy. The protest proceeded peacefully on Tuesday, but on Wednesday it suddenly turned violent, with hundreds of stone-throwing and stick-wielding demonstrators spreading across town. Soon they were breaking into compounds, smashing cars and setting buildings on fire.\n \n By midafternoon four people had been killed and 63 wounded, many from gunshots and others from stones, knives and sticks, the director of public health in Jalalabad, Fazel Muhammad Ibrahimi, said in a telephone interview. Seventeen people were detained by the police, Kabul Television reported.\n \n The governor's office was set on fire, as was the Central Statistics Office, destroying the census records, said a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Lutfullah Mashal. The Pakistani Consulate, the city library and the regional television and radio station were also attacked, he said.\n \n The main United Nations office and two guesthouses were attacked and staff members evacuated, a United Nations spokeswoman said. Aid organizations including the Red Cross; Acbar, an umbrella group of aid organizations; and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission were attacked, as well as offices of the Women's Affairs Ministry, residents said.\n \n Demonstrations were reported in several other towns in eastern and southern Afghanistan, but they seem to have been peaceful. High school students in Wardak Province blocked the main road south from Kabul for an hour but were persuaded to disperse peacefully, said the local police chief, Basir Salangi.\n \n In Jalalabad, \"the students were peaceful and were shouting,\" Mr. Mashal said. \"But there were some specific hard-line religious groups involved. From their activities it looks like it was preplanned.\"\n \n He said there were some indications that the violence had been influenced by religious or extreme elements across the border in Pakistan, whether supporters of the Taliban, who were removed from power in late 2001 in an American-led military campaign, or Pakistani groups.\n \n President Hamid Karzai, on a visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels, said that while protests were a sign of newfound democracy, the violence indicated how much Afghanistan still needed foreign assistance. \"Afghanistan's institutions, the police, the army, are not ready to handle\" such protests, he said, adding that guards at the governor's office had stood by while the offices had been destroyed.\n \n Sharifa Shahab, an officer of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, was leading an election seminar for women in Jalalabad when the demonstration began. She and 20 others were taken to the basement of the United Nations mission for protection, she said.\n \n \"This was not a demonstration,\" she said. \"It was completely organized violence. It started with students from the medical college, and then armed men seized the occasion and abused it.\" \n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/12/international/asia/12afghan.html?oref=login",

Afghasnistan hasn't been in the papers much recently, so who knows what's happening there. The troops there have the same training and oversight as our Iraq troops, the cultrure is just a strange there, and the troops have been there just as long if not longer.

Very close to treasonous, and people are dead because of this gross irresponsibility. And it shouldn't have been reported even if it were true. An internal investigation could have come after the war was completed. FDR would have had some people hung over this screw-up as he did with those German saboteurs. \n =======================================\n \n \n Newsweek says Koran desecration report is wrong\n \n By David Morgan1 hour, 26 minutes ago\n \n Newsweek magazine said on Sunday it erred in a May 9 report that U.S. interrogators desecrated the Koran at Guantanamo Bay, and apologized to the victims of deadly Muslim protests sparked by the article.\n \n Editor Mark Whitaker said the magazine inaccurately reported that U.S. military investigators had confirmed that personnel at the detention facility in Cuba had flushed the Muslim holy book down the toilet.\n \n The report sparked angry and violent protests across the Muslim world from Afghanistan, where 16 were killed and more than 100 injured, to Pakistan to Indonesia to Gaza. In the past week it was condemned in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Malaysia and by the Arab League.\n \n On Sunday, Afghan Muslim clerics threatened to call for a holy war against the United States.\n \n \"We regret that we got any part of our story wrong, and extend our sympathies to victims of the violence and to the U.S. soldiers caught in its midst,\" Whitaker wrote in the magazine's latest issue, due to appear on U.S. newsstands on Monday.\n \n The weekly news magazine said in its May 23 edition that the information had come from a \"knowledgeable government source\" who told Newsweek that a military report on abuse at Guantanamo Bay said interrogators flushed at least one copy of the Koran down a toilet in a bid to make detainees talk.\n \n But Newsweek said the source later told the magazine he could not be certain he had seen an account of the Koran incident in the military report and that it might have been in other investigative documents or drafts.\n \n Whitaker told Reuters that Newsweek did not know if the reported toilet incident involving the Koran ever occurred. \"As to whether anything like this happened, we just don't know,\" he said in an interview. \"We're not saying it absolutely happened but we can't say that it absolutely didn't happen either.\"\n \n INCIDENT UNDER INVESTIGATION\n \n The acknowledgment by the magazine came amid heightened scrutiny of the U.S. media, which has seen a rash of news organizations fire reporters and admit that stories were fabricated or plagiarized.\n \n The Pentagon told the magazine the report was wrong last Friday, saying it had investigated earlier allegations of Koran desecration from detainees and found them \"not credible.\"\n \n Newsweek reported that Pentagon spokesman Lawrence DiRita reacted angrily when the magazine asked about the source's continued assertion that he had read about the Koran incident in an investigative report. \"People are dead because of what this son of a bitch said. How could he be credible now?\" DiRita told Newsweek.\n \n The May 9 report, which appeared as a brief item by Michael Isikoff and John Barry in the magazine's \"Periscope\" section, had a huge international impact, sparking the protests from Muslims who consider the Koran the literal word of God and treat each book with deep reverence.\n \n Desecration of the Koran is punishable by death in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n \n Newsweek, which said opponents of the Afghan government including remnants of the Taliban had used its report to fan unrest in the country, said it was not contemplating disciplinary action against staff.\n \n \"This was reported very carefully, with great sensitivity and concern, and we'll continue to report on it,\" said Newsweek Managing Editor John Meecham. \"We have tried to be transparent about exactly what happened, and we leave it to the readers to judge us.\"\n \n U.S. officials opened an investigation but maintained that members of the Guantanamo security force were sensitive to the religious beliefs and practices of the detainees in U.S. custody.\n \n U.S. national security adviser Stephen Hadley earlier on Sunday stressed the report had not been confirmed. \"If it turns out to be true, obviously we will take action against those responsible,\" Hadley said on CNN's \"Late Edition.\"\n \n Newsweek's Whitaker said that when the magazine first heard of the Koran allegation from its source, staff approached two Defense Department officials. One declined to comment, while the other challenged a different aspect of the May 9 story but did not dispute the Koran charge.\n \n The magazine said other news organizations had already aired charges of Koran desecration based \"only on the testimony of detainees.\"\n \n \"We believed our story was newsworthy because a U.S. official said government investigators turned up this evidence. So we published the item,\" Whitaker said.\n \n \"Our original source later said he couldn't be certain about reading of the alleged Koran incident in the report we cited,\" he wrote.\n \n http://story.news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050515/ts_nm/religion_afghan_newsweek_dc",

   "Oh well, nothing to see here. Let's move along. Tomorrow's Imus program should be interesting. I believe the managing editor of Newsweek will be on. The **** should hit the fan.\n =================================\n Newsweek Apologizes\n Inaccurate Report on Koran Led to Riots\n \n By Howard Kurtz\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Monday, May 16, 2005; A01\n \n Newsweek apologized yesterday for an inaccurate report on the treatment of detainees that triggered several days of rioting in Afghanistan and other countries in which at least 15 people died.\n \n Editor Mark Whitaker expressed regret over the item in the magazine's \"Periscope\" section, saying it was based on a confidential source -- a \"senior U.S. government official\" -- who now says he is not sure whether the story is true.\n \n The deadly consequences of the May 1 report, and its reliance on the unnamed source, have sparked considerable anger at the Pentagon. Spokesman Bryan Whitman called Newsweek's report \"irresponsible\" and \"demonstrably false,\" saying the magazine \"hid behind anonymous sources which by their own admission do not withstand scrutiny. Unfortunately, they cannot retract the damage that they have done to this nation or those who were viciously attacked by those false allegations.\"\n \n Whitaker said last night that \"whatever facts we got wrong, we apologize for. I've expressed regret for the loss of life and the violence that put American troops in harm's way. I'm getting a lot of angry e-mail about that, and I understand it.\"\n \n The report, in the issue dated May 9, said U.S. military investigators had found that American interrogators at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had flushed a copy of the Koran, the sacred Muslim text, down a toilet. A week later, when newspapers in Afghanistan and Pakistan picked up the item, it sparked anti-American demonstrations in the Afghan city of Jalalabad in which four protesters were killed and more than 60 injured. A dozen more protesters were killed in the following days when the demonstrations spread across Afghanistan and to Pakistan and other countries.\n \n \"There had been previous reports about the Koran being defiled, but they always seemed to be rumors or allegations made by sources without evidence,\" Whitaker said, referring to reporting by British and Russian news agencies and by the Qatar-based satellite network al-Jazeera. The Washington Post, whose parent company owns Newsweek, reported a similar account in March 2003, attributing it to a group of former detainees. \"The fact that a knowledgeable source within the U.S. government was telling us the government itself had knowledge of this was newsworthy,\" Whitaker said in an interview.\n \n He said that a senior Pentagon official, for reasons that \"are still a little mysterious to us,\" had declined to comment after Newsweek correspondent John Barry showed him a draft before the item was published -- except to challenge an unrelated point -- and that the magazine would have held off had military spokesmen made such a request. Whitaker said Pentagon officials raised no objection to the story for a week after it was published, until it was translated by some Arab media outlets and led to the rioting.\n \n The item was principally reported by Michael Isikoff, Newsweek's veteran investigative reporter, who initiated the story by calling the source. Isikoff, a former Post reporter, gained national attention in 1998 when the magazine held his report on an independent counsel's investigation of Monica S. Lewinsky's relationship with President Bill Clinton, a report that then leaked to Internet gossip columnist Matt Drudge. Isikoff's role was crucial because he had listened to tapes secretly recorded by Linda Tripp, a colleague of the former White House intern. Isikoff declined to comment, and a Newsweek spokesman said top editors are handling all media inquiries.\n \n The 10-sentence item said an upcoming report by the U.S. Southern Command in Miami was \"expected\" to include the alleged Koran incident -- the subject of only one sentence -- among various abusive techniques used \"to rattle suspects\" at Guantanamo. Since then, Pentagon officials and Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have said investigators found \"no credible allegations of willful Koran desecration,\" as Whitman put it.\n \n On Saturday, when Isikoff reached his original source, the magazine said, the official \"could no longer be sure\" that the Koran allegation \"had surfaced\" in the SouthCom investigation.\n \n \"Just as citizens,\" Whitaker said, \"we feel badly about the fact that there's been a rash of violence. . . . Clearly, that was not our intent in publishing what we thought was a solid news item.\"\n \n But the story is already showing signs of becoming the latest in a high-profile series of media blunders involving plagiarism, fabrications and questionable documents at such respected news organizations as the New York Times, USA Today and CBS News. In this case, the consequences -- deadly riots -- were far more serious than a breach of journalistic ethics.\n \n The intensity of the anti-American riots, fueled in part by outraged Muslim clerics and radio broadcasts by elements of the ousted Taliban regime, took many Western analysts by surprise. Desecrating the Koran is punishable by death in some Muslim countries. Newsweek reported yesterday that agitators opposed to the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai had seized on the report to foment violence.\n \n About 500 Islamic scholars meeting in the northern Afghan province of Badakshan, where protests were held last week, passed a resolution yesterday urging a U.S. investigation of the Newsweek report, according to wire service accounts.\n \n Interviews with several people in the province yielded differing views of the controversy. Javed Ahmed, 23, a sandal salesman who participated in the demonstration, said he was unaware of the Newsweek story until the radio program of Iranian, Afghan and Indian songs that he normally listens to was interrupted with news of the violent protests in Jalalabad. He was initially \"doubtful\" about the allegation, he said, \"but when I saw it on television later that day, I became more sure it was true.\"\n \n Ghulam Dastagir, 28, a bird seller who refused to join the demonstration, said: \"I don't think the report is true, but these crises work for those who want to make fights between people.\"\n \n Del Agha, 47, a dry-goods salesman who joined the protest, said, \"Even now, I'm not sure if this was true.\" He said he participated because \"we just wanted to tell the world that the people who did this should be brought to justice\" for \"disrespecting the holy Koran. . . . We wanted to have a peaceful demonstration but the demonstration was like a car and some people who are the enemies of Afghanistan took the steering wheel and turned it in the wrong direction.\"\n \n The fallout here is starting to build, and Dan Klaidman, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief, was doing cable news interviews yesterday, describing the story as \"an honest mistake.\"\n \n Said Whitaker: \"I suppose you could say we should have foreseen the consequences of the report, but we didn't.\"\n \n Staff writers N.C. Aizenmann in Kabul and Ann Scott Tyson in Washington contributed to this report.\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/15/AR2005051500605_pf.html",

We can go all the way back to our founding to find flame throwers like Tom Paine who would make Rush Limbaugh appear to be a diplomat. What we need in the press are individuals who are both patriotic and respectful of the truth. A little common sense would also go a long way. No way in the world should that Newsweek story have seen the light of day. \n \n As to your last question, consider how the press handled FDR's disability. He was a dead man walking when he won his fourth term of office. They didn't tell us that nor the fact he had a long standing affair with a woman other than his wife. One can also look at the old news reels of the day to see how the news was handled during a war time. Most leftists do not see us in a war footing, but real Americans know viscerally that we are in a clash of civilizations and that if we do not hang together we will hang seperately. The wedge driven into American society by an irresponsible press is largely responsible. The liberal NYT was opining today that far too much time is spent on reporting the bombing in Iraq as though that is news. All it really does is to sew discouragement among the American people. Suppose that all the American people had heard about during the Battle of the Bulge was how many American boys lost their lives there (we lost 19,000 dead.) See link below. This gives some perspective to the news of today and news of WWII when patriotism was expected of all Americans, including news reporters.\n \n By the time it was over with American troops suffered 81,000 casualties, including 19,000 deaths, in one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. The German army suffered 70,000 casualties with 20,000 dead.\n \n The Battle of the Bulge was the largest combat action in the history of the American military; for 40 days the men fought in the bitter cold of the worst winter weather in 20 years, not even stopping for Christmas Day. When it was over, the German Army in the West was broken.\n \n http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Defensewatch_121704_Helms,00.html",

   "Here is an interesting article I came across while surfing the net. As I have said before, you know where my nickel is riding as to whether or not the Quran was dumped into a toilet or not. Also, you know that I am of the opinion that the toilet is the proper place to put one. That being said....enjoy!\n **************************************************\n \n Newsweek Got It Right\n By Calgacus\n MediaChannel.org\n 5-18-5\n \n CAMBRIDGE, MA -- Contrary to White House spin, the allegations of religious desecration at Guantanamo published by Newsweek on May 9, 2005, are common among ex-prisoners and have been widely reported outside the United States. Several former detainees at the Guantanamo and Bagram prisons have reported instances of their handlers sitting or standing on the Quran, throwing or kicking it in toilets, and urinating on it. Prior to the Newsweek article, the New York Times reported a Guantanamo insider asserting that the commander of the facility was compelled by prisoner protests to address the problem and issue an apology. \n \n One such incident (during which the Quran was allegedly thrown in a pile and stepped on) prompted a hunger strike among Guantanamo detainees in March 2002. Regarding this, the New York Times in a May 1, 2005, article interviewed a former detainee, Nasser Nijer Naser al-Mutairi, who said the protest ended with a senior officer delivering an apology to the entire camp. And the Times reports: \"A former interrogator at Guantanamo, in an interview with the Times, confirmed the accounts of the hunger strikes, including the public expression of regret over the treatment of the Korans.\" (Neil A. Lewis and Eric Schmitt, \"Inquiry Finds Abuses at Guantanamo Bay,\" New York Times, May 1, 2005.) \n \n The hunger strike and apology story is also confirmed by another former detainee, Shafiq Rasul, interviewed by the UK Guardian in 2003 (James Meek, \"The People the Law Forgot,\" Dec. 3, 2003). It was also confirmed by former prisoner Jamal al-Harith in an interview with the Daily Mirror (Rosa Prince and Gary Jones, \"My Hell in Camp X-Ray,\" Daily Mirror, March 12, 2004). \n \n The toilet incident was reported in the Washington Post in a 2003 interview with a former detainee from Afghanistan: \n \n \"Ehsannullah, 29, said American soldiers who initially questioned him in Kandahar before shipping him to Guantanamo hit him and taunted him by dumping the Quran in a toilet. 'It was a very bad situation for us,' said Ehsannullah, who comes from the home region of the Taliban leader, Mohammad Omar. 'We cried so much and shouted, \"Please do not do that to the Holy Quran.\"' \n (Marc Kaufman and April Witt, \"Out of Legal Limbo, Some Tell of Mistreatment,\" Washington Post, March 26, 2003.) \n \n Also citing the toilet incident is testimony by Asif Iqbal, a former Guantanamo detainee who was released to British custody in March 2004 and subsequently freed without charge: \n \n \"The behavior of the guards towards our religious practices as well as the Quran was also, in my view, designed to cause us as much distress as possible. They would kick the Quran, throw it into the toilet, and generally disrespect it.\" \n (Center for Constitutional Rights [.pdf], Aug. 4, 2004.) \n \n The claim that U.S. troops at Bagram prison in Afghanistan urinated on the Quran was made by former detainee Mohamed Mazouz, a Moroccan, as reported in the Moroccan newspaper, La Gazette du Maroc. (Abdelhak Najib, \"Les Am&#1048;ricains pissaient sur le Coran et abusaient de nous sexuellement,\" April 12, 2005.) An English translation is available on the Cage Prisoners site (which describes itself as a \"nonsectarian Islamic human rights Web site\"). \n \n Tarek Derghoul, another of the British detainees, similarly cites instances of Quran desecration in an interview with Cage Prisoners. \n \n Desecration of the Quran was also mentioned by former Guantanamo detainee Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost and reported by the BBC in early May 2005. (Haroon Rashid, \"Ex-Inmates Share Guantanamo Ordeal,\" May 2, 2005.) \n \n \"Calgacus\" has been employed as a researcher in the national security field for 20 years. \n \n http://www.mediachannel.org/views/d...falert376.shtml",

What really outrages me is this: You have jihadists in Iraq that have bombed a mosque on more than one occasion. A mosque for crying out loud!! Where was the outrage among the Afgan rebels when a house of Allah was blown to bits and it's worshippers killed? Might it have had to do with who was doing the bombing? Can we make an educated guess about where the Afgan protestor's loyalties lie? Are we forgetting who we are at war with? These people are already outraged enough at us enough to justify killing 3000 innocent Americans just over 3 and 1/2 years ago! It seems we can't catch a break. Do any of you remember the outrage Christians felt and expressed over a taxpayer supported artistic display known as the P**S Christ? If that wasn't a case of desecrating a religious symbol of profound importance to catholics and other Christians, I don't know what is. Would any violence at all have been justified in that case?
