   "I have decided to create a list of things I find odd about creationists' arguments.\n This is similar to another list, but I am aiming for accuracy more than humor in this case.[*]They ignore all instances of evolution without speciation (microevolution) regardless of the changes in characteristics, and they ignore most instances of speciation because the characteristics of the new species aren't obviously different.[*]They admit that the fossils of human ancestors are similar to each other with some differences, but do not attribute this to evolution.[*]They believe that a lack of peer-reviewed anti-evolutionary research indicates that such research has been done and is being suppressed.[*]They ask for proof for all arguments made by proponents of evolution and ignore the proof when it is given.[*]They ask for proof for all arguments made by proponents of evolution, even though they admit that they cannot show any.[*]They provide \"evidence\" only in the form of another's argument, not with actual documented observations.[*]They complain about useless, ad hominem statements, making such a statement in the process.[*]They believe that random mutations cannot produce enough beneficial traits to allow a species to evolve.[*]They believe that a specific mutation would be required for survival in all cases involving a specific danger.[*]They believe that the perfection of the human body indicates design.[*]They ignore the imperfections of the human body simply because the imperfect structures have a function.\n Note: I may add to this list in the future if I come up with anything else worth mention.",

   "Though I find it hard to disagree with any specific item on this list, it would be a mistake to deduce that people who believe in creation are fundamentally any different from those who do not. I have to ask myself: what would it take to make me behave in such a fashion?\n \n If I'm brutally honest with myself, not much. These are emotionally charged issues - primarily, I think, for those who perceive themselves (mistakenly, in my opinion) as defending their faith. However wrongly, creationists believe that evolution - an observation no more spiritually significant, and no more in doubt than the height of a particular hill or the orbital trajectory of the Earth - is inimical to faith - inimical to goodness - in a way that transcends truth or logic. It must be false, because the alternative is a black pit of despair.\n \n I think if I truly believed such a thing, and saw myself as standing between humanity and that pit, I would have no difficulty at all in rationalising away double standards, refusing to honestly appraise evidence, and looking for ways to misinterpret the words of those I argue against, just so long as it afforded me the satisfaction of seeing them stymied. And if I further believed, as I think many creationists do, that fanatical evolutionists (the ones we more normally call 'thoroughly convinced by evidence') were a lost cause and that the real battle was for the hearts and minds of the undecideds, then I would not hesitate to muddy the waters and erect field upon field of strawmen, because it would not be about winning a stupid debate; it would not be about presenting the more cogent and persuasive argument and allowing onlookers to make their own decision; it would be simply too important to risk having them make the wrong decision.\n \n I claim no intellectual or moral superiority here; I have had to overcome none of these temptations because I really don't see that much as being at stake, and I freely, if shamefully admit that my history of intellectual honesty has been chequered to say the least - though I sincerely hope most would agree, not so much since I began posting here. As we atheists say*, \"There but for the grace of absolutely nobody at all go I.\"\n \n *Actually I don't think anyone but me says that, but it would be cool if they did.",
