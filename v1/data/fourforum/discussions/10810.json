   "Dozens in Texas town report seeing UFO\n \n By ANGELA K. BROWN, Associated Press Writer\n Mon Jan 14, 10:17 PM ET\n \n STEPHENVILLE, Texas - In this farming community where nightfall usually brings clear, starry skies, residents are abuzz over reported sightings of what many believe is a UFO.\n \n Several dozen people - including a pilot, county constable and business owners - insist they have seen a large silent object with bright lights flying low and fast. Some reported seeing fighter jets chasing it.\n \n \"People wonder what in the world it is because this is the Bible Belt, and everyone is afraid it's the end of times,\" said Steve Allen, a freight company owner and pilot who said the object he saw last week was a mile long and half a mile wide. \"It was positively, absolutely nothing from these parts.\"\n What do you think of this? A mile long and a half mile wide? Are all of these people seeing the same mirage from different angles? Could someone actually mistake 2 or even multiple commercial Jets for such an Aircraft? Are they delusional? Could there be anything to this story? Do Aliens visit the Earth in advanced Aircraft in your opinion? \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080115/ap_on_fe_st/odd_ufo_sightings;_ylt=Akmgn6eQZDfICLFy11ppCYcuQE4F",

And people who would be considered credible in any other situation. Especially a Pilot and a Constable. These are trained observers. And having lived in Texas and knowing how big hunting is down there, and that this is hunting season, seeing it through a rifle scope is actually understandable if it was a daytime sighting. \n \n But hunting at night is illegal so more info would be needed regarding that aspect of the story. Maybe he was at home, saw it overhead, and just grabbed his rifle because he wanted to use the scope on it for a better look at it.\n \n It's also interesting that the witnesses saw Military Jests chasing it yet the Government denies they got involved. I don't believe for a minute that the Government would ignore something the size that this craft is claimed to be. \n \n Could this be an American Military Craft? Could it be another type of experiment, such as holographic emitters being tested by the Government? I'm just saying, because obviously none of us has an actual clue.",
