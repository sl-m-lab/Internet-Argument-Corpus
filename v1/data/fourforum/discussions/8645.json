The 'josephus' antiquties 18 reference was added in the 4th century, and it apppears the the antiquies 20 is probaby a copiers gloss.\n \n Even if it wasn't, the first non-scriptual reference to him was in 93 c.e.\n \n Look at the progression of the details. The earliest writings about him were from saul/paul, who 'met' him on the road because he heard a voice in his head. It isn't after 70 c.e. that you get any details about what happened.. and that is after a major war in the area. \n \n The first non-biblical mention of Jesus that does not appear to be a forgery was Pilney the younger's mention of the Christian cult, in 109 CE.\n \n Do you think that is having a real person 'established'?",
