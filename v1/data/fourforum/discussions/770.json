   "I didn't read it all but I don't see any reference to the fact that Christian fundamentalism was a backlash movement in the U.S. against the findings of science. It is ironic that the scientists against whom the fundies rebelled were, for the most part, Christian. The fundamentalist movement takes its name from a series of tracts published in the early 20th century. And young earth creationism was born of the early 20th century 7th Day Adventist Church, especially the flood geology of George McCready Price. In the 1960s, Henry Morris adopted Price's flood geology and expressed it in the spirit of fundamentalist christianity and thus was born \"creation science.\"",

Creationist science has existed for centuries. It just wasn't called that because most science was looked at from a creation perspective until the evolution theory. There was no other theory that really competed up until Darwin. \n \n I would venture to say that Darwinism and evolution theory was a good thing for Christianity in the manner that it made some people start thinking about other possibilities, which kick-started a few brains out there.",
