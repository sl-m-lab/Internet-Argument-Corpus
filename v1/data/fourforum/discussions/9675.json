   "agreed. First world will have to lead\n\n \n \n Well, let's see, there are three Industrialized Nations on Earth today who are considered Superpowers. America, Russia, although it has fallen, still has tremendous power. And China. If you look at these 3 Nations, only one has imposed its own environmental laws that it has followed and made more stringent in the decades going back to the early 70s. And that Nation is the USA. Only we fixed the serious problems with Air Pollution that were affecting our major cities like a cancer in the early 70s. Los Angelus, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Atlanta, New York, Denver, and many other hot pockets of Inversion where Smog literally set over and sank into these places limiting the times that joggers could jog, bikers could ride their bike, skaters could roller blade, and kids could just play outside,\n \n Yes it was that bad in the 70s. But not anymore, in the USA anyway. But look at China and Russia. Do they use scrubber technology in their new factories to pull the carcenigens out of the air ? Do they control polluting their waterways and ground water ? Not on your life. The air and water quality in China is becoming a National epidemic. Lung problems and infections from the water has cancer rates on the rise at alarming rates. Russia recently reported yellow and orange snow with a pungent smell has fallen and covered a large populated section of Siberia. They have simply warned the people not to get it on their skin. No one knows the source or the cause of this event, and it seems the powers that be are more afraid to ask how and why than they are of the substance itself.\n \n So yes, the first Worlders do have to lead the way, but if the World stopped blaming the US when we are doing all we can based our productivity and focused on the third World Industrial polluters who have technology we have outlawed since the 60s, maybe we could get a real handle on air and water pollution.",

   "Ok, so you want the science explained.\n \n The current temperature on earth is dependant on the so-called greenhouse effect. This effect is a result of broad spectrum radiation emitted by the Sun being absorbed by the Earth and re-emitted in a much narrower band. This occurs because the absorption of radiation shifts electrons up 1 or more energy levels in an atom or molecule. When the electrons drop back, they emit radiation of certain fixed wavelengths. Some of these wavelengths match up with particular components of the atmosphere, and hence when the radiation is emitted, those components are particularly prone to absorbing that radiation again, causing the energy to be retained in the atmosphere rather than radiated into space. Because the emission occurs in a random direction, the greater the concentrations of certain chemicals in the atmosphere, the greater the chance of radiation becoming trapped. These chemicals include CO2 (Carbon Dioxide), H2O (Water), CH4 (Methane) and various more complex things, including CFCs if memory serves. Each of these will trap different wavelengths of radiation. Substantial increases in any of them will increase the amount of radiation trapped from that part of the spectrum.\n \n This much is basic quantum physics.\n \n We know that CO2 emissions from industry have increased massively over the last 2 centuries, as has deforestation. CO2 levels in the atmosphere have risen by over 50% above pre-industrial levels. Yes, there have been times in the very distant past when CO2 levels have been higher, but there is no natural process that anyone has been able to point to that would account for the increase, and as it coincides with the increase in industrial emissions there is every reason to believe that the two are synonymous. Likewise there has been no indication of any other natural event that could be responsible for the warming, claims about increases in solar activity have been proven to be false, as temperatures continued to rise despite a fall in solar activity. \n \n So, we have a correlation, a causal link, and a total lack of any credible other evidence. And yet \"sceptics\" react in exactly the same way as they do to evolution (and no-one should be surprised to find a lot of the same people trying to claim a scientific debate about both evolution and climate change).",

Didn't I say that China and Russia, not to mention that the Third World Industrialized Nations are polluting at unheard of levels due to antiquated technology that does nothing to protect either the air or water from unchecked pollutants being spewed to the tune of thousands of tons a day ? And then there are articles like this.\n \n An experiment that hints we are wrong on climate change\n Nigel Calder, former editor of New Scientist, says the orthodoxy must be challenged\n When politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled, they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works. We were treated to another dose of it recently when the experts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued the Summary for Policymakers that puts the political spin on an unfinished scientific dossier on climate change due for publication in a few months' time. They declared that most of the rise in temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to man-made greenhouse gases. \n \n The small print explains \"very likely\" as meaning that the experts who made the judgment felt 90% sure about it. Older readers may recall a press conference at Harwell in 1958 when Sir John Cockcroft, Britain's top nuclear physicist, said he was 90% certain that his lads had achieved controlled nuclear fusion. It turned out that he was wrong. More positively, a 10% uncertainty in any theory is a wide open breach for any latterday Galileo or Einstein to storm through with a better idea. That is how science really works. \n \n Twenty years ago, climate research became politicised in favour of one particular hypothesis, which redefined the subject as the study of the effect of greenhouse gases. As a result, the rebellious spirits essential for innovative and trustworthy science are greeted with impediments to their research careers. And while the media usually find mavericks at least entertaining, in this case they often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man-made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies. As a result, some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported. \n \n Enthusiasm for the global-warming scare also ensures that heatwaves make headlines, while contrary symptoms, such as this winter's billion-dollar loss of Californian crops to unusual frost, are relegated to the business pages. The early arrival of migrant birds in spring provides colourful evidence for a recent warming of the northern lands. But did anyone tell you that in east Antarctica the Ad\u00e9lie penguins and Cape petrels are turning up at their spring nesting sites around nine days later than they did 50 years ago? While sea-ice has diminished in the Arctic since 1978, it has grown by 8% in the Southern Ocean. \n \n Background\n 'Blame cosmic rays for warming up the planet' \n No excuse for soft climate change laws \n Jeremy Clarkson: Cornered by the green lynch mob \n Related Internet Links\n New Scientist on Climate Change\n So one awkward question you can ask, when you're forking out those extra taxes for climate change, is \"Why is east Antarctica getting colder?\" It makes no sense at all if carbon dioxide is driving global warming. While you're at it, you might inquire whether Gordon Brown will give you a refund if it's confirmed that global warming has stopped. The best measurements of global air temperatures come from American weather satellites, and they show wobbles but no overall change since 1999. \n \n That levelling off is just what is expected by the chief rival hypothesis, which says that the sun drives climate changes more emphatically than greenhouse gases do. After becoming much more active during the 20th century, the sun now stands at a high but roughly level state of activity. Solar physicists warn of possible global cooling, should the sun revert to the lazier mood it was in during the Little Ice Age 300 years ago. \n \n Climate history and related archeology give solid support to the solar hypothesis. The 20th-century episode, or Modern Warming, was just the latest in a long string of similar events produced by a hyperactive sun, of which the last was the Medieval Warming. \n \n The Chinese population doubled then, while in Europe the Vikings and cathedral-builders prospered. Fascinating relics of earlier episodes come from the Swiss Alps, with the rediscovery in 2003 of a long-forgotten pass used intermittently whenever the world was warm. \n \n What does the Intergovernmental Panel do with such emphatic evidence for an alternation of warm and cold periods, linked to solar activity and going on long before human industry was a possible factor? Less than nothing. The 2007 Summary for Policymakers boasts of cutting in half a very small contribution by the sun to climate change conceded in a 2001 report. \n \n Disdain for the sun goes with a failure by the self-appointed greenhouse experts to keep up with inconvenient discoveries about how the solar variations control the climate. The sun's brightness may change too little to account for the big swings in the climate. But more than 10 years have passed since Henrik Svensmark in Copenhagen first pointed out a much more powerful mechanism. \n \n He saw from compilations of weather satellite data that cloudiness varies according to how many atomic particles are coming in from exploded stars. More cosmic rays, more clouds. The sun's magnetic field bats away many of the cosmic rays, and its intensification during the 20th century meant fewer cosmic rays, fewer clouds, and a warmer world. On the other hand the Little Ice Age was chilly because the lazy sun let in more cosmic rays, leaving the world cloudier and gloomier. \n \n The only trouble with Svensmark's idea - apart from its being politically incorrect - was that meteorologists denied that cosmic rays could be involved in cloud formation. After long delays in scraping together the funds for an experiment, Svensmark and his small team at the Danish National Space Center hit the jackpot in the summer of 2005. \n \n In a box of air in the basement, they were able to show that electrons set free by cosmic rays coming through the ceiling stitched together droplets of sulphuric acid and water. These are the building blocks for cloud condensation. But journal after journal declined to publish their report; the discovery finally appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Society late last year. \n \n Thanks to having written The Manic Sun, a book about Svensmark's initial discovery published in 1997, I have been privileged to be on the inside track for reporting his struggles and successes since then. The outcome is a second book, The Chilling Stars, co-authored by the two of us and published next week by Icon books. We are not exaggerating, we believe, when we subtitle it \"A new theory of climate change\". \n \n Where does all that leave the impact of greenhouse gases? Their effects are likely to be a good deal less than advertised, but nobody can really say until the implications of the new theory of climate change are more fully worked out. \n \n The reappraisal starts with Antarctica, where those contradictory temperature trends are directly predicted by Svensmark's scenario, because the snow there is whiter than the cloud-tops. Meanwhile humility in face of Nature's marvels seems more appropriate than arrogant assertions that we can forecast and even control a climate ruled by the sun and the stars. \n \n The Chilling Stars is published by Icon. It is available for \u00a39.89 including postage from The Sunday Times Books First on 0870 165 8585\n \n \n www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1363818.ece",

And not even Sir Jonathon Porrit can control natural climate change due to variations in solar activity. \n \n It would be intolerable if economic (\"green taxes\") and social measures that are supposed to transform western consumers into saviours of the planet, had knock-on effects which increase global poverty. \n \n What ultimate vision of society do the environmental zealots have in mind? Will they be satisfied with a global agrarian economy and transport by sail and horse? The central management of resources and control of human behaviour which are already being advocated, suggest that a command economy and severe restrictions on individual freedom would characterize the \"green utopia\".\n \n James.\n\n \n I'm not sure the zealots have thought things through to the extent you envisioned.

   "I thought this was worth repeating.\n \n \nTwenty years ago, climate research became politicised in favour of one particular hypothesis, which redefined the subject as the study of the effect of greenhouse gases. As a result, the rebellious spirits essential for innovative and trustworthy science are greeted with impediments to their research careers. And while the media usually find mavericks at least entertaining, in this case they often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man-made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies. As a result, some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported. \n \n Enthusiasm for the global-warming scare also ensures that heatwaves make headlines, while contrary symptoms, such as this winter's billion-dollar loss of Californian crops to unusual frost, are relegated to the business pages. The early arrival of migrant birds in spring provides colourful evidence for a recent warming of the northern lands. But did anyone tell you that in east Antarctica the Ad\u00e9lie penguins and Cape petrels are turning up at their spring nesting sites around nine days later than they did 50 years ago? While sea-ice has diminished in the Arctic since 1978, it has grown by 8% in the Southern Ocean. \n",
