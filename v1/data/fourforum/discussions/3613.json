   "All 11 states with ballot initiatives to offer the ban on same-sex marriage passed mightily. Some of these states (I know LA was one) even banned civil unions. \n \n The closest measure was in OR, where 57% of voters voted to ban same-sex marriage, and only 43% voted not to ban it. The highest margin was in MS, where 86% of voters voted to ban it, and only 14% voted not to ban it. \n \n I was so happy this morning. Bush won, Republicans won more seats in the House, more in the Senate, Daschle is gone, and every state with the ban same-sex marriage initiative passed it, some even banning civil unions.",
