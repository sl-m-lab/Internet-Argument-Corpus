If selection of some sort drives a change in gene frequency in a consistent direction from one generation to the next, I suppose it would indicate that adaptation to the environment was driving the change. But the main point about natural selection, as opposed to non-adaptive change, is that it is driven by how well the phenotype is adapted to environmental conditions. Without that understanding the anti-Darwin folks can bring up the old saw about natural selection being a tautology. So it must be emphasized that this change in gene frequencies is driven by adaptation to the environment, and not the other way around.",

   "First of all, if malaria was caused by a random mutation, \n\n \n Malaria is not caused by a random mutaion its caused by malarial parasites:\n \n \n Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Four species of Plasmodium can produce the disease in its various forms:\n \n * Plasmodium falciparum\n * Plasmodium vivax\n * Plasmodium ovale\n * Plasmodium malaria \n \n P. falciparum is the most widespread and dangerous of the four: untreated it can lead to fatal cerebral malaria.\n\n \n \nwhy aren't thousands of people here in the U.S. walking around with sickle-cell who have not had prior contanct with malaria or inherited the disease? \n\n \n Many are! Many people in the US have either sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease and they have never had or contacted malarial parasites. Indeed a quick search indicates that about 1 in 1000 people in the US have sickle cell trait or sickle cell anemia. Over 200,000 people. Most of them have never had malaria as a disease.\n \n Now to part two - inherited they have all inherited the gene. Having the gene is not contingent on having had malaria. The rate of spontaneous mutation to the sickle cell trait is likely too low to detect against the existing background. Oh yes MOST people do not inherit the disease since that requires that two individuals carrying the trait have chidren and that the affected children inherit two copies of the relevant gene. At a 1:1000 incidence and assuming random mating, the likelyhood of a randomly chosen couple having a sickle cell anemic child is theoretically about 1 in 4,000,0000.\n \n The thing to bear in mind is that the trait confers a degree of resitstnce to malaria for heterozygotes. Their RBCs contain both the \"defective\" hemoglobin AND normal hemoglobin. The RBCs function normally. However the malaria parasite preferentially consumes normal hemoglobin. When infected the RBCs in trait carriers will \"sickle\" and this results in the infected individals body destroying those cells which are infected in a selective way. Not a bad mechanism for a parasite which otherwise can hide from our immune system. Unfortunately it comes at a cost for heterozygotes!\n \n \n \nWhy does the malaria mutation have this weird way of happening only in areas where malaria strikes? Weird.\n\n \n The short answer is that it does not. When it occurrs its conserved and then fixed into the population because it carries a significant survival advantage when malaria is commonly present in the environment. Where there is no malaria it occurs but it is either neutral with regard to selection or is else negative (because of the sickle cell anemia). Its all very nicely NDS although I am certain you will be genetically unable to see the relationships and mechanisms involved.",

If so we would have good vaccines to control malaria and so far as I know we do not! There are efforts being made along those lines, but success is not upon us yet.\n \n You might like to see the article and linked video at:\n http://www.livescience.com/health/060808_sneaky_parasite.html\n \n Now lets consider the immune system. Perhaps you understand the clonal selection theory? Perhaps you don't? Suffice it to say that it amounts to a selective expansion of clones of B-cells which carry the specific antibody sequences directed at environmental antigens to which the individual has been exposed. Its a form of evolution in itself. You might wish to study it in some detail. Suffice it to say its selection NOT purposeful.\n \n \n \n It's like bacteria: stick it in an environment of antibiotics and it immediately starts adapting, passing genes back and forth, recombining and mutating. But a bacteria who's just left in alone in a petri dish does nothing.\n\n \n Nope \"it\" Is NOT like bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Although drug resistance in Malarial parasites doe represent an example of adaptation via the usual NDS mechanisms.",

Many people in the US have either sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease and they have never had or contacted malarial parasites.

Most of them have never had malaria as a disease.\n \n would you please point me to someone who came down with sickle cell who did not inherit it and/or was not subjected to malaria?",

Let me quote myself in the post which you clearly avoided comprehending!\n \n \n Quote:\n \nWhy does the malaria mutation have this weird way of happening only in areas where malaria strikes? Weird.\n \n\n \n \nThe short answer is that it does not. When it occurrs its conserved and then fixed into the population because it carries a significant survival advantage when malaria is commonly present in the environment. Where there is no malaria it occurs but it is either neutral with regard to selection or is else negative (because of the sickle cell anemia). Its all very nicely NDS although I am certain you will be genetically unable to see the relationships and mechanisms involved.\n\n \n Perhaps in 1 in a million cases you might find a spontaneous mutation to sickle cell trait. On the other hand in cases like this you would have to retest carefully since the number of false negatives is significant under that statistical regime. In additoon there is no medical motivation to do so since the treatment to be used would be unchanged given this knowledge. Again if you want to go looking for the spontaneous mutations you can. But its gonna cost ya and its going to take a lot of work. Perhaps someone has found such a case, if so it may or may not be in the medical literature as a curiosity. Enjoy your scholarly search.",

   "I\n'll take that as an inability to do so.\n\n \n Correct I do not have the resources to do the research (I am after all a disabled and retired chemist not the director of NIH). But you can look into the literature if you wish. Somebody might have found and documented such a case. At least the spontaneous mutation is theoretically possible.\n \n To see why consider what the genetic change is as detailed at\n \n http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/posters/chromosome/hbb.shtml\n \n Its a point mutation near the beginning of the hemoglobin molecule. Postition 6 to be precise. The normal triplet is GAG (coding for glutamic acid which has a carboxyl and thus is very polar) to GTG which codes for valine (which is a much more hydorphobic residue than is glutamic acid). The article linked details HOW this alteration results in abnormal HBB interactions and produces the resultant disease. \n \n If you bothered to look it up you would find that the average copy error rate for single bases is from 1 per million to 1 per billion in eukaryotes and humans have lower rates than many others. So to find this person you are asking for one might have to screen between 1 million and 1 billion subjects (and their parents) with something like a 50% chance of finding one. At a 1:1000 incidence in the US for sickle cell trait that means you need populations of at least a billion and perhaps as many as a trillion. Not likely to actually observe such a miutaion in a practical sense are we?",
