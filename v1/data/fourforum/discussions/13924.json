   "They really had to do a study to tell them this?!?! emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nI eat all the time and eat alot yet I am skinny.\n\n \n lol I was the same way until I hit my 30s. Everyone told me \"wait til you hit 30\" and I blew them off. I'd always been skinny and underweight, could eat anything I wanted to without gaining a pound. Not so much now! lol I would beat that's how overeating set the stage. I can see now how easily it is to be use to eating a certain way your whole life and then your body changes, you have kids, etc and it catches up with you. If you aren't use to exercising it's really hard to just up and start to when you notice your body has changed and your metabolism isn't what is use to be.",
