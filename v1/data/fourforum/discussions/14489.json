Darwin's theory is very similar. evolutionary theory doesnt progress unless changes and additions are made.\n \n also, if you are so convinced that Darwin's theory and the modern synthesis are not the same, you must be convinced enough to be able to outline the differences.",

   "No. I was never wrong in my post. A comparison of Charles Darwin's research and that which is taught today has almost nothing the same. You can blame it on lack of scientific tools or you could say that todays scientists are more sophisticated. It was not an insult, it was an irony.\n\n \n Are you serious? The concept of evolution from natural selective pressures is as brilliant a concept today as it was back then.\n \n \n\n Distraction? No. I merely pointed out not that you are a child, but that you are pitiable. You just come on to this forum and become an interjector. It is a sad position to be in and you have my sympathies.\n\n \n What does you thinking I am an interjector have to do with the validity of my argument.\n \n I postulate that this is a standard creationist debating distraction. You have no facts or evidence, you have picked a conclusion from the outset (a god did it) and now that the evidence doesn't fit your pre-concieved ideas, you attack me and try to put me down rather than explaining to my why I am incorrect in concluding that you haven't the slightest idea about how evolution works.\n \n The advantage of coming in so recently is that I have been able to read what you have posted on these forums in the past, so I already know that your arguments are tired and baseless.\n \n You however, have no data on me, but I'm sure that's not going to matter as you will have already made you mind up about me without a scrap of evidence. This is the advantage you have of taking a faith-based approach to matters that require science and reason.",
