I don't know of anyone that rode on them, but pterodatyls have existed, at least up into the Civil War - we have photographic evidence of this: http://www.omniology.com/LivingPterodactyls.html\n\n \n Good God MAN! Is gullibility hereditary among you people, or is it just linked to evangelical YECism?\n \n Archangel made the SAME EXACT CLAIM way back in April, and when he got refuted, he refused to even address what he had done.\n \n My post to you is the same as it was to him: \n I've dealt with this claim on other forums, so I already had some links, but if you look up \"pterodactyls in civil war\" on Ask, these are the first and third links, and there are many many more. Maybe you should do some research before submitting something that is a proven hoax.\n http://www.lorencoleman.com/museum.html\n \n From that link:\n \nThe \"Mystery Civil War Pterodactyl\"\n \n An internet rumor began in the late 1990s that this photograph was found squeezed between the pages of a 1970s paranormal book purchased at a thrift store. For years, Forteans had searched for the exclusive \"Thunderbird\" photograph seen and remembered by zoologist Ivan T. Sanderson during the 1960s. Then, this newly discovered picture raised the question of its relationship to the Sanderson \"lost Thunderbird photo.\" But something seemed wrong. The Sanderson stories told of a Thunderbird tacked to the side of a barn in Tombstone, Arizona, or some other location in the Old West. The photograph shown here, however, appeared to have captured a group of Civil War soldiers, circa 1860s, with the remains of a pterodactyl. Was this the long lost photograph, remembered by so many, but never found after decades of looking for it?\n \n As it turned out this photograph was a promotional tool of Orlando, Florida's Haxan Production (producers of \"The Blair Witch Project\"), to develop interest in their forthcoming fictional program, \"Freaky Links.\" The series, first broadcast on Fox TV, finally in 2000, involved the character \"Derek Barnes,\" an investigator of the unknown.\n \n The picture was a hoax and the pterodactyl was a prop created exclusively for two episodes of Freaky Links. Fox is done with the prop, however, and this intriguing pseudo-cryptid was acquired by Loren Coleman, and is now part of the collection of the Museum--that is all 22 feet by 11 feet of it.\n \n Photograph used with permission of Gregg Hale, Executive Director, Haxan Productions. Credit, Fox TV. \n\n \n From another site: Civil War Pterodactyl\n \nFortean Times ran a very skeptical article about this photo in its May 2000 issue, concluding with these words: \"We believe he's a hoaxer but a clever and well-informed one as the site is full of excellent fortean jokes--e.g., the rather disgusting photo of a toilet bowl thoughtfully snapped after some unfortunate had just vomited frogs.\"\n \n Further doubts soon emerged after the magazine's article was published. Various readers wrote to pinpoint several details in the photo that led to the conclusion that the photo was a fake. First of all, the men pictured were obviously reenactors, \"given the undue proportion of over-age and overweight members in their ranks--the average Civil War soldier was a scrawny youth of nineteen.\" Such groups of re-enactors are quite common in the States and, among them \"there is a much higher proportion of older and fatter members than in the original armies.\" The clean and neat uniforms \"also mark them out as re-enactors rather than the real thing.\" Their poses, also, are \"too naturalistic for an 1860s photograph\"; if you've ever looked at photos from that period \"you can see there are a dozen subtle differences in the way they stood, the way they held their heads, the looks on their faces, and what they did with their arms and hands while they were being photographed.\"\n \n Finally, all doubts were confirmed when it was discovered that the site was connected to the creators of The Blair Witch Project. FreakyLinks was in fact the title of an upcoming TV series, and the site was designed to promote interest in it. The show star was actor Ethan Embry and his character was named \"Derek Barnes, Editor of an Internet Web site that investigates the paranormal.\" As expected, the experts quoted in the site were imaginary, just as the pterodactyl that was only a stage prop courtesy of Fox. \n \n\n \n Bolding and underlining in both quotes are mine.\n \n There are numerous more, you were duped, man.  \n \n Say hello to the Raelians for me.",

In fact, most grade schoolers when they go through their \"dinosaur phase\" learn this stuff.\n \n Opposite of erosion = sedimentation.\n \n There is no \"average\" or predicted depth of burial over 400 million years. It's a function of the rock cycle - erosion, sedimentation, lithification, strucutural movement of the earth's crust, etc... 400 million years is a LONG time.\n \n Google \"geology 101\" or \"the rock cycle\" to get the basics.\n \n Fossilization is a function of preservation, burial depth (pressure) and cementation/mineralization that is due to the movement of fluids through the rock.

Really.\n\n I don't know why your stumpted - the choice should very obviously be the Word of God rather than the words of atheist evo men.\n \n \n \n \n\n Seriously, is this how you expect people to think? That is everything you need to make a conclusion? It sure as f**k is not everything I need to make a conclusion, but maybe I'm just fussy. \n \n\n Maybe you should drop the evo bias - it makes it mucheasier to make the correct conclusion.\n \n \n\n You got all that from the carving? That's awesome.\n\n \n No, I got it from both the carving and from God's True Perfect and Holy Word.",

   "I don't know why your stumpted - the choice should very obviously be the Word of God rather than the words of atheist evo men.\n\n \n So you believe that God deliberately decieved man by creating everything to appear much older than it really is? That's the only logical position you can hold, given that absolutely all the physical evidence (not just words, EDO, but physical evidence) shows a very old earth. \n \n \nMaybe you should drop the evo bias - it makes it mucheasier to make the correct conclusion.\n\n \n If I do have a 'bias' towards evo, that bias has been generated by a theory that is completely self-consistent, highly consilient with other sciences, and thoroughly supported by mountains of physical evidence. Would you like me to run through the major evidences that support evolution?\n \n EDIT: And are you now willing to admit that you were fooled by a hoaxed photo of a pterodactyl that 5 minutes' research on your part would have revealed to be phony? It's this kind of sloppy thinking, among other things, that results in creationists getting no respect from the scientific community.",
