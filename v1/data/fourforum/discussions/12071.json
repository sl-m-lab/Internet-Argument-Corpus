   "Clarence Page\n December 7, 2008\n \n \"Gay is the new black,\" declares the Dec. 16 issue of The Advocate, a leading gay-oriented magazine. Well, not quite. How about, \"Gay is the new gray?\"\n \n The gray area for a lot of black Americans like me is not in the issue of gay rights but in the comparison some gay activists make between that issue and the movement for racial equality.\n \n I don't oppose same-sex marriage. After years of arguments from the other side about perceived threats to the sanctity of marriage, I have yet to see any impact by gay marriages on my marriage. Nor do I expect to see any.\n \n Besides, single parenting has become so pervasive in the past half-century, especially in black America, that I am delighted whenever anyone still wants to get married. But gay rights leaders should think twice before drawing too many comparisons to the fight for racial equality. They are tragically correct to point out the murder, beatings, arson and other hate crimes that continue to be perpetrated against homosexuals. But the history and nature of our oppression is so different as to serve to alienate potential allies instead of winning them over.\n \n I have long thought that gay activists should congratulate themselves that gay rights has made so much progress in less time than the civil rights movement's decades-long march to the election of a black man to the White House.\n \n That progress, unfortunately, was set back with whiplash force in the double message California voters delivered on that same Election Day. While America elected Barack Obama to be its first president of African descent, Californians voted for Proposition 8, a measure to overturn gay marriage.\n \n The crosswinds of Obama's win and gay people's losses inflicted what Advocate writer Michael Joseph Gross called \"mass whiplash\" on those who mistakenly thought a win for one would mean a win for the other. \"We were elated,\" he wrote, \"then furious.\"\n \n The fury found an unexpected target as exit polls showed 70 percent of gays voted for Obama but 70 percent of blacks voted for Proposition 8. This led some commentators to blame black voters for the loss of gay marriage. That's a bum rap, as Gross points out, because black voters account for only 10 percent of California's turnout.\n \n In fact, the vote was so close&#8212;52.3 percent to 47.7 percent&#8212;that you could credit or blame, depending on your point of view, any group of voters for the outcome. The measure carried Hispanics and other demographic groups too. It also was supported by the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church, which contributed millions to support the measure.\n \n So why single out blacks? A lot of people, it turns out, made the mistake of presuming that most of the state's black voters would see comparisons to the racial equality movement that, it turned out, most black voters did not see.\n \n I sympathize with the sense of hurt and betrayal that many Proposition 8 opponents feel in regard to the black vote. How, many ask, could a people who have known so much bigotry and persecution turn around and inflict it on another group?\n \n But, as many black homosexuals know, the answer is pretty much the same as for most other demographic groups. Black voters tend to vote liberal, but we also have a strong strain of social conservatism closely tied to a strong tradition of church membership. Too often we forget the centuries in which the Bible was cited to justify the dehumanization of black people too.\n \n If anything the gay rights movement can take some valuable lessons from Obama's success. It was not that long ago, after all, that he was losing 2-1 in the polls to Sen. Hillary Clinton among black voters before he won the Iowa caucuses.\n \n Gay rights similarly was such a despised notion as to be a largely underground movement until the late 1960s. But by 2000, Vermont became the first state to create civil unions to provide legal rights, responsibilities and protections of marriage to gay and lesbian couples in almost every legal sense&#8212;except for the M-word.\n \n Four years later, even President George W. Bush outraged some conservative groups by supporting civil unions, \"if that's what a state chooses to do.\"\n \n Obama turned his popularity around through persistent campaigning and excellent organizing to increase the public's comfort level with him. In the end, he turned a vote for Obama into something in which many voters took pride, just for being on the right side of history.\n \n The gay rights movement has a long way to go to reach that point, but it is better that gays win their victories from the bottom up, supported by the voters, than to have them imposed by the courts.\n \n http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-oped1207pagedec07,0,7826587.column",

   "Let's do the math.\n Admittedly, it will be gross simplifications on the issues involved, but it will show some of the reasonings behind the \"blame blacks\" on a purely mathematical point.\n \n Blacks were 10% of the voter turnout, with a stated 70% against gay marriage. That puts \"blacks against gay marriage\" as 7% of the total gay marriage vote.\n With the same 10%, let's now put them at 50% against gay marriage. A loss of 2% (7-5) for the total \"against gay marriage\" vote and gained by the \"for gay marriage vote\".\n Puts the whole \"gay marriage\" thing at about a tie.\n \n Now, let's give blacks the same support FOR gay marriage as gays gave for Obama. That would leave \"blacks against gay marriage\" at 3%. A change of 4% which would change the results we saw and essentially flip the results. Gay marriage would have won out by roughly the margin it lost by.\n \n By the same token, if you changed other groups (like Republicans who were much more than 10% of the voter turnout) by the same 40% (blacks originally 70% changed to 40%), you would get an EVEN LARGER margin win for gay marriage.\n So, by that logic it would make more sense to blame Republicans than blacks...\n \n \n \nThe gay rights movement has a long way to go to reach that point, but it is better that gays win their victories from the bottom up, supported by the voters, than to have them imposed by the courts.\n\n For SOME victories. Yes.\n ENDA will be decided in the legislature.\n Gays in the military is being pushed through the legislature.\n Civil unions? Legislature.\n Sexual orientation employment discrimination? Legislature.\n \n Other forms of discrimination? They will be solved the same way they have been historically solved.\n If people were to pass a law prohibiting blacks from adopting white babies, does anybody think that the \"voters\" (who passed the discriminatory measure in the first place) should be persuaded to stop discriminating?\n No.\n The courts are there to protect equality and prevent laws without any legitimate state interest from being enforced.\n And as such, it is the courts that should strike down any anti-gay adoption legislation.\n \n Gay marriage discrimination?\n Can ANYBODY name me ANY state which solved it's miscegenation law situation by passing MORE legislation, and NOT by the courts?\n Ahh yes. Crickets chirping?\n \n Some issues should be rightfully decided by legislation.\n Others? They have their proper recourse in the courts.\n That's a fact that some people like to frown upon, but their criticism can be most accurately summarized as simple distaste. It's not an issue of abusing a legitimate recourse of correction, but rather they wish we would do it another way that they prefer...",

   "It's always an uphill battle when a civil rights struggle has to battle against the major churches, rather than having them on on its side, or even leading it. With the notorious exception of some white Protestant churches -- now under the umbrella of the Southern Baptist Convention -- most major churches initially or eventually came to support black civil rights. That was a huge boost and support.\n \n In contrast, the gay equal rights movement has encountered mostly hostility, often malevolent demonisation, from mainstream Christian churches. It has historically lacked the central leadership and purpose of the black civil rights movement. Nevertheless, despite these handicaps, despite the malevolence of churches such as Southern Baptist Convention, the Mormons, and the RC hierarchy, the rightness of gay equality is an idea that IS spreading among the population as a whole. Hearts and minds are being won over, mostly by the growing visibility of individual gay gay people who have been encouraged by court and legislative victories to come out and not stay in the closet. People who know gay friends and relatives are much less likely to be prejudiced against them.\n \n There will always be a hardcore of reactionary Christians whose prejudice against gay people will never allow them to admit equality, not even for their own kith and kin. However, it is dwindling in size. I suspect we will see the victory of the Dark Side in California as something of a last gasp, the highest reach of an ebbing tide. The future belongs to equality.",

   "And I have to point out generally that although it is fair to say that the case for equal rights for gay Americans has to be made with the grassroots to stick and be effective, court cases are still part of the arsenal of activism. They are not, of course, the only weapon in the arsenal.\n \n Court cases, even when they are lost, play a spotlight on injustice. They encourage gay people to come out, and I have always argued that being openly gay is the best contribution any individual gay person can make to equal rights.\n \n The mean-spirited referenda in California and other states will eventually be seen for what they are: milestones in the retreat of religious anti-gay activism. I believe that's the way they will fall out because what they do most effectively is not, of course, protect marriage, but highlight the injustice perpetrated by those states against their gay citizens. They will be a rallying cry, a focus. This is not a religious tide. It's a belch. The overall trend in the US is against those who seek to enshrine bigotry in law.",

Not an opinion, not a theory, but physical proof of a cause other than choice. I would be very interested in reading this information. As for my particular choice: I make it every day, all the time. Same as I choose to stay married, same as I choose to not get a tattoo, same as I make a zillion other choices every day about my lifestyle. And yes, I could choose to lead a gay lifestyle, but I don't.\n \n \nActually, the constitution (under the 14th amendment) requires a \"legitimate state interest\" before any discrimination against a right can take place.\n As such, the constitution puts the burden of proof on the GOVERNMENT to show why they should discriminate in the first place.\n\n \n Maybe you should reread the 14th, because nowhere in it does the phrase \"legitimate state interest\" appear.\n \n \nNo.\n Gay marriage is about discrimination based on gender. A man can marry \"Chris\" based on what \"Chris's\" gender is.\n That's gender discrimination.\n\n \n Good one, this is an arguement I haven't heard before. However I would counter that it isn't gender discrimination because the rules apply equally to both genders. A man cannot enter into a same sex marriage but neither can a woman. I would also point out that the constitution does not protect the \"right to get married\" same sex or otherwise, which is why this fight is being brought at a state level for the most part.\n \n \n\"Polygamy\" is discrimination based on the number of people who can enter a contract. Entirely different issue.\n\n Not true, multi-party contracts are nothing new, in fact they are quite common. Ever seen a loan with a co-signer or a been involved in a joint venture? Bans on polygamy are religious descrimination based on societies morals.\n \n Merry Christmas",

   "I think that the title of this thread sums up the argument. One purpose of civil rights is to ensure that a person is not discriminated against due to something beyond their control i.e. being black, or short, or a woman, etc. It can be proven beyond a doubt that a black person has no choice in the matter, skin color is a biological thing not a choice thing. The same cannot be proven about homosexuality, science cannot point to a gene or hormone or other physical cause. On the other hand science cannot difinitively say it is a choice either. That being said I ask this: Isn't it up to the people trying to change the status quo to prove that the status quo is wrong? And untill it is proven wrong wouldn't it be a decision for the voters as opposed to the courts?\n \n Another question: Are all of the people here opposed to gay marriage bans equally opposed to polygamy bans?\n \n Merry Christmas\n Lurch\n\n \n The choice argument is easily disposed of. I am not sure why some people still think that while skin colour is in large part (tanning aside) genetic, because its inheritance follows fairly simple and readily observable patterns, that therefore something as basic to human survival as the sex instinct is a \"chosen\" trait. I'd find this sort of thinking baffling, were it not for the explanation that those people who love to condemn homosexuality find it easier to live with themselves if they imagine it's a voluntary trait.\n \n Ask anyone whether they have any choice in the gender or sorts of people they find themselves sexually attracted to. Ask yourself. Ask if you could choose to be sexually attracted to just anyone.\n \n So let's not pretend that there is still some scientific jury \"out\" there on the question. The preponderance of scientific evidence (and it isn't insignificant), common sense, and our own personal experiences, lead to the highly probable conclusion that sexual orientation and desire is a programmed feature, with strong genetic contributions during development. It is not merely an outer behaviour to be assumed or discarded at a whim, but an integral part of everyone's psyche. as basic to them as their sexual gender. You will not find many genuine biologists who think it's a choice.\n \n As for the burden of proof being on those who want to change a homophobic status quo, I think that burden was shouldered long ago, starting towards the end of the 19th century. Yes, we can and have shown the injustice of anti-gay legislation. We have shown it in courts, in classrooms, in the commons, in legislatures and yes, even in some churches though not yet most. Churches are highly resistant to change, even for the better.\n \n What about the burden of proof on those who desire to maintain an injustice? Have they none? Do they not have to justify their prejudice against gay people? I think that even they think they do, else they wouldn't spend so much of their time thumping their bibles. Surely all the dust must have been shaken out of them by now.",

   "It is not inaccurate just incomplete, thats why I said \"One purpose of civil rights..\" and not \"The only purpose...\"\n As for the freedom of religion: It is specificly spelled out in the bill of rights, freedom to marry the partner of your choice is not. Hence the reason a constitutional ammendment would be needed to give gay marriages protection at a national level.\n\n The problem with that is the 14th amendment came after the first amendment.\n The 14th amendment spells out more explicit and comprehensive coverage. It establishes the requirement for a legitimate state interest in the cases of governmental discrimination.\n \n And getting back to your original claim, \"civil rights\" is in NO way restricted to inherent attributes or non-choices. That is a modern attempt at redefining what \"civil rights\" means for the obvious attempt at discrediting gay civil rights.The rights belonging to an individual by virtue of citizenship, especially the fundamental freedoms and privileges guaranteed by the 13th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and by subsequent acts of Congress, including civil liberties, due process, equal protection of the laws, and freedom from discrimination.civil rights: Definition from Answers.com\n \n We get civil rights by being a citizen.\n Not by being born with some attribute.\n \n \n \nPlease provide a link to the proof that homosexuality is not a choice.\n\n Please provide your link to proof that any credible scientist thinks it is rational to believe it is a choice.\n Your claim is inherently flawed.\n We all understand that being straight is NOT a choice.\n Yet for some nonsensical and unnamed presumption, there is a false belief that homosexuality is a \"choice\".\n \nIs Sexual Orientation a Choice? \n No, human beings cannot choose to be either gay or straight. For most people, sexual orientation emerges in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed. \n\n \n APA Help Center - Health & Emotional Wellness - \"Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality\"\n \n \n \nAs for my particular choice: I make it every day, all the time. Same as I choose to stay married, same as I choose to not get a tattoo, same as I make a zillion other choices every day about my lifestyle. And yes, I could choose to lead a gay lifestyle, but I don't.\n\n One aspect of the \"choice\" debate that some anti-gay people try to boil the situation down to is claiming \"choice\" based solely on \"actions\".\n Failing to recognize that sexual ORIENTATION is about ATTRACTION. Not just actions.\n \n You are attracted to women, correct?\n The point of the challenge is that could you be SEXUALLY attracted to MEN, if you \"chose\" to.\n Most straight people will admit that the answer is no, with the exclusion of a select few who actively attempt to make absurd claims like sexual orientation is a \"choice\"...\n \n \n \nMaybe you should reread the 14th, because nowhere in it does the phrase \"legitimate state interest\" appear.\n\n And nowhere in the first amendment does the phrase \"freedom of religion\" appear...\n Does that mean we don't have any?\n \n \"Legitimate state interest\" is a phrase used to summarize the court's APPLICATION of the 14th amendment, much like \"freedom of religion\" is a phrase used to summarize the court's APPLICATION of the 1st amendment.\n \n \n \nGood one, this is an arguement I haven't heard before. However I would counter that it isn't gender discrimination because the rules apply equally to both genders. A man cannot enter into a same sex marriage but neither can a woman.\n\n Think about it.\n We previously had laws that applied to interracial marriage, and the courts and public acknowledged that was discrimination based on RACE.\n By your argument (which was also rejected by SCOTUS), since a black could not marry a white and a white could not marry a black, that would apply \"equally to blacks and whites\".\n That argument was rejected because \"equal\" does not mean \"I can think of one isolated scenario where something similar can be said to occur\"\n \"Equal\" means that EVERYTHING a man can do, a woman is allowed to do.\n \n A man can marry a woman.\n A woman is forbidden from marrying a woman.\n That's gender discrimination.\n Your excuses on the issue do not mitigate the discrimination existing.\n \n THINK about the absurdity of your argument.\n By your thinking, we could enact legislation outlawing yarmulke's and other Jewish symbology. Christian symbology would still be allowed.\n By your line of thinking, we could say that there was NO discrimination, because both the Jew and the Christian were equally prevented from wearing Star of David jewelry. Both the Jew and the Christian could EQUALLY wear Christian jewelry.\n That's nonsense!\n \n Whether the discrimination is justified is a separate issue, but the EXISTENCE of the discrimination should not be in dispute.\n \n \n \nI would also point out that the constitution does not protect the \"right to get married\" same sex or otherwise, which is why this fight is being brought at a state level for the most part.\n\n You are very wrong on this.\n In 1967, SCOTUS acknowledged that not only a \"right to get married\" exists, but WHO a person is eligible to marry is covered by constitutional protection.\n Loving v Virginia.\n \n \n \nNot true, multi-party contracts are nothing new, in fact they are quite common. Ever seen a loan with a co-signer or a been involved in a joint venture? Bans on polygamy are religious descrimination based on societies morals.\n\n By \"contract\" I was referring specifically to the marriage contract.\n And the point is that while the government does not utilize legislation in this area in as many ways as it could, it COULD if it wanted to.\n \n Furthermore, while some people's bans on polygamy are based on religious discrimination, there are other secular, legitimate state interests which prevent polygamy. Google \"lost boys Utah\" for one heinous consequence of polygamy. Also, there are over 1,000 rights and privileges that come with marriage.

In other words, I can't prove a court ruling didn't happen without posting all court cases that happened, at least, until 1843 which is the date the law was removed. Given the date is 1843 and I don't live in Massachusetts, I don't think it is fair to ask me to post every court case and their ruling.\n \n Massachusetts Advances Gay Marriage - Again - Coldwater, MI - The Daily Reporter\n \n This article references it saying \"Back in 1843, Massachusetts was the second state in the country to pass a law to permit interracial marriage.\"\n \n We know a few things from this. One, the 1843 date is solid. Two, that nothing happened beforehand. The third thing we kind of know is that a law was passed. You have stated that a quick reference is not evidence enough but you did admit earlier that a basically laws passed means a legislature passed it (if I misrepresent simply correct me).\n \n This next website is actually a letter written to the mass. state legislatures. While you may not agree with their point, I doubt their facts are wrong.\n http://www.mafamily.org/issues/docs/61_TESTIMONYREH1728JCommittee.pdf\n The relevant part is \"Massachusetts Legislature, which had repealed the Commonwealth's ban on interracial marriage in 1843\"\n \n Finally here is a news article referencing the 1843 law.\n FOXNews.com - Massachusetts Senate Votes to Repeal Law Barring Out-of-State Gay Couples From Marrying - Politics | Republican Party | Democratic Party | Political Spectrum\n \n As far as I can tell, I can't access laws passed in 1843 because, I guess, Massachusetts is not exactly up with the times on making electronic documents.\n \n Given all of that, I'd say it is clear Massachusetts passed a law to allow interracial marriage starting in 1843. \n \n It is probably not a bad assumption to say that all the states that do not reference a court case on that wikipedia article probably were legislativly passed.",

You cannot compare gay discrimination to say race discrimination untill you have done that.\n\n \n By this same illogic, you would argue that Catholics and Protestants couldn't possibly be discriminated against because their religion is a form of choice. Apparently you seem to be laboring under the bizarre delusion that if people can choose to be something else, then they have only themselves to blame if bigots hate them for being who they choose to be.\n \n Sorry, but even if you could choose to be gay, and no-one on this planet, don't know about yours, ever did, how would that excuse bigotry against them?",

   "Current interpretation of 14th Amendment doesn't depend on whether any identifiable trait is a choice. Only whether it is distinctive enough to be the source of discrimination due to bigotry. The 14th protects people on the basis of religion, as well, and surely you aren't going to claim that religion is genetically programmed?\n\n \n If all that mattered was an identifiable trait was distinctive the 14th could be used to protect any lifestyle choice imaginable. Dressing up for work in tin foil everyday would be a distinctive trait but that doesn't mean you can't be fired for it. Choice is and always has been a factor, not the only factor, in determining a protected status. Basic common sense says it has to be.\n \n \nSorry, but nothing in science can be \"proven\" as if it were a mathematical proposition like Fermat's Last Theorem. You cannot even \"prove\" the law of gravity that way. All you can ever do in science is construct probable theories about causes, and amass evidence for or against them. The evidence against sexual orientation being a choice is pretty massive, though you seem to be unaware of it.\n\n \n Where do I start: First, mathmatics is a science. Second, many scientific theories can and have been proven, especially in the area of biology. The evidence against sexual orientation being a choice is inconclusive, same as the evidence that sexual orientation is biological.\n \n \nCan it be easily argued? Can you easily argue it? Since you do not, despite the oportunity you gave yourself, we can assume you can't argue it easily. If you could, you would have.\n\n \n Yes I can easily argue it, but as I said it makes zero difference because a \"legitimate state interest\" is not addressed by the 14th ammendment, and is irrelevent to the this debate.\n \n \nWhat has polygamy got to do with it? And why are you so reluctant to believe congressional reports about the extent of federal laws granting rights to married couples? Got some bone to grind?\n\n \n I asked the polygamy question as a sort of litmus test, because I find it hypocritical to rally for same sex marriage yet rally against polygamy. No, I don't have a bone to grind and I don't deny that there are advantages to being married, but I find the 1000 number foundit66 gave a bit hard to swallow and his tying it into polygamy even harder to swallow.\n \n \nBy this same illogic, you would argue that Catholics and Protestants couldn't possibly be discriminated against because their religion is a form of choice. \n\n \n Of course they could be discriminated against, same as homosexuals. What I'm saying is that all forms of discrimination are not illegal, or for that matter wrong. For instance: Most busnesses wouldn't hire a receptionist that had tattoos on his/her face. Is that discrimination against people with tattoos on their faces? Yes. Is it wrong? No. Is it discrimination when fire departments only hire people who are in shape? Yes. Is it wrong? No.\n \n \nApparently you seem to be laboring under the bizarre delusion that if people can choose to be something else, then they have only themselves to blame if bigots hate them for being who they choose to be.\n\n \n To a certain degree, yes. If a person chooses a lifestyle, mannerism, etc. that is going to not sit well with other people then they need to accept that reality. People have the right to make their own choices, but the are delusional if they think everyone is going to agree with that choice.\n \n \nSorry, but even if you could choose to be gay, and no-one on this planet, don't know about yours, ever did, how would that excuse bigotry against them?\n\n \n Never said it excuses it, I just said it doesn't make it illegal or unconstitutional.\n \n Merry Christmas",

   "Nowhere in the 14th amendment does it talk about a \"legitimate state interest\" in the cases of governmental discrimination. The portions relevant to this discussion talks about due process and equal protection. These are made irrelevant to the discussion if you can't prove that homosexuality isn't a choice. Otherwise, the 14th could be to justify almost any choice on earth.\n\n emoticon_wow\n Gee.\n Nowhere in the 14th amendment do we see any requirement for \"not a choice\" either. \"Choice\" isn't a word in it, regarding \"due process\" or \"equal protection\".\n \n What I am talking about is how courts and lawyers ACTUALLY INTERPRET the 14th amendment. And NOWHERE in their statements on \"legitimate state interest\" do they specify ANY requirement that the issue involved not be a \"choice\".\n You might as well be peeing into the wind on this issue. Cause you may not like it, but I am telling you HOW it actually WORKS today.\n \n \n \nI never said it was, you keep arguing on a point we agree on.\n\n I'm sorry, but I AM arguing about something you have CLEARLY stated you disagree with when you said: \"One purpose of civil rights is to ensure that a person is not discriminated against due to something beyond their control i.e. being black, or short, or a woman, etc.\"\n I stated: \"\"civil rights\" is in NO way restricted to inherent attributes or non-choices.\"\n \n \n \nRead my posts, I've already clearly stated that homosexuality as a choice cannot be proven. You stated that homosexuality has been proven to not be a choice, all I've asked is that you back that statement with proof.\n\n I have already supplied you with the proof.\n It's common sense, if you would stop and think and answer HONESTLY.\n Heterosexuals DO NOT CHOOSE to be attracted to the opposite gender.\n Homosexuals DO NOT CHOOSE to be attracted to the same gender.\n We could take a poll on this message board and you'd find the honest answer from people, over and over again is that sexual orientation IS NOT a choice.\n \n You might as well ask me to prove that a rock is hard!\n \n The proof is all around you.\n Take reparative therapy for example. I have already pointed out that reparative therapy groups DO NOT try to pretend that being gay is a choice.\n The fact that reparative therapy groups EXIST is further evidence that it is not a choice.\n If being gay were a choice, if somebody didn't want to be gay, they could just \"choose\" to be straight and that's it.\n Doesn't work that way.\n \n \n \nWhich you have not done, your link to the APA give a lot of theories and conjecture but offers no scientific proof of a biological cause.\n\n Stop right there.\n I don't need to prove \"biological cause\" to prove you wrong.\n If I had four paper cups and one transparent glass cup, and said there is a ball under one of the cups, we wouldn't have to turn over all the paper cups to see that there IS NO BALL under the glass cup.\n \n One common \"logic\" problem I see with some Christians is they can't wrap their head around the fact that casting doubt on another idea DOES NOT make their idea somehow more credible.\n \n I can easily turn this around and ask you to show me ANY evidence (whatsoever) that homosexuality or heterosexuality is a choice.\n You can't, cause we've all acknowledged the world is round and that the earth rotates around the sun.\n You refusing to listen doesn't mean squat about me or sexual orientation.\n \n \n \nIf sexual orientation is based on attraction (not a very specific term) how do you explain changes in sexual orientation when heterosexual people are isolated in a single sex environment. If attractions can change due to outside influence then why not by choice?\n\n What \"changes in sexual orientation\" are you talking about?\n Let me guess. \"Prison\"?\n \n Look. Just cause a guy masturbates with his hand doesn't mean he is \"attracted\" to it. It doesn't mean he's \"hand-asexual\".\n Just cause somebody has sex with the same gender doesn't make them gay. The point is if they had their choice as to which gender to have sex with, would it be male or female.\n When you remove that choice from people in prison, the consequences of \"same gender sex\" are meaningless.\n \n \n \nThe answer to your challenge is yes, as I've already stated. I find it interesting that you ask a question but then dismiss the answer as absurd when you don't get the answer you want.\n\n That is actually the first time you answered my question.\n Earlier you tried to confuse the issue of sexual orientation by ONLY looking at action.\n \n If you are sexually attracted to both genders, that makes you a bisexual. Plain and simple.\n \n The thing I don't think you get out of this is how MOST PEOPLE ARE.\n If you ask straight people if they can \"choose\" to be attracted to the same gender, they will answer no.\n With reparative therapy, you have gays who WANT to be straight. They WOULD CHOOSE to be straight if they could, but they can't. Ergo, the \"therapy\".\n \n \n \nIt does not appear there and no we do not have \"freedom\" of religion. What we have is rule against government dictating a religion.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Look. I don't know if your brain is just wired this way or not, but for the \"rest\" of us we understand that \"freedom of religion\" is a phrase that accurately assesses how the first amendment affects people's religion.\n You're trying to quibble over the phrase, and your argument is meaningless.\n In the end, you're just arguing against something that everybody else already has come to grips with...\n \n \n \nFor instance I cannot claim to be an Aztec and demand the right to human sacrifice. The 1st ammendment is worded the way it is for a reason, so is the 14th.\n\n By that logic, we as Americans have NO rights.\n Cause there is NO right in America that is completely absolute.\n 1st amendment? Speech? Assembly? Religion?\n It has restrictions.\n 2nd amendment? Restrictions for felons.\n We could go down the list and it's all the same.\n \n Your comment is meaningless because freedom DOES HAVE LIMITS. Unbridled \"freedom\" would be akin to anarchy!\n \n \n \nGoogle \"Crusades\" for a heinous example of the consequences of Christianity. That doesn't give the state an interest in banning Christianity.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n So?\n It's like forest for the trees here.\n The \"interest\" would be in preventing MURDER.\n Christianity doesn't have to have \"crusades\". In fact, most Christians will tell you that modern Christianity abhors the idea of \"crusades\" as un-Christlike.\n \n \n \nIt can easily be argued that the state has a legitimate interest in banning gay marriage, but as I said it matters not. \n\n I've argued against people all over the place who try to pretend there are legitimate interests in banning gay marriage.\n The fact that you don't even try to argue, and cowardly duck the issue, is rather telling.\n \n \n \nFirst I would love to see a link to the 1000 privileges of being married, then I would like to see how they would all be cut in half with a second wife. Removing the polygamy bans would work both ways as well, women could marry multiple men.\n\n I've run across quite a few guys who refuse to educate themselves on things that are easily self-educated.\n Knock yourself out...\n list marriage rights - Google Search\n \n And I never said that \"all\" would be cut in half.\n \n And the fact that women could marry multiple men just means that men could also be a victim of this. Doesn't make it right...\n \n \n \nThis still boils down to weather or not homosexuality is a choice. You cannot compare gay discrimination to say race discrimination untill you have done that.\n\n No. It doesn't.\n There is NO requirement that an attribute has to be proven as \"not a choice\" before it is protected.\n You're making that up.\n \n I challenge you to prove that \"choice\" is in any way legally relevant.\n Quit giving your blind opinion and give some substance...",

Choice is and always has been a factor, not the only factor, in determining a protected status. Basic common sense says it has to be.\n\n \n The fourth Amendment is a constraint on GOVERNMENT.

The evidence against sexual orientation being a choice is inconclusive, same as the evidence that sexual orientation is biological.\n\n \n There are so many misunderstandings here. First of all, mathematics is not a science. It is a tool used by science. Mathematics is, well, maths... a purely logic system of propositions and deductions with no necessary empirical content whatsoever. You CAN prove or disprove many things absolutely in mathematics. Not so easy in science which has to deal with the real world and test hypotheses empirically, not just rely on pure reason. Science is inductive as much as deductive. It's a different animal from mathematics, for all that reason and logic are common to both.\n \n Consequently, the evidence for the biological component of sexual orientation is as conclusive as it gets in much of science. That hypothesis has not been disconfirmed by contrary data, while there is a lot of data consistent with it. The contrary hypotheses, that sexual orientation is either a choice or a product purely of childhood upbringing, have been pretty much refuted by evidence. Only a few die-hard anti-gay activists cling to those notions.\n \n Of course, it's truism to say that every person is a product of the interaction of his or her genes and environment. Genes do not entirely determine who a person is or can become. But they do set constraints that cannot be broken. It seems fairly probable that sexual orientation is one of them, at least according to current data. The scientific jury may not be entirely certain of its findings, but based on available evidence, it is inclined to discount those who dismiss sexual orientation as either non-existent or a mere fashion statement.\n \n \nI asked the polygamy question as a sort of litmus test, because I find it hypocritical to rally for same sex marriage yet rally against polygamy. No, I don't have a bone to grind and I don't deny that there are advantages to being married, but I find the 1000 number foundit66 gave a bit hard to swallow and his tying it into polygamy even harder to swallow.\n\n \n I'm not getting into an argument about polygamy. Whether one is for it or agin it -- and I for one do not much care, though I do see legal and social problems that are not simple to overcome for polygamy or polyamory advocates -- it can be treated as a separate issue from equality in marriage. This is because polygamy laws apply to everyone equally, whereas anti-gay marriage laws discriminate exclusively against gay Americans.\n \n \nOf course they could be discriminated against, same as homosexuals. What I'm saying is that all forms of discrimination are not illegal, or for that matter wrong. For instance: Most busnesses wouldn't hire a receptionist that had tattoos on his/her face. Is that discrimination against people with tattoos on their faces? Yes. Is it wrong? No. Is it discrimination when fire departments only hire people who are in shape? Yes. Is it wrong? No.\n\n \n That's a bit besides the point. The 14th Amendment applies specifically to government actions and policies. Private individuals can do as they see fit. Government can pass laws limiting the ability of corporations and public accommodations to discriminate, but if government chooses to do so, then it shouldn't exclude an entire identifiable class of people such as gays from them.

As you quoted, I said \"One purpose of civil rights.....\" not \" The only purpose....\". I'm not sure why you keep arguing a point I agree with you on. I'll say it one more time for the cheap seats: I AGREE WITH YOU THAT CIVIL RIGHTS IS IN NO WAY RESTRICTED TO INHERENT ATTRIBUTES OR NON-CHOICES.\n However, that being said, I will stand by my point that not all choices should be protected as a civil right.\n \n \nI have already supplied you with the proof.\n It's common sense, if you would stop and think and answer HONESTLY.\n Heterosexuals DO NOT CHOOSE to be attracted to the opposite gender.\n Homosexuals DO NOT CHOOSE to be attracted to the same gender.\n We could take a poll on this message board and you'd find the honest answer from people, over and over again is that sexual orientation IS NOT a choice.\n\n \n You have provided zero proof.

You even said you had proof. And while you are correct that you do not have to turn over the glass to prove there is no ball under it, you do have to turn over the paper cup to prove the ball exists. You telling me that there is a ball is not proof.\n \n \nLook. Just cause a guy masturbates with his hand doesn't mean he is \"attracted\" to it. It doesn't mean he's \"hand-asexual\".\n\n \n Comparing masterbation to sex is a ridicules apples to oranges comparison. \n \n \nJust cause somebody has sex with the same gender doesn't make them gay. The point is if they had their choice as to which gender to have sex with, would it be male or female.\n\n \n So your saying that what gender you have sex with is a choice but that has no bearing on sexual orientation.

Unbridled \"freedom\" would be akin to anarchy!\n\n \n Thank you for making one of my points. Every choice of lifestyle should not/ can not be protected as a civil right, hence the reason proving whether or not homosexuality is a choice is important. If it is found that homosexuality is biological, like being black, then it is a clear cut case of civil rights. If not then the issue become much more grey.\n \n \nI've argued against people all over the place who try to pretend there are legitimate interests in banning gay marriage.\n The fact that you don't even try to argue, and cowardly duck the issue, is rather telling\n.\n \n I haven't discussed it because it is irrelevent to the issue at hand, as I've stated, twice. However, if you would like to start a new thread concerning that issue I would be more then happy to participate. (give me a couple of days I'm going out of town for the weekend)\n \n \nI challenge you to prove that \"choice\" is in any way legally relevant.\n Quit giving your blind opinion and give some substance...\n\n \n Simple, being treated equally because of things that are not a choice such as being black, women, etc. is nearly always an inherent civil right. All choices do not inherently justify civil rights status. If they did we would have the anarchy you spoke of earlier.\n \n Merry Christmas",

   "OK, so government can not discriminate but with private companies its fine. Ok, I can roll with that. Oh wait....\n \n This seems to be a bit of a conflict in your post. \n\n \n None whatever. The Constitution limits the powers of government: that is its purpose. There is nothing in the Constitution to prevent government from banning discrimination in public accommodations and corporations. Freedom of association applies to individuals.\n \n \nAllow me to quote Merriam-Webster: \"Main Entry: math\u00b7e\u00b7mat\u00b7ics 1 : the science of numbers and their operations, interrelations, combinations, generalizations, and abstractions and of space configurations and their structure, measurement, transformations, and generalizations\" \n Tell me again how mathematics isn't a science. Pretty much makes the rest of that portion of your post irrelevant.\n\n \n I'm sorry, but I spent over 20 years as a scientist. I'll back my extensive, real world knowledge against your website soundbites. Science and mathematics are certainly related kissing cousins, but they aren't the same sort of enterprise. All a mathematician needs is paper and pencil, or these days a computer. A scientist always gets his or her hands dirty. I explained why, but obviously, that bit flew right over your head.\n \n \nWhoa, hold up. This is the exact same argument I made defending same sex marriage bans. If same sex marriage bans discriminate exclusively against gays, then polygamy bans discriminate exclusively against polygamists. You implied that the 14th protects freedom of religion and sexual orientation equally. Well, does it or doesn't it?\n\n \n Sorry, but you miss the point as usual. Polygamists have exactly the same right to enter a monogamous marriage as everyone -- except gays. They experience no natural compulsion to be polygamists; as such, they are not a natural group the way gays or blacks are. However, I think they may have a case under the 14th Amendment. Not to mention the 1st. While I don't think polygamy is a good way of organising a society, it doesn't really injure anyone if government refuses special rights polygamous relationships, because everyone is in the same boat. And nobody \"needs\" a polygamous relationship the way some of us need a gay one. Besides, a certain degree of polygamy already exists in society, as heterosexual husbands cheat on their wives.\n \n As far as gays are concerned, special rights have been extended to heterosexuals that aren't open to gays. That is unconstitutional.\n \n \nI think you should address some of the inaccuracies and contradictions in you posts.\n\n \n If you could point them out, I will try. So far, you haven't highlighted any actual contradictions.\n \n \nMerry Christmas.\n\n \n And a festive Pagan Yuletide to you. The Solstice cannot come quickly enough!",

Blacks didn't have equality all because of the color of skin. The color of my skin is not a behavior. Heterosexuality is a behavior. Homosexual is a behavior.\n\n \n First of all, what makes you think you speak for \"black people\" as if black people were some sort of monolithic group that all sahred your personal opinions?\n \n Second, since when is being black not also a behaviour as well as a skin colour? Many whites justify their prejudice against blacks not because of the colour of their skin, but because of perceived behaviour. I've seen groups of blacks and groups of whites... the separation of their cultures often results in different behaviour.\n \n Third, whatever makes you think that being gay is a behaviour? It's a state of mind, just as colour is a state of skin.\n \n \nWhite homosexuals had rights that blacks didn't have all because they were white, nothing more. White homosexual could sit at the front of the bus, why because they were white.

If he were still alive, he'd be even less polite to you than I'm being. I've known many gay black people, and they all complained of the vicious homophobic hatred in the black Christian community. That's one reason they sought out white friendships within the gay community -- those could take them away from those churches.\n \n And I also have to point out that not all the religious black community is virulently homophobic. Some of it is very supporting of gay rights. Many black civil rights leaders have gone on record as supporting equal rights for gays, because they recognise the similarity between the struggles.\n \n So don't presume you have any right to talk of \"black people\" as if you were their accredited representative.

   "Help me understand what discrimination do homosexuals face that blacks face?\n\n 1) To answer your question, gays and blacks share discrimination in employment, housing, military, ...\n There are differences in the discrimination focus, but it's the REASON WHY the discrimination is invalid that is the primary shared issue.\n \n 2) Regarding what I ACTUALLY said, some of the shared reasons for discrimination involve a shared pretense of the validity of imposing \"morality\" as a legitimate state interest for discrimination.\n Also, if you look at the arguments for miscegenation laws presented in Loving v Virginia, the similarities between that and today's \"gay marriage\" arguments are kind of eerie. The FUNDAMENTAL arguments were rejected in Loving v Virginia, yet people keep trying to repeat them today.\n And before you try to raise the predictable strawman argument, I'm not talking about substituting \"gender\" in for \"race\" at all.\n I'm talking about arguments like \"well, personX can marry somebody, so there is no discrimination\".

   "I still agree with you, no matter how much you don't want me to. As you quoted, I said \"One purpose of civil rights.....\" not \" The only purpose....\". I'm not sure why you keep arguing a point I agree with you on. I'll say it one more time for the cheap seats: I AGREE WITH YOU THAT CIVIL RIGHTS IS IN NO WAY RESTRICTED TO INHERENT ATTRIBUTES OR NON-CHOICES.\n However, that being said, I will stand by my point that not all choices should be protected as a civil right.\n\n To be more explicit then, NO purpose of civil rights revolves around making sure that \"born with\" attributes or \"not a choice\" attributes are protected.\n civil rights: The rights belonging to an individual by virtue of citizenship, especially the fundamental freedoms and privileges guaranteed by the 13th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and by subsequent acts of Congress, including civil liberties, due process, equal protection of the laws, and freedom from discrimination.\n civil rights: Definition from Answers.com\n \n There is no requirement and no suggestion of needing any inherent attributes.\n \n \n \nYou have provided zero proof. You repeating it and threatening to do a poll are not proof either. The simple fact is that science, at this time, cannot prove it either way. When you can admit this simple fact we will be able to move on, otherwise show me this proof you claim to have.\n\n I have linked to the APA web-site which acknowledges the reality of the situation.\n You refuse to listen.\n \n I have given proof regarding \"reparative therapy\" and how gays who WANT TO BE straight CANNOT choose to be straight.\n You refuse to listen.\n \n If anybody out there is convinced by Lurch's argument that homosexuality COULD be a choice, then please let me know and I will go further.\n Otherwise, I'm not wasting my time repeating myself for somebody who adamantly refuses to listen\n \n \n \nYes, you do have to prove it. You even said you had proof. And while you are correct that you do not have to turn over the glass to prove there is no ball under it, you do have to turn over the paper cup to prove the ball exists. You telling me that there is a ball is not proof.\n\n You are lost in the analogy.\n The cups are different reasons for why homosexuality is. CupA could be \"genetics\". CupB could be \"environment\". CupC could be \"God's divine intervention\".\n And CupTransparent is \"people choose to be gay\".\n \n The ball is the associated demonstration of validity. The cup without the ball is false. The cup with the ball is true.\n So, while we do not have a definitive answer of whether CupA has a ball, and ergo whether or not \"genetics\" is a cause for sexual orientation, that does not mean that we cannot see that CupTransparent has NO BALL.\n \n \n \nComparing masterbation to sex is a ridicules apples to oranges comparison. \n\n Again, you don't want to listen.\n The point is that people getting off by a certain method does not mean they are ATTRACTED to the method.\n \n Your replies are becoming obviously non-responsive to the points being made.\n \n \n \nSo your saying that what gender you have sex with is a choice but that has no bearing on sexual orientation. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n It does to most people.\n Straights can't choose to be sexually attracted to the same gender.\n But ANY straight person can have sex with the same gender.\n \n Again, your reply is obviously non-responsive to the point being made. You might as well just say \"I don't think so\" over and over again and it would be just as note-worthy...\n \n \n \nTo seperate uncoerced sexual action from sexual orientation is absurd. \n\n To refuse to acknowledge the difference between the two is absurd.\n Again, your reply is pointlessly non-responsive.\n \n \n \nThank you for making one of my points. Every choice of lifestyle should not/ can not be protected as a civil right, hence the reason proving whether or not homosexuality is a choice is important. If it is found that homosexuality is biological, like being black, then it is a clear cut case of civil rights. If not then the issue become much more grey.\n\n I'm sorry, but no.\n There is NO legal requirement for ANY test of \"is it a choice\" to validate civil rights, or to aid civil rights legitimacy.\n \n I challenged you to show ANY EVIDENCE that \"not a choice\" is in any way important to \"civil rights\".\n You failed to do so.\n \n \n \nI haven't discussed it because it is irrelevent to the issue at hand, as I've stated, twice. However, if you would like to start a new thread concerning that issue I would be more then happy to participate. (give me a couple of days I'm going out of town for the weekend)\n\n That's funny.\n It's \"relevant\" enough for you to claim the answer is \"legitimate interests exist\", but not relevant enough for you to actually SUBSTANTIATE your claim.\n Not substantiating your claim is becoming a recurring trend with you.\n \n \n \n I challenge you to prove that \"choice\" is in any way legally relevant.\n Quit giving your blind opinion and give some substance... \n\n \nSimple, being treated equally because of things that are not a choice such as being black, women, etc. is nearly always an inherent civil right. All choices do not inherently justify civil rights status. If they did we would have the anarchy you spoke of earlier.\n\n Do you even realize how flawed your response is?\n It's like claiming there is a link inbetween \"Florida oranges\" and \"Sunkist\".\n And to prove your claim, you point to a variety of \"Sunkist\" oranges that happen to be from Florida.\n It doesn't prove anything about the ACTUAL EXISTENCE of such a link in the first place.\n \n People can't choose their height, correct?\n Suppose I fire a guy for being too short. He's only 5'8\", and I like people to be 5'9\" or taller.\n Does that mean that the guy in question has any legal recourse cause he NEVER CHOSE to be 5'8\"?\n NO.",
