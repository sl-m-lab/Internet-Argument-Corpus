   "They better not do that! I hail from Spain! Those are MY people turning gay! This isn't cool...\n \n Actually, I strongly disagree with gay marriage anyway. It just isn't marriage. It is hypocritical and just plain disugusting. Marriage is ment to be between one man and one woman, and no other way. Some people claim to be Christian, then they go and commit this sin full of hypocricy by marrying someone of the same sex.\n \n Homosexuality, in terms of sex, marriage and whatnot, is a sin. Now, homosexual LOVE isn't a sin. I have a male friend who is my friend, and I am in NO way attracted to him, because I am not gay, but I love the guy. That is homosexual love, but homosexuality does not mean GAY. Homo=Same Sex=Gender. You can love someone same gender as you, such as mother, father or close friends, and it is homosexual, but not GAY.\n \n We need to stop this hypocricy before human civilization continues to defile itself by doing such things.\n\n \n Welcome to the United States of America, where, if the people have anything to say about it, RELIGION DOES NOT MAKE UP THE LAW! \n \n Also, to catch you up to speed, we've already established the fact that \"marriage\" is a Government institution, not a religious institution. So, let's not have to rehash that for you now. \n \n Just in case I've missed something, I will also remind you that \"human civilization continues to defile itself by doing such things\" would also include divorce, murder, theft, rape...etc. Are you attempting to say that those issues are somehow a lesser of a problem than homosexuality (or for you \"gay sex\")? \n I seriously doubt it. \n Mainly because the issues I listed all create victims, show me the victims of a concentual, committed homosexual union? I don't think you can. \n \n I will also refer you to WMS's post #716, in the thread entitled \"Let's Make a Deal.\" where he reprints actual church cerimonial rites given to same sex unions. For your further education, these rites are VERY old. So, I'm not talking \"modern\" stuff here. \n \n So, now that you have been brought up to speed. Your religious feelings about homosexual love, or since you seem to have such a problem with that term...GAY SEX and GAY UNIONS, really don't have much to stand on as far as laws go.\n \n Oh, and before I forget, your ettimology of the word \"HOMOSEXUAL\" is also not correct, well not completely anyway.\n Yes, it stems from the word: Homo, meaning same.\n But the later part is still: SEXUAL, not sex. The extended meaning of the word: \"Of, relating to, involving, or characteristic of sex, sexuality, the sexes, or the sex organs and their functions. \n Implying or symbolizing erotic desires or activity. \n Relating to, produced by, or involving reproduction characterized by the union of male and female gametes: sexual reproduction.\" \n So, if we were to apply your definition to the word \"Homosexual\" one would have to call you Oedipus..and I really hate to tell you, but sexual contact with a member of your immediate family is known as INCEST.\n Eeeewwww...\n \n No, homosexual does NOT mean simply \"liking\" or having platonic affection towards someone of the same gender.\n \n ho\u00b7mo\u00b7sex\u00b7u\u00b7al (hm-sksh-l, -m-)\n adj.  \n \n Of, relating to, or having a sexual orientation to persons of the same sex.\n n.  \n A homosexual person; a gay man or a lesbian.",

   "Not true Our laws were originally founded on the precepts of the 10 commandments........\n\n \n Which is why the Supreme Court has ruled against their display on public property??????\n \n One more time:\n \n Geez. emoticon_rolleyes Will you people EVERY grow up?\n http://earlyamerica.com/review/summer97/secular.html\n http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/treaty_tripoli.html\n http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/barbary/bar1796t.htm\n \n \nSome people today assert that the United States government came from Christian foundations. They argue that our political system represents a Christian ideal form of government and that Jefferson, Madison, et al, had simply expressed Christian values while framing the Constitution. If this proved true, then we should have a wealth of evidence to support it, yet just the opposite proves the case.\n \n Although, indeed, many of America's colonial statesmen practiced Christianity, our most influential Founding Fathers broke away from traditional religious thinking. The ideas of the Great Enlightenment that began in Europe had begun to sever the chains of monarchical theocracy. These heretical European ideas spread throughout early America. Instead of relying on faith, people began to use reason and science as their guide. The humanistic philosophical writers of the Enlightenment, such as Locke, Rousseau, and Voltaire, had greatly influenced our Founding Fathers and Isaac Newton's mechanical and mathematical foundations served as a grounding post for their scientific reasoning.\n \n A few Christian fundamentalists attempt to convince us to return to the Christianity of early America, yet according to the historian, Robert T. Handy, \"No more than 10 percent-- probably less-- of Americans in 1800 were members of congregations.\"\n \n The Founding Fathers, also, rarely practiced Christian orthodoxy. Although they supported the free exercise of any religion, they understood the dangers of religion. Most of them believed in deism and attended Freemasonry lodges. According to John J. Robinson, \"Freemasonry had been a powerful force for religious freedom.\" Freemasons took seriously the principle that men should worship according to their own conscious. Masonry welcomed anyone from any religion or non-religion, as long as they believed in a Supreme Being. Washington, Franklin, Hancock, Hamilton, Lafayette, and many others accepted Freemasonry.\n \n The Constitution reflects our founders views of a secular government, protecting the freedom of any belief or unbelief. The historian, Robert Middlekauff, observed, \"the idea that the Constitution expressed a moral view seems absurd. There were no genuine evangelicals in the Convention, and there were no heated declarations of Christian piety.\"  \n\n \n \nAuthored by American diplomat Joel Barlow in 1796, the following treaty was sent to the floor of the Senate, June 7, 1797, where it was read aloud in its entirety and unanimously approved. John Adams, haven seen the treaty, signed it and proudly proclaimed it to the Nation.\n\n \n \n Art. 11. As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\n \n The year was 1797. Passed unanimously. \n \n Now what part of that is it that you don't understand?",

   "Two letters to the editor from today's L.A. Times: \nJack Hitt is absolutely correct in his assessment that Jesus, in forcing his followers to find their faith through a process of deep thought and reflection, would be out of step with the right's quickie, black-and-white takes on so-called \"values.\"\n \n Jesus urged his followers not to be dittoheads, but instead to think for themselves. He would have decried an \"ownership society\" in which the rich got richer and the poor got the picture, time and again. \n \n A decidedly nonviolent man, he would have abhorred the death penalty - a government policy of which he himself was a victim. The sad truth about these unenlightened times is that were Jesus to return today he would likely meet the same fate at the hands of his most publicly fervent \"believers.\" \n \n John DeCure\n \n Long Beach\n \n *\n \n Hitt's piece is likely to call forth the demons in most of us Christians who feel that it is our duty to have and to hold the right answers. Where did we get that notion? It was certainly not from Jesus, who only answered three questions directly or indirectly out of the more than 100 questions that were asked! \n \n Could it possibly be that Jesus wants us to own our viewpoints and to know that they are just views from a point? Is it possible that when we \"know\" we have the right answers or the absolute, it gives us the right to lobby against, persecute or even torture and kill anyone who disagrees with us?\n \n John Wynne\n http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-le-jesus30apr30,1,6567724.story?ctrack=1&cset=true",
