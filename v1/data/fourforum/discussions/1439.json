I shall endeavor to answer correctly. The plan/boundary cannot be overstepped. You still have free will within the way you were created. A lion cannot be a hippopotamous. You cannot be other than you. However, within who you are you may make choices. The plan for God is an eternal one. To look at just what you do here on this planet is short sighted. Not that it is unimportant. It is important, but it is not the end of the story. \n \n Your final destiny, I can only answer as a christian as I don't know other religions. Your final destiny is not based on what behavior you exhibit. It is instead based upon who you are. As a christian, it is my belief that You can Identify yourself with Jesus, who is the way to God, or you can identify yourself with anyone or thing else which are the ways away from God. Your final destiny is based on that. If a person has aligned themselves with Jesus and then falls into \"a life of porn\" for instance, I could not answer where they go because God is the only judge.

I am a christian and when I say predestination, I do not mean simply that God already knows what will happen. That sells God very short. \n \n God chose people before the beginning of time. He has predestined us, yet he still allows for our free will. I do not think that the two are necessarily reconcilable. It is in the nature of God to be paradoxical on several fronts (or at least seemingly so). he predestines and he allows for free will, He is merciful and just, He is one and He is three. There are many more examples. Of anyone but God they are impossible. God did not simply look down through time and see which ones would believe in Him and then choose them. It is His choice of us that allows us to Choose Him. How does one know if they are predestined? By faith. Sorry, but there is no better answer. We christians too often try to get off of the faith hook and prove that it is logical to choose God. \n \n I believe anyone who knows Him will choose Him. Those that don't don't know Him and are blinded to Him. Many will say it is not fair for God to choose some and not others. On the contrary, He is perfectly just to choose none. We are the ones that abandoned Him not the other way. How do I know he didn't abandon us? Jesus. He would be perfectly just and righteous to choose none, but he is merciful and gracious and desires that none should perish, but He will not force himself on us. \n \n I cannot reconcile all these things, no one can.

And here is why. You seem to be missing the concept of God being OUTSIDE of time. Time is irrelevant. God has seen the taxi arrive in front of the green leaf, he has seen the accident that prevented it from arriving, he has seen the little old lady that got in the taxi before it arrived and it went a different direction. He has seen all possibilities and all possibilities have occurred ( and since he is outside of time) will occur and have been occuring and are occuring and so on. A good way to use the proper verb tense would be to say \"had been will be are occuring.\" English does not have the verb tense to describe it. Greek comes the closest but is still off.\n \n You are looking only at things in a linear fashion. It is difficult to grasp otherwise as we can only have the abstract conception of \"outside of time.\" Much like a fourth dimension. We cannot interact with it in three dimensions. Look at the book by Edwin Abbot called Flatland. It is a fascinating social commentary but explains the concepts in a wonderful manner.\n \n Two dimensional creatures would have no concept of up or down. They would simply be living in what would be a unidirection universe. They perhaps would not measure time as passing them by but rather up (forward in time) or down (backward in time). If a three dimensional sphere came along and grabbed a two dimensional square and moved him through up and down the square would see before him a point growing to a larger and larger circle and then finally a smaller and smaller cirlce and then larger and larger and then smaller and smaller (as he descended back through down to where he was). \n \n To us as three dimensional beings, two dimensions exist all around us.

Lets pretend that you are God and that you know everything that has happened from 6000 BC (the beginning of time) to 2003 AD (the end of time).

As you are watching them they challenge you to predict what they are going to do next. However you find that you don't have to predict anything at all because infact to you this whole event has already occurred and you know the outcome. You didn't force this person to do what he is doing yet you already know what is going to happen since you are outside of time and have already seen it happen. So since you know what this guy from 1000 AD is going to do next do you believe that he has no free will or do you think that God simply already knows what he is going to do with his free will and therefore it is no surprise to God when this little guy does something?\n \n That is basically the whole story. Assuming God exists and that there is free will it makes perfect sense how God knows what you are going to do next even though you are doing it at your own free will. To him it has already happened and you were no more destine to do this event than the guy in 1000 AD was destine to challenge God to predict what he would do next. Just because God knows about it before it happens doesn't mean he made it happen.\n \n Now if you want a real puzzle try to figure out if God's decisions are predetermined. epaphras_faith will quickly point out that God is not time based yet I question that point based on the fact that God has created a linear system in our universe and he has acted linearly when dealing with this system.

Just as you and I can act linearly within left or right but we don't necessarily have to. He did create the nature of the universe. However, we only dimly understand that nature. However, God cannot act in any way that is not in accordance with his nature. That does not mean he is not all powerful. It means he is perfect and He is the definer and the definition. \n \n Mamboni:\n \n Read through this thread, there are a number of arguments that point to the possibility of the coexistence of predestination and free will. You will find that I argue the possible coexistence because of the nature of God. Because we are three dimension and exist unidirectionally and linearly within time and God does not we cannot conceive of it other than in the abstract.

   "Adept, you are suggesting that there is no free will and that external factors outside of our own invented and personal imagination is what makes people do what they do, right? in other words, if person x is put in position p with the same external factors e, then he will always make that same choice.[/b]\n\n \n Yes. If all of the variables are the same, then the answer to the equation will be the same.\n \n \nfirst of all there is really no way I can think of to disprove this, since no 2 instances will 2 identical people be faced with the same choice under identical circumstances. however, in one's mind an identical event can be simulated, and the choice can be reconsidered. in fact there is no doubt that you yourself hae made decisions and then later conclude that you could have done something different, and would have done differently if you were in the same position.\n\n \n Indeed. However, hindsight is another variable. Using it, and taking account of it in an equation will yield a different answer. I could have chosen differently, and would do so if given the choice again. However, given the choice again is not the same as having the original choice again, because you are now armed with more knowledge of the outcome. So of course your decision will be different.\n \n \nI disagree with determinism on a moral/motivational level, because this type of mentality relieves the actor of his responsibility for his actions, anf usually results in a lackadaisical que-sera-sera type attitude in the person.\n\n \n Yeah, it sucks. But I believe it to be the truth. Remeber, just because your decisions are already made does not need you do not need to make them.\n \n \nI also disagree on a practical level that your environment dictates your actions. environment itself is a result of your actions, and if your actions are also a result of your environment you end up with a pointless circular logic. How can the environment be the initiator of the action and the outcome of the action itself?\n\n \n The environment cannot be a result of the actions until after they are made. Up until that point they are an influence, and after the action they are part of the result, and will then become an influence on any further actions.\n \n \nAnd in the same process you subtract decision making power and imagination out of the equation under the presumption that they dont exist. it doesnt make sense to me\n\n \n No, I dont subtract them. Decision making and imagination are simply chemical reactions firing the brain. Very complex, almost completely un-predictable reactions, but reactions none-the-less. They are limited and bound by the same laws o physics that the rest of the world is, which is to say that certain stimuli cause certain reactions in the brain, which in turn can cause other reactions. \n \n Everyone can see a certain level of determinism in everyday life. If you slap someone, they become angry. If someone loses a loved one, they become sad. If someone wins the lottery, they become happy. It is easy to predict these reactions because the number of variables that have a direct outcome on the result are few. Other reactions, like how a person will react under pressure, or if faced with great stress, are harder, as more variables come into the equation.",

   "Firstly, some people appear to have absolutely no idea what determinism even means - kind of silly to be discussing it under such circumstances.\n \n A simple definition:\n The view that every event has a cause and that everything in the universe is governed by causal laws.\n \n The fact those causal laws exist makes determinism true in any given situation, unless you can find a special exception (there is a possibility on the quantum level, some might say the human \"mind\", but that is a discredible notion today).\n \n The roll of a dice is determined by the laws of physics, by gravity, friction, and the force and height with which it were thrown and its initial position and orientation in space. If you had all the numbers and all the equations you could predict the outcome with perfect accuracy. In the real world, we don't - but that doesn't make the dices outcome undetermined even though we might call it chance.\n \n Secondly, can you please stop making reference to God to support your argument, there are several atheists here and appealing to his existence is poor form, I might as well start talking about how I'm right because Superman and Hitler's Ghost support my theory.",

The last one is a certainty.\n \n As to predicting an individual when predicting groups, this is not true. The individuals actions are only a minute part of the whole if the group is large enough. It has less and less impact the larger the group gets. That is why statistics are useful.\n \n The problem with statistics is that they do break down at the limits. The integral of 1/X is the natural number. This is an infinite non repeating number. It is the natural number if the limit goes to zero.

Why did you pick sweater A over sweater B?\n \n If you do not believe the decision making process to be limited by the physical world (Which is a perfectly acceptable, if unsupported belief), then where does it reside, and under what rules?

For every stimulus, a nerve cell can respond in only one way. The nerve cell does not have a mind of its own. It merely undergoes chemical reactions when a stimulus arrives. How do we know the chemical reactions would be the same? Because of the properties of the atoms that make up the nerve cell.

Let's create a scenario. A man has to choose between a chocolate or frosted donut. He only has enough money to buy one. Hard choice. What happens in the brain?\n \n He sees the two donut choices. He starts debating which one to eat. However, this debating, or \"thought\" that he experiences is merely the communications of nuerons and nerve cells.

For every stimulus, a nerve cell can respond in only one way. The nerve cell does not have a mind of its own. It merely undergoes chemical reactions when a stimulus arrives.

Free will isnt a matter of having a chance of picking one or the other. Free will is the decision of which one you do pick.\n\n \n Let me clarify. I do not mean chance as in probability per se, but instead as possibility. Free will states that i am capable of choosing many different options. Key word being capable. (if u think im wrong, please state your definition of free will. i might be confusing myself)\n \n \nJohnGalt: Of course I would pick the same option over and over again.

I will pick one and if you rewind me doing that into the origional position I will pick the same thing because that is my decision. \n\n \n So you agree that if placed in a situation, you will choose only one choice again and again? Then i revert to my (newly revised) definition of free will, in which a person is capable of choosing any option. However, if no matter what, you will always choose the same option if you are placed in the same situation, you are not really capable of choosing any option other than the one you pick. This is because of brain chemistry. There is no possibility that you would choose anything else.\n \n \nJohnGalt: Those reactions, impulses and other cellular responses they produce affect me and affect my decision. These feelings affect my thoughts. They do not make the decision... I do. \n I (my mind) produces thoughts. My nerve cells do not produce my thoughts.\n\n \n Well, what exactly is your mind then? From a purely scientific standpoint, your brain is composed of communicating nerve cells and nuerons. When you say \"I do\", what is really the \"I\"?

By seperating conciousness from the physical realm of your mind, you are giving conciousness a preternatural existence. But, from a purely scientific standpoint, a metaphysical conciousness does not exist. Conciousness in itself is nothing more than a sensation created by physical happening.

   "I think it's an interesting distinction, but not really an important one. Descartes doesn't connect sight with existence, yet he wrote is words on a page...odd. Likewise, what evidence does he give to support that our eyesight isn't capable of passing to our mind a sense of things that exist? None? Sounds like faith to me to claim what we see is not what exists. What evidence could you possibly provide to support this claim?\n \n Beliefs are based on reason, require evidence, and are falsifiable, by definition. All beliefs/reasoning implies acquisition through human senses (in our case). Axioms are not. You don't \"believe\" an axiom, it's not an option. You either use an axiom, or you don't, and you don't only by not thinking. To say the only thing we \"know for certain is an axiom\", implies you have some evidence to back that claim. You don't.\n \n When you say \"There are brain cells on this microscope slide\":\n this is a statement of fact, and can be shown to be true, and you will \"believe\" they are there. To say it's \"less certain\" than an axiom is meaningless, beliefs and truth and evidence DO NOT apply to an axiom, so why do you place axioms in the realm of falsifiable, or place beliefs and truth in the realm of the axiom? You've got to keep the seperate to remain consistent.\n \n If it were an axiom, you wouldn't need to use reason to establish the knowledge of it's existence, observation would be irrelevant. If you know the measure of probability associated with the existence or non-existence of the cells, you might be able to give a percentage error or other such qualified response. But you cannot know how likely or unlikely it is, there is no reason to believe contrary to evidence, that what we see is not what exists.\n \n For you to claim there is some uncertainty associated with observation of cells under a microscope requires evidence that what you see is NOT what you claim it to be. That is, if you're approaching truth/false through reason. If you cannot do this, I submit that it's just like a unie, a concept that has no basis in reality. If you can, but the evidence does not compare to the overwhelming evidence that what we see DOES exist, then it's discarded as a useless hypothesis, just like creation. \n \n -Mach",

We may contrast \"free\" man with a machine, whose actions are determined by the preferences of the operator, or with a jellyfish, which has no preferences, and does not have a (deterministic) mechanism for deciding which actions to take to achieve goals. It does not even have goals, and it does not act.\n \n Finally, if our actions were not determined by our preferences, if they were random, we could not in the sense I use the word, be termed free.

This annoys him though, since he prefers apples.\n \n Which man here is truly free? Man B) is certainly free from \"determinism\", but man A) is free to act in accordance with his preferences. Man B)'s undeterministic nature means he is not free to act in accorance with his preferences - even though that is what he would like to do.\n \n I believe it is acting in accordance with one's preferences which is what constitutes free will, and it is this kind of freedom which is not only compatible with, but dependent on, determinism.",

How, in any sense, is God \"fallible\" if the free moral agents He creates sometimes choose to do evil rather than good? It not possible to create truly free moral agents without assuming the risk that some of those free moral agents will freely choose to do evil rather than good. Your arguments regarding time travel are not relevant to the discussion about the compatibility of free will and divine foreknowledge. The fact that I did not do x or y in the past does not mean that I wasn't free to do them, it means I exercised my free will in opting not to do x or y.\n \n With respect to quantum theory, I will grant that we cannot now always predict the behavior of particles at the quantum level. It does not, however, logically follow that there does not exist rules which govern the behavior of particles at the quantum level, of which we do not now have knowledge.

If the choice you make is known in the future then there is no way you could do something different in the past.\n \n Far as you are concerned Free Will exists, but given that there is only one outcome of your choice, and circumstances end up with you choosing a particular one it seems like you had a choice. But from an observer who either knows all the variables, or the choice you chose there really is no option for you.\n \n Quantum particles do not behave like macroscopic ones, and their behaviour fits as if they only existed as probable ones.

We can't think like God or think what aims he might have and seeing as even with Free Will using God logic starts to fray around the edges when he gets personally involved in things (knowing what the consquences must be) - you end up with something very similar to determinism where we just have to assume that on the whole we are making the choices God wanted us to. \n \n Personally I think the main problem comes from the early hebrew culture where God was probably not seen as quite the abstract diety it is today but more of a fairly human Sky King.",

First of all, Christianity states that God is omniscient, yes, He knows everything that was, is and will be. However, this does not mean that we, as acting free agents of reality, \"don't really know the entire reason we know what we do\". When a person makes a choice, the knowledge that is applied to decide and act one way or the other is enough to make that act coherent. In other words, when we act we know enough of what and (especially) why we do something.\n \n The fact that God knows what will be doesn't mean that things are determined previously, at least not as far as what we can chose to do is concerned. This means that the knowledge God possesses of the future is derived from a comprehension of the human nature profound enough to pinpoint the choices that all of us, in freedom, will make.\n \n Tastyfish, I think this is a very appropriate place to discuss the free will issue we debated in the Abortion forum.",

The concept of free will is most definitely NOT a physical factor, because its existence or nonexistence cannot be proven using the normal scientific methods that are the basis of knowledge in the sciences that study the physical world. However (thankfully), there are other branches of human knowledge (today being sadly discredited) that study other phenomena which are beyond the competence of the physical sciences. These sciences are entirely dedicated to the study of the human person both as an individual (psychology, personal philosophy, anthropology, etc.) and as a part of a society (sociology, history, economics, law, etc.). The methods used in these \"humanistic\" sciences to acquire knowledge are obviously different from those used in the physical sciences, because the factors at hand are different. Nothing can be scientifically \"proved\" in these areas of knowledge, because there is no possible experimentation, no possible control of the relevant variables in play, and so, no possible prediction of future outcomes. This is because human events are essentially and inexorably unpredictable, uncontrollable and unrepeatable. So, the knowledge we search for in these areas of what we can generally call Science consists in deciphering the motivations behind human events, in analysing the results of those events and in proposing abstract premises (concepts) that can help us comprehend the entirety of what the human creature does. So, the phrase given by Occam's Razor (\"if you can't tell the difference between your existing system and one with a load of other unproven assumptions in it, you can reject those assumptions as unnecessary\") is not applicable to these areas of knowledge, because the susceptibility of \"assumptions\" to be proved or not is irrelevant. In a few words: knowledge in the humanistic sciences is essentially not provable, that is precisely the delineation that separates both areas of Science (empirical sciences from humanistic sciences), and that gives sense to both.\n \n Then, above all other sciences, we have what we call Philosophy, which is the generalised and comprehensive study of all objects (physical and not) and the study of knowledge itself, and whose methods are a mixture (or are, rather, the parent) of the methods used in the other two \"daughter\" branches.\n \n This distinction of human knowledge has been constant in all the history of Western thought, so if you are going to discredit it, I hope you use well substantiated arguments, after all, I think it makes a lot of sense.\n \n Given this distinction, which is fundamental, I think we can begin to define free will, which, as Tastyfish has already made clear, cannot be proven through the \"scientific method\". However, the fact that the concept of free will is recurrent in all the history of human knowledge must mean that there is some truth behind it (otherwise we would be saying that the people who speak of free will have been completely wrong and stupid for the past 6,000 or so years). So, this leads us logically to the idea that, perhaps, free will is a concept which falls within the competence of the sciences we call humanistic, and which deal with all human phenomena which are not strictly physical (of course, free will is not a tangible object).\n \n Having said this, we can begin to define the different categories at hand. In human affairs, things do not happen following a cause-effect scheme, saying this would be like saying that the behaviour of humans is equivalent to the response a chemical will give when put in contact with another (in other words, ALWAYS and INEXORABLY predictable), and this is wrong. Like I said, human events are not predictable, not because we don't have knowledge of all the factors going on, but because human action is essentially unpredictable: it is essentially free. Given a cause and effect scheme, the existence of civilisation and culture as a whole would make absolutely no sense, because culture is much more than the means humans use to survive in the world, it is the means we have to advance in ourselves: find knowledge, create art, communicate ideas, etc. However, the fact that these phenomena exist makes it logical to think that human action has never been a mere response to foreign stimuli, it is much more than this.\n \n Now, concerning the brain, I think your idea that \"the brain is responsible for human thinking and is a physical thing that follows the stimulus - response idea\" is not complete. Well, of course the brain is responsible for human thinking, this is obvious. However, the fact that we don't understand the brain very much (we know too little of it, I think, to use it as a fully satisfactory argument) means that the existence of free will, and of other phenomena like intuitive reason are as yet not understood by scientists. The fact they are not understood, obviously, does not necessarily mean they do not exist (the knowledge of this comes mainly from the distinction between the two branches of Science I made above). The fact that the brain responds to stimulus - response is significant, yes, after all, it is a physical object subjected to the laws of physics, chemistry and biology. However, the processes that go on in the brain are so unknown to us, that to say that thought is a mere response to a stimulus is, I think, very daring. And to say that the concrete content of thought is the response to stimuli is simply outrageous. The content of thought is whimsical: we create our own thoughts out of our own free will.\n \n The quantum theory (I'm sorry, I don't completely understand it, but I think I grasp its basic principles) is a theory elaborated in the core of a physical, empirical branch of Science. Therefore, the conclusions made in this area of knowledge cannot possibly be applied (without risking a complete loss of logical coherence) to other areas. To say that quantum physics have a profound impact on the development of art, for example is ridiculous, there are too many intermediate factors (as well as a radical jump in the category of these two things) to make such a bold statement. The same is true about the functioning of our thought, and about the way we behave, and the reasons behind human action.\n \n With respect to the question about omniscience and free will, they are not contradictory. I will use the example of God, which is fitting for this issue. God is an omniscient being, He knows everything that has been, that is and that will come to be. This infinite knowledge comes from two of God's characteristics: He is timeless, so the distinction of what is, what was and what will be does not exist for Him. For God, everything is now, there is no such thing as time, because time itself is of God's creation, and so separate from Him. Secondly, we come to omniscience itself; God knows everything because he is God, simply put. He is the beginning and end of all things, and the workings of everything are known to Him from eternity. Now, the fact that God knows everything does not mean that people's lives are predestined. If this was so, then it would be meaningless to sin, because all actions would be a mere interpretation of the greater scheme of things that has already been decided, and so, in truth, there would be no goodness or badness, simply action. The possibility of action for a person, even in the face of God's omniscience is infinite. We can do whatever we want whenever and however we want, because we all have enough information to decide what we consider to be appropriate in each given moment. The choice that derives from this decision is free, it is not predetermined in our mind, it is, however, already known to God in His mind. The knowledge of God of what we will do comes from the fact that He, and only He, can know, comprehend and weigh all the factors at hand, and so understand the future and know it (not just predict it). We know not all the factors, but we know enough of them to analyse and decide. What else do want knowledge for if it is not to make decisions? Decisions can only be made if the subject is free, if he is predetermined, there is no such thing as a decision.\n \n Concerning animals, you say \"if there is nothing we can measure to demonstrate we have free will, then there is nothing to measure to show that animals don't have it\". Again, free will is not a measurable object, it is an object whose study is beyond the competence of all sciences whose primary method is measurement. There are objects that cannot be measured (the value of art, the strength of an emotion, the wrongness of actions, etc.), and yet they exist and are relevant. The possibility of animals having free will is contradictory with all I have stated. Animals cannot make choices because they do not act out of their own will, they act on the basis of cause-effect, stimulus-response. Unlike humans, there are no factors in animal behaviour that are not measurable, and are therefore beyond the competence of the physical sciences. Everything about animals can be analyses scientifically, because all there is about them is measurable (they do not do good or bad things, they create nothing that is beyond what is basically useful, they are incapable of true emotion, etc.).\n \n Finally, I think it's important to state I am not giving you a summary of any faith or belief, this is the result of thousands of years of philosophical contemplation, and, as you must know, philosophy is not a faith, it is the highest form of knowledge, and the Science on which all others are founded.\n \n I know this is very long and potentially somniferous.

   "With respect to the question about omniscience and free will, they are not contradictory. I will use the example of God, which is fitting for this issue. God is an omniscient being, He knows everything that has been, that is and that will come to be. This infinite knowledge comes from two of God's characteristics: He is timeless, so the distinction of what is, what was and what will be does not exist for Him. For God, everything is now, there is no such thing as time, because time itself is of God's creation, and so separate from Him. Secondly, we come to omniscience itself; God knows everything because he is God, simply put. He is the beginning and end of all things, and the workings of everything are known to Him from eternity. Now, the fact that God knows everything does not mean that people's lives are predestined. If this was so, then it would be meaningless to sin, because all actions would be a mere interpretation of the greater scheme of things that has already been decided, and so, in truth, there would be no goodness or badness, simply action. The possibility of action for a person, even in the face of God's omniscience is infinite. We can do whatever we want whenever and however we want, because we all have enough information to decide what we consider to be appropriate in each given moment. The choice that derives from this decision is free, it is not predetermined in our mind, it is, however, already known to God in His mind.

   "Your post is very long, and you point out several issues in one place, so I'll try to be as schematic as possible, going one by one/I know this is very long and potentially somniferous. Please forgive. emoticon_xhoho\n\n Sorry about that, I tend to get sort of distracted sometimes when doing this things. As for yours, I'll try to break it down into sections, or break up the quote to make a comment, in some cases I'll delete a big chunk of it but I'll say when I do, its mostly to make it easier to read whilst I'm typing.\n \n\n First off, however, before going to each individual point, I think we must make a fundamental distinction. The concept of free will is most definitely NOT a physical factor, because its existence or nonexistence cannot be proven using the normal scientific methods that are the basis of knowledge in the sciences that study the physical world.\n This is a big step for me to make, not sure whether its due to my background or whatever but I'm not sure that this is the proper way of doing something like this. To me the correct way of looking at it would be to ignore this untestable bit and see if everything still works without it. Because in this case we do really have free will or determinism as competing theories, even if we haven't strictly proven free will there is certainly a sensible reason to accept it.\n \n \n\n However (thankfully), there are other branches of human knowledge (today being sadly discredited) that study other phenomena which are beyond the competence of the physical sciences. These sciences are entirely dedicated to the study of the human person both as an individual (psychology, personal philosophy, anthropology, etc.) and as a part of a society (sociology, history, economics, law, etc.)\n I know an aweful lot of economists who would disagree pyschologists with you on that front. I'm starting to think that this is a similar case to the anthropology issue of the abortion thread, to me it seems you are using quite old fashioned ideas of these subjects\n \n Psychology is as much a science as physiology for the most part, even the psychiatry side of things is very strongly linked with neurology or at the very least obersavtional studies. Sociology and Economics are based on fitting mathematical forumla and creating models, which will be tested using the scientific method, the only philosophical parts will be based around what level of significance is nessesary and determining which models are more accurate.\n \n Law admittedly is a bit different, not really being a science like the rest. History I am less famililar with, but I'm pretty sure that most historians would say that it is all about analysing evidence, determining how accurate that evidence is and drawing conclusions off it.\n \n \n\n The methods used in these \"humanistic\" sciences to acquire knowledge are obviously different from those used in the physical sciences, because the factors at hand are different. Nothing can be scientifically \"proved\" in these areas of knowledge, because there is no possible experimentation, no possible control of the relevant variables in play, and so, no possible prediction of future outcomes. This is because human events are essentially and inexorably unpredictable, uncontrollable and unrepeatable.\n Most of the people involved in these 'humanistic' sciences will disagree with you on that one. Also isn't that last statement more or less just saying 'free will exists'?\n \n\n So, the knowledge we search for in these areas of what we can generally call Science consists in deciphering the motivations behind human events, in analysing the results of those events and in proposing abstract premises (concepts) that can help us comprehend the entirety of what the human creature does. So, the phrase given by Occam's Razor (\"if you can't tell the difference between your existing system and one with a load of other unproven assumptions in it, you can reject those assumptions as unnecessary\") is not applicable to these areas of knowledge, because the susceptibility of \"assumptions\" to be proved or not is irrelevant. In a few words: knowledge in the humanistic sciences is essentially not provable, that is precisely the delineation that separates both areas of Science (empirical sciences from humanistic sciences), and that gives sense to both.\n Again I disagree, here Occam's razor is essential because you don't have something to measure, all you can do is use logic to eliminate unessary steps. As in the pool table example, I know that things usually follow certain rules but I can not know if the pool ball will or not and I don't have anything to use to measure any factors. All I have are a lot of examples of other similar things that I can measure or have done in the past and the massive overarching trend seems to be that things do stuff because something makes them. It is less of an assumption to assume that this unmeasurable thing will follow the trend that to assume it is unique. \n \n \n\n Then, above all other sciences, we have what we call Philosophy, which is the generalised and comprehensive study of all objects (physical and not) and the study of knowledge itself, and whose methods are a mixture (or are, rather, the parent) of the methods used in the other two \"daughter\" branches.\n This distinction of human knowledge has been constant in all the history of Western thought, so if you are going to discredit it, I hope you use well substantiated arguments, after all, I think it makes a lot of sense.\n \n We have to be careful to avoid just ending up in soliphism here, especially as you seem to see a continous transition toward philosophy from science whilst I would say that there is a significant gap between modern science and philosophy (which is a bit ironic given our usual positions on things), or at least the sort of 'high philosophy' that deals with the slightly more nebulous domain of ideals and concepts rather than the logic type that seems more or less maths. I'm having some problem discribing the difference, so forgive the poor analogy but philosophy (logic) + observation = science in the same way that flour + water = bread. Neither observations or philosophy alone make science any more than water is bread even though that both may be vital components of it.\n \n Logic has no problem with; \n All cats are over 50 feet high\n All things over 50 high consume worlds\n Therefore all cats consume worlds.\n \n Logically, there is nothing wrong with that chain of statements in isolation. Only when we observe cats and see that the assumptions we have made are wrong do we get science, likewise if we have seen one cat then without any logic to put this to any use (whether speculating that there might be more cats, or that cats will look vaguely like this), we have just seen a cat.\n \n All that aside, I'll try to work within your idea of philosophy from here on, its going to get silly if each debate requires another debate before it. Then again, what is and isn't philosophy might be interesting...\n \n \n \n \n Given this distinction, which is fundamental, I think we can begin to define free will, which, as Tastyfish has already made clear, cannot be proven through the \"scientific method\". However, the fact that the concept of free will is recurrent in all the history of human knowledge must mean that there is some truth behind it (otherwise we would be saying that the people who speak of free will have been completely wrong and stupid for the past 6,000 or so years). \n Dragons have had a fairly decent run too, in different cultures as well - however even if we take into account that they may have been influenced by very early discoveries of dinosaurs (which seems unnessary given the existance of griffons, unicorns or shoggoths), they are very different from the common representation in various cultures art (as chinese, aztec or western dragons)\n \n\n So, this leads us logically to the idea that, perhaps, free will is a concept which falls within the competence of the sciences we call humanistic, and which deal with all human phenomena which are not strictly physical (of course, free will is not a tangible object).\n I've mentioned my problem with this but for now, fair enough.\n \n\n Having said this, we can begin to define the different categories at hand. In human affairs, things do not happen following a cause-effect scheme, saying this would be like saying that the behaviour of humans is equivalent to the response a chemical will give when put in contact with another (in other words, ALWAYS and INEXORABLY predictable), and this is wrong. Like I said, human events are not predictable, not because we don't have knowledge of all the factors going on, but because human action is essentially unpredictable: it is essentially free.\n Just because you brough chemicals up - this is a massive oversimplification. As you are comparing a multifactorial event to one something so much simpler - even with your example two chemicals will only react under set conditions. Wood doesn't burn except at a certain temperature, to ignore the conditions that caused wood to burn and declare that 'whether wood will burn or not is essentially unpredictable' is clearly wrong. \n \n \n\n Given a cause and effect scheme, the existence of civilisation and culture as a whole would make absolutely no sense, because culture is much more than the means humans use to survive in the world, it is the means we have to advance in ourselves: find knowledge, create art, communicate ideas, etc. However, the fact that these phenomena exist makes it logical to think that human action has never been a mere response to foreign stimuli, it is much more than this.\n Books have been written in response to issues such as slavery, women's rights etc. Not to mention that finding knowledge and creating ideas are two things that are our means of surviving in the world. Art and creativity is complicated, and not directly related to free will. Whilst a child's drawing of a bird may look very different from the object it is trying to copy, it is an attempt to replicate the image it sees. Does this mean its not art, because the mona lisa is not a huge step away from that child's drawing in theory. Different styles of painting after often even said to be a response to previous styles.\n \n Surely you see that the world we live in is very complex and not only are you receiving very complicated stimuli under a very specific set of conditions but in addition because of memory, past experiences are also being included in the whole equation. \n Because of these huge range of possible responses and stimuli and the fact people will respond to other people's responses its not suprising that some unusual things come out of this mass of information and interactions. \n \n \n \n\n Now, concerning the brain, I think your idea that \"the brain is responsible for human thinking and is a physical thing that follows the stimulus - response idea\" is not complete. Well, of course the brain is responsible for human thinking, this is obvious. However, the fact that we don't understand the brain very much (we know too little of it, I think, to use it as a fully satisfactory argument) means that the existence of free will, and of other phenomena like intuitive reason are as yet not understood by scientists. The fact they are not understood, obviously, does not necessarily mean they do not exist (the knowledge of this comes mainly from the distinction between the two branches of Science I made above). The fact that the brain responds to stimulus - response is significant, yes, after all, it is a physical object subjected to the laws of physics, chemistry and biology. However, the processes that go on in the brain are so unknown to us, that to say that thought is a mere response to a stimulus is, I think, very daring. And to say that the concrete content of thought is the response to stimuli is simply outrageous. The content of thought is whimsical: we create our own thoughts out of our own free will.\n Something you might want to read up on is something called Emergance, its how very complicated and diverse systems can come out of a very simple set of instructions which need have no real bearing on the eventual result. It explains how something like thought could come out of the brain, in the same way a ant colony can respond to things that an individual ant can not, how mindless things like slime moulds can navigate mazes and how cities tend to organise themselves. \n \n The trouble with what your last statement is saying is that clearly, to some degree whether we have free will or not, our actions are heavily influenced by the conditions at hand and our past experiences. It is undeniable that there is a very heavily deterministic part to our behaviour even if you take instinct completely out of the equation. Why must there be something else as well, especially if that thing doesn't operate like anything else we ever come into contact with? In our experience free will seems to be limited by choices, in most situations where we say we have a choice the vast array of other irrelevant actions seem to be removed. \n \n If I am offered a job that involves moving away from my family I will consider whether the benefits of the new job outwiegh having to move away from my family. Pretending to be a hippo, or attempting to consume my own feet are within my range of possible actions but some process seems to be elimnating these, surely if just free will is involved then I should be contemplating all my actions (I think Satre said something along these lines), and if we totally leave out any determinism I am left with no way of differentiating between them. \n \n Free will can not exist alone seperate from the physical actions of the brain, and how can something physical interact with something that is not? Unless we are talking patterns, in which case the term physical becomes somewhat confusing, but emergance doesn't get you out of determinism, far from it.\n \n \n \n With respect to the question about omniscience and free will, they are not contradictory. I will use the example of God, which is fitting for this issue. God is an omniscient being, He knows everything that has been, that is and that will come to be. This infinite knowledge comes from two of God's characteristics: He is timeless, so the distinction of what is, what was and what will be does not exist for Him. For God, everything is now, there is no such thing as time, because time itself is of God's creation, and so separate from Him. Secondly, we come to omniscience itself; God knows everything because he is God, simply put. He is the beginning and end of all things, and the workings of everything are known to Him from eternity.\n Ok, this all follows, Omnipresent + timeless = Omniscient. \n \n\n Now, the fact that God knows everything does not mean that people's lives are predestined. If this was so, then it would be meaningless to sin, because all actions would be a mere interpretation of the greater scheme of things that has already been decided, and so, in truth, there would be no goodness or badness, simply action.\n No, sin is irrelevant to God's omniscience. The problem here is with sin if your previous section on God is correct. Its similar to our 50ft world consuming cat example - by looking at sin, we have suddenly observed a cat. \n We now have two options - either there is some flaw in the previous assumptions, or what we are looking at now is unrelated to the previous statements. In feline terms, either cats are not all 50ft high or what we saw is not a cat - we can not have both.\n \n I'm going to leave you're second section of God there is that's ok and address the issue of 'sin' and determinism because it was bound to come up eventually. Ok, thats actually a lie because I'm going to define sin here as a 'religious wrong' and focus more on the results of sin and more mundane offenses, essentially a sin is just an offense that will be judged and punished by God rather than a court. \n \n The lack of personal responsibility and therefore the injustice of punishment comes up a lot in these arguments, if someone commits a crime out of nessesity (such as injuring someone in self defense) or by accident we will tend to be more lenient that someone who commits the same crime on purpose. However if we take free will out of the equation then all three of these crimes have resulted in the same result, and all were destined to happen and there is nothing anyone involved could have done to alter this, including the criminal. The mistake here is to then class all three events as accidents and punish all three indentically as it fails to take into account that the threat of this punishment is a stimulus that will influence later actions. \n \n Same could be true with God, the punishments for sin are not for in some way inconvenicing or offending God but really in order to provide the nessesary stimulus to get people to generally behave themselves and be nice to others. Its not perfect, but I don't think anyone can claim that all the various logical issues with god as he is claimed to be by his followers all work out. Infact I would say that pretty much everyone disagrees with at least someone else's claims about god. \n \n The thing to remember is that these claims are more likely to be incorrect than the logic, this example of sin and attributes of God is one. Essentially, sin is probably a little different than you have defined it, or God isn't totally 100% omniscient\n \n If its ok with you I'm going to ignore quantum and animals for now, I think I would be repeating a lot of points. We can come back to this once we've brought out views on the previous topics inline, should have said thats what I thought would be the plan...just setting out a set of issues I saw that we would settle and them move to the next\n \n\n On a spiritual level, predestination makes life pointless and God arbitrary.\nLife has whatever meaning you give it, nothing more nor does it need anything more.",

Mathematics are used as a means to comprehend the greater scheme of things with which Economics is concerned, which is a mainly social question. So, Economics is not at all \"based on fitting mathematical formulae and creating models\", these are a means for understanding the true economic questions, which deal with much more profound issues than any mathematical model can address. So, what you call \"the only philosophical parts\" that you say are \"based around what level of significance is necessary and determining which models are more accurate\", are the true core of what the science of Economics is, not only knowing calculus and statistics, but being able to interpret and give meaning to those models. Otherwise, any mathematician would also be an economist. Sociology is the same (being an even less mathematical discipline).\n \n Law is a very scientific discipline. The development of Law is profoundly logical and rational (in fact, there is a very legal way of reasoning which is taught expressly in law schools). Of course, Law is also an art, because it deals with persons in very fundamental terms, and its formulation and even its evolution could also be called a dimension of art. History is much more than checking archaeological evidence for its veracity. I know many historians who would tremble when told History is \"all about analysing evidence, determining how accurate that evidence is and drawing conclusions off it.\" History is also an art, because what you refer to as \"drawing conclusions\" is not like seeing what colour a chemical takes when poured into some other substance. It is a very philosophical, sociological and even psychological task, and the greatest historians are the ones who can understand a past society even with the slightest evidence (for example, our current knowledge of Homeric Greece or of primitive Rome).\n \n \n Most of the people involved in these 'humanistic' sciences will disagree with you on that one. Also isn't that last statement more or less just saying 'free will exists'? \n\n \n I am one of those persons involved in the \"humanistic\" sciences, and I can assure you more of my colleagues than you know would agree with me. The distinction between both branches of Science is so fundamental it gives sense to human knowledge itself. And, more than this being like saying free will exists, I think it is more like a statement that expresses an evident reality (ask any historian).\n \n \n Again I disagree, here Occam's razor is essential because you don't have something to measure, all you can do is use logic to eliminate unessary steps. As in the pool table example, I know that things usually follow certain rules but I can not know if the pool ball will or not and I don't have anything to use to measure any factors. All I have are a lot of examples of other similar things that I can measure or have done in the past and the massive overarching trend seems to be that things do stuff because something makes them. It is less of an assumption to assume that this unmeasurable thing will follow the trend that to assume it is unique. \n\n \n Occam's Razor is wrong, because the determination of whether those steps are \"unnecessary\" or not cannot be based on whether or not they can be proved. In the humanistic sciences, many assumptions are made based on what, scientifically, is an unproven question (for example, many of the fundamental pillars of the science of Law are not provable, such as what we call bona fides (in the Continental legal system) in private law, the idea that human rights are inherent to the human person or the concept of sovereignty in public law, etc.). This doesn't make these sciences less reliable, because the areas of reality they study are beyond the physical (and thus provable) facets. Also, this is why many of these sciences don't try to predict anything, because that is not their competence or interest (the case of Law, or History, or Anthropology).\n \n Your pool table example is inadequate, because it is a physical phenomenon, not a phenomenon like those studied by these sciences. The fact that you don't have anything to use to measure the factors at hand in the pool table doesn't mean that those factors aren't measurable. In the humanistic sciences we don't measure like you do in the physical sciences because there are no measurable factors, to attempt a scientific measure would be an elementary error in method.\n \n \n We have to be careful to avoid just ending up in soliphism here, especially as you seem to see a continous transition toward philosophy from science whilst I would say that there is a significant gap between modern science and philosophy (which is a bit ironic given our usual positions on things), or at least the sort of 'high philosophy' that deals with the slightly more nebulous domain of ideals and concepts rather than the logic type that seems more or less maths. I'm having some problem discribing the difference, so forgive the poor analogy but philosophy (logic) + observation = science in the same way that flour + water = bread. Neither observations or philosophy alone make science any more than water is bread even though that both may be vital components of it.\n \n Logic has no problem with; \n All cats are over 50 feet high\n All things over 50 high consume worlds\n Therefore all cats consume worlds.\n \n Logically, there is nothing wrong with that chain of statements in isolation. Only when we observe cats and see that the assumptions we have made are wrong do we get science, likewise if we have seen one cat then without any logic to put this to any use (whether speculating that there might be more cats, or that cats will look vaguely like this), we have just seen a cat.\n \n All that aside, I'll try to work within your idea of philosophy from here on, its going to get silly if each debate requires another debate before it. Then again, what is and isn't philosophy might be interesting... \n\n \n I agree with you, philosophy + observation = science. I couldn't have said it more succinctly. However, what you call observation in the physical sciences is different from what we observe in the humanistic ones. For example, in Chemistry, we observe physical phenomena that occur at molecular levels in the diverse substances we know of. In Law, we observe reality, and, using what you have called philosophy, we determine what is just. That determination of justice is a scientific conclusion in Law, which is perfectly valid. The process is legally scientific (because it deals with knowledge and follows a method), and it is also artistic (because it deals with questions that affect the core of the human experience).\n \n Your example of the cats is faulted. Logic does have a problem with your example, because you are parting from a false premise. Logic makes absolutely no sense as a scientific method at all if it is abused.\n \n Anyway, I agree with you, let's stick to the question of free will (too bad I didn't read this part of your thread before I had written all this...).\n \n \n Dragons have had a fairly decent run too, in different cultures as well - however even if we take into account that they may have been influenced by very early discoveries of dinosaurs (which seems unnessary given the existance of griffons, unicorns or shoggoths), they are very different from the common representation in various cultures art (as chinese, aztec or western dragons). \n\n \n What? What does this have to do with what I sad? I'm talking about the history of human knowledge, not about whatever foolishness people have believed at any given time. Dragons are a question of popular legend and myth, free will is a question that has been dealt with by philosophers and thinkers, on a completely different category.\n \n \n Just because you brough chemicals up - this is a massive oversimplification. As you are comparing a multifactorial event to one something so much simpler - even with your example two chemicals will only react under set conditions. Wood doesn't burn except at a certain temperature, to ignore the conditions that caused wood to burn and declare that 'whether wood will burn or not is essentially unpredictable' is clearly wrong. \n\n \n Well, this is like your examples of dragons and pool tables, and 50 feet cats. Instead of questioning the example, address the issue I spoke of.\n \n \n Books have been written in response to issues such as slavery, women's rights etc. Not to mention that finding knowledge and creating ideas are two things that are our means of surviving in the world. Art and creativity is complicated, and not directly related to free will. Whilst a child's drawing of a bird may look very different from the object it is trying to copy, it is an attempt to replicate the image it sees. Does this mean its not art, because the mona lisa is not a huge step away from that child's drawing in theory. Different styles of painting after often even said to be a response to previous styles. \n\n \n Books have been written in response to issues? Then why hasn't every literate person in history written books about every single issue they were ever faced with? Books were written in response to questions, but the content of those books, the way they were written, the opinions expressed, the position of the words, the literary style used, etc., were not a response to factors, they are a product of free will. Otherwise, art would be a mere physical product of a series of factors that come together over any person at any given time, and so art would have no value as art, but merely as a fascinating composition of physical factors that produced a fascinating composition of physical factors.\n \n So, art is directly related to free will, it is the highest expression of the existence and beauty of free will. Its absolute non-functionality, its uniqueness, its ability to hit the core of what the human creature is, this is all an expression of a creation that comes from a human mind that is free and concerned with the world.\n \n The Mona Lisa is light years away from a child's drawing. Of course, from a psychiatric or scientific point of view, perhaps art is seen as a mere product, whose complexity comes from the degree of development of the artist's mind. However, art is not this merely, it has value as something separate from the mind of its creator, this is the place where it takes on all the sense and complexity it can have. A child's drawing is nothing more than an attempt to reproduce reality. The Mona Lisa is a very profound meditation about the human condition. The meaning, value and beauty of art transcends both the mind of its creator and the physical reality in which it is expressed.\n \n \n Surely you see that the world we live in is very complex and not only are you receiving very complicated stimuli under a very specific set of conditions but in addition because of memory, past experiences are also being included in the whole equation. \n Because of these huge range of possible responses and stimuli and the fact people will respond to other people's responses its not suprising that some unusual things come out of this mass of information and interactions. \n\n \n Of course life is complex. I'm not saying that stimuli produce no effect on our actions, this obvious, as Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset put it, \"I am me and my circumstances\". This is true, however, your position would end up stating that our personality, our very own self is nothing more than a production of the outside world, and so there is nothing really authentic, nothing truly personal about anything that we are, do, say, express... This is false, personality, humanity itself, presuppose the existence of a core upon which all these stimuli act, that core is the \"me\", which expresses itself only through its own free will.\n \n \n Something you might want to read up on is something called Emergance, its how very complicated and diverse systems can come out of a very simple set of instructions which need have no real bearing on the eventual result. It explains how something like thought could come out of the brain, in the same way a ant colony can respond to things that an individual ant can not, how mindless things like slime moulds can navigate mazes and how cities tend to organise themselves. \n\n \n I looked up Emergance on the Internet, but found nothing. It sounds very interesting, maybe you could give me a reliable site to read about it?\n \n \n The trouble with what your last statement is saying is that clearly, to some degree whether we have free will or not, our actions are heavily influenced by the conditions at hand and our past experiences. It is undeniable that there is a very heavily deterministic part to our behaviour even if you take instinct completely out of the equation. Why must there be something else as well, especially if that thing doesn't operate like anything else we ever come into contact with? In our experience free will seems to be limited by choices, in most situations where we say we have a choice the vast array of other irrelevant actions seem to be removed. \n\n \n Well, because free will is not merely about choices, it is about the design of one's own life, and so is deeply connected with the person's very identity. Your free will extends not only to your choice of steak over chicken, it is the capability we all have of designing our own personalities, the very core of whom we are. This is fundamental. I said it above, if free will doesn't exist at this level, then people are a mere production of the environment, and have no value or distinction at the personal level than any other creature or object in the universe. In this case, if there is no personal, unique core, to each person, then why not murder half of the world's population so we can have more food and space? After all, they are mere products of history... The following generations will fill the gap in their own right, like eggs coming out of an ant queen, already set by their circumstances to be what history says they should be. This is a very profound position, but I think it is incorrect, because it leaves out the very thing that makes us people, our individuality, our uniqueness as individuals - our \"personness\", if you will.\n \n \n If I am offered a job that involves moving away from my family I will consider whether the benefits of the new job outwiegh having to move away from my family. Pretending to be a hippo, or attempting to consume my own feet are within my range of possible actions but some process seems to be elimnating these, surely if just free will is involved then I should be contemplating all my actions (I think Satre said something along these lines), and if we totally leave out any determinism I am left with no way of differentiating between them. \n\n \n Sartre spoke of the absurdity of the human condition. He said there is no God, no afterlife, and so (simplifying), there is no true meaning to human life. We have been dropped into the world with nothing bout our freedom, in an illogical, absurd situation of absolute meaningless, and so, he said that we are \"condemned to be free\". As you can see, Sartre's entire system is based on the existence of free will.\n \n However, I agree with you, as I said before, the existence of free will doesn't exclude the influence of external stimuli and circumstances (I refer back to the quote of Ortega y Gasset). However, the base of the person is that free will, and so that is why we always say that \"the choice is ultimately in your hands\". Even if you were to be offered one billion dollars a day for doing nothing to move away from your family, you could reject that offer and stay home, and it would be a free choice. \n \n \n Free will can not exist alone seperate from the physical actions of the brain, and how can something physical interact with something that is not? Unless we are talking patterns, in which case the term physical becomes somewhat confusing, but emergance doesn't get you out of determinism, far from it. \n\n \n I agree, free will interacts with the external world and the physical actions of the brain, but it the base of action.\n \n \n No, sin is irrelevant to God's omniscience. The problem here is with sin if your previous section on God is correct. Its similar to our 50ft world consuming cat example - by looking at sin, we have suddenly observed a cat. \n We now have two options - either there is some flaw in the previous assumptions, or what we are looking at now is unrelated to the previous statements. In feline terms, either cats are not all 50ft high or what we saw is not a cat - we can not have both. \n\n \n Sin is absolutely not irrelevant to God's omniscience. The fact that God knows sin and permits it to happen is an excellent argument in favour of free will. Otherwise, God's omniscience would be irrelevant to us and our actions. God knows EVERYTHING, not just the temporary succession of events, but also the value of those events. He makes judgements of those events, and sees some as good, and some as bad. The criteria to see something as good or as bad is to compare it with the nature of things and of God himself. This is a fundamental pillar of Christianity, otherwise, the world would be little more than a fun machine for God to play with. We are parts of His creation, but we are his image on Earth, and so, are free, the fact that we are is what gives sense to sin, to judgement, to goodness and badness.\n \n \n The lack of personal responsibility and therefore the injustice of punishment comes up a lot in these arguments, if someone commits a crime out of nessesity (such as injuring someone in self defense) or by accident we will tend to be more lenient that someone who commits the same crime on purpose. However if we take free will out of the equation then all three of these crimes have resulted in the same result, and all were destined to happen and there is nothing anyone involved could have done to alter this, including the criminal. The mistake here is to then class all three events as accidents and punish all three indentically as it fails to take into account that the threat of this punishment is a stimulus that will influence later actions. \n\n \n This does not make sense, because it leads to absolute relativism. If we punish a murderer for killing because we want to make an example of him, then that means that, if society changes in the future, killing could be seen as a neutral action, or even as something good. Also, punishing someone for killing to make an example of him leaves the entire question of law itself without meaning. Law regulates the rights and duties of persons in society, and although criminal law has a purpose of protecting society from wrongdoers, the objective is not just social peace, but also the protection of the rights and duties of each individual person (including their right to life), and, ultimately, of each individual person as well. To make an example out of someone is to instrumentalise the person, use him as a means for a goal, and this is completely contrary to the very founding principles of what Law is: an affirmation of the value of the HUMAN PERSON in society, and thus, of the worthiness of an effective defence of that person, and of his rights and duties. When we use a person as a means for something, we attack that idea that we must protect the person, because if we don't protect one person (the killer) for the sake of society, then we destroy the foundations and the legitimacy of Law.\n \n Besides, I think your idea of making examples of people is a bit totalitarian, regardless of the effectiveness of its results.\n \n \n Same could be true with God, the punishments for sin are not for in some way inconvenicing or offending God but really in order to provide the nessesary stimulus to get people to generally behave themselves and be nice to others. Its not perfect, but I don't think anyone can claim that all the various logical issues with god as he is claimed to be by his followers all work out. Infact I would say that pretty much everyone disagrees with at least someone else's claims about god. \n\n \n Obviously, with God it makes even less sense than with the other example. God values each person for themselves. There is no justice in condemning someone to an eternity of suffering, just to make others be nice. In reality, we would be forcing that person to sacrifice themselves for the other's salvation, and although that is a very commendable action (it is what Jesus Christ did), we cannot be forced to do this, and it would leave the entire system without meaning.",

   "Going to do this in smaller posts to break up the whole thing a bit, before these posts get even bigger.\n \n As for the sciences debate it seems that Spain and the UK have very different ideas about the nature of these subjects and the approachs they use. Psychologist can't prescribe medicine for the same reason the scientists who actually design and create the drugs in the first place can't. It has nothing to do with the field of study and more the type of qualification.\n \n As for cats, with no observations how can it be known if this is a false premise? Soon as we see a cat we know that the statements are just incorrect, but until then we don't and just have to accept the statements as being internally consistant...anyway onto the matter at hand.\n \n Sorry, its Emergence, with an e. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence as a starting point, it references the book I mentioned.\n \n \nHowever, the fact that the concept of free will is recurrent in all the history of human knowledge must mean that there is some truth behind it (otherwise we would be saying that the people who speak of free will have been completely wrong and stupid for the past 6,000 or so years). \n The existance of angels and demons has been considered by many thinkers, as has the various aspects of God. The concept of 'Gods' has cropped up many times and been beleived and discussed by the same people considering free will. Do I think we can use this as evidence for God? No, however it might tell us something about how the human brain works. Free will is an obvious topic whether it exists or not, things appear to follow cause and effect but if you oversimplify that and try to apply it to human behaviour you will find it raises various issues. Add in religious dogma as well and its an obvious problem due to the paradoxs caused by various articles of faith, even without it as soon as a societies justice system starts taking into account extenuating circumstances you are going to end up asking free will questions. \n \n \nHaving said this, we can begin to define the different categories at hand. In human affairs, things do not happen following a cause-effect scheme, saying this would be like saying that the behaviour of humans is equivalent to the response a chemical will give when put in contact with another (in other words, ALWAYS and INEXORABLY predictable), and this is wrong. Like I said, human events are not predictable, not because we don't have knowledge of all the factors going on, but because human action is essentially unpredictable: it is essentially free. \n \n ...Instead of questioning the example, address the issue I spoke of.\n\n There isn't an issue you speak of, that is why I pointed out why your example is wrong. Human behaviour is to an extent predictable when the conditions are identical or at least very familiar - the issue here is that you can't get indentical conditions because of memory. I don't see where you can get 'human events are not predictable, not because we don't have knowledge of all the factors going on, but because human action is essentially unpredictable: it is essentially free' from without just assuming free will exists and therefore this unpredictability is due to free will, therefore proving the existance of free will. Determinism says the you will get exactly the same thing, you don't know all the factors involved so you can not predict with a high degree of accuracy. \n Humans are hard to predict because the situations are very complex and more or less unique to each circumstance. The fact they arn't 100% unpredictable in similar cases (say children who are abused will tend to abuse in the future, certain symbols will resonate with people of a particular demographic) surely points us to the idea that the unpredicability might be more because people aren't identical rather than there being some inherant freedom.\n \n \nBooks have been written in response to issues? Then why hasn't every literate person in history written books about every single issue they were ever faced with? \n This is clearly a strawman, or at least a massive simplification of the deterministic approach. It requires a specific set of stimuli to get someone to write a book, art and books are not the automatic response to any stimuli. Its like saying if Art is the true representation of free will, then why do people with free will do anything but art all the time? \n If its ok with you I think that this might be a good topic to leave out for the time being, art is tricky enough as it is without getting it involved in another debate - whether art is in the mind of the creator or the beholder etc. Some would say that the Mona Lisa is not so much a 'very profound meditation about the human condition' but originally just a portrait. It became more through its later fame and in the mind of the observers, even then to some people its just a famous picture of a woman.\n \n I'll leave this here for now and reply to some of the other points later, unless you had any issues that you think are particularly important?",

   "I looked up Emergance on the Internet, but found nothing. \n\n \n That may be simply because it's spelt emergence.\n \n Emergence is an aspect of chaos theory, which is a fairly new science (originating in the late 70s) which has required new maths to deal with, but is mathematically sound and backed up by observation.\n \n In simple terms, chaos theory is the based on the proven observation that in any sufficiently complex system, specific predictions about details of that system's behaviour become impossible (not just very difficuly, but literally impossible) to make; the only way of describing such systems is in terms of large-scale patterns which repeat, but are different every time. \n \n Examples of these kinds of system which, having been studied, gave rise to chaos theory are stock market fluctuations, wild animal populations, weather patterns, turbulence, snowflake formation, heart rhythms, and the fractal patterns (patterns self-similar at all scales) found everywhere in nature.\n \n Emergence deals with this non-predictability factor; even when we know everything about all the individual aspects of a system, we find that when we look at the system as a whole, we find new, emergent properties on large scales which cannot be explained by our knowledge of individual aspects. Complex systems become more than the sum of their parts. Chaos gives rise to order, but not the order we'd expect. One extremely exciting example of emergence's use is that it should be able, eventually, to explain how that one cell that we all start out as contains all the information to grow our hugely complex bodies.\n \n Chaos and emergence are everywhere in nature; the only reason it wasn't discovered earlier was because since the time of Newton, scientists have been enthusiastically creating a huge body of work based on analysing cause-and-effect, looking at smaller and smaller scales to discover the influences behind any given phenomena. It is only after centuries of this that we have found that there is a glaring disparity between explanations at small and large scales, the sheer strangeness of quantum theory being the best example of this.\n \n How does all this relate to the question of free will? I hope this is already fairly obvious from my brief explanations above, but the central observation of chaos theory is that even quite simple deterministic systems give rise to unpredictable behaviour. The human brain is the most complex ordered arrangement of matter that we know exists. \n \n Doyne Farmer, a colleague of Robert Stetson Shaw, godfather of chaos theory, sums it up like this:\n \n \"On a philosophical level, [chaos] struck me as an operational way to define free will, in a way that allowed you to reconcile free will with determinism. The system is deterministic, but you can't say what it's going to do next.\"\n \n While this in no way resolves the philosophical problem of free will, I think it does shed a new and exciting light on the subject. One of the problems with arguments about free will tends to be that most people think that if we fully understood the brain, we would find it to be conclusively either deterministic or unpredictable. Chaos theory suggests that our minds are both.",

   "\"There is nothing that human beings do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics\".

Not just unpredictable in terms of vast arrays of probabilities of outcomes, but literally unpredictable; we have no way of knowing what they will do next. \n \n Emergent properties can only be described in detail after the fact, and they can only be predicted to occur once a pattern has been established, and even then the prediction can only be that \"something like what we've seen before\" will happen: repeating patterns of emergent behaviour are never, ever, identical. \n \n For example, if you knew the geometry of every snowflake that has ever existed in chronological order, you still wouldn't be able to predict what form the next one would take.\n \n The Feynman quote only states that we can understand humans from a determinist perspective, not that we can predict what one will do.

   "The argument rests solely on the unproven assumption that the past controls the future. This must be proven before anything else in the argument can follow.\n\n \n \nEvery event is the upshot of antecedent causes. The state of the world at any moment is the result of its state immediately before and evolves from that preceding state in accordance with the unchanging laws of nature.\n \n Isn't this how the past controls the present and future? Perhaps that's not a 'proof' and only a belief, but can you prove the contrary?\n\n \n While it's not proof, it's certainly evidence that the past controls the future and is a very good way of putting it: We have observed that \"The state of the world at any moment is the result of its state immediately before and evolves from that preceding state\", we observe it all the time in chemistry and physics.\n We have no reason to believe that this cause-and-effect pattern does not exist, even in the past or In The Beginning. Surely Occam's Razor requires us to ignore this more complicated assumption, for which we have no evidence? \n \n \nFirstly, we don't know that everything in the observable universe requires a cause. That is a hypothesis. It is in fact the basis for scientific hypotheses and therefore cannot be proven scientifically itself.\n\n \n The concept of cause-and-effect is more than just a hypothesis, it is a theory with evidence; the scientific method is based on the observation that while myths and mysticism might be imaginative and exciting, recording what we observe and then recording what happens next and making logical (preferably mathematical) connections between the events is the most efficient way of providing explanations, and crucially of providing accurate predictions. \n I can't help but find it amusing that while we associate prophecy with religion or astrology or psychic powers, we can make countless 'prophecies' with science and see them happen in front of our very eyes.\n \n The unproven assumption in Alan Ryan's argument is\n \n \nSo, you can't control the present or the future.\n\n \n This is circular. If we assume we can't control, or affect, the future we are already assuming determinism; conversely if we assume we have free will we would assume that we can control the future, or at least have an effect on it as well as the effect of prior influences.",

I think it is pretty relevant to what you are saying.\n\n I did fail to address your question because I was trying to bring the 'essence' of determinism into focus: but I will try to answer you now. \n \n I think your objection to my 'heavy duty determinism' can be paraphrased as follows:\n \n Even if my decision or action is directly caused by and linked into an indefinitely long chain of other causes, it can often be true that I could have chosen otherwise. \n \n If we accept this 'compatibilism' of freedom with determinism, then it follows that, because I could have chosen otherwise, I can be held responsible for what I did choose. Previous events that shaped my choice are then irrelevant. I do not find this argument convincing.\n \n But since freedom (I have alleged) seems to be incompatible with causation, is the concept of freedom itself coherent? \n \n Well, there seems to be a way out that preserves the idea that everything happens by necessity with the freedom to choose. It goes something like this:\n \n If we describe as 'free' only those actions that originate in the agent, then only God is really free. But we could distinguish between those events we understand and those events we do not.

   "Maybe I should clarify what I was criticising about your argument:\n \n \nOK, I'm taking sides and speaking up for determinism. \n \n Here's a very old argument:\n \n The past controls the present and future.\n\n \n Agreed - observation of cause and effect.\n \n \nYou can't control the past.\n\n \n Agreed - the past is lost to us forever.\n \n \nAlso, you can't control the way the past controls the present and future.\n\n \n Agreed - logically follows from the previous statement.\n \n \nSo, you can't control the present or the future.\n\n \n This statement assumes that nothing but the past has any effect on the future, thereby assuming that we have no free will. The whole question of whether or not we have free will relates to asking \"Can we, as apparently free, conscious beings, affect the future in the same way that deterministic causes do?\"\n \n \nIn fact, you can't control anything at all, past, present, or future.\n\n \n While we can't affect the past, because we don't know if free will is real or an illusion, we don't know if our actions in the present are truly, or just percieved, choices. \n To just expand on the idea of the 'future', it can be argued that it is a misleading concept. The present is all that exists, moment to moment; the past exists in our memories and we 'know' that it did exist when it was the present. The future does not exist at all, there is just the continual procession of the momentary present.\n \n If your argument rests on the word 'control' being taken literally, then I have to agree; we cannot hope to shape the future specifically; even if free will is real, we cannot know all the implications of our actions, especially when they interact with the effects of others' actions.\n \n But we do not need to be able to control the future for free will to be real, so your argument does not need to be \"demolished [to] restore human freedom\" (post #316), because it never threatens human freedom.\n \n We only need to know that our actions affect the future, and if we accept cause-and-effect, we have to accept that they do. But the question remains, \"When we affect the future through our actions, can we tell whether or not we freely make choices about our intentions in regards to those effects?\" The answer is we can't. But we do know, at every moment, what our intentions are.\n \n \nto the extent that the causes of our actions are adequately understood, we are free or responsible in that limited sense. This freedom of choice is a matter of degree.\n\n \n I can only refer to my own life experience here; I won't go into specifics, but there have been decisions I have made that I regret, and now being a little older and a little (hopefully) wiser, I understand the reasons behind the aspects of my personality that influenced those bad decisions. \n \n When I have been faced with decisions in a similar context, I have thought to myself, \"No, if you do that you'll regret it, because you did that last time and you regretted it.\" Obviously this seems deterministic, but at the time, in the moment of decision, I know I could have gone either way, although of course I can never prove this.\n \n But the fact that some people keep making the same mistakes even when they know why they make those mistakes, and know what they have to do to prevent them, and some people change, suggests to me that there are degrees of freedom. Your personality is shaped by every moment of life, and I think the older you get the less you can change it, or the harder it is to change, but in addition to outside influences we all know within ourselves that we can change if we really want to. The specific moment of making that decision to better oneself and acting upon it is for me, the best evidence that the mind is not wholly deterministic. \n \n I know this argument is not very sound and is entirely subjective, but my life has given me great faith in the power of the mind to deliberately shape itself, and the self-referential complexity of the mind seems to be too much for purely deterministic factors to account for.",

   "\n The whole question of whether or not we have free will relates to asking \"Can we, as apparently free, conscious beings, affect the future in the same way that deterministic causes do?\"\n\n Free will is incompatible with human freedom.

But we do know, at every moment, what our intentions are.\n\n If you agree that every event must have a cause and that causes determine their effects because they are joined to them by universal laws, then what we decide now is determined by the necessity of previous causes. There is no escape from this necessity, and therefore the exercise of free will is an illusion. \n \n You object that if the outcome of a situation depends on my choice, then I'm free. But do I have any choice in present circumstances?\n \n Of course, we imagine that we do. If I choose X when I could have chosen otherwise (Y, Z, etc.), then it appears that my free will is being consciously exercised. Some future state seems to depend on what I decide.\n \n However, whatever I choose, could I have so chosen freely? Once a question about the choice leading to an action is raised, we seem to initiate a regress.\n \n So there is some kind of conflict between our belief in free will and our knowledge of causes. Common sense suggests that the more we know of the circumstances, the less we are inclined to attribute the responsibility that a free agent would deserve. (There is a French proverb to the effect that to know everything is to forgive everything.)\n \n \nI can only refer to my own life experience here; I won't go into specifics, but there have been decisions I have made that I regret, and now being a little older and a little (hopefully) wiser, I understand the reasons behind the aspects of my personality that influenced those bad decisions. \n \n When I have been faced with decisions in a similar context, I have thought to myself, \"No, if you do that you'll regret it, because you did that last time and you regretted it.\" Obviously this seems deterministic, but at the time, in the moment of decision, I know I could have gone either way, although of course I can never prove this.\n \n But the fact that some people keep making the same mistakes even when they know why they make those mistakes, and know what they have to do to prevent them, and some people change, suggests to me that there are degrees of freedom.

This means a person could be described as acting freely if it was possible to do otherwise in the right sense. (i.e. by taking true knowledge and understanding into account). \n \n An alternative position is to argue that nothing in our concept of freedom denies determinism. In this case, the idea of freedom arises when we attribute the consequences of an action to an agent by means of praise or blame.\n \n I do not like the idea that determinism eliminates human freedom.

From a scientific point of view, one would say that our minds are entirely defined by the functioning of our brains, which follow the same laws of physics as does all matter. In the entirely unrealistic hypothetical situation where all of the details of a particular person's physical being and environment would be known, someone with nearly infinite capabilities of calculation would be able to predict the next series of thoughts and actions of that person - i.e. that particular persons actions would be predetermined. However, in the practical sense, nobody has that detailed knowledge and nobody's actions or thoughts can be absolutely predetermined.\n \n All of this assumes no mental existence outside of the physical brain.

How is free will in a universe of horrors any better than a meaningless life?\n \n As for real debate, the Soul doesn't provide a way out or at least not without causing problems elsewhere. We had a similar sort of debate in the abortion forum - if the Soul is not a direct copy of the material mind, then all punishment after death is irrelevant as it is not happening to me and is based of criteria that are beyond understanding of one of us (me or the soul). So either Souls are a seperate beings who are punished for acts they had no control over, or souls are incapable of developing without a material body and heaven is more minds kept in stasis than some pleasant afterlife.

   "That may be simply because it's spelt emergence.\n \n Emergence is an aspect of chaos theory, which is a fairly new science (originating in the late 70s) which has required new maths to deal with, but is mathematically sound and backed up by observation.\n \n In simple terms, chaos theory is the based on the proven observation that in any sufficiently complex system, specific predictions about details of that system's behaviour become impossible (not just very difficuly, but literally impossible) to make; the only way of describing such systems is in terms of large-scale patterns which repeat, but are different every time. \n \n Examples of these kinds of system which, having been studied, gave rise to chaos theory are stock market fluctuations, wild animal populations, weather patterns, turbulence, snowflake formation, heart rhythms, and the fractal patterns (patterns self-similar at all scales) found everywhere in nature.\n \n Emergence deals with this non-predictability factor; even when we know everything about all the individual aspects of a system, we find that when we look at the system as a whole, we find new, emergent properties on large scales which cannot be explained by our knowledge of individual aspects. Complex systems become more than the sum of their parts. Chaos gives rise to order, but not the order we'd expect. One extremely exciting example of emergence's use is that it should be able, eventually, to explain how that one cell that we all start out as contains all the information to grow our hugely complex bodies.\n \n Chaos and emergence are everywhere in nature; the only reason it wasn't discovered earlier was because since the time of Newton, scientists have been enthusiastically creating a huge body of work based on analysing cause-and-effect, looking at smaller and smaller scales to discover the influences behind any given phenomena. It is only after centuries of this that we have found that there is a glaring disparity between explanations at small and large scales, the sheer strangeness of quantum theory being the best example of this.\n \n How does all this relate to the question of free will? I hope this is already fairly obvious from my brief explanations above, but the central observation of chaos theory is that even quite simple deterministic systems give rise to unpredictable behaviour. The human brain is the most complex ordered arrangement of matter that we know exists. \n \n Doyne Farmer, a colleague of Robert Stetson Shaw, godfather of chaos theory, sums it up like this:\n \n \"On a philosophical level, [chaos] struck me as an operational way to define free will, in a way that allowed you to reconcile free will with determinism. The system is deterministic, but you can't say what it's going to do next.\"\n \n While this in no way resolves the philosophical problem of free will, I think it does shed a new and exciting light on the subject. One of the problems with arguments about free will tends to be that most people think that if we fully understood the brain, we would find it to be conclusively either deterministic or unpredictable. Chaos theory suggests that our minds are both.\n\n \n I think this is a very interesting perspective on free will. However, in philosophy, the idea of what you have called \"emergent\" properties is not new. It is a repeated theme in philosophical discussion that there are many objects that constitute an order in themselves that is higher than the mere union of their parts. The most notable of these objects is the human person, which cannot be fully and correctly comprehended if it is explained on the basis of its parts (for example, an explanation that is entirely biological, or entirely metaphysical). The whole idea of free will is comprehended in philosophy as one of those \"emergent properties\".\n \n We can understand the composition and nature of each of tha parts or of the aspects of the human creature, but from a mere abstract union of those parts or aspects, we cannot comprehend the full nature of what the human person is in entirety. The fact that in empirircal science we have come to a proposition which states the existence of \"systems\" that follow this scheme is, I think, a great proof that there are many aspects of the world around us that are beyond the competence or interest of physical or empirical sciences. A notable example being the existence of free will.\n \n For science to say that \"the system is deterministic, but you can't say what it's going to do next\" is almost the same as saying: \"we see this for what it is, we understand its parts, but we don't know what it is or how it works as a whole\". This is a great argument in favour of the existence of free will, as accepted by science, and also in favour of the fact that the assertation of that existence is beyond the competence of the very science that has -so to speak- retreated from attempting to explain it. \n \n This is where we enter into what is philosophy, the proper branch of knowledge in which a phenomenon like free will can be studied. We also observe in philosophy, but we don't use the same method as in physicial sciences (simply read Descartes to see how different philosophical method is from scientific method). \n \n The explanation of Emergence gives full proof that free will can exist, but that it is beyond the competence of empirical knowledge and its methods.",

   "Cause and Effect needn't just be two things, obvious because of the way it works the original cause could have occured over a long series of events before the effect we are observing now. This is your process of deliberation, as the choices and realisations you make (how hungry as well as thirsty you are, how soon could you get another drink, whether you are in a free will debate etc) are influenced by the physiological demands for water and then factor each other into the eventual decision. \n \n We can show that when you are thinking this, there is activity in the brain so clearly something physical is going on when you consider things. We also know how the brain works at this basic level (how one cell or set of cells are triggered by another etc) which is a series of cause and effects. What we don't know is how the arrangement of these switchs translates into higher brain function.\n \n I'm going to take issue with 'The explanation of Emergence gives full proof that free will can exist, but that it is beyond the competence of empirical knowledge and its methods.' There are emergant systems that we can ahppily predict and model, we are just talking about a particularly complicated one here. Given that until recently we've just not had the synthetic computing power to accurately model what could be happening I think it is too early to completely dismiss it as completely unpredictable (rather than just currently unpredictable.\n \n Also, wouldn't this still be the illusion of free will, rather than free will itself?

It's most obvious in simple mechanical things, where the equations are in plain sight. A billiard ball bouncing around the table can have it's final position predicted with great accuracy.\nNot observable: the billiard ball example is used by Hume as an example when showing we cannot actually directly observe causation, just conjunction\n \n \nMore complex things simply have more complex equations. But those equations exist. Those laws of interaction exist. Nothing can escape them, or act outside them. Or that is to say, nothing has ever been seen to do so. You can imagine the brain does, if you want, but I see no reason to believe that to be the case.\nNothing has been seen to, but nor have we observed that nothing does. Causation is the best model for many things, but not necessarily all.\n \n \nIn fact, I would go so far as to say nothing in the world can act. It can only react. Respond to the stimuli it's given. Of course, this begs the question; what was the initial, first act that started everythin off? But that's another debate entirely.\nIt's not another issue: it's a fundamental flaw in your original assertion. You can't bracket it off because it's problematic. Existence is proof that something beyond this position exists.\n \n \nSo the brain generates a completely new cause and effect seperate of any potential 'cause'?\n \n 1 - Why would you assume this is possible?\nBecause there's no proof it's impossible, and it's the model we inevitably use for internal choice, just as we inevitably use the model of causation for ordering external events. Either or both may be false, of course.\n \n \n2 - How would the brain do this?\nNo idea. Not even whether it is the brain or some distinct mind. In any case, it would be hard to explain in scientific terms, as these are reliant on cause and effect. It would have to be described in psychological or philosophical terms, where it is a fundamental of experience: after pure consciousness the most fundamental. Being aware and taking action are two sides of the same non-physicalist coin.\n \n \nI would say that a choice is the brain responding to stimuli within it's physical parameters in the only way it can.\nBut you would have no proof: this is a metaphysical assertion",

Just because we don't know why we might like something, doesn't mean there isn't a reason why we like them.\n\n \n First of all, the natural disposition of the world, including stars, and the possibility of aesthetic effects of erosion, etc., are NOT what is generally and commonly known as art. What is understood by this concept is entirely a human phenomenon. I think we should stick to what is conventionally accepted, or we could, as has happened before with us, have to start each post with a previous debate on what art is. I think it is safe to say that art is not found outside of human creation.\n \n Second, you misunderstand what art is. It is not merely the appreciation of something aesthetically pleasing. Not everything that is beautiful is art, and not all art fulfills the most basic aesthetic canons. Art is a much more complicated matter. According to the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language, art is (roughly translated by yours truly emoticon_xgood ) \"a manifestation of a human activity through which is expressed a personal and distanced point of view that interprets the real or the imagined using linguistic, sonorous or plastic means.\" According to Wikipedia, \n \n \nArt is commonly understood to be the process or result of making material works (or artwork) which, from concept to creation, adhere to the \"creative impulse\"-that is, art is distinguished from other works by being in large part unprompted by necessity, by biological drive, or by any undisciplined pursuit of recreation.\n \n The creative arts are a collection of disciplines whose principal purpose is in the output of material that is compelled by a personal drive and echoes or reflects a message, mood, and symbolism for the viewer to interpret. As such, the term art may be taken to include forms as diverse as prose writing, poetry, dance, acting, music, sculpture and painting. In addition to serving as a method of pure creativity and self-expression, the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically-, religiously-, and philosophically-motivated art, to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics and fine art) or pleasure, or to generate strong emotions; the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.\n \n As a form of cultural expression, art may be defined by the pursuit of diversity and the usage of narratives of liberation and exploration (i.e. art history, art criticism, and art theory) to mediate its boundaries. This distinction may be applied to objects or performances, current or historical, and its prestige extends to those who made, found, exhibit, or own them. Other than originality, there are no widely agreed-upon criteria for what is or isn't considered \"art\", and there are many divergent definitions of art to seek more specific requirements.\n\n \n What can we gather from here? First of all, art is a HUMAN thing, it can be related to nature, be inspired in nature or attempt to recreate nature, but it is not a product of nature. Also, there is no need for art to follow any particular aesthetic dogma (although this separation of art and beauty came with modern art, and is quite recent in art history).\n \n This all points to what I said. Art is useless. But more importantly, it is unique, and it expresses with fullness the complexity and beauty of the human experience. Why is this important? The uniqueness of art is an expression of the freedom of the will that created it. No single rational will is identical to any other, and so the products, expressions, actions or thoughts that come from one will always be an expression of a unique, unrepeatable identity, which is what we call personality. The whole idea of perosnality means that there is nothing or no one exactly the same as any given human being (and not just genetically). More powerfully, we find that art, despite its evident uselessness, is a pivotal and integral part of what civilisation is, and of what the whole human experience becomes. There is no humanity without art, because humanity is social, and in societies people must communicate themselves, express their ideas and thoughts, attempt to represent what is happening around them. The expression we see in art however, can be even more profound than the mere delivery of ideas. It is a projection of the mind of its creator, a mirror, so to speak, of the personality (the whole bieng) of the artist. This is why artists can be identified through their work, and why art is such a personal thing. Also, this is the reason for why art becomes a separate and autonomous object once outside the mind of the artist, it has its own entity, and is therefore capable of expressing the full complexity of the creator's sprirt (rational free will) to as many other spirits may contemplate and interpret it.\n \n The production of art is therefore, inherently, free. Otherwse, artists would be nothing more than happy coincidences in the greater cause-effect scheme. And there is no merit or responsibility in such a worldview.\n \n With respect to evolution, I think that the question of art rises to be much more complex than the tail for the peacock. The tail a necessity the animal has in order to mate. Yes, it is contingent in its form and development, but not in its essence. Without it, peacocks would not be what they are, in fact, they would not exist as such. Art however, is the maximum expression of contingency. There is nothing more contingent in human existence or expreience than art, and yet there are few other phenomena more closely or intimately linked to the core of the person. How can we explan this disjunctive? Only by accepting the free will of the artist, and, in the broader scheme, of all human persons.\n \n \nOur decision making process is still working on cause and effect, as we are basically trying to simulate the possible effects of the different choices. Conciousness is something tricky though, I don't know whether something like that is inevitable in any system as complicated as the brain (as whilst some computer systems might be complex enough to be concious, we don't have any way of knowing if they are due to a lack of possible communication) or whether there is a slightly more specific set of circumstances that are required.\n\n \n Our decision making process is always working on cause and effect? Well, what about the possibility of actions that have no cause? Is this impossible? Are there no human actions that have no external cause, and that are the pure product of whim? I believe there are. In the greater understanding, art is one of them. But on the more personal side, I think I can move myself to do just about anything just because I want to.

As soon as that 'whim' is to made into action then suddenly a material signal is appearing from nowhere. It might seem like a whim, but quite often when you stop and think about it you realise what it was that made you suddenly want something, though of course other times you have no idea. Its like word association on a more complex scale - if you have seen any of Derren Brown's mind tricks you can see it demonstrated where someone will just do something on a whim (rob an armoured van in this example) and have no idea why the idea just came to them, however its actually a very carefully controlled situation with all the right triggers there to stimulate the response.\n \n As for Art, I think you are reading a lot into it\n \na manifestation of a human activity through which is expressed a personal and distanced point of view that interprets the real or the imagined using linguistic, sonorous or plastic means\nThis is perfectly in line with cause and effect, you've just said what the stimulus is more or less - it is an interpretation of something else. It may be more technically impressive or beautiful but it is still more or less the same thing as the child trying to copy an image it sees (or imagines). \n Art doesn't need a purpose in a course and effect world, it needs a reason but that is no deeper than just 'something caused it to happen'. Why does art need to be more than a happy coincidence? Though in many cases art does serve a purpose, I'd actually say that whilst it may not be directly functional in the same way a machine or tool might be most art is done for a reason - to earn the artist a wage, to make a home more asethetically pleasing, as a by-product of a relaxation technique or past time, to ensure that an event or person is remembered (in the correct way, where art merges with propaganda, intentional or otherwise) to challenge a set belief or to make a statement about them. \n \n Nothing about cause and effect makes everyone identical, infact because the each event has a seperate set of factors (especially for a person with memory as all previous remembered and imagined events are included as factors as well) means that if you are interpretting something through these unique entities then you will get something slightly unique each time.\n If you want art to tell you about a person or a culture, it must be a product of that person and society.",

They don't have any particular structure judging the correct action or behaviour other than something like the fundamental rules of chemical interactions - surely this is some evidence for determinism? \n \n\n the thing is, the existence of free will assumes that free will was always in existence since the begining of life. similarly, determinism assumes that all decisions were always deterministic. by extrapolating backwards, all we can do is build on the same assumptions, and it doesnt seem to help us get a better picture of the truth\nEarlier on (though I think it was Pejotif) mentioned that free will was something specifically human as a lot of lower animals do not appear to act with it, or anywhere near the range of actions. Course if you beleive that microrganisms still have free will then we will start entering difficulties if we have to ask if viruses or even primative things like ribozymes and other self replicated molecules also have free will.\n \n \n\n the simulation of possible outcomes is exactly where the determinist problem comes up. our brain simulating the outcomes and selecting the one we would like to have happen creates a strong case for free will. in a deterministic system, there should be no premonition or concern about outcomes and consequences. there should be no anticipation of what will occur. the present causes should be the only thing affecting the act that is about to be commited.\nDeterminism is just as concerned about making the correct choice as free will is, though whatever choice is eventually picked is inevitable - the fact that you are thinking over the action is one of the chain of events leading from original cause to eventual effect. Ultimately thinking over a decision in a determinstic universe is pointless (though its not as if you have a choice with regards to thinking about it anyway) but no more so than in a universe governed by free will. Just because you actually have the potential to do several things doesn't mean that fundamentally one will be better than the other, its still just as subjective as with determinism.",
