Perhaps it would be better to ask who has abortions and your answer would be those already at the lower end of the social-economic spectrum; people who are already more prone to social and medical ills.

   "Did you read the entire article or did you just stop at the title? Let me bring out the jist of the study. \n Read carefully.\n \n \n\n The findings come from the Christchurch Health and Development Study of 1265 children tracked since birth in the 1970s. The researchers found 41 per cent of the more than 500 women remaining in the cohort had become pregnant by age 25 and 14.6 per cent had sought an abortion. In total, 90 pregnancies were terminated.\n \n At age 25, 42 per cent of those who had had an abortion had also experienced major depression at some stage during the previous four years - nearly double the rate of those who had never been pregnant and 35 per cent higher than those who had chosen to continue a pregnancy.\n \n\n \n No where in the study did it conclude that abortion was the cause of it. Instead it showed that women who had abortions had a 42% increase in mental problems years later. It doesn't tie the two together. Thus it is deceptive to sugges the results conclude \"Abortion linked to mental problems\" or \"abortion hurts women.\"\n It is like saying, \"A 100% of all those who suffer from alcoholism have been to a liquor store! Oh no! That must mean looking at liquor stores turns you into an alcoholic!\" \n You need to illustrate a cause and effect before you can make such a link.",

Can a mother choose to kill her 3 month old child as well?\n\n \n Sure - anyone can choose to do anything. Do I agree with legalizing it - no. Care can be provided by another. Not the the same as pregnancy.\n \n Get this through your head - NOTHING is.\n \n \n ....it should read unborn human, try not to read too much into that.\n\n \n Fruedian slip.\n \n \nWell, me personally nothing? But the unborn is the other person involved and I think he/she should have a say in the matter. I'm for the rights of the minority here.\n\n \n Who are you to speak for the unborn more than its mother? You going to come over and supercede my voice in the raising of my 11 year old as well?\n \n \nWhere did I lie? Can you show me an example of where I lied?\n\n \n I did not accuse you of lieing, you misread what I wrote. \n \n \nOther reasons people use for abortion? Are the valid things to be addressed? Sure..if the women doesn't wish to get an abortion I would be happy to help out the best that I can.\n\n \n That's great. But I want something more. I want the acknowledgment that pregnancy is quite impactful and the reasons to not be pregnant are not matters of \"convenience\". I want it acknowledged that the THE ABSOLUTE POOREST way to assist pregnant mothers and their children are unfeeling abortion laws that address nothing and will not help.\n \n \nThe same reason why I make decisions about you not killing another person.\n\n \n Such delusions - you do not make any choice for me and you never will.\n \n \nI can comment as an outside party that I do not want person x to kill person y for doing no wrong. Person x can voice his/her reasons all day long (like he killed my dog, he stole my plants, he called me a bad name) but I am not going to think that justifies killing.\n\n \n And when it comes to my life, you are a stranger, and I do not care what you think.\n \n \nOh, trust me, I understand the impact of pregnancy on her life.\n\n \n Not like I do.

Why? Isn't the fetus sucking precious resources from the \"host\" that you object to just as it was 2 months earlier?

He is now 11. That is why I supplied the ages. I love my kid and I love my life. I simply know more about the impacts of pregnancy than he. I am sure there is stuff he knows more about than me.

These associations reflected a tendency for rates of mental health problems to be highest amongst those having abortions and lowest amongst those who had not become pregnant, with those who became pregnant but did not have an abortion having rates that were intermediate between these extremes.\n 2. \n \n For all outcomes except alcohol dependence, the results of pairwise comparisons showed a generally similar pattern in which rates of disorder did not vary significantly (p < .05) between the never pregnant and pregnant no abortion groups. In all comparisons, those becoming pregnant and seeking abortions had significantly (p < .05) higher rates of disorder than the not pregnant group and, with the exception of anxiety disorder, significantly higher rates of disorder than the pregnant no abortion group.\n\n \n You raised this issue...in a way:\n \n \nThis raises issues about the direction of any causal association since the results may be interpreted in two ways: (a) mental health problems lead to increased risks of abortion; or (b) abortion leads to increased risks of mental health problems\n\n \n This was a addressed actually with this following results:\n \n \nThe results of this analysis are summarised in Table 4 which shows estimates of the covariate adjusted incidence rate ratios for the number of mental health problems. The association between pregnancy/abortion history prior to 21 and number of mental health problems from 21-25 years remained statistically significant after covariate adjustment (p = .008). In addition, consistent with the previous analysis, the results show a clear pattern in which, after covariate adjustment, those who were not pregnant and those who were pregnant but did not have an abortion had rates of disorder that were not significantly different (p < .05), whereas those having abortions had rates of disorder that were significantly (p < .05) higher than both of these groups.\n\n \n It you would like to know anything else from the article just let me know...I am not going to post it though as I could get into serious trouble....in fact, I'm probably already pushing it as it is.\n \n \n ---Citations---\n \n Fergusson, David M., John Horwood, L. & Ridder, Elizabeth M.

I'll grant that men are generally bigger and stronger than women are and it's rather more serious to tangle with an abusive man.

If you go back a year or so, I told you the story of the battered wife and kids that my wife and I took in for 6 months to prevent further violence against her. I, even, invited her ex-husband to take a shot at me so I could cripple his sorry XXX permanently when he had the nerve to show up at my front door.\n What I object to is Simone's use of language designed to deflect blame away from women and place it exclusively on the man. It's been a common theme in many of your posts as well. \n I understand that you were burned by your ex. My brother was burned by his ex, lost his house and 4 kids as well, but he moved on. He didn't blame ALL women for the actions of ONE. Now, I'm no psychoanalyst, but I've read that women have the bad habit of marrying the same type of abusive man that fathered them and an abusive father is more likely to beget an abusive son. \n The cycle is a self-propagating one, unfortunately, and unless women stop marrying these bums, it'll continue. That's where my frustration comes, women enablers. \n As you probably know, I have two adult daughters. I can guarantee you that neither will give the time of day to an abusive or disrespectful suitor. In fact, my oldest, 23, waits next to the car door for her fiance to open it for her, not because she's old-fashioned, but because she knows that it's a matter of respect. That's the way they were raised in my house. To hear you say that I don't respect women is so far from the truth as to be laughable.",

   "Simone, the problem is I can never give you a pro-choice website because pro-choicers would never give out results that said those things, even if they were true. People who found these things out would OF COURSE be pro-life, because not only would it save a woman's life but also the child's. Not to mention that I PERSONALLY knew a woman who had an abortion, and her feelings mirrored the study's as well as many health problems that were in there. So basically, no matter what you think, the study is accurate. Not to mention that most women who have never aborted a baby are the most rabid pro-choicers.\n \n Here's the main thing: what is the logic behind pro-choice arguments? Pro-lifers have strong arguments, but the best argument that I've heard from a pro-choicer is \"it's MY body.\" Sadly, that doesn't matter, because the fetus has a body TOO.\n \n It boils down to this. In Cinderella Man, James Maddock says to his son, \"No matter how hard things get, we never steal.\" And that's what abortion is: stealing another person's life because you don't want your life complicated in any way, shape, or form.

(I mean poverty, social stigma, uncaring support group, health insurance being nonexistant, kids having kids, etc.)\n \n Can we identify these causes and then address how to eliminate them as reasons for abortions?

   "Bell, you're right. We do need to find ways to keep women from getting into such a distressing situation. \n \n For one thing, as I see it, family is the root cause. If your family is all messed up, you'll end up running to men for acceptance or to drugs/alcohol to deaden your pain. And that often leads to unwanted pregnancies. No one has a perfect family. But I think something that most girls can do (and I do do this) is to surround themselves with true friends, not ones that will leave you in the lurch. \n \n I'm personally for abstinence, because it keeps alot of bad stuff from happening. But I know that the norm these days is not abstinence and that most girls are pressured into things. But, as I said before, good friends wouldn't get you into a mess like that. \n \n But the main point here is, if you do get pregnant, if you have really good friends, they'll help you through it all, no matter what your decision.\n \n Another good idea would be to donate more money to adoption agencies and to help out with women who are trying to decide whether or not to have an abortion. After all the reading I've done, I've ended up donating more money to those agencies so that the kids there can have a chance at a better future. And when I'm a little older I'll be able to help even more.\n \n Oh, here's an article that is very middle-of-the-road.

What about the stupendous mental stress of being a parent to too many children?\n \n\n \n I do know that pregnancy is a stressful time. But here's the biggest problem, Simone. I was just baby-sitting today. And there was the cutest 6 month old I had seen in a long time there. When I got home, my Mom was telling me the tremendous love she felt for my brother (the oldest of 4 kids) when she had him. She has always told me that even though having a child is not easy, it has always been worth it. \n \n I don't think that many women would call childbirth \"traumatic\" seeing that so many women have MULTIPLE children even though they could kill them in an instant in this country if they didn't want to have them. Too bad for you, every mother I've ever talked to loved having her kids. I know women who record the birth and one friend of mine actually took a picture of the placenta. I doubt anyone would record a \"traumatic\" event. Interesting that my sister saw the birth of a baby on one of those medical stations and said that it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. And she's never had kids, meaning, she wouldn't just think it was beautiful by default.\n \n Now, parenthood is a huge strain. But you can give the child up for ADOPTION instead of exterminating its life.\n \n And now, about the finances of a pregnancy. My family has always been on the lower-side of middle class. There were times in our family's life that we had to file for bankruptcy. And yet, all 4 of us are alive. And here I am, fighting for the life of others. \n \n In fact, having a child actually helps a woman's mental status. I've read this many times all over the place. But here's an article that you might like. Again, it's middle-of-the road. And it's by a woman who has a daughter who has learning disorders. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/17/AR2005101701311.html\n It might just change your mind about the \"stresses\" of parenthood.

I guess with people like them, you can only love them and hope they notice. \n \n But here's the main problem. I just realized it today. Fitch women's health (they'll smoke or do whatever they want no matter what the consequence; they want the right to abort their babies). Fitch their situations. (Don't scream. Ok, breathe. I'm getting to something.) The main issue here is: should a woman be able to decide whether her child gets to live its life AND when is a fetus, basically, declared a human being. \n \n See? Because, even if the woman was raped, if she had an abortion at say, 6 months, everyone would be outraged because she stole the child's life. So women's health and circumstances don't change whether the child is a human being or not. Or as pro-choicers say, \"aware\".\n \n Now, my position is that the child is a human being at the time when it is conceived. But your problem with persuading me otherwise is that you have no argument to make me believe that the fetus magically becomes a child when it can support life on its own. Basically, in the mind of a pro-choicer, the fetus is a child when the mother doesn't have to have it in her body.\n \n Now, don't get me wrong, I hate that women have been raped or abused. I hate rapists. And I certainly hate it when a teenage girl is put into a situation that she's almost helpless in. But that does NOT give a woman the right to choose whether her child lives or dies. Because that's what abortion does: it kills the fetus; thus ending the life of their (as pro-choicers would say) \"would-be\" child. ",

I've had numerous opportunities to take foreign assignments for way more money, I've been offered promotions that involved high amounts of travel, etc., but I turned them down to be a real \"DAD\". My kids weren't just lawn ornaments that I pat on the head in the AM and forget. They are a driving force for most of the decisions that my wife and I have made over the years. My wife stayed at home instead of packing our kids off to daycare for someone else to raise because we decided that, while it'd be \"nice\" to drive new cars and have a bigger house, it was more important to raise our own kids. So we drove older cars, didn't have a boat or summer cottage \"up north\". I live in a typical middle class 2 income neighborhood and see the negative effect that not having a parent home has on the kids. Instead of staying home with their kids, both parents dump them in daycare and after-school programs so that they can afford the new cars and other adult toys. And who suffers for the parents' selfishness? The kids, 100% of the time. Altruism may be dead when it comes to helping your fellow man on the street, but it shouldn't be dead inside of your own home. It takes people willing to make sacrifices in order to be good parents. That, sometimes, means not getting an abortion because it will inconvenience your lifestyle. emoticon_mad",
