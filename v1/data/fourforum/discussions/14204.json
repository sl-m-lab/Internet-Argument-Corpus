   "The US is the top arms seller in the world and expanding its lead.\n So if your neighbour is the US why look farther for your tools of trade?\n \n The violence of course can not contained south of the border. The USA is becoming more and more like a Latin American country (Chile and Argentina are the exceptions) violent, poor, corrrupt and the gap between rich and poor ever widening.\n \n See below:\n \n Just as government officials had feared, the drug violence raging in Mexico is spilling over into the United States.\n \n U.S. authorities are reporting a spike in killings, kidnappings and home invasions connected to Mexico's murderous cartels. And to some policymakers' surprise, much of the violence is happening not in towns along the border, where it was assumed the bloodshed would spread, but a considerable distance away, in places such as Phoenix and Atlanta.\n \n Investigators fear the violence could erupt elsewhere around the country because the Mexican cartels are believed to have set up drug-dealing operations all over the U.S., in such far-flung places as Anchorage, Alaska; Boston; and Sioux Falls, S.D.\n \n \"The violence follows the drugs,\" said David Cuthbertson, agent in charge of the FBI's office in the border city of El Paso, Texas.\n \n The violence takes many forms: Drug customers who owe money are kidnapped until they pay up. Cartel employees who don't deliver the goods or turn over the profits are disciplined through beatings, kidnappings or worse. And drug smugglers kidnap illegal immigrants in clashes with human smugglers over the use of secret routes from Mexico.\n \n So far, the violence is nowhere near as grisly as the mayhem in Mexico, which has witnessed beheadings, assassinations of police officers and soldiers, and mass killings in which the bodies were arranged to send a message. But law enforcement officials worry the violence on this side could escalate.\n \n \"They are capable of doing about anything,\" said Rusty Payne, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman in Washington. \"When you are willing to chop heads off, put them in an ice chest and drop them off at a police precinct, or roll a head into a disco, put beheadings on YouTube as a warning,\" very little is off limits.\n \n In an apartment near Birmingham, Ala., police found five men with their throats slit in August. They had apparently been tortured with electric shocks before being killed in a murder-for-hire orchestrated by a Mexican drug organization over a drug debt of about $400,000.\n \n Mexican Drug Violence Spills Over Into US",
