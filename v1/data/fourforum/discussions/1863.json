The cover depicts you pulling down a statue of George W. Bush, doctored to resemble the statue of Saddam the Iraqi people pulled down earlier this year. Way to go Michael! You show them right-wing crazies! Bush is no different than Saddam! (Which concentration camp are you being kept in again?) Although it was offered at 30% off, I still couldn't find the cash to purchase it. I'm a poor working college student so I'm sure you understand. Then again, maybe not, since you dropped out of college to become a full time activist. Not that there's anything wrong with that; you made quite a career for yourself in left-wing journalism. As a brief aside, I notice you were fired from Mother Jones for refusing to run an article that was crticial (read truthful) of the Sandinistas.\n \n Anyway, I'm writing about one chapter in your new book that really caught my attention. It's entitled \"Horatio Alger must die.\" I was planning on taking it into the bathroom with me but you have to purchase the book first. So feel free to correct any errors in my memory. The gist of the chapter is that you can't make it in America. You even helpfully typed it in bold (no doubt to provide some help to your target audience): You will never be rich. That's what I like about you Michael: you never let the facts get in the way of great writing. If they just put your book in the fiction section, you'd be set.\n \n Have you ever read The Millionaire Next Door? I would guess not since it doesn't reinforce your preconceived conclusions about the economy. You see Michael, the economy is not a zero sum game. Your great wealth does not cause the relative poverty of the lower class. I say relative because America has the richest, fattest poor people in the world. More than three quarters of American millionaires are first generation, ie self made. They are self-made millionaires like... you Michael. You refute your own rantings. You are living proof that people can make it big in America. If I want to become a multi-millionaire with a luxurious apartment in Manhattan like you, all I have to do is think of new and creative ways to say America sucks. Then millions of left-wing sheep will raise hosannahs to my genius and wit. Who knows? If I make a \"documentary\" filled with lies and distortions, I might even win an Oscar. At my acceptance speech I'll be sure to thank you, the ficticious champion of the working class.\n \n Your buddy,\n \n Kevin \"Darth\" Beckman\n \n http://www.livejournal.com/community/conservatism/741232.html",

(note that this would violate federal law)\n \n Is this not a lie?\n \n Splicing someones speech (Heston) into something he did not say. Is this not a lie?\n\n \n \n Yes, you can walk into that particular bank and walk out with a rifle. THis is because that bank holds an FFL. Of course, between the time you walk in and the time you walk out, there will be a background check.\n \n There is a gas station nar my house where you can do the same thing, becasue they also have an FFL. \n \n I wuoold agree that splicing HEstons speach was a lie on moores part, whether it meets the dictionary definition or not.",
