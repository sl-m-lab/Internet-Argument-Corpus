Top of the list is a challenge to the United States to join an international pollution permit trading system which, the UN claims, could deliver $3.64trn of global wealth....\n \n In an endorsement of the report, Mr Brown said: \"This shows how we can equip people and countries for a new global economy that combined greater prosperity and fairness both within and across nations.\"\n \n The UNDP says rich countries should build on this and go further. It proposes six schemes to harness the power of the markets:\n * Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through pollution permit trading; net gain $3.64trn.\n * Cutting poor countries' borrowing costs by securing the debts against the income from stable parts of their economies; net gain $2.90trn.\n * Reducing government debt costs by linking payments to the country's economic output; net gain $600bn.\n * An enlarged version of the vaccine scheme; net gain (including benefits of lower mortality) $47bn.\n * Using the vast flow of money from migrants back to their home country to guarantee; net gain $31bn.\n * Aid agencies underwriting loans to market investors to lower interest rates; net gain $22bn....\n \n But - and the UN admits it is a big \"but\" - the US would have to sign up to Kyoto and carbon trading to achieve the $3.64trn that it believes the system would deliver over time.....\n \n Andrew Simms, director of the New Economics Foundation, said it left unanswered questions over how these markets would be managed and how the benefits and costs would be distributed. \"We have nothing against markets so it would be missing the point to get into a pro- or anti-market stance. The point is how you distribute the benefits.\"......\n\n \n Any thoughts?",
