   "Learning from religious fanaticism can prevent future atrocities \n \n by Eugene Ramirez (.....Vegan, graduate student, Latino, spiritual, progressive-liberal residing in San Antonio, Tx -- More of my editorials can be read at http://www.EugeneRamirez.com/html/editorials.html)\n \n As we reflect back upon history, one thing remains clear regardless of one's religious affiliation or no affiliation: More people have died in the name of God than any other way throughout history. \n \n Indeed, for hundreds of years, religious elites and common people have used their own religious interpretation (and passed down interpretation) to oppress based on gender, sexual orientation, religion and ethnicity. We have come to know of the atrocities that were all tied to religion such as the Holocaust, African-American enslavement, and the persecution of Jews. \n \n In his book, \"Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness,\" James A. Haught chronicles a thousand years of religious hate ranging from the witch hunts, to the numerous crusades, to the Holy Inquisition, to the religious anti-Semitic influence that later fueled the Holocaust. Haught says, \"Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined, and imprisoned, yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of the coercion? To make one half of the world fools and the other half hypocrites.\" Furthermore, theologian Richard Rubenstein wrote that the Nazis \"did not invent a new villain...they took over the 2,000-year-old Christian tradition of the Jew as a villain. The roots of the death camps must be sought in the mythic structure of Christianity.\" \n \n We have also seen throughout history how numerous religious leaders and common people have pointed to specific passages in the Bible that have been used to validate slavery. One insightful book, \"Noah's Curse: The Biblical Justification of American Slavery,\" by Stephen R. Haynes, further shows how just \"one\" biblical passage fueled anti-African-American sentiment over the course of hundreds of years. The biblical passage, \"A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren,\" reads Noah's curse on Ham. Ham is later identified as the ancestor of black Africans, and this particular biblical passage is just one that has been used historically to justify African-American slavery. Also many Christian clergymen throughout history were pro-slavery. Historian Larry Hise says in his book, \"Pro Slavery,\" that ministers \"wrote almost half of all defenses of slavery published in America.\" He also lists more than 250 religious men who used the Bible to prove white people were entitled to own black people. \n \n Similarly, Hitler and other anti-Semitic leaders throughout history have used biblical passages to validate the persecution of Jews. Here is just one passage that fueled anti-Semitism: \"You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews, who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.\" (1 Thessalonians 2:14-16). \n \n In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II issued a historical pardon at St. Peter's Basilica regarding the Catholic Church's prime role in the persecution of Jews for the past 1,000 years. In addition, they also released a document that named (and officially validated) other multiple \"sins\" on their part including the Holocaust, Inquisition, Crusades and other religious acts. \n \n Not surprisingly, comparable negative sentiment that existed hundreds of years ago against African-Americans and Jews, fixated on non-heterosexuals around 50 years ago during its national peak. True, much progress has been made for gay and bisexual rights. But even today, when discussing bisexuality and heterosexuality, some people are quick to (just as in history) point to biblical passages that condemn anyone who is not heterosexual. \n \n Earlier this year we witnessed a progressive change in history as gay and bisexual men and women fought back against hegemonic norms and married in San Francisco. With the right time to pass, it will not be long when equal marriage rights under the law will be given to non-heterosexuals; similar to the way segregation was outlawed and ruled unconstitutional in the 1960s despite such opposition. \n \n Still, some do not consider gay and bisexual rights a \"civil rights\" issue. However, Coretta Scott King, wife of the late Martin Luther King Jr., disagrees with them. In 1998, on the 30th anniversary of her husband's assassination she commented: \"I still hear people say that I should... stick to the issue of racial justice, but I hasten to remind them Martin Luther King Jr. said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' \" I appeal to everyone who believes in Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream to make room at the table of brother-and-sisterhood for lesbian and gay (and bisexual) people.\" \n \n Clearly, religion has also been used against women throughout history, which has solidly set the foundation for our dominating patriarchal world. One such biblical passage has been used to prohibit women from being ministers: \"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak.\" (I Corinthians I 4:34). Many believe this biblical passage and others like it fueled misogynistic beliefs at the time, which viewed women as merely second-class citizens. Not long after, The Women's Suffrage Movement was a prime example of how women fought against the male-dominated world. Finally with the passage of the 19th Amendment, women got their long-deserved right to vote. \n \n \n Yes, it is true more people have died in the name of God throughout our history than any other way. So it behooves us today to not forget our history, for we may be doomed to repeat it. As we have seen through hundreds of years, indeed it has been repeated. I know I will never identify myself as a Catholic or with any other religion that is not in line with my life-changing (progressive) and liberal beliefs. However, I do believe in God very much and always will; there is a higher Creator, and I believe that our higher Creator would want us to most definitely learn from our horrid history, so that we will never repeat it again. The time is now for us to continue to fight for civil rights in all aspects. The work is never done!",

   "AcrossTheUniver:\n \n The Bible teaches that every people group (scientific discoveries in the human genome project have comfirmed the Bible's truth that we are all of 'one blood', i.e. all came from one man and one woman) is equal in the sight of God.\n \n We have also seen throughout history how numerous religious leaders and common people have pointed to specific passages in the Bible that have been used to validate slavery. One insightful book, \"Noah's Curse: The Biblical Justification of American Slavery,\" by Stephen R. Haynes, further shows how just \"one\" biblical passage fueled anti-African-American sentiment over the course of hundreds of years.

Historian Larry Hise says in his book, \"Pro Slavery,\" that ministers \"wrote almost half of all defenses of slavery published in America.\" He also lists more than 250 religious men who used the Bible to prove white people were entitled to own black people.\n \n And where is this \"curse on Ham\" located in the Bible? Genesis 9:25 says:\n \"A curse on Canaan! He will be a slave to his brothers.\" There is no mention of skin colour (although we know there there is no such thing as 'white' or 'black' people. Everyone is different shades of brown depending on how much melenon they have in their skin) at all in Genesis 9 or any other part of Genesis. This idea of so-called black people being less than the so-called white people is foreign to the Bible and most likely just came from people's thoughts. As you could guess, they tried to justify their beliefs from the Bible - they ended up resorting to lies to do so. In fact the popularisation of Darwinan evolution fueled racism (it's not the cause of racism, but it sure fueled it) as people believed that the 'black' people weren't as evolved as the 'white people'. In fact, the Australian Aboriginal people were labelled as animals by museums. As a result, many died in the subseqent attacks.\n \n The Bible does not teach male chauvinism. The Bible teaches that men and women are equal, but they have different roles because of the way God created them and because of their reactions to the temptation of the serpent (1 Tim. 2:12-14). In fact, 1 Corinthians 7:4 implies that both men and women are equal in marriage as well:\n \"A wife is not the master of her own body, but her husband is; in the same way a husband is not the master of his own body, but his wife is\".\n \n Ephesians 5:21 under the heading \"Wives and Husbands\" shows clearly that men and women are eqaul.\n \n As for Hitler, he was an evolutionist and as such used his belief in evolution to justify his terrible acts. The verse in 1 Thessalonians, people, if what you say is true, have taken this verse out of proportion (context). We are told in the Bible to love our enemies and to pray for those who persecute us. In fact, I believe that the persecution experienced by Christians in many parts of the world is the reason why many are coming to Christ, e.g. China. Take Brother Yun, one of the most famous Chinese Christian leaders, for example. He was tourtured and almost killed many times in prison, yet he never hated those who were constantly beating him. He felt pity for them. He prayed for them. For more information on Brother Yun's experiences I would strongly urge people to grab a copy of \"The Heavenly Man\" as it is an amazing book. I personally couldn't put it down!\n \n With reference to 'sexual orientation', we are told to hate the sin and love the sinner. Such hatred for people does not come from the Bible, rather from people's own evil desires and thoughts. They do nothing that the Bible says, yet some still call themselves 'Christians'. If they were Christians, they were being inconsistent with their own faith and what it says to do and how to act...",

   "Across the Univer,\n \n Obviously this new \"progressive\" movement you speak of towards trying to legitimize unbiblical relationships (gay unions, etc.), is really nothing new. God commanded against gay sex relationships in Leviticus 18:22, Leviticus 20:13, Romans 1:26-27, etc. No amount of \"progressive\" thought or politically-correct attitudes will change that.\n \n \nHaught says, \"Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined, and imprisoned, yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity.

The roots of the death camps must be sought in the mythic structure of Christianity.\"\n\n \n Biblical Christianity is not at fault as you suggest here. Abrogation of the tenets of Christianity are. You can't denigrate true Christianity as Jesus taught it by citing examples of people who violate Jesus' teachings. That's like saying all gays or blacks are murderers just because some of them are. \n \n Regarding Hitler and the Nazis:\n \n The Nazis defended paganism, both during the early stages, and also when they came to power in 1933. They tore German society away from Christianity, and tried to turn it to pagan beliefs. \n \n A short while after Hitler came to power, Christian holidays and festivals were replaced by pagan ones. 'Mother Earth' or 'Father Sky' were called on at wedding ceremonies. In 1935, Christian prayers in schools were stopped, and then all lessons concerning Christianity were banned. \n \n Schoolchildren were taught the so-called 'Glorious pre-Christian German history,' and various rites and ceremonies, legacies of pagan culture, were held all over Germany. All Nazi meetings were in the form of traditional pagan ceremonies. There was almost no difference between Nazi rallies, held under the shadow of flaming torches, where slogans full of hate and violence were shouted and Wagner's pagan music played, and the perverted ceremonies carried out thousands of years ago at pagan temples and altars. \n \n The Nazis also used the arts to re-awaken paganism. Ancient Greek concepts and symbols began to predominate under Nazi rule, and many statues similar to Greek statues were made, showing strong men and women of the Aryan race. Hitler dreamed that a 'superior race' would be formed by the use of eugenics, and establish a cruel and oppressive 'world kingdom' based on the Spartan model. The expression \n \n 'The Third Reich' is a statement of this dream. And as a result of this dream, 55 million people lost their lives in the Second World War, the bloodiest conflict that had ever been seen. \n \n http://www.islamdenouncesantisemitism.com/thepagan.htm",

   "It never ceases to amaze me how people can take the Bible and twist it to fit their agenda.\n \n And then say that God told them...?\n \n Religion, yes; God, no.\n \n Who killed Jesus? The Jewish people? No. Read 1 Thessalonians again and this time don't pick and place scripture like those you so readily denounce. If you read closer, those scriptures talk to you and about you, more precisely about what you have just said; throwing the blame elsewhere instead of on the perpetrator. Also follow the lesson, or message to the end and discover who really killed Christ.\n \n You religionists are all the same. You play your game using the appropriate pawns, but neglect the rules. You lose and blame the legislature instead of your own blind ambition while spreading your brand of hate. You use scripture intended to reveal truth and turn them into lies.\n \n You hope to gain ground by this? How?",

   "That's the thing though - different texts are intended to be read in different ways. Each form of literature, you could say, is a game with certain rules of participation between the author (making the story) and the potential reader (receiving the story). The Bible falls into that special category of literature called \"Theology\" or \"Moral Epistemology\" - a statement of the various objects and rules that constitute the game called \"Christian Morality\".\n \n The interesting thing about the Bible is that it is written aphoristically, rather than literally - trying to cite by a combination of exposition and example instances of good behaviour or attitudes. But what's captivating about it is its use of colloquialistic, rather than poetic, metaphors in order to get the point across. It's a religion for everyone, rather than just for priests (or academics).\n \n However as an example of deeply meditative thought, the Bible pales in comparison to Plato's Republic, the Tao-te-Ching, Kant's Metaphysics of Morals, let alone Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations. Like every other meditative-text there is, you can read too much into it. Some interpretations are better than others for very simple reasons that they are more faithful to the original structure.\n \n The accessibility of the Bible is its downfall though, as that accessibility leads to lazy thinking and so it has a tendency to promote dogmatism on issues of doctrine rather than critical discussion thanks to the ancilliary misconception that because the Bible points to Truth that it is Truth.",
