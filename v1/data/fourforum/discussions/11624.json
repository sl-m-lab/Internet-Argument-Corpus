   "Everyone has their opinion on how to have piece worldwide. When you talk about the middle east, you have a region, a culture, a religeon, and a society that operates on Muslim beliefs. To them, anyone who is not a Muslim is an infidel, and they should be killed. No matter how many terrorist we kill or imprison, there are 100 more to take his place. The only way to prevent more terrorist attacks would be a complete elimination of Muslims and Islamist. Now I am not saying we should go on a massive killing spree, Im just making a point. Muslims do not just target Americans, they target all people who are not muslims, from England to Australia to America. Terrorist attacks are nothing more than deadly, violent hate crimes. Our government sends billions of our tax dollars to the middle east so the rebuilding can start, but all they are doing is rebuilding a society that still believes we are infidels and we all deserve to die.",
