   "Is this a new doctine of the church?:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/01/world/europe/01vatican.html\n \n July 1, 2006\n Excommunication Is Sought for Stem Cell Researchers \n By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL\n ROME, June 30 - Scientists who engage in stem cell research using human embryos should be subject to excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church, according to a senior Vatican official. \n \n Cardinal Alfonso L\u00f3pez Trujillo, who heads the group that proposes family-related policy for the church, said in an interview with the Catholic weekly Famiglia Cristiana published Thursday that stem cell researchers should be punished in the same way as women who have abortions and doctors who perform them. \n \n \"Destroying an embryo is equivalent to abortion,\" said the cardinal. \"Excommunication is valid for the women, the doctors and researchers who destroy embryos.\"\n \n It was unclear if the pope supported the position, and the Vatican did not return calls for comment. But such blunt remarks from a powerful cardinal just a week before the church convenes a meeting to discuss the topic could foreshadow a hardening of Vatican policy on the issue, experts said. \n \n On Saturday, Cardinal Trujillo will open the church's fifth World Meeting of Families in Valencia, Spain, and Pope Benedict XVI will attend on July 9, the closing day. As head of the Pontifical Council for the Family, it will be up to Cardinal Trujillo to propose new church policies, though adopting any such measure could require a long and complicated process. \n \n The church has long opposed embryonic stem cell research, and has campaigned against any medical procedure or research technique that harms human embryos or fetuses. \n \n But the threat of individual excommunication - the most serious punishment meted out by the church - was previously directed at women and medical personnel who participated in abortions. Cardinal Trujillo's stand would broaden the use of that sanction to biomedical researchers who use embryos. \n \n \"The cardinal's view is that the penalty of excommunication should be extended to stem cell research,\" said the Rev. Brian Johnstone, a moral theologian at the Alphonsian Academy here. \"The provisions of canon law about what leads to excommunication are very precise.\" \n \n But Father Johnstone cautioned that it was unlikely that the church would formally adopt a final position next week. \"Clarification of such a delicate point of this importance is unlikely to be made at such a large gathering,\" he said. \n \n Even some Catholics who are opposed to the use of embryos in research felt that excommunication was too strong a sanction. \"If we're defending the principle that human life should not be touched, it should not be done in a punitive, castigatory or burn-in-hell sort of way,\" said Paola Binetti, a leading Catholic politician here. \n \n The specification of the punishment for embryonic stem cell research was partly needed so the church could catch up with advances in science. \n \n When the 1990 Evangelium Vitae came out reaffirming that abortion would lead to automatic excommunication, \"Embryonic stem cell research was not a front-page issue,\" Ms. Binetti said. \n \n While doctors and scientists claim that embryonic stem cell research holds the promise to cure many intractable diseases, the church opposes the practice because human embryos are used to harvest cells for the work. Some of these embryos are left over after in vitro fertilization procedures, but scientists can also create embryos themselves. \n \n The church regards such early-stage embryos as a human life, not to be used or destroyed. It maintains that there are other ways to obtain stem cells for research purposes - from umbilical cord blood after a birth, for example - though it acknowledges that they are significantly more cumbersome. \n \n According to current church law, excommunication for abortion is \"latae senentiae,\" meaning that it is automatic and does not require an action or proclamation by a church official. This type of excommunication is reserved for acts deemed so serious that no verdict or judgment is required. Even so, many women who have had abortions continue to practice Catholicism, and many parishes take pains to embrace and reintegrate them into church life. \n \n Other acts that result in automatic excommunication include violence against the pope and consecrating a bishop without authorization. Now, experts said, Cardinal Trujillo's remarks raise the possibility that being involved in stem cell research might be added to the category. Secret Papal Archives to Be Opened\n \n By The New York Times\n \n ROME, June 29 - The Vatican has authorized secret files from Pope Pius XI and his pre-World War II pontificate, from 1922 to 1939, to be released from their secret archives. \n \n In 2003, under Pope John Paul II, the Vatican released archival material from the same period in an effort to allay accusations that the Vatican did not do enough to save Jews from the Holocaust. \n \n For years, the Vatican has struggled to defend the reputation of Pius's successor, Pope Pius XII, who has been accused of shirking his responsibilities by looking the other way during the atrocities of World War II. \n \n Peter Kiefer contributed reporting from Rome for this article, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Milan.",

   "Well since you guys are talking about Catholics I might as well give some input.\n I'm glad I'm not a Catholic, they seem much, much stricter than the Lutheran church I attend.\n\n I just wanted to put in a somewhat good word about the actual practice of Catholicism. Though my actual current beliefs certainly don't conform to the vast majority of official Catholic dogma, I must mention that, in growing up Catholic in the liberal state of Massachusetts, I very rarely if ever encountered any of the strictest aspects of Catholic dogma in the masses I attended. I never heard anything said against abortion or contraception, no mention of homosexuality, no \"fire and brimstone\" homilies, etc. Even if there was a reading of the Old Testament that touched upon a wife needing to obey her husband, the subsequent homily on the subject was almost apologetic in its tone - as if they themselves recognized how outdated that concept was. \n \n My only point in bringing this up is that there are many versions of the actual practice of Catholicism as well - some more liberal than others. I was lucky in having mainly only encountered the more liberal side of Catholicism so that my departure from established dogma is far more based on intellectual arguements than on emotional reactions against irrational beligerance that others have experienced.",

   "It just seems odd that you would want a church to \"evolve\" out of the teachings in the Bible and kinda develop their own set of standards. When Jesus said there is only one way I don't think he meant your own personal wants way.\n\n Politics and historical trends largely determined what is currently considered the range of beliefs about Jesus which we call Christianity. In the early years, these beliefs varied very widely - from beliefs in Jesus being purely human to beliefs in him being purely divine (with the human form being an illusion). So, when you say that \"there is only one way\", that is only your opinion based on the traditions you are most familiar with. Other faiths believed in a different way.

Your early point was that the RCC should become more liberal and pretty much stray away from their belief in the Bible. If they do this than why even have the religion? You are believing in anything and just instead creating a club to make you feel good which chances on the whims of the people.\n\n It depends on what level of the religion you are trying to change. As I mentioned in post 36, the Roman Catholic Church was essentially founded on the consolidation and codification of Christianity in the 4th century so any deviation from those chosen limitations on Christian belief would probably no longer be allowed to be called Roman Catholic. However, even within those constraints, a lot of laws of the Roman Catholic church were determined by subsequent generations of clergy and scholars and their personal interpretations of original texts (Gospels, etc.) that were either vague on certain issues or silent on those issues. Just look at the issue of abortion (the main topic of this forum, after all). There were long periods in the history of the Roman Catholic Church when abortion was not considered murder until \"quickening\" when it was thought that the soul enters the body. At other times, the soul was thought to enter the body at about 40 days. These variations show that the original texts are far from clear on the subject. I suspect the same is true for approaches to gays, etc. Another issue is the possession of wealth and keeping it away from the poor. Anyone familiar with the teachings of Jesus as explained in the Gospels would know how such hoarding of property was frowned upon by him. Nevertheless, the Roman Catholic Church, though it does give a non-insignificant portion of its wealth to the poor, certainly does hoard significant property. All I am saying is that so much of Roman Catholic faith is based on the interpretations and, essentially, guesses of generations of clergy that may or may not have even been based on those original texts. Therefore, even within a particular faith, there is still a lot of room to maneuver.\n \n As for the adaptability of \"Christianity\" in general, the wide range of early Christian beliefs show that a completely novel interpretation, much different than the current range of Christian faiths, could still call itself Christian. Personally, I would love to see one emerge that is more liberal. Episcopalianism is somewhat more liberal than the others - with its ordaining of women and gay bishops. That seems to be causing a potential split. If that happens, then so be it. It might free the more liberal wing to evolve farther.",

I've often heard of Episcopalians being referred to as \"bob-tailed Catholics\" and we have Southern Baptists, Orthodox Jews, Mormons (who simply added a book to the Bible) and other versions of other basic religions each of which share some link to their common source foundations.\n \n I suppose this (splitting of congregations into opposing groups) somewhat supports my belief that religion is the single most powerful source of divisiveness that we have...it divides people even within groups who already claim to have the same beliefs. The ordainment of gay priests is currently doing that to one group as we speak. (I forget which, but it's been in the news lately...maybe the Presbyterians?)\n\n Well at least those splits, where Christianity is concerned, are no longer followed by violence. It also certainly seems that most people readily accept others of different Christian faiths. Also, many, if not most, also readily accept others of completely different non-Christian faiths. It is a different world (in the West at least) than it was centuries ago when wars were fought over religious splits.\n \n It is the Episcopalians that have recently ordained a gay bishop and thus provoked a lot of anger from the more conservative parts of the Anglican community. I believe that they also had ordained a divorced female higher level bishop some years back. That is the most liberal Church I have heard of so far - more power to them emoticon_xgood \n \nThis discussion has opened many fascinating windows of opportunity to ponder religion and human nature. I maintain that the RC church is out to lunch. There is no sound reason to ostracize women based upon abortion. \n\n Well, I would agree with you about the official Roman Catholic Church, but maintain the large differences between that and some of the actual Roman Catholic practice.",

   "It depends on what level of the religion you are trying to change. As I mentioned in post 36, the Roman Catholic Church was essentially founded on the consolidation and codification of Christianity in the 4th century so any deviation from those chosen limitations on Christian belief would probably no longer be allowed to be called Roman Catholic. However, even within those constraints, a lot of laws of the Roman Catholic church were determined by subsequent generations of clergy and scholars and their personal interpretations of original texts (Gospels, etc.) that were either vague on certain issues or silent on those issues. Just look at the issue of abortion (the main topic of this forum, after all). There were long periods in the history of the Roman Catholic Church when abortion was not considered murder until \"quickening\" when it was thought that the soul enters the body. At other times, the soul was thought to enter the body at about 40 days. These variations show that the original texts are far from clear on the subject. I suspect the same is true for approaches to gays, etc. Another issue is the possession of wealth and keeping it away from the poor. Anyone familiar with the teachings of Jesus as explained in the Gospels would know how such hoarding of property was frowned upon by him. Nevertheless, the Roman Catholic Church, though it does give a non-insignificant portion of its wealth to the poor, certainly does hoard significant property. All I am saying is that so much of Roman Catholic faith is based on the interpretations and, essentially, guesses of generations of clergy that may or may not have even been based on those original texts. Therefore, even within a particular faith, there is still a lot of room to maneuver.\n \n As for the adaptability of \"Christianity\" in general, the wide range of early Christian beliefs show that a completely novel interpretation, much different than the current range of Christian faiths, could still call itself Christian. Personally, I would love to see one emerge that is more liberal. Episcopalianism is somewhat more liberal than the others - with its ordaining of women and gay bishops. That seems to be causing a potential split. If that happens, then so be it. It might free the more liberal wing to evolve farther.\nWell, as stated, no one ever accussed the Roman Catholic Church of being consistent. While they may maneuver (as you put it) it really contradicts everything they stand for. At the end of the day, God is right and the changing of opinions means the RCC (or others) will be wrong...atleast one time. But if they become more liberal you are basically saying that they should just change with the times and thus have no basis for a religion other than the wishes of the people. \n \n I believe there is only one true meaning to the Bible. I disagree that it is a matter of interpreting. While the Bible doesn't have to state every issues directly, you can easily recognize basic principals and apply them to other situations. For example, the Bible doesn't say cutting of peoples arms for fun is wrong but you could easily apply principals of the Bible to this. I think abortion and gay \"rights\" work the same way..although gay rights is a little more explicit. But this is a little off topic. My main point is that making the Roman Catholic Church just change it views based on nothing would render the RCC more worthless than it already is.",

No such evidence exist, so the rest is a leap of faith. We have no clear way to know who is right and who is wrong. People base their faith on texts - i.e. the Bible - that are considered sacred. What made them sacred? It wasn't until the fourth century that the New Testament was codified by fallible human beings. To trust in the truth of the Bible means that you trust that those human beings knew God's requirements. That is a leap of faith about people that I do not choose to make. Humans make good faith interpretations but those good faith interpretations can easily be wrong. New, more liberal interpretations of the original stories about Jesus have no better or worse chance of being right or wrong than the early intepretations. In fact, I would think that added scientific and historical knowledge would only give them a greater chance at guessing the truth (if there truly is a supernatural truth out there). Ultimately, I don't have blind trust in the Bible due to (a) the fallibility of personal interpretation of many of the writers and (b) the delay between the death of Jesus and even the first of the Gospels easily allowing for original true stories to be distorted.\n \n However, the Roman Catholic Church does claim to rely on the truth of the Bible - at least in the form it took at its founding. Thus, as I had already agreed, the Roman Catholic Church is limited in how far it can evolve since it is ultimately limited by the canonized texts. However, even there, the original texts were so vague on certain subjects that many interpretations were possible. I am curious, regarding those canonized texts (i.e. the Bible), and more specifically the Gospels: What specific quotes do you know of most related to gay marriage? As for abortion, I have seen quotes that claim to support both sides of the arguement.\n \n The limits on religious evolution would be much less strict for other possible Christian denominations. As I had explained, some early Christians didn't even think that Jesus was divine and some didn't think the God of the Old Testament was the same as that of the New Testament - beliefs far different from current versions of Christianity. The \"Christian\" relgion in general thus has much more freedom to evolve than does Roman Catholicism.",
