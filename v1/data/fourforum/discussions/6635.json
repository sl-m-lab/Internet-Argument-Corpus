Today's rabbis say Isaiah 53 (which speaks of Christ) pertains to Israel as the \"suffering servant.\" Their ancient counterparts said it refers to the Messiah, i.e.\n \n Rabbi Moses Alschech(1508-1600) says:\n \"Our Rabbis with one voice accept and affirm the opinion that the prophet is speaking of the Messiah, and we shall ourselves also adhere to the same view.\"\n \n \n Babylonian Talmud: \"The Messiah --what is his name?...The Rabbis say, The Leper Scholar, as it is said, `surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him a leper, smitten of God and afflicted...'\" (Sanhedrin 98b) \n \n Midrash Ruth Rabbah: \"Another explanation (of Ruth ii.14): -- He is speaking of king Messiah; `Come hither,' draw near to the throne; `and eat of the bread,' that is, the bread of the kingdom; `and dip thy morsel in the vinegar,' this refers to his chastisements, as it is said, `But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities'\"\n Targum Jonathan: \"Behold my servant Messiah shall prosper; he shall be high and increase and be exceedingly strong...\"\n \n Zohar: \"`He was wounded for our transgressions,' etc....There is in the Garden of Eden a palace called the Palace of the Sons of Sickness; this palace the Messiah then enters, and summons every sickness, every pain, and every chastisement of Israel; they all come and rest upon him. And were it not that he had thus lightened them off Israel and taken them upon himself, there had been no man able to bear Israel's chastisements for the transgression of the law: and this is that which is written, `Surely our sicknesses he hath carried.'\"\n \n Rabbi Moses Maimonides: \"What is the manner of Messiah's advent....there shall rise up one of whom none have known before, and signs and wonders which they shall see performed by him will be the proofs of his true origin; for the Almighty, where he declares to us his mind upon this matter, says, `Behold a man whose name is the Branch, and he shall branch forth out of his place' (Zech. 6:12). And Isaiah speaks similarly of the time when he shall appear, without father or mother or family being known, He came up as a sucker before him, and as a root out of dry earth, etc....in the words of Isaiah, when describing the manner in which kings will harken to him, At him kings will shut their mouth; for that which had not been told them have they seen, and that which they had not heard they have perceived.\" (From the Letter to the South (Yemen), quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, pages 374-5)\n \n Rabbi Mosheh Kohen Ibn Crispin: This rabbi described those who interpret Isaiah 53 as referring to Israel as those: \"having forsaken the knowledge of our Teachers, and inclined after the `stubbornness of their own hearts,' and of their own opinion, I am pleased to interpret it, in accordance with the teaching of our Rabbis, of the King Messiah....This prophecy was delivered by Isaiah at the divine command for the purpose of making known to us something about the nature of the future Messiah, who is to come and deliver Israel, and his life from the day when he arrives at discretion until his advent as a redeemer, in order that if anyone should arise claiming to be himself the Messiah, we may reflect, and look to see whether we can observe in him any resemblance to the traits described here; if there is any such resemblance, then we may believe that he is the Messiah our righteousness; but if not, we cannot do so.\" (From his commentary on Isaiah, quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, pages 99-114.)\n \n Additional Rabbinic quotes in the following link:\n \n http://www.hearnow.org/isa_com.html",

Israel is never described as sinless. Isaiah 1:4 says of the nation: \"Alas sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity.

Are you suggesting that Jews have never complained about their oppression? That doesn't match history either. \n \n When was Israel cut off from the land of the living (v.8)? \n \n When was Israel assigned a grave with the rich (v.8)? \n \n When can we say that Israel did no violence (v.9)? Isaiah chapter 1, verse 15 states, \"Your hands are full of blood.\" They also went on a violent tear under the leadership of Joshua, etc., etc. \n \n When did Israel bear your iniquities (v.11)?

What blatant hypocrisy you present there.\n \n As for the Jews and their own Scriptures, they understand a good many things from their Tanakh, and many of them have received Jesus as the Messiah. But the fact remains they have had a hard time listening to God and their prophets.\n \n Why should we expect that they would recognize and receive their own Messiah when they killed and persecuted the prophets who told them about him? Even their own Tanakh confirms this:\n \n Jeremiah 25:4 And though the LORD has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention.\n \n Numbers 14:10 But the whole assembly talked about stoning them (Moses and Aaron). Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the Tent of Meeting to all the Israelites. 11 The LORD said to Moses, \"How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them? \n \n 2 Chronicles 36: 15 The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent word to them through his messengers again and again, because he had pity on his people and on his dwelling place. 16 But they mocked God's messengers, despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the LORD was aroused against his people and there was no remedy. \n \n And there's many more examples.",

   "The Dead Sea Scrolls \n \n \"The Crucified Messiah\" Scroll\n \n It is a five line scroll containing information about the death of the Messiah. It refers to \"the Prophet Isaiah\" and the Messianic prophecy in Isaiah 53 that identifies the Messiah as the one who will suffer for the sins of His people.\n \n It mentions the Messiah as the shoot of Jesse, the Branch of David, and also that He was pierced and wounded. Note the Messianic prophecy in Psalms 22:16 - \"They pierced my hands and feet.\" Also see Jeremiah 23:5 - \"I will raise unto David a righteous branch.\"\n \n The scroll identified the Messiah as \"the sceptre\" which most likely refers to the Genesis 49:10 prophecy, \"The sceptre shall not depeart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between His feet, until Shiloh come; and unto Him shall the gathering of the people be.\" \n \n http://members.aol.com/acoxon1274/crucified_messiah_scroll.html\n \n The Crucified Messiah Scroll\n \n In 1991 the world was astonished to hear that one of the unpublished scrolls included incredible references to a \"Messiah\" who suffered crucifixion for the sins of men. The scroll was translated by Dr. Robert Eisenman, Professor of Middle East Religions of California State University. He declared, \"The text is of the most far-reaching significance because it shows that whatever group was responsible for these writings was operating in the same general scriptural and Messianic framework of early Christianity.\" Although the original scroll team still claimed that there was no evidence about early Christianity in the unpublished scrolls, this new scroll totally contradicted their statements. This single scroll is earth-shaking in its importance. As Dr. Norman Golb, Professor of Jewish History at the University of Chicago said, \"It shows that contrary to what some of the editors said, there are lots of surprises in the scrolls, and this is one of them.\"\n \n This remarkable five-line scroll contained fascinating information about the death of the Messiah. It referred to \"the Prophet Isaiah\" and his Messianic prophecy (Chapter 53) that identified the Messiah as one who will suffer for the sins of his people. This scroll provides an amazing parallel to the New Testament revelation that the Messiah would first suffer death before He would ultimately return to rule the nations.\n \n http://members.surfeu.fi/foragnostics/deadsea_scrolls.htm\n \n Ask a Jew? Why did the Essenes (Jews) of the 1st century B.C. and A.D. believe in these apparent Christian beliefs?",

Why did the Essenes (Jews) of the 1st century B.C. and A.D. believe in these apparent Christian beliefs?\n\n \n \n Well, first of all, you would have to understand that the concept of the messiah is different in the Jewish religion than it is in the Christian reliigon. The Messiah in the Jewish religion was going to be a military leader that kicks the Romans out of Israel, and will be the new King of Israel. \n \n The Essenese were an appocolytic cult (not main stream), that thought that the battle to end all battles would come. They were obsessed with purity. \n \n They weren't looking for a 'cruxified messiah'. Please note , for example the\n translation of 'pierced' in Psalm 2 is incorrect, it shoudl be 'they were like a lion at my hands and feet'.. the word lion was properly translation by the KJV people before and after, making the use of 'pierced' in that pslam a purposeful mistranslation.\n \n In addition, the term 'Son of God' was a phrase that meant a rightous person.\n Yes, they were waiting for the 'rightous teacher' to come back from the dead.. but, since he had not yet, it could not have been Jesus.\n \n Mind you, the scroll did not mention cruxifiction at all, nor does it mention a name. The fact you want to project Jesus on it is speculation. It might be the source of the later resurection stories.. but waitin for someone to come back from the dead is not that person back from the dead. If the scroll does attempt to refer to a proto-jesus, the idea that he already was raised fromthe dead was not there yet.",

What makes you think that I'm under any obligation to fulfill your demands, especially when you've already dismissed my assertion as being spurious and unfounded without even considering whatever evidence I might provide? You're a strange guy, EZ. The information which you demand has already been compiled by individuals far more qualified than I. That information is readily available to you or anyone else. However, given your obvious disdain for authoritative Bible scholarship and your reliance on Christian fundamentalist websites as your sources, I can easily understand how this information could have escaped your attention. No matter. You don't need me to substantiate the fact that the NT resurrection accounts of Jesus cannot be reconciled. The evidence is contained within the NT itself. Read for yourself those accounts with a critical and objective eye, and you won't need my explanation. Your objection here is not unlike your objection to the idea that the Torah could not have been written by a single individual (Moses), despite the fact that a substantial amount of evidence which points to multiple authorship of the Torah is contained within the Torah itself. I find it amusing that you pay so little attention to the \"Word of God\".\n \n Given that I don't have the week or so necessary to comply with your above demands, I'm willing to provide links to sites which substantiate my assertion. I hesitate to do so, however, for reasons which I've already explained. I consider argument via link or cut&paste to be both cheap and lazy. If someone requests this from me, however, I will do so.\n \n Meanwhile, EZ, I have a suggestion for you - based on the NT narratives, tell us exactly what happened on Easter morning and the days following.

How many of them were there?[*]What was their purpose in going there?[*]Was the tomb already open when they arrived?[*]Who was at the tomb when they arrived?[*]What did these angels/men say to the women?[*]After the women, to whom did Jesus appear?[*]How long did Jesus remain on earth? \n Bonus question...\n [*]When is Jesus returning? As I've already pointed out to you, quoting from your own scripture, Jesus' followers thought his return to be imminent, heralding \"the end of all things\", \"in just a very little while\", \"without delay\". \n Remember, EZ, omit nothing from the narratives. And, no, I don't want some link.",

What makes you think that I'm under any obligation to fulfill your demands, especially when you've already dismissed my assertion as being spurious and unfounded without even considering whatever evidence I might provide? You're a strange guy, EZ. The information which you demand has already been compiled by individuals far more qualified than I....
