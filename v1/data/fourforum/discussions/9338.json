   "I think that pornography is a disgusting form of entertainment and i very degrading, and men don't realise that the women on these films are fake and would do anything for money. \n \n They also don't realise what it does to women that are in a relationship with them(yes, married men and unmarried men in a relationship so watch porn too) it makes them feel useless, ugly, used and unloved. It maked them think that they are worthless next to these great looking, big boobed, perfect bodied women and the men are that selfish thet they carry on doing it and don't think about the consequences.\n \n What they do in these videos is unatural and revolting. When you have sex with a partner/wife/husband it should be an amazing experince thats full of warmth and love for each other and it should be somethig that only the two of you share, it's the best moment you canhave with each other, you get to show each other how much you want them and express you're love throught it too. But in these porn movies it's just about dirty sex and \"kinky\" things likw whips/dildos etc, it really is disgusting and a lot of people don't realise that it creates a lot of insecurity in women and men and leaves them depressed because they're always striving to be like the pornstars and celebrities and then maybe their partner/wife/husband might have sex with them instead of themselves while imagining horrible things.\n \n Does anyone else have an opinion??",

It makes women think that they have to be fake to be liked/loved. This is why we have young girls being anorexic and getting plastic surgery all for the sake of a man to have a wank.\n \n \n I'd say that it is fashion and the media in general that is causing that sort of thing, certainly not porn. The sexualisation of young girls' fashion I'd say is more a trend due to feminism and the blurring of gender rolls, its not porn that is making young women go out 'drinking with the rest of the lads' its them deciding it looks like fun and being involved in more traditionally male activities. This is why there has been a change in the way young womens' sex drives have been perceived - they are now seen the same as young mens'.\n \n Women during Elizabethan times would wear arsnic based paint to make them seem pale, which resulted in a drastic reduction in health and lifespan - anorexia isn't much different than this or the binding of children's feet in Japan. Female circumsion is carried out due to people thinking that women \"want sex all the time and have to give sex in this way\" and the societies its practiced in are generally too primative for our sort of porn.\n \n Do you not think its possible for porn to reflect something else as well - its not all stick thin models with huge boobs, certainly nothing stopping you from doing a more romantic, loving couple focused porn. There is already a huge market for 'amatuer porn' because a lot of people don't like the fakeness of other stuff.\n \n \n\n You consider it an art but would you film you and your partner and then show it to evryone and would you show this so called art to your children, i don't think so, it's not art it's trash (oh, if you want art like that i'll go take a picture of my bin). Just face it porn is for wankers (pardon my language) not artists.\n\n Can't draw to save my life, so wouldn't put that art up on show. Don't even like acting or singing in front of people either, not to mention naked bodies like mine are the reason for obscenity laws ;)\n \n Art is fairly nebulous to describe really - if its a creative piece designed to illicit an emotional response then couldn't a work of art incorperate porn if its intention was to disgust you and highlight the cheapness of modern life, stretching the boundaries of our currently oversexed advertising. Ballet is all about showing off a body and what it is capable of doing, harmonising it with the music, whilst its not my sort of thing (but then nor is ballet) I don't see what is fundamentally different about sex that would prevent you from doing the same, afterall a lot of modern dance routines certainly simulate sex as well.\n \n Just to set the record straight, I'm not some deviant with vast archives of porn and a dungeon, I've never even owned anything like FHM or anything. However I think you are being unrealistic in laying so much blame on it, most of the things you complain about I think are far more likely to be either the negative effects of very positive changes (increased equality between the sexs and huge boosts in the levels of communication) or fairly unchanging issues that have been with us since the beginning of civilisation.",

   "In the 1980s, conservatives and feminists joined to fight a common nemesis: the spread of pornography. Unlike past campaigns to stamp out smut, this one was based not only on morality but also public safety. They argued that hard-core erotica was intolerable because it promoted sexual violence against women.\n \n \"Pornography is the theory; rape is the practice,\" wrote feminist author Robin Morgan. In 1986, a federal commission concurred. Some kinds of pornography, it concluded, are bound to lead to \"increased sexual violence.\" Indianapolis passed a law allowing women to sue producers for sexual assaults caused by material depicting women in \"positions of servility or submission or display.\"\n \n The campaign fizzled when the courts said the ordinance was an unconstitutional form of \"thought control.\" Though the Bush administration has put new emphasis on prosecuting obscenity, on the grounds that it fosters violence against women, pornography is more available now than ever.\n \n That's due in substantial part to the rise of the Internet, where the United States alone has a staggering 244 million Web pages featuring erotic fare. One Nielsen survey found that one out of every four users say they visited adult sites in the last month.\n \n So in the last two decades, we have conducted a vast experiment on the social consequences of such material. If the supporters of censorship were right, we should be seeing an unparalleled epidemic of sexual assault. But all the evidence indicates they were wrong. As raunch has waxed, rape has waned.\n \n This is part of a broad decrease in criminal mayhem. Since 1993, violent crime in America has dropped by 58 percent. But the progress in this one realm has been especially dramatic. Rape is down 72 percent and other sexual assaults have fallen by 68 percent. Even in the last two years, when the FBI reported upticks in violent crime, the number of rapes continued to fall.\n \n Nor can the decline be dismissed as the result of underreporting. Many sexual assaults do go unreported, but there is no reason to think there is less reporting today than in the past. In fact, given everything that has been done to educate people about the problem and to prosecute offenders, victims are probably more willing to come forward than they used to be.\n \n No one would say the current level of violence against women is acceptable. But the enormous progress in recent years is one of the most gratifying successes imaginable.\n \n How can it be explained? Perhaps the most surprising and controversial account comes from Clemson University economist Todd Kendall, who suggests that adult fare on the Internet may essentially inoculate against sexual assaults.\n \n In a paper presented at Stanford Law School last year, he reported that, after adjusting for other differences, states where Internet access expanded the fastest saw rape decline the most. A 10 percent increase in Internet access, Kendall found, typically meant a 7.3 percent reduction in the number of reported rapes. For other types of crime, he found no correlation with Web use. What this research suggests is that sexual urges play a big role in the incidence of rape -- and that pornographic Web sites provide a harmless way for potential predators to satisfy those desires.\n http://www.reason.com/news/show/123330.html?",

   "Porn is essentially nothing but a big waste of time. Why are we busy looking at this when we could have something better to do? There is no security on the internet; a horny twelve year old could easily access any porn website, because you don't need to provide any evidence whatsoever to prove that you're eighteen or older. And I think most porn site owners like it this way. A greater span of veiwers means more money, and everyone on this forum is well aware that the only true God is money in today's society. \n \n And covering pornstars, I could compare them to dogs. \"Sit! Good boy, here's a doggy treat!\" \"Get naked! Good, here's your paycheck.\" I'm sure there are very intelligent people who waste their lives as pornstars when they could have a job where they actually help our society rather than waste our time. And they cause many people to waste their time chasing fantasies when they could be out doing something useful for us. \n \n And finally; why would you want to waste money for something when in reality, all you're doing is making some lazy bum rich? This is a classic example of people getting \"something for nothing\". They live off our money while making no contribution of their own to society. To them, I say \"Get a real job!\" All work is honorable as long as you make contributions to society. Even if you have a lowly job, like a waiter, a Wal-mart unloader, or even a toilet scrubber, I respect you just as much as I do professional people. But if the only thing you're doing is taking money from somebody without giving them anything useful, then you're just a leech.

   "Well I think alot of things are sad but I'm not trying to stop people from doing them. \n\n \n *sigh*. Haven't I already explained that this argument was a strawman? How many times to I have to tell you?\n \n \nabout your other points you have a point but the fact that your source for some reason has a bias towards males makes me unwilling to will credit it completely. If it had done females and males I'd be a little more willing to believe it. \n\n \n Like I pointed out in a post that you had no answer to, you're focusing on trying to refute my sources rather than supporting your own point. Regardless of what anyone says, this gives me the upper hand no matter how horribly I debate. If I wanted to, I could post 100% ad homs and lies on here, but since I posted sources, my point is still more valid. It's not helping you. \n \n \nYes VGs are addictive. (Beat Star Ocean for the 20th time yesterday) but the same can be said of reading. Which somehow no one has a problem with even though books can be just as ographic and violent as books and movies :xbanghead\n\n \n Which is more addicting? or video games? And you also may want to prove this. Just because you think you're addicted doesn't mean that it acts as a narcotic. You're one person; maybe lacking self-control?\n \n \nIn the end what you're trying to do is censorship which I don't agree with. I don't care if its negative or if you don't like it censoring something that other people enjoy despite the fact that you don't like what it is simply isn't acceptable. I don't like having to look at people being intimate (kissing folks not the other intimate...though yeah that too) in public. I find it annoying does that mean that because I and several other people don't like it that it should be banned? Of course not. It's a right people have the same with ography. As long as consensual people are making it its perfectly legal and I feel that no matter how filthy or perverse or evil you feel it is you should understand that censorship is wrong. No matter how you try to spin it.\n\n \n *sigh*... How many times have you used this strawman now? At least five... at least five. Let me make it clear to you: I never said I wanted to censor or ban the stuff. I'm just pointing out the effects. You have used this strawman despite the number of times I pointed this out to you.

I'm not arguing that pornographic industry's (which is a big one, much bigger than people realize, and therefore a serious consideration) employment opportunities in some way \"redeem\" the industry. The jobs apparently involve quite hard work, and apparently, not many actors last long.\n \n However, I just don't think there's all that much to redeem. Apart from the monotheistic preoccupation with the morality of it, there are not all that many problems arising from porn. There are issues, and the industry usually also deals with them quite effectively. Yes, you get issues of forced labor in porn. But then, you get forced labor all over the place. From chinese slaves forced to carry just fired bricks without gloves to children forced to weave the finest silk rugs. \n \n Regarding the recent activity: I find a study that shows that men who watch porn are more likely to rape rather suspect - until now, the studies I have read about (few people actually read the studies themselves, they just read summations) indicate the opposite: porn acts as a release, a safety valve. It certainly goes against my opinion on whether a male with empty balls or full balls is more aggressive and likely to rape. Hell, being a male, my personal experience would suggest the opposite...\n \n \n BTW, the stuff this thread made me read...

However if there was a wa to restrict certain porn like child porn and such it would be better but sadly with as wide and broad as the internet it, it's an impossibility.",

Before anyone comments, I'm not saying it should be banned, but hentai can express the most disgusting fantasies of the sickest people on earth. \n \n Photo porn isn't as bad, because what the model (who actually exists, by the way) can do on camera is bound by law and her physical appearance. But artists are more creative, and their women can look like however the artist wants them to look. Hentai can express the most morbid fantasies from the perverted, twisted mind of a hentai artist. Images depicting gorey deaths, rape, sadistic fantasies, death, or pedophilia can be published and veiwed by people across an entire nation. And while some contries censor it more than others, every picture can be displayed somewhere. \n \n If you have a real, underaged model who you lacerate, rape, mutilate, and kill, you go to prison and, as sex offenders aren't particulary liked in prisons, you probably end up being someone's bitch.
