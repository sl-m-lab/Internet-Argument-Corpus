(I don't know the reason for this... maybe they didn't want to be joined).\n \n Likewise, Guam has more incommon with the newly created states around it... such as the Federation of Micronesia.\n \n Guam will not become a state though, because it's a major haven for companies that want to rort US labour laws.\n \n There's thousands of Chinese and Fillapina women who are drawn there to work in US factories, thinking that because its a US territory they'll get decent wages, but they don't!
