   "What does this have to do with being gay? This is about the core tenants of Christianity.\n\n \n I think the church has already done a pretty good job of summing up its core beliefs. In fact it's done it two or three times (and no, non-believers burning in hell doesn't feature, neither does homosexuality):\n I believe in God, the Father almighty, \n creator of heaven and earth. \n I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, \n who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, \n born of the Virgin Mary, \n suffered under Pontius Pilate, \n was crucified, died, and was buried; \n he descended to the dead. \n On the third day he rose again; \n he ascended into heaven, \n he is seated at the right hand of the Father, \n and he will come to judge the living and the dead. \n I believe in the Holy Spirit, \n the holy catholic Church, \n the communion of saints, \n the forgiveness of sins, \n the resurrection of the body, \n and the life everlasting. \n Amen. \n \n We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen. \n We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father; through him all things were made. \n For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven, was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and was made man. \n For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried. \n On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. \n He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. \n We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. \n We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. \n We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. \n We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. \n Amen",

AD, he never calls one of them a Messiah. Granted that silence, it is remarkable that both of the Josephus references to Jesus allude to him as christos (Ant. 18.3.3; #63; 20.9.1 #200).If we take at face value later rabbinic references, they tell us that Rabbi Aqiba hailed Simon ben Kosiba as the Messiah (AD 130), but before him in these centuries there seems to be no identifiable Jew hailed as the kingly messiah other than Jesus of Nazareth [my emphasis]. I stress this so that in the following disccusion some commonly found but erroneus ideas may be discounted. There was a not a single national expectation of the Messiah; one cannot argue that if Jesus' followers thought he was sent by God, they would have had to say he was the Messiah.\n",

The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs\" (CCC 1035).\n \n In his 1994 book, Crossing the Threshold of Hope, Pope John Paul II wrote that too often \"preachers, catechists, teachers . . . no longer have the courage to preach the threat of hell\" (p. 183).\n \n Concerning the reality of hell, the pope says, \"In point of fact, the ancient councils rejected the theory . . . according to which the world would be regenerated after destruction, and every creature would be saved; a theory which abolished hell. . . . [T]he words of Christ are unequivocal. In Matthew's Gospel he speaks clearly of those who will go to eternal punishment (cf. Matt. 25:46). [But] who will these be? The Church has never made any pronouncement in this regard\" (pp. 185-6). The Hell There Is!\n \n Hell is real, according to Christian dogma.\n Jhn 3:16 \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, [fn] that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. \n \n It seems incredibly clear that those who do not believe in Jesus WILL \"perish\".",

   "I think he displays a total (deliberate?) lack of understanding of Christian theology in a particularly unoriginal and condescending way. It's like Archangel's atheist twin.\n\n \n It's time to call a spade a spade, and some xtian nut jobs tend to get terribly offended when they are slapped in the face with the ridiculous nature of the nonsense (I mean it literally) they are promulgating. Stiff cheese I say. The damage this absurd myth has done and continues to do, far outweighs the sensitive feelings of the sook brigade emoticon_cry that pretends their religious institutions had nothing to do with the inquisitions, that their beliefs are not the barbaric practices endorsed by the old testament (cherry pickers) and they are nothing to do with the recent strife in Northern Ireland and even Bush's war ordained by God! \n \n The list of atrocities, wars and injustices, that Christianity needs to be held accountable for along with other religions is astounding. I for one am fed up with religion and the disastrous effects it has on our societies. If you want to see a deliberate lack of understanding of something, go check out a fundamentalist pretending to 'understand' thermodynamics to use it as an argument against evolution. This guy mocks the absurdity that the Bible itself presents. I note that you haven't pointed out what he got wrong. Is Jesus not God for instance? i.e: God = Jesus. I may be wrong, but I am sure it says this in the Bible. Did Jesus not come back from the dead? That makes him a zombie in my books. In fact, were it not for the resurrection of Jesus, Christians might not need to believe zombies were anything other than monsters from fantasy horror stories. Except that is for the actual zombie story about the people climbing out of their graves in Mathew 27:52 & 53 Presuming the souls of these people were already in heaven/hell/purgatory or whatever, then these corpses are just a silly puppet show put on by God. Real zombies. Soulless, animate corpses walking around the streets. \n \n This is the kind of nonsense fairytale (more like horror story) rubbish you believe? And you wonder why people scoff and ridicule Christianity. !! News flash !! IT'S BECAUSE THE #### IS RIDICULOUS. Screwed up bat-#### crazy nonsense. Not just a little speculative, not just somewhat far fetched; It's out and out bat-#### crazy, loony tunes, wacko jacko, loopy woo woo, deluded, absurd, ridiculous, idiotic unbridled nonsense. If you believe this #### you'd believe anything. It just begs to be ridiculed. You know how wacko it is, when you go to write a parody and can't imagine anything more patently absurd than the real (actually unreal) thing itself. \n \n The real complaint though would be how evil it is to evade accountability for wrong doing by accepting the principle of atonement and retribution in the manner of a scapegoat for the sins of future or past generations. I don't want a reprieve for my sins thank you very much. Nor will I stand for any guilt trip laid at my feet for the sins of an ancestor or descendant. Your imaginary friend can go and screw himself... to a cross, for all I care, it has nothing to do with me. As far as I am concerned the Bible scribes got their idea of Jesus from the Yom Kippur (Look it up in Wikipedia. I cant post links yet). BAD JUJU. \n \n Regards FWIW Skepticus.",

   "You'd be surprised how many believe in Jesus as their resurrected Savior for the remission of their sins.\n\n \n Not at all. That is the core of Christian belief. Do you think that because you can find one thing which they don't disagree about completely, that it negates my point? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Lakrite said: \n \n \nA Christian knows more about Christianity than a non-Christian.\n\n \n To which I pointed out the volumes of general disagreement between Xtians. If the Christians themselves can't even agree in broad principal what constitutes their belief then they can hardly expect to extract millage by contradicting an outsider and berating them on the grounds of specialized knowledge. Christians don't have specialized knowledge beyond that which is wrote learned and regurgitated; certainly none which is required to don the mantle of 'Christan'.\n \n In my experience you walk into a church and they don't give a damn about your general knowledge of Christianity or the Bible. If you can bring yourself to utter the words \"I accept Jesus Christ as my savior\" or \"take the holy spirit into my heart\" or some such inane blathering you are 'IN' like Flin. Moreover small children who can't even comprehend the concepts of retribution for original sin or how to differentiate the truth from the most obvious fallacy (Santa Tooth Fairy et.al.) are indoctrinated into this religious dogma from the cradle. They don't rely on esoteric knowledge, to establish the deeper understanding of what appears to outsiders ridiculous absurdity. What they rely on is ignorance and naivety. They rely on emotional outpouring and the blackmail and bribery of heaven and hell. They put the fear of Hell into you and goad you to enjoin the fray of wishful thinkers, by promising the (useless) power of prayer, reminding you that god is watching and comforting lonely approval seeking people with the company of a swaddling fellowship.\n \n Those are the pre-requisites and motives for adopting Christian faith, and specialized knowledge doesn't get anywhere near it. Most Christians in my experience have an appalling lack of Bible knowledge. It comes as no surprise that when they are dealing with the doctrines of original sin and divine retribution, they conveniently evade and ignore the doctrine of trinity. Original sin and divine retribution, can only make sense if Jesus and God were completely individual entities. To have anything approaching an understanding of this, there has to be something approaching meaning, but identifying two different characters with their own mind, personality, will etc, is semantically distinct from one entity with one mind, personality, will, etc, albeit having a triune manifestation. It may not be meaningless or absurd that a god may create for itself an embodiment in the form of a divine human, but it is meaningless or absurd for this god to have that embodiment punished to redeem somebody else's sins. The punishment of death to an immortal being is absurd (notice that Jesus didn't stay dead and since he would only go to heaven, the act of dying isn't punishment anyhow) the punishment of Self is absurd. The supposed displaced retribution for sins of other people is absurd. \n \n The concept of the trinity in and of itself is absurd. Either Jesus was an individual or the embodiment of God, take you're pick, otherwise defining the meaning of words is useless. To try reconciling this by saying non-Christians just can't understand this is disingenuous bullshiit. Actually, it's true. Non-Christians just can't understand it. Nor can Christians. Nobody can understand it because it is just plain and simply nonsensical. Christians pretending that they have a secret language used to divulge meaning between mutually inconsistent claims, that makes an otherwise absurd set of claims seem plausible, is as fantastic and far fetched as any of their other claims. But now we have to wonder how anybody ever becomes a Christian in the first place if, supposing they had an open mind and was receptive to the possibility that the Christian doctrine might be false, well... a set of absurd claims would usually put paid to the validity of any idea to a rational person. If you have to be a Christian with a history of imbibing the dogma, to 'understand' how this absurdity is reconciled. I am not surprised you can convince yourself that however ridiculous the claims your belief makes, you must somehow desperately find an excuse to cop out of admitting that there are absurdities, lies, contradictions and fanciful claims made by the bucket loads in your chosen dogma.\n \n An absurdity in anybody else's dogma, you would no doubt happily point out in a flash and take any amount of liberties to contradict the absurd and meaningless claims of other competitor faiths. If they proclaimed that the seemingly absurd was only able to be resolved by somebody of their faith, and that if you could only understand it, you would see that your faith is wrong and theirs it the one true faith. No doubt I could corner a Muslim, Hindu or a Bahia, with the same predictable results. A debate would boil down to privileged insider knowledge. All religious dogmas use the same tricks. They would also refuse to be held accountable, even to the sensible semantic definition of words. If you can't even agree to honor common semantics, but seek to pretend that your nonsense only has to make sense to somebody who already believes it, then you are only making a case for a self supporting delusion. It is circular reasoning or begging the question. Of course it makes sense to the deluded follower, you have bought into the mythology and have an emotional investment in desperately trying to bolster your faith against the howling winds of reason. You are willfully avoiding any cognitive dissonance. \n \n There's no point being in a debate with somebody if you refuse to accept common grounds of reaching conclusions. Circular reasoning (such as 'you have to be a Christian to understand it') is just pathetic excuse making for being shown how ridiculous your belief is. You've been handed your XXX in your hat, now you want to pretend that your hat is a part of your abdomen. You should really have the decency to admit right from the outset, that you intend in a squeeze to cry 'It's true because I believe it'. Admit that you are seeking a position which is irrefutable by design rather than intellectual honesty. That kind of peeves me off, because Christians know that they have no intention of exercising intellectual integrity, that no argument presented will ever be allowed to show they are laboring under a misconception. They shouldn't even be attempting to debate in the first place when they know very well they have dogmatic closed minds and won't ever allow themselves to concede any misconception in their hardwired emotional beliefs. \n \n This claim about 'special knowledge' or understanding issue has a natural analog which I believe is more than just analogous, but take it as you see fit: The Christian who proclaims that \"A Christian knows more about Christianity than a non-Christian\" is no different/better than a schizophrenic who insists that a schizophrenic knows more about schizophrenia than a non-schizophrenic. Maybe so, but their specialized knowledge is only of what it subjectively feels like to suffer from this condition and it is of no use to have their experience, in order to understand why it occurs, or how to treat it. Likewise, experiencing a delusional belief is not going to give you any greater insight into how delusional it is. On the contrary, most delusions are self reinforcing. They are attached to strong emotional motivators. In this case having a savior, redemption of sins, everlasting life in heaven. etc... are all good reasons to avoid facing reality. \n \n Believing a Christian even wants to face the truth is asking too much, so when they are shown some absurdity of their beliefs, it is no surprise they plead that they know better and that their magical understanding (inside of their belief) is the saving grace, of the belief itself. Again anybody can make such claims even a person who is mentally disturbed. I think the distinction is immaterial. Religion is just delusion IMHO.\n \n The specialized knowledge Christians claim to have is torn asunder, in a disarray of bleating squabbling factions. This guy has gotten as much factually right, with his parody, as any Christian, by the only real 'standards' of interdenominational faith. So pointing out that Christians at least agree on X where X = the requirement to \"believe in Jesus as their resurrected Savior for the remission of their sins.\" Is saying that you agree that this guy has accurately identified the central tenets of Christianity, because he did include X. He did indicate that Christians believe Jesus died for our sins i.e. \"God sent himself down to earth, to sacrifice himself to himself...\" (We all know very well he is talking about Christ as the embodiment of God, and that the doctrine of the trinity, makes an absurdity of the divine retribution.) \"...because bleeding on a cross, was the only way that he could convince himself to forgive us, for the fact than an ancestor of ours, who was made from a rib, ate a magic fruit that she wasn't supposed to eat, after being tricked by a talking snake.\" \n \n Well, it's all there including the original sin. He has paraphrased every aspect of Christian doctrine that All Christians should agree with. Anything more and we would be into areas which even Christians wont agree about. So that is the barest fundamental essence of your Christian myth and as you have pointed out Easyrider, that is enough subject matter to claim substantiative agreement between Christians. You can't have it both ways. \n \n The complaint (the ad hom/irrelivent diversion presented by Lakrite ) was that this guy doesn't know enough to comment: \n \n Originally Posted by Lakrite:\n \nI don't understand how someone who is not a Christian believes that they are all knowing and can sum up Christian beliefs.\n \n\n \n I responded by pointing out how little Christians 'know' in whatever sense of the word you care for, by pointing out how little agreement they share with each other. \n \n That reply is countered by your comment: \n \n \nYou'd be surprised how many believe in Jesus as their resurrected Savior for the remission of their sins.\n\n \n Do you concur that if Christians can be allowed such a small island of agreement in what it is they believe, the subject matter accurately reflected by the youtube guy is more than adequate to counter Lakrite's original complaint? This guy knows as much about Christian doctrine as Christians 'know' about themselves. \n \n \nBut about divisiveness, even scientists don't all agree on evolution.\n\n \n Heads up: No qualified biologist disagrees with biological evolution by natural selection in the professional arena. They do not write peer reviewed papers to criticize it and offer more plausible explanations. No. The vast majority of biologists, are in agreement that the process of evolution is an undeniable fact of reality. They do so because it is a massive body of knowledge about which a vast plethora of evidence is in play and because they know what they are talking about. \n \n Division however, is acceptable in science in areas where there is room for speculation. The products of agreement in science are all about you. There is plenty of agreement that encompasses every product in your world that depends upon science. Not just high tech gadgets like your computer, but multitudes of everyday objects from your polyester weave pullover to your headache pill to your light switch / wires / bulb and electricity. The radio and weather report bantering forth from it, are all science. The reason that all of these things work, is that scientists don't just seek agreement with each other, they must also reach agreement with the laws of nature. Nothing they think or say, will matter one iota if their postulations do not confer with the actual empirical facts of reality. The difference (one of them) between scientist and theologians, is that the scientists interpretation of reality must ultimately be checked against one completely neutral collaborator. Her name is Mother Nature. \n \n You have found one thing which which Christians agree upon, and even then, they are indoctrinated with that (often as a child) from their earliest infant communications. They are told 'this is what you must believe' and 'that' at the barest bones of Christian doctrine is the original sin and redemption. Anything else they may be told to believe varies from doctrine to doctrine, individual to individual. Not that disagreement is a bad thing but when we are told that \"A Christian knows more about Christianity than a non-Christian.\", it kind of matters that there should be a coherent set of knowledge about which anybody could be meaningfully said to be knowledgeable. \n \n To your credit Easyrider, to have found one thing about which all Christians agree, but that is little more than the definition of Christianity. If they didn't believe this much, then they wouldn't even be Christians and probably wouldn't even try to claim they were. So Christians disagree on practically everything possible to disagree on while still being identifiably Christians. By comparison you have attempted to point out a single article of disagreement in biological science. The claim that \"not all scientists agree on evolution\". Well that firstly, is carelessly worded and ambiguous. What disagreement are we talking about? The mechanisms of gene prorogation; the importance of secondary selection methods (i.e. kin / sexual etc. ); punctuated equilibrium vs gradualism; what? I might suspect you mean the nonsense that evolution may not even be a fact of nature. \n \n When you are called out by Penfold on the meaninglessness of the statement, you elaborate \"There's scientists and biologists on both sides of the evolution issue.\" Again just what evolution issue are you talking about? Aside from details within biology about several issues regarding the precise mechanisms of evolution, the only 'issue' I know about is the completely fabricated fundamentalist creationist myth, that evolution is a false hypothesis (which they nevertheless call a theory, because their followers are to scientifically illiterate to know the difference). \n \n So (if the latter is your intended meaning of 'issue') I will challenge you to furnish the references to peer reviewed academic science papers, in which qualified research biologists can be seen providing plausible refutations of mainstream evolutionary biology. Otherwise the only side of the issue competent, qualified biologists, are on is the one supported by evidence and reason, that evolution by natural selection, is a fact of nature which is as firmly established, as the rotation of the earth on it's axis and about the sun. \n \n ps: If you are going to respond Easyrider, could you please try to make yourself clearer and give some relevant details to qualify what you are talking about. If you make a claim for instance, about the existence of scientists who support X view, the convention in cordial debate is to provide references to their publications. Save the person you are talking to the effort of having to ask you to furnish this information and show you are not bluffing and eager to move the debate forward and to get to the crux of it.\n \n Regards Skep.",

   " Please identify for us the specific hominid who is man's immediate, direct-line ancestor, and supply the conclusive DNA evidence to back it up. \n\n \n \nOtherwise it's a house of cards.\n\n \n Why? Because you don't know about any other evidence that supports evolution and can't think of any other evidence which might? You wish to just plonk down a truculent demand that X is the evidence you require to find evolution valid, and of course that evidence is impossible and unnecessary because you are predisposed to fabricating strawmen upon which to clothe your ignorant dogma. Your unfettered arrogance, is as desirable as a maggot shiit sandwich. Who died and left you in charge of biological research? By what metric do you even propose to establish yourself as a worthy candidate to stipulate any evidence required? Are you a biologist? You don't sound like one. You do realize don't you, that people study for years to make it through postdoctoral degrees before they are considered informed/learned enough to contribute to theoretical speculation. Doing such things as deciding what evidence to look for, is not a job for the carnival clown. emoticon_xclown \n \n Never mind though. Come on then show us your metal. Just for the hell of it, lets see if you can anticipate some of the necessary points of evidence you might require to establish the furtive links between recent hominid ancestors.

Try again.\n \n If you want DNA evidence, I will suggest you must look farther afield and to living species, it can be use to provide indirect empirical support for more recent hominid ancestors.
