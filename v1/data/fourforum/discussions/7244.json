   "Here is an article from the very conservative AEI, that details some of the probable problems the Abramoff corruption case is going to cause the Republicans.\n \n http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.23341,filter.all/pub_detail.asp\n \n \nOne central player was DeLay's key staffer, Tony Rudy, who worked hand-in-glove with Abramoff from the inside, e-mailing him internal House memos, telling him what was going on in closed-door sessions and giving him advice on what to do. \n \n His performance as a secret agent, or mole, inside the House was so helpful that Abramoff soon hired him directly as a lobbyist. Even before that, Abramoff made sure that some of the fees in the $2 million eLottery campaign went to Toward Tradition, the Orthodox Jewish organization run by conservative rabbi and Abramoff friend Daniel Lapin, who just happened to hire Rudy's wife to be a consultant. \n \n snip\n \n money paid for part of the now-infamous May 2000 golfing trip to St. Andrews in Scotland that included both DeLay and Rudy. The greens fees alone exceeded $5,000 a day. \n \n Money, lots of money, also went to the Rev Lou Sheldon's Traditional Values Coalition and to Ralph Reed, former head of the Christian Coalition, with some of Reed's money flowing through Grover Norquist's group Americans for Tax Reform, and other funds were shuffled through other intermediate groups to hide its source\n \n snip\n \n The same pattern of laundering money through a series of organizations, real and shell, is characteristic of DeLay as well, as another recent story, this one by The Associated Press, makes clear. DeLay and his temporary successor as House Majority Leader, Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), deliberately raised far more soft money than they needed to finance parties at the 2000 GOP Convention. They then shuffled the excess funds from from corporations and other interests--hundreds of thousands of dollars worth-- back and forth between each other via their leadership PACs, Americans for a Republican Majority PAC and the Rely On Your Beliefs Fund. \n \n Some of the money ended up at the Alexander Strategy Group, a lobbying firm headed by a former DeLay chief of staff and employing DeLay's wife. Some ended up with the Missouri Republican Party, which in turn made generous contributions to Matt Blunt, Roy's son, who was then running an ultimately successful campaign for Missouri secretary of state. (He is now governor.) Some of the funds came from Northern Marianas Islands-based Concorde Garment Manufacturing, part of a coalition of companies, considered sweatshops by critics, that had hired Abramoff as a lobbyist. \n \n \n\n \n A number of top Republicans are likely to be named, and this is going to hurt the Republicans more then the Democrats, just in time for the 2006 mid terms",
