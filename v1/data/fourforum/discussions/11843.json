Evolutionary theory makes predictions about what we should find if all extant life on earth had a common ancestor, and those predictions have been confirmed (ubiquity of base pairs etc). But consider a hypothetical situation where we find life on another planet. Evolutionary theory predicts what we should expect if life here and there had a common ancestor.

That alone tells me that creationism does nothing to advance knowledge. Therefor it can in no way lay claim to any type of commerical product.\n\n \n Hi baconsbud, the reason I haven't responded to this thread is because the premise upon which it's based is false. You see, creationism doesn't claim to be a science at all. So why would it be expected to result in commercial products? Creationism is based on the biblical explanation of Creation, and nothing more. It is a spiritual explanation for why and how God spoke life and the world into existence. \n \n Now, is that to say that believers in creation, ie christians haven't made great and important scientific contributions to this world? Of course they have and the list is extensive. But to ask the question about what commercial products creationism has contributed is such a loaded question, and child knew that before he asked it. But here is the contribution christianity made to science, and it desacrilized it for the world at large since pagans used to worship nature, believing it to be guided by spirits which they feared angering. It was a belief in God which nullified that fear and made nature something to be explored rather than feared.\n \n Not a Threat: The Contributions of Christianity to Western SocietyContributions to Science\n \n Perhaps the area in which Christianity has been the most vociferously attacked in this century has been the area of science. Religion and science are thought by many to be like oil and water; the two simply don't mix. Religion is thought to offer superstition while science offers facts.\n It would seem, however, that those who make such a charge haven't given much attention to the history of science. In their book, The Soul of Science,{5} authors Nancy Pearcey and Charles Thaxton make a case for the essential role Christianity played in the development of science. The authors point out four general ways Christianity has positively influenced its development.{6}\n \n First, Christianity provided important presuppositions of science. The Bible teaches that nature is real, not an illusion. It teaches that is has value and that it is good to work with nature. Historically this was an advance over pagan superstitions because the latter saw nature as something to be worshipped or as something filled with spirits which weren't to be angered. As one theologian wrote, \"Nature was thus abruptly desacralized, stripped of many of its arbitrary, unpredictable, and doubtless terrifying aspects.\"{7}\n \n Also, because it was created by God in an orderly fashion, nature is lawful and can be understood. That is, it follows discernible patterns which can be trusted not to change. \"As the creation of a trustworthy God, nature exhibited regularity, dependability, and orderliness. It was intelligible and could be studied. It displayed a knowable order.\"{8}\n \n Second, Christianity sanctioned science. Science \"was justified as a means of alleviating toil and suffering.\"{9} With animistic and pantheistic cultures, God and nature were so closely related that man, being a part of nature, was incapable of transcending it, that is, of gaining any real control over it. A Christian world view, however, gave man the freedom to subject nature to his needs-with limitations, of course-because man relates primarily to God who is over nature. Technology-or science applied-was developed to meet human needs as an expression of our God-given duty to one another. As one historian put it, \"the Christian concept of moral obligation played an important role in attracting people to the study of nature.\"{10}\n \n Third, Christianity provided motives for pursuing scientific knowledge. As scientists learned more about the wonders of the universe, they saw God's glory being displayed.\n \n Fourth, Christianity \"played a role in regulating scientific methodology.\"{11} Previously, the world was thought to work in perfectly rational ways which could be known primarily through logical deduction. But this approach to science didn't work. Planets don't have to orbit in circular patterns as some people concluded using deductive logic; of course, it was discovered by investigation that they didn't. A newer way of understanding God's creation put the emphasis on God's will. Since God's will couldn't be simply deduced through logical reasoning, experimentation and investigation were necessary. This provided a particular theological grounding for empirical science.\n \n The fact is that it was distinctly Christian beliefs which provided the intellectual and moral foundations for the study of nature and for its application through technology. Thus, although Christianity and some scientists or scientific theories might be in opposition, Christianity and science are not.Not a Threat: The Contributions of Christianity to Western Society\n \n \n Just out of curiosity, what commercial products / tangible products from evolution have been named in this thread?

   "Your delusionality knows no bounds. \n \n \n \n Nice fallacy of changing the subject there. No one argued that someone who believes in Creationism yet practiced actual science can't contribute to world knowledge. \n \n This is entirely about creationism as a science and its fundamental failures to produce anything outside of print. \n \n Thanks for citing a link that specifically discusses theists who have accepted modern science.\n \n Now getting away from your blatant fallacy, name me something other then print that creation science has commercialized\n\n \n First of all, changing the subject isn't a fallacy. Secondly, your question is loaded since you wont accept inventions or scientific discoveries by christians based on their faith in God. From the George Washington Carver link above; here is what it say's about him.\n A devout Christian, Carver considered his laboratory \"God's Little Workshop.\" He discovered that peanuts and soybeans would restore soil fertility, but farmers complained that they had no market for these products. To provide markets, Carver developed 300 products from peanuts and 118 from sweet potatoes. By 1940 peanuts had become the South's second largest crop. During World War II he developed 500 dyes. \n \n  Archangel It is fair to say that had he not been a believer in God, ie a creationist, he may never have had the curiosity or the creativity to see the 300 products which came from Peanuts and 118 from sweet potatoes, hundreds of uses for soy Soybeans, George Washington Carver or the 500 dyes he invented. And remember, this was a second class citizen who rose above his station in life and accomplished more than the vast majority of whites who had unlimited opportunities in life. \n \n In 1916 he was honored by being appointed to the Royal Society of Arts in London. In 1923 he received the NAACP's prestigious Spingarn Medal. In 1938 a feature film, Life of George Washington Carver , was made. Before his death in 1943, he received the Roosevelt Medal for Outstanding Contribution to Southern Agriculture. The Hall of Fame for Great Americans inducted him in 1977. The National Inventors Hall of Fame included him in 1990. \n \n Carver's dedication to God and his people led him to patent only three of his 500 agricultural inventions because he wanted his products to benefit all. He left his life savings to Tuskegee Institute. \n So I don't know how you can say that these inventions aren't the result of creationism since the man who invented those products lived his life according to the principles of creationism, the bible and the God he believed was the author of life.",

But your point also warrants a clarification as to where Obvious Child's actual argument is going.\n \n What you're citing are pragmatic uses for creationism. That is, whether or not creationism is actually true is not the issue; the point is that well-intentioned people can still be motivated by a concept to do something beneficial for society. For example, religion can be used as a means to help someone with an alcohol or drug problem, even though their belief in the religion may be lacking on all epistemological fronts.\n \n But the argument this thread raises does not work the same way. Obvious Child is talking about commercial products whose very existence demands that the idea they're based on is true. Flu vaccinations, for example, are a product that would not work if evolution did not occur. It doesn't matter how devoutly anyone believes in evolution -- they literally could not have designed an effective flu vaccine for a newly evolved strand of flu if the flu didn't evolve in the first place.\n \n We can all agree that ideas can have their pragmatic uses in the most bizarre of ways. If someone is standing on railroad tracks and they move off the tracks out of the way of a train in order to catch what they believe is a magical flying unicorn, well... their belief just saved their life. But this lends positively nothing to the truth of falsity of their belief. The products we're asking for are products that demand the truth of creationism.",

But For you to assume that because GWC did real science, that he couldn't have been a real creationist in his deepest convictions just confirms your condescending attitude toward creationists. It say's nothing at all about the truth of creationism and the eternal truths it is based upon.\n \n Throughout his life, Carver maintained that &#8220;the master analyst needs no book; he is at liberty to take apart and put together substances, compatible or non compatible to suit his own particular taste or fancy.&#8221; Nevertheless, his reliance on divine revelation instead of scientific methods often put him at odds with the scientific community.\n \n His deep religious faith was also important. In his speeches and interviews, he almost always referred to the Bible and divine guidance. His accomplishments, he was fond of saying, were not his doing but were the work of God. As he told a reporter for the Atlanta Journal who questioned him about the permanency of the clay paints he had developed: &#8220;Why should they not be permanent? God made the clay in the hills; they have been there for countless generations, changeless. All I do is prepare what God has made, for uses to which man can put it. It is God's work-not mine.&#8221;\n \n For him to make a statement like that, that God made the clay in the hills; he obviously believed that God made everything. Made it for mans use and all George did was utilize what God had given us. Had he not been a creationist, he wouldn't have thought that way and may have remained just another unknown oppressed ex-slave for his lifetime. My point is that as a result of his creationist convictions, the world of possibilities opened to him regarding the products he created from things like clay, peanuts, soybeans and sweet potatoes. \n \n And had he just invented a couple of products from each of these food sources, that in itself would have been impressive, and he still would be famous considering that he was born a slave. But he invented hundreds of uses for each product becoming an industry unto himself. No oc, to claim that Carvers creationism beliefs played no part in his inventions from natural products, or that he was a true scientist rather than a creationist, contradicts what he himself believed and said when he openly told anyone he lectured that he was only finding the uses God designed in creating the food products He gave us. That is the definition of a creationist at its most basic level.\n George Washington Carver",

   "That's a very interesting way of looking at it, actually. I don't think it's quite the same thing, but it's interesting.\n \n Carver undoubtedly interpreted everything he did and saw according to his creationist beliefs. It even seems likely that they inspired him to look for uses for things. Is that enough? Does that make his inventions commercial products of creationism? I'm teetering between yes and no, and here's why:\n \n Aerodynamic theory tells us what to expect if we construct an aircraft with a particular wingspan and profile etc etc - and it's a good theory because it works: we get the results we expect. Creationism led Carver to believe that if he looked he would find many applications for natural products, and that also turned out to be true. So in very, very general sense one could claim equivalency. \n \n On the other hand... if a belief that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow leads you to spend all your time chasing them across fields, and as a result you spot a valuable Roman coin jutting out of the soil which turns out to be part of a vast treasure, is it correct to describe your find as a commercial application of a belief in pots of gold at the ends of rainbows? Sounds tenuous, doesn't it? Because if the Romans hadn't dropped a load of coins in that field, no amount of belief in fairy gold would have enabled you to find them. Conversely, you could have been in that field for any reason at all and still spotted the coin - or you could just as easily have found a dinosaur fossil instead of a coin. So the causal linkage between belief and outcome is really flimsy.\n \n About the most we can say is that if a belief encourages you to have an enquiring mind, it deserves some credit for what that mind achieves. Are those achievements commercial products of that belief, in the same way as planes are commercial products of aerodynamic theory? I think I have to say no: planes work because aerodynamic theory is in fact correct, whereas Carver's inventions were the product of him behaving as if his beliefs were correct. To put it another way, his beliefs didn't actually need to be correct in order for him to achieve what he did, whereas if aerodynamic theory were wrong planes built according to its principles would fall out of the sky.\n \n As I said though, very interesting - and if nothing else an argument that diversity of beliefs is a good thing (even if only accidentally :) )",

Just because you believe in literal creationism does not mean you cannot practice actual science. \n \n Name me a single commercial product derived from Creationist science. Carver obviously practiced actual science by looking at how the natural world worked. If he was practicing Creationist science he'd be looking at the world from a perspective of two different sets of physical laws, pre and post flood. He'd also be rejecting radioactivity, biological evolution, geology and a whole host of other sciences. \n \n Your argument is not addressing the subject as you are citing someone who believed in Creationism yet practiced something very different.

I attempted to restart it in post #48, after the taunts in posts 46 and 47, and, after 7 other evolutionists weighed in, we now have ONE suggestion of a commercial product from evolution - flu vaccines.

Let's say that you are on the first floor of a building and you find there is a baby kangaroo on the same floor. You and a friend are arguing as to whether he could have come up via the stairs. To obtain evidence to make this explanation plausible, it would certainly help if you could demonstrate the animal's ability to hop from one step to the next higher one. But to observe its ability to hop horizontally across the room tells you nothing at all about the question being contemplated. 'Evolution' to most people means 'hopping up the stairs'. So if hopping across the room and down the stairs is labelled 'micro' or 'mini' evolution or whatever, it risks being misleading. \n\n \n Has AIDS evolved?\n \n The horizontal hopping of evolution has produced things like flu vaccines.

It's number one usage is too attack religion - whatever commercial uses it has come in a distant second to that. \n \n \nIt's pretty damn clear you don't have a single example of literal creationism as a science being commercialized. \n\n \n How long will the demands keep coming, while we see no examples of common descent evolution as a science being commercialized?

The plain fact is that the chimp genome, for instance, and the human genome differ by a finite number of base pairs - or more correctly they both differ by finite numbers of base pairs from their common ancestor. What do you think would happen if we took chimp DNA, manually made all the individual changes so as to make it identical to human DNA, and grew an organism from it? That's right: you'd get a human. And since we also know for a fact that every single one of those changes can occur naturally, the idea that there could be a micro/macro divide is absurd.\n \nCarl Wieland uses this example;\n Has AIDS evolved?\n \n \"Are the observed changes, on analysis, heading in the &#8216;right direction&#8217;? That is, are they the type of changes which, given enough time, would be capable of producing a massively complex organism like a horse from a one-celled creature?\"\n \n\n Yes. Single celled organisms have been observed to evolve 'clumping' behaviour in the lab, which is a plausible first step towards multicellularity. Even that is pretty remarkable, when you consider what Carl fails to take into account: that there are almost certainly no cells around today like those which evolved into multicellular creatures half a billion years ago. That ship has sailed and we're on it.\n \nThe horizontal hopping of evolution has produced things like flu vaccines. The vertical hopping of common descent has produced nothing. (so far in this thread anyway) There are worlds of difference between the two. To try to blend them is misleading. \n\n On the contrary, to pretend that there is a difference is misleading. I could change chimp DNA into human DNA one base pair at a time, and at no point would you be able to stop me and say 'ah ah, that was macro evolution'. Of course, in reality chimp and human DNA both diverged from the DNA of a common ancestor; one did not change into another. But I could in principle 'rewind' the genetic changes experienced by chimps, one at a time, and then wind forward those experienced by humans, one at a time, and turn a chimp into a human via their common ancestor using 'micro' evolution alone.\n \nHow long will the demands keep coming, while we see no examples of common descent evolution as a science being commercialized? Is this an indicator of how science in general makes demands of ID that are far above and beyond what they require of common descent evolution?\n\n No, marc, it isn't. I explained quite a few posts ago the relationship between evolutionary theory and common descent. Mushing the phrases together into 'common descent evolution' is like demanding a commercial application for 'relativity GPS'. GPS has commercial applications, and its accuracy is made possible by our understanding of relativity and the speed of light. Similarly, evolution's commercial applications are possible because the appreciation of common descent - knowing what problem the theory had to solve - guided the development of the theory and led us down the right track. And in return, evolutionary theory made predictions that confirmed common descent and allowed us to make progressively better and finer judgements as to the shape of the tree of life.\n \n From the link above:\n \nSince evolution has been the dominant theory of biology for more than a century, it's a safe statement that all of the wonderful innovations in medicine and agriculture that we derive from biological research stem from the theory of evolution. Recent, exciting examples are humanized antibodies like Remicade for inflammation and Herceptin for breast cancer, both initially made in mice. Without our knowledge of the evolution of mice and humans and their immune systems, we wouldn't have such life-saving and life-improving technologies.\n \n Another specific example is resistant bacterial infections, one of the scariest threats to public health. The ones that are resistant to antibiotics are more reproductively successful than their non-resistant relatives and pass the new resistance genes on to more offspring. Just as Darwin said 150 years ago.\n \n The creationists have devised a tortuous work-around for this phenomenon, which endorses natural selection and survival of the fittest, but says that evolution doesn't explain the original development of species. The problem is, there are hundreds of genes that occur in both bacteria and humans. It's hard to see why a designer would do it that way, since having the same genes in bacteria and humans makes infections harder to treat: drugs that act on bacterial gene products act on the human versions as well, so those drugs could kill both the bacterium and the human host.

   "The idea that there could be two 'kinds' of evolution has long baffled me. \n\n \n Well I'll be glad to enlighten you on it! First, let's go to the anti-creation folks at talkorigins;\n \n \nAntievolutionists argue against macroevolution so loudly that some people think they invented the term in order to dismiss evolution. But this is not true; scientists not only use the terms, they have an elaborate set of models and ideas about it, which of course antievolutionists gloss over or treat as being somehow problems for evolutionary biology. \n\n \n Macroevolution: Its definition, Philosophy and History\n \n Do you honestly not know about the elaborate set of models and ideas, or are you glossing over it? I'm not necessarily singling you out personally - you seem to be one of many who prefer to \"speak of biological evolution as one process.\" As Wikipedia tells us; \n \n \nOrigin of the term\n Russian entomologist Yuri Filipchenko (or Philipchenko, depending on the transliteration) first coined the terms \"macroevolution\" and \"microevolution\" in 1927 in his German language work, \"Variabilit\u00e4t und Variation\"[6].\n Since the inception of the two terms, their meanings have been revised several times and even fallen into disfavour amongst scientists who prefer to speak of biological evolution as one process.[6] \n\n \n If talkorigins claims this criteria exists, and a doctor and surgeon (Carl Wieland) takes it into account, is it not logical to question another scientific thought process being baffled by it? If one healthy percentage of scientists CHOOSE to use it, and another healthy percentage of scientists CHOOSE to toss it out, who are laypeople supposed to believe is being more open minded and honest? Are laypeople supposed to just accept this much confusion in the basics of evolution? This much confusion is understandable concerning faith, (religion certainly has it) but isn't evolution supposed to be about FACTS? \n \n But to touch on what micro-evolution and macro evolution are very simply and briefly, macroevolution requires new genetic information to arise within an organism, while microevolution does not. Changes within kinds (observed) vs unlimited changes into new kinds (unobserved) Could this distinction have fallen into disfavor amongs some scientists because it raises annoying questions? Of course the peer reviewed scientific solution is to THROW IT OUT. In the throwing out process, the implication seems to be pretty widespread in the evolutionary community that some crazed creationist recently invented the terms micro vs macro, when even talkorigins admits they have been around since 1927, and were not coined by current creationists or ID proponents. \n \n \nThe plain fact is that the chimp genome, for instance, and the human genome differ by a finite number of base pairs - or more correctly they both differ by finite numbers of base pairs from their common ancestor. What do you think would happen if we took chimp DNA, manually made all the individual changes so as to make it identical to human DNA, and grew an organism from it? That's right: you'd get a human. And since we also know for a fact that every single one of those changes can occur naturally, the idea that there could be a micro/macro divide is absurd. \n\n \n Is this a newly discovered absurdity - did no one tell the people at talkorigins? Are those \"elaborate sets of models and ideas\" now outdated, or do some evolutionary biologists (independent of religion) still believe they aren't justified in tossing them out just yet? \n \n \nYes. Single celled organisms have been observed to evolve 'clumping' behaviour in the lab, which is a plausible first step towards multicellularity. Even that is pretty remarkable, when you consider what Carl fails to take into account: that there are almost certainly no cells around today like those which evolved into multicellular creatures half a billion years ago. That ship has sailed and we're on it. \n\n \n \"Almost certainly\"? Almost is good enough in handgrenades, horseshoes, and evolution? \n \n \nOn the contrary, to pretend that there is a difference is misleading. I could change chimp DNA into human DNA one base pair at a time, and at no point would you be able to stop me and say 'ah ah, that was macro evolution'. Of course, in reality chimp and human DNA both diverged from the DNA of a common ancestor; one did not change into another. But I could in principle 'rewind' the genetic changes experienced by chimps, one at a time, and then wind forward those experienced by humans, one at a time, and turn a chimp into a human via their common ancestor using 'micro' evolution alone. \n\n \n So if you start with the assumption of a common ancestor and work backwards from that, micro vs macro is moot? \n \n \nNo, marc, it isn't. I explained quite a few posts ago the relationship between evolutionary theory and common descent. Mushing the phrases together into 'common descent evolution' is like demanding a commercial application for 'relativity GPS'. GPS has commercial applications, and its accuracy is made possible by our understanding of relativity and the speed of light. Similarly, evolution's commercial applications are possible because the appreciation of common descent - knowing what problem the theory had to solve - guided the development of the theory and led us down the right track. And in return, evolutionary theory made predictions that confirmed common descent and allowed us to make progressively better and finer judgements as to the shape of the tree of life.\n \n From the link above: \n\n \n \nSince evolution has been the dominant theory of biology for more than a century, it's a safe statement that all of the wonderful innovations in medicine and agriculture that we derive from biological research stem from the theory of evolution. \n\n \n It gets more and more dominating all the time doesn't it? Is the day almost here when we can throw out the word \"biology\" like we largely have with micro and macro, and just call it all evolution? The more broad the term, the easier it is to use it as a weapon against religion, right? \n \n \nRecent, exciting examples are humanized antibodies like Remicade for inflammation and Herceptin for breast cancer, both initially made in mice. Without our knowledge of the evolution of mice and humans and their immune systems, we wouldn't have such life-saving and life-improving technologies.\n \n Another specific example is resistant bacterial infections, one of the scariest threats to public health. The ones that are resistant to antibiotics are more reproductively successful than their non-resistant relatives and pass the new resistance genes on to more offspring. Just as Darwin said 150 years ago.\n \n The creationists have devised a tortuous work-around for this phenomenon, which endorses natural selection and survival of the fittest, but says that evolution doesn't explain the original development of species. The problem is, there are hundreds of genes that occur in both bacteria and humans. It's hard to see why a designer would do it that way, since having the same genes in bacteria and humans makes infections harder to treat: drugs that act on bacterial gene products act on the human versions as well, so those drugs could kill both the bacterium and the human host. Talk about throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\n \n So evolution has some pretty exciting applications (like food), and I'm guessing most people would prefer antibiotics developed by someone who knows the evolutionary relationship of humans and bacteria. \n\n \n \nEvery modern product of biotech owes its existence to our appreciation of the fact of evolution. Every hardy or disease-resistant strain of crops, too. Not to mention the banana - although we didn't really understand what we were doing back then, we still grasped the basic principle of keep and breed what you want and discard what you don't. Nature supplied the tasty mutation, and in its environment - consisting of lots of hungry people - that mutation thrived and is now the world's most popular fruit. Spin-offs of evolutionary theory are rendering the graphics on your monitor as you read this text: today's computer chips are not designed, but evolved using the principles we observe in nature. \n\n \n Today's computer chips are not designed? Did you really say that? No wonder everything we see and do is evolutionary. I shudder to think of what life on earth would be like if we didn't reject the book of Genesis. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nBut ok, let's try and find a commercial application for common descent specifically. \n\n \n Specifically?? Hahaha - that would be nice for a change!\n \n \nIt's actually not all that hard: paleontology. Fossil hunting is made more efficient in terms of both time and money by our understanding of common descent: it tells us where to look to stand a chance of finding the fossils we're interested in. I believe the challenge - delivered in lieu of an answer to the original question posed by this thread - has been well and truly met. \n\n \n Well and truly met, well lets see, we got \"every product of biotech\", \"food\" (according to your link) bananas, computer chips, antibiotics. Did I miss anything? When this seemed inadequate to you {hallelujah!!!} \"fossil hunting\" is all you have? The word \"commercial\" involves business, profits, sales to the general public etc, not methods of study. \n \n \nAny chance of getting that answer now?\n\n \n Is the answer you're looking for a commercial product of creationism? Everything Archangel showed you has been thrown out? In post #67, you said you were teetering between accepting/rejecting what Archangel proposed about George Washington Carver's creationist products. Now I have an important question - the mere content of this question will soar far over T.Q.'s and obvious_child's heads of course, but I know you'll understand it, and even if you decide not to address it here, I hope you'll give it some thought;\n \n Since my post #70 (that you are responding to with this post) may have upset you to some degree, did that figure in your decision to reject what AA said about Carver? Would it be safe to say that being upset with someone or some group could increase the chances of rejecting something that they would favor? That evolutionists being upset with creationists could influence their decision to reject ID as science, more than it would if there was an unemotional interest in scientific inquiry? A completely unbiased interest in finding out what the truth is? \n \n But on to your question about a commercial product of creation, how about this one \"Wine\". It is a commercial product that involves business, sales to the general public etc and it got a lot of mention throughout the Bible - old and new testaments. Jesus is said to have turned water into wine at one point. Wine making, wine tasting, maintanance of vineyards - probably no other beverage receives the precision, high class attention and experimentation that wine does. Jesus only lived to be 33 years old, and never traveled more than 30 miles from his home, yet is the most written about person in human history, and has influenced the world more than any other person. Is it not logical to figure he did big things for \"wine\"? If you don't think so, I'm going to have to ask that you forfeit your evolutionary claim on bananas. :p\n \n To close, I can show you what is probably the most influential, highest dollar commercial product of evolution of all, the one that none of us creationists could possibly dispute, and that would be atheist propaganda books;\n ___________ \n \n The God Delusion \n God Is Not Great\n The Selfish Gene\n God: The Failed Hypothesis: How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist\n Letter to a Christian Nation\n The end of faith\n The Blind Watchmaker\n Breaking the Spell\n The Atheist Universe\n The Portable Atheist\n The Quotable Athiest\n Irreligion \n Everything You Know About God Is Wrong\n ___________\n \n All written by evolutionists, many of them big sellers, they involve business and sale to the general public. Considering the influence they're bound to have on human activity and decision making, they are probably more profound than any other product of evolution. Certainly more than anything named in this thread thus far, since there has been practically nothing.",

   "(Regarding micro/macro evolution) Do you honestly not know about the elaborate set of models and ideas, or are you glossing over it? I'm not necessarily singling you out personally - you seem to be one of many who prefer to \"speak of biological evolution as one process.\" As Wikipedia tells us;\n\n I appreciate your helpfulness, but I think maybe I wasn't sufficiently clear earlier:\n \nThe idea that there could be two 'kinds' of evolution has long baffled me.\n\n You spoke of micro and maco evolution as if they represented motion in two independent axes - you even used analogies to that effect:\n \nThe horizontal hopping of evolution has produced things like flu vaccines. The vertical hopping of common descent has produced nothing.\n\n But micro and macro evolution are matters of degree, not direction. That's why I said there aren't two 'kinds' of evolution. That's why I said there's no micro/macro divide. That's why I said I could rewind/wind a chimp into a human without you ever being able to stop me and say that the change I just made was \"unobserved macro evolution\". Do you understand?\n \n\"Almost certainly\"? (no cells around like those which first evolved into multicellular creatures) Almost is good enough in handgrenades, horseshoes, and evolution?\n\n I'm not sure what you want from me here, or why you think this is significant. There may be cells around very similar to those ancestral to multicellular organisms, but it seems unlikely given the timescales and mutation rates involved. Not being personally acquainted with every single-celled organism on the planet I feel it would be presumptuous to claim absolute certainty :)\n \n(rewinding and winding chimps into humans via common ancestor)So if you start with the assumption of a common ancestor and work backwards from that, micro vs macro is moot? \n\n No, that's not it at all. I was just being careful not to propagate the myth that chimps evolved into humans. \n \nIt gets more and more dominating all the time doesn't it? Is the day almost here when we can throw out the word \"biology\" like we largely have with micro and macro, and just call it all evolution? The more broad the term, the easier it is to use it as a weapon against religion, right? \n\n You demanded commercial applications for evolution. I gave them to you. Now our understanding of evolution has been... too useful? I'd call it paranoia if I didn't know you only say these things to wind me up :)\n \nToday's computer chips are not designed? Did you really say that? No wonder everything we see and do is evolutionary. I shudder to think of what life on earth would be like if we didn't reject the book of Genesis. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n I appreciate that the debunking of Genesis looms large on your personal horizon, but it's hubris to suppose that was anything other than an incidental by-product. You're like the guy stuck in a traffic jam railing against the police cars and ambulances up ahead who are making you late.\n \n As for computer chips, the latest 'designs' really are the product of evolutionary algorithms. Their complexity is so high and the tolerances so fine that - short of actually building them - simulating them at a very low level is the only way to judge their performance. In order to reflect reality accurately enough, the computer model of the chip becomes so complex that the only way to predict if it's going to be good is to simulate it working - and the effect of small changes are also so subtle and complex that the only way to predict the result of making them is, again, simulation. In other words, the notion of trying to work out how to make the chip better evaporates because that 'working out' inevitably becomes a process of simulating alternatives.\n \n\"fossil hunting\" is all you have? The word \"commercial\" involves business, profits, sales to the general public etc, not methods of study. \n\n Does a map have commercial applications? Not according to you it doesn't. The time and fuel it saves lorry drivers because they don't have to drive down every road in the country looking for their delivery address doesn't count, apparently :)\n \nIs the answer you're looking for a commercial product of creationism?\n\n Yes.\n \nEverything Archangel showed you has been thrown out? In post #67, you said you were teetering between accepting/rejecting what Archangel proposed about George Washington Carver's creationist products. \n\n Yes. And you'll note the conclusion I reached: that while his creationist beliefs could be credited with fostering within him an enquiring mind, it is not equivalent to the credit due to the principles of aerodynamics for commercial air travel. Specifically, Aerodynamic theory has to be right in order for commercial air travel to be possible. Carver's creationist beliefs did not have to be right in order for his investigations to yield the results they did.\n \nSince my post #70 (that you are responding to with this post) may have upset you to some degree, did that figure in your decision to reject what AA said about Carver?\n\n No. I didn't even reject it; I merely drew what I think is a valid distinction between theories that need to be right in order to yield useful results, and those that need not. The credit due to the theory in each case is, I hope you would agree, of a different nature.\n \nWould it be safe to say that being upset with someone or some group could increase the chances of rejecting something that they would favor? That evolutionists being upset with creationists could influence their decision to reject ID as science, more than it would if there was an unemotional interest in scientific inquiry? A completely unbiased interest in finding out what the truth is? \n\n Of course. I thought I'd agreed as much long ago! What I disagree with are the illogical leaps you proceed to make from that observation: that because emotion can influence decisions the decision to reject ID as science must be entirely emotional and, furthermore, must be wrong. Neither is true. A decision made for emotional reasons can still be, upon sober reflection, logically correct. Also, a person can be emotionally motivated to logically disprove something, which provides a sink for the emotions you claim run so high in the 'evolutionist camp' without compromising the validity of their arguments.\n \n I don't think you appreciate almost all of the negative emotion provoked by creationism and ID within the scientific community is professional rather than philosophical in nature. You simply assume that because you are primarily angered philosophically by evolution, the same must apply in reverse. \n \n The raison d'etre of science is to produce theories that work. It doesn't matter how much you love or hate an idea, or why, your emotions can't force it to yield good predictions. It will only work if it's genuinely a good theory. Right now, ID doesn't work, and that's why it's excluded from the science classroom. The fact it ticks emotional boxes for you, while evolution might tick emotional boxes for some hypothetical idea-of-god-hater, is irrelevant.\n \n And I'm not, by the way. An 'idea-of-god' hater, I mean. It's just that none of the gods I've heard about make any kind of sense when put in context (as a real thing, that is; they make perfect sense as conjured reflections of our own nature), and I think if there is such a thing as god it should make sense.\n \nBut on to your question about a commercial product of creation, how about this one \"Wine\".\n\n I think this falls into a similar category as AA's examples: the bible doesn't have to be right in any important respect (Genesis least of all) in order for it to have influenced the sales and development of grape-based beverages. It was at the very outside an inspiration for more people to apply what are, in the end, scientific methodologies to the improvement of wine-making.\n \nTo close, I can show you what is probably the most influential, highest dollar commercial product of evolution of all, \n\n Funny, but not even close:\n \n This report describes and evaluates animal biotechnology\n and its application in veterinary medicine and pharmaceuticals as well as improvement in food production. Knowledge of animal genetics is important in the application of biotechnology to manage genetic disorders and improve animal breeding. Genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics are also being applied to animal biotechnology.\n \n Transgenic technologies are used for improving milk production and the meat in farm animals as well as for creating models of human diseases. Transgenic animals are used for the production of proteins for human medical use. Biotechnology is applied to facilitate xenotransplantation from animals to humans. Genetic engineering is done in farm animals and nuclear transfer technology has become an important and preferred method for cloning animals. \n\n I'm sure Dawkins would have loved to clear $10,000,000,000 from The God Delusion, though :)\n \n As I said before, you only think of this issue's impact in terms of religion, so all the stories you construct to explain it are also in terms of religion. You're front and centre in the coming Apocalypse, and you love it :) Far more exciting than the reality.",

   "I appreciate your helpfulness, but I think maybe I wasn't sufficiently clear earlier:\n \n You spoke of micro and maco evolution as if they represented motion in two independent axes - you even used analogies to that effect:\n \n But micro and macro evolution are matters of degree, not direction. That's why I said there aren't two 'kinds' of evolution. That's why I said there's no micro/macro divide. \n\n \n If there was no micro/macro divide, talkorigins wouldn't have referred to \"an elaborate set of models and ideas about it.\" If micro/macro was as simple (indeed, nonexistent) as you say, what could possibly be \"elaborate\" about it? I can understand if there's a disagreement in the evolution community over evolution basics (Baptists have disagreement with Catholics over Christian basics) but I can really understand it only in terms of faith, not factual science in public school classrooms. \n \n \nThat's why I said I could rewind/wind a chimp into a human without you ever being able to stop me and say that the change I just made was \"unobserved macro evolution\". Do you understand? \n\n \n No. If you're doing the rewinding, you're an intelligent force, not the natural, non-intelligent force that evolution needs. In addition, saying you can do something doesn't result in me actually observing it, you would have to actually do it for me to observe it. Is anybody actually winding chimps into humans these days? If they are, it's gotta be somewhere on youtube - link me. \n \n \nYou demanded commercial applications for evolution. I gave them to you. Now our understanding of evolution has been... too useful? I'd call it paranoia if I didn't know you only say these things to wind me up :) \n\n \n I'd like to see some clear proof that they were from evolution, that they would not have been developed with biology alone - Darwinless biology. You won't of course, and it may not even be your fault. As I said, biology has been Darwinized, blended, and it started long before you and I were born. Most biologists today couldn't separate them if they wanted too. But I've heard that molecular biology, biochemistry, and physiology, can and have been done completely without evolution.\n \n Maybe I could go to a website like Answersingenesis and try to find something on the distinction between biology and Darwinism from a Christian biologist. It may be there, but chances are excellent that thousands of militant evolutionists (armed with taxpayer money) immediately jumped on it and came up with a complicated scientific explanation of why it was wrong. We could do some copy/paste wars on it, but your side has mine outnumbered greatly. It's all about the money. \n \n \n \nI appreciate that the debunking of Genesis looms large on your personal horizon, but it's hubris to suppose that was anything other than an incidental by-product. You're like the guy stuck in a traffic jam railing against the police cars and ambulances up ahead who are making you late. \n\n \n Speaking of \"saying things to wind you up\" - it can go both ways. Do you think the debunking of Genesis looms large on the personal horizon of the starter of this thread? Of the authors of the books I named? Of the website no answers in Genesis? Of talkorigins? Of the NCSE? Of the education community?\n \n The debunking of Genesis controversy is where it's all at - it's where the money is. My personal horizon, the ID movement, the \"wedge strategy\" - most of the Christian opposition to the evolutionist philosophy is reactionary. Destroying religion is the not an incidental by-product of evolution - it's in first place on evolutions 'to do' list. In 1959, the year of an emotional boost for evolutionists (100 year aniversary for Origin of Species - 150 year aniversary of Darwin's birth) evolutionists were lamenting that students in America's schools weren't getting near enough of a dose of evolution to break the religious spell. That one last chapter in biology textbooks wasn't enough, especially if some teachers didn't get around to covering it. That was all changed with the BSCS - the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study. They made sure that biology textbooks were saturated with evolution, from front to back. That was the debunking of Genesis that was here before ID, it was before the Wedge strategy, before AnswersinGenesis, before a lot of reactionary things that are taking place today. \n \n Now we're coming up on 2009, Darwin's 200th birthday, and Origins 150th birthday. My guess is that the debunking of Genesis is going to be big in 2009, and creationists won't be instigating it. \n \n \nAs for computer chips, the latest 'designs' really are the product of evolutionary algorithms. Their complexity is so high and the tolerances so fine that - short of actually building them - simulating them at a very low level is the only way to judge their performance. In order to reflect reality accurately enough, the computer model of the chip becomes so complex that the only way to predict if it's going to be good is to simulate it working - and the effect of small changes are also so subtle and complex that the only way to predict the result of making them is, again, simulation. In other words, the notion of trying to work out how to make the chip better evaporates because that 'working out' inevitably becomes a process of simulating alternatives. \n\n \n And we would have never been able to figure this out without a belief in common descent of living things? \n \n \nDoes a map have commercial applications? Not according to you it doesn't. The time and fuel it saves lorry drivers because they don't have to drive down every road in the country looking for their delivery address doesn't count, apparently :) \n\n \n Hunting LEADS TO maps. If you're giving evolution sequential leeway like that, I wouldn't have problems coming up with products that the creation story has come up with in the Bible. God's creating things led to man's motivation to create things. Man's encouragement to work is significant in the creation story. It's in Genesis 3, a major evolutionary rejection. Noah built a pretty impressive ship. Without the creation story, would we not know how to build ships? That's just a s ridiculous as your implication that we wouldn't be able to build computer chips without billions of year biological evolution. \n \n \nYes. And you'll note the conclusion I reached: that while his creationist beliefs could be credited with fostering within him an enquiring mind, it is not equivalent to the credit due to the principles of aerodynamics for commercial air travel. Specifically, Aerodynamic theory has to be right in order for commercial air travel to be possible. Carver's creationist beliefs did not have to be right in order for his investigations to yield the results they did. \n\n \n The Wright brothers didn't have to know a thing about evolution to make their first plane fly. Neither did those who improved on it over the future decades. If evolution inspires the development of a commercial product, the evolutionist who was inspired didn't have to know for sure if it was right - all it may have been was an inspiration to try it. And it could have been just an ideological inspiration that didn't really require the first hypothesis to be right. Billions of year evolution doesn't have to be right for small changes to be utilized in the development of computer chips. \n \n \nNo. I didn't even reject it; I merely drew what I think is a valid distinction between theories that need to be right in order to yield useful results, and those that need not. The credit due to the theory in each case is, I hope you would agree, of a different nature. \n\n \n I don't think it's that easy to draw that distinction. I think we're coming to the conclusion that a belief in evolution can inspire commercial products to a very comparable extent to the way a belief in creation can inspire commercial products. \n \n \nOf course. I thought I'd agreed as much long ago! What I disagree with are the illogical leaps you proceed to make from that observation: that because emotion can influence decisions the decision to reject ID as science must be entirely emotional and, furthermore, must be wrong. \n\n \n I've never said they must be, I've said they may be. That's should be enough to keep them from being established as fact - fact to build on, or fact to throw out other possibilities on. \n \n \nNeither is true. A decision made for emotional reasons can still be, upon sober reflection, logically correct. Also, a person can be emotionally motivated to logically disprove something, which provides a sink for the emotions you claim run so high in the 'evolutionist camp' without compromising the validity of their arguments.\n \n I don't think you appreciate almost all of the negative emotion provoked by creationism and ID within the scientific community is professional rather than philosophical in nature. You simply assume that because you are primarily angered philosophically by evolution, the same must apply in reverse. \n\n \n No, I see it in evolutionists, and I provided the proof above. If I continue to provide evidence of self motivated (not reactionary) political action by evolutionists, do you think you could show an equally long list of political action by creationists? That's more than just a reaction to something evolutionists have done? I don't think you could. Philosophical anger in the creation/evolution debate is much worse from the evolutionist side. \n \n \nThe raison d'etre of science is to produce theories that work. It doesn't matter how much you love or hate an idea, or why, your emotions can't force it to yield good predictions. It will only work if it's genuinely a good theory. Right now, ID doesn't work, and that's why it's excluded from the science classroom. The fact it ticks emotional boxes for you, while evolution might tick emotional boxes for some hypothetical idea-of-god-hater, is irrelevant. \n\n \n Different people have different definitions of what \"works\". The Biblical account of creation, male and female - how they relate to each other - \"works\" pretty well. \n \n \nAnd I'm not, by the way. An 'idea-of-god' hater, I mean. It's just that none of the gods I've heard about make any kind of sense when put in context (as a real thing, that is; they make perfect sense as conjured reflections of our own nature), and I think if there is such a thing as god it should make sense. \n\n \n It's a worldview thing. That all the good and bad, the twists and turns, the complications of this one little planet happened as a cosmic accident with no purpose doesn't make a bit of sense to me at all. \n \n \nI think this falls into a similar category as AA's examples: the bible doesn't have to be right in any important respect (Genesis least of all) in order for it to have influenced the sales and development of grape-based beverages. It was at the very outside an inspiration for more people to apply what are, in the end, scientific methodologies to the improvement of wine-making. \n\n \n In EXACTLY the same way, evolution doesn't have to be right to have influenced the slight changes and modification in computer chip development, or medical advances. \n \n \n \nFunny, but not even close:\n\n \n \nQuote: \n This report describes and evaluates animal biotechnology\n and its application in veterinary medicine and pharmaceuticals as well as improvement in food production. Knowledge of animal genetics is important in the application of biotechnology to manage genetic disorders and improve animal breeding.

Transgenic animals are used for the production of proteins for human medical use. Biotechnology is applied to facilitate xenotransplantation from animals to humans. Genetic engineering is done in farm animals and nuclear transfer technology has become an important and preferred method for cloning animals. \n\n \n \"Biotechnology\"? Shouldn't that be \"evotechnology\"? Is there a difference? \n \n \nI'm sure Dawkins would have loved to clear $10,000,000,000 from The God Delusion, though :) \n\n \n There's a lot more to it than just the sales of one book. It's impossible to put a dollar figure on it. It would be the sales of all those books and others like them combined, and include all the influence they had on society. \n \n \nAs I said before, you only think of this issue's impact in terms of religion, so all the stories you construct to explain it are also in terms of religion. You're front and centre in the coming Apocalypse, and you love it :) Far more exciting than the reality.\n\n \n Explained above, but to go one step further - creationism is a religion, in addition to being a belief about the beginning of life. Of course there are going to be promotions for it, it is a positive belief, part of it is promoting it - the Bible strongly suggests it. Those books I listed in my previous post weren't intended to be evolution books (the best I can tell), they were atheist books. Atheism is supposed to be an absense of belief - why does an absense of something inspire something so loaded with constructs? What is their front and center? The year 2009? The worship of their 200 year old god?",

   "If there was no micro/macro divide, talkorigins wouldn't have referred to &#8220;an elaborate set of models and ideas about it.&#8221;\n\n I apologise; I spoke unclearly. There is no micro/macro divide in the sense you used earlier, in terms of genetic or phenotypic changes: there is no 'lateral' and 'vertical' evolution of which we see one but not the other. I refer you to the same diagram as I did with AA:\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/macroevolution/microevolution.png \n Macroevolution concerns changes at the species level and above. That doesn't mean it refers to genetic changes that turn organisms into new species. Do you appreciate the distinction? When part of species 'A' migrates, becomes reproductively isolated, and undergoes microevolution to the point it no longer can or does interbreed with other descendents of 'A' even when they encounter each other, speciation is said to have occurred, and that whole process constitutes macroevolution. \n \nIf micro/macro was as simple (indeed, nonexistent) as you say, what could possibly be &#8220;elaborate&#8221; about it?\n\n One might as well ask why it took so long to come up with something as simple as E=MC2 :) It might seem obvious after the fact, but a lot of careful science lies behind our current understanding of the processes of speciation and the vital role played by factors like reproductive isolation.\n \nNo. If you&#8217;re doing the rewinding, you&#8217;re an intelligent force, not the natural, non-intelligent force that evolution needs. \n\n That's irrelevant. I wouldn't need to make one single change of a type not already observed occuring naturally in the lab. I would be 'intelligently' mimicking natural events - the outcome would be the same either way.\n \nIn addition, saying you can do something doesn't result in me actually observing it, you would have to actually do it for me to observe it. Is anybody actually winding chimps into humans these days? If they are, it's gotta be somewhere on youtube - link me. \n\n That's absolutely fair comment - which is why I tried to remember to say 'in principle' :) I have no idea what the series of microevolutionary changes would be to rewind a chimp and wind the common ancestor forward into a human being. However, we do know that 1) none of the differences are impossible to achieve naturally, and 2) there's overwhelming evidence that parallel evolution from a common ancestor did in fact happen.\n \n Imagine you're shown the following evidence: two guys going into a room carrying a deck of cards and a wad of cash each. Then several snapshots from inside the room, showing the guys playing poker and one of them with a bigger and bigger stack beside him. Finally, you see both guys leave, one with all the cash and the other with none. You know perfectly well what has happened, even if you can't reconstruct every single hand dealt. That's analogous to the situation we find ourselves in with human evolution: we see an inarguable fossil convergence of human and primate lineages, backed up to the hilt by analysis of genetic differences between us and the other great apes. \n \nI'd like to see some clear proof that they were from evolution, that they would not have been developed with biology alone - Darwinless biology. You won't of course\n\n Well, no, because it's an impossible demand and a meaningless exercise to boot. DNA evidence helps convict murderers who might have been convicted on the strength of other evidence anyway. It's not possible to say for sure exactly which convictions depend utterly upon DNA evidence, but we can say it leads to more successful convictions. Similarly, would our knowledge of biology be as advanced as it is now without an understanding of evolution? No.\n \nSpeaking of \"saying things to wind you up\" - it can go both ways. Do you think the debunking of Genesis looms large on the personal horizon of the starter of this thread? Of the authors of the books I named?\n\n Having read hardly any of the books you listed, I couldn't say - although if The God Delusion is a representative example I'm happy to go along with the premise that analysing the shortcomings of religion is a central theme. Even so, they too are little more than a corollary; a sideshow - just like our discussion here.\n \nOf the website no answers in Genesis? Of talkorigins?\n\n There the focus is clearly upon rebutting creationism in its various pseudo-scientific guises, not upon pulling apart Genesis. As are the others you linked:\n \nOf the NCSE?\n\n \nOur 4000 members are scientists, teachers, clergy, and citizens with diverse religious affiliations.\n\n \n Of the education community?\n\n \nThe Coalition for Excellence in Science and Math Education (CESE) is composed of interested citizens throughout New Mexico and the nation, including scientists, engineers, educators, university faculty, members of the clergy, and parents. CESE is non-partisan and non-sectarian, and welcomes members of all religions and political philosophies. This coalition works to improve science education and science literacy for all citizens.\n\n \n \nMy personal horizon, the ID movement, the \"wedge strategy\" - most of the Christian opposition to the evolutionist philosophy is reactionary.\n\n Of course it's reactionary. But it's not a reaction to a philosophy, it's a reaction to the published results of a methodology and the fact those results are contributing to lots and lots of successful science. It's often said evolution encroaching on religious territory, but that's not true. It merely falsifies narratives of natural history you've decided to entangle with your spiritual beliefs.\n \nDestroying religion is the not an incidental by-product of evolution - it's in first place on evolutions 'to do' list.\n\n Science doesn't get to choose which theories agree with the universe, and it doesn't get to choose what is written in the bible. If the universe contradicts the bible, there's only one possible source of error. If the bible had contained an accurate narrative of the natural history of Earth, science would have confirmed it - or at the very least, it would have confirmed that it was within the bounds of possibility. Has the bible's inaccuracy proved a boon for atheists? Yes, but I don't think it's justified in the final analysis. God's existence (or otherwise) does not depend upon the accuracy of what we believe about him or about the way he's done things. I think the human race will eventually come to terms with the reality of common descent, and everyone will carry on much as they did before, no doubt downplaying the significance of the whole embarrassing affair, much as we do now with Galileo.\n \n(evolutionary design in industry) And we would have never been able to figure this out without a belief in common descent of living things? \n\n It's impossible to say 'never' with certainty, but I think it very unlikely. Would we have developed flight if there were no birds or winged insects to put the idea in our heads? A truly vast proportion of what we now take for granted as 'human inventions' can be traced back to the observation of a natural phenomenon, which tends to suggest that inspiration from nature was required for our development of evolutionary algorithms.\n \nHunting LEADS TO maps. If you&#8216;re giving evolution sequential leeway like that, I wouldn&#8216;t have problems coming up with products that the creation story has come up with in the Bible.\n\n I think you're wandering off topic here. You demanded a commercial application for common descent. I pointed out that our knowledge of common descent saves paleontologists time and money by helping them focus their efforts. That's a direct consequence of a very specific bit of knowledge, which has to be right in order to achieve the benefit it does. It doesn't matter what 'lead to' the creation of maps; the point is that maps have direct commercial application. I'm not invoking any sequential leeway at all.\n \nGod&#8216;s creating things led to man&#8216;s motivation to create things.\n\n One could as easily say that man's habit of creating of things motivated him to invent a god who created things. Even if we don't go that far, it's only necessary to believe god greated things in order to be inspired to emulate him. That belief, unlike the contents of a map or our knowledge of common descent, does not have to be correct to yield the benefits described.\n \nNoah built a pretty impressive ship. Without the creation story, would we not know how to build ships? That&#8216;s just a s ridiculous as your implication that we wouldn&#8216;t be able to build computer chips without billions of year biological evolution. \n\n That wasn't my implication. Evolutionary principles allow us to make modern computer chips, just like relativity enables us to make accurate GPS. The exact same universal principles Darwin perceived operating in nature.\n \nThe Wright brothers didn&#8217;t have to know a thing about evolution to make their first plane fly. Neither did those who improved on it over the future decades.\n\n True up to a point - but not any more. These days plane designs are modelled, varied, filtered - evolved in a simulator, in short, before ever going into production. Evolution is a way of making things better than we can design them to be via other methods. I even explained why in our other recent thread.\n \nIf evolution inspires the development of a commercial product, the evolutionist who was inspired didn&#8217;t have to know for sure if it was right - all it may have been was an inspiration to try it. And it could have been just an ideological inspiration that didn&#8217;t really require the first hypothesis to be right. Billions of year evolution doesn't have to be right for small changes to be utilized in the development of computer chips.\n\n Now you're getting the hang of it :) You're correct that we don't need to have evolved, although we do have to be able to evolve - evolutionary principles do have to work - in order for better computer chips to emerge from the same process. But I never claimed that computer chips were a direct spin-off from our understanding of common descent, only a commercial spin off of evolutionary theory.\n \nI don't think it's that easy to draw that distinction. I think we&#8217;re coming to the conclusion that a belief in evolution can inspire commercial products to a very comparable extent to the way a belief in creation can inspire commercial products. \n\n I'm sure you'd love to come to that conclusion, but in reality there is a clear and straightforward distinction between beliefs that need to be correct in order to bear fruit, and those that do not. So far, every single 'product of creation' has been a 'product whose development was inspired by a belief in creation'. I'm not detracting from the value of that in the slightest - I'm quite prepared to be convinced that belief in god has inspired humanity. But inspiring is not the same as enabling. Aerodynamics enable the construction of working aircraft. Evolutionary principles enable the design of modern computer chips. Our understanding of common descent enables efficient paleontology, as well as inspiring the discovery of evolutionary principles.\n \nI&#8217;ve never said they must be, I&#8217;ve said they may be.\n\n On the contrary, on several occasions you have laid down your reasoning as to why it's 'clear' that ID is not being excluded on merit, and that reasoning has explicitly excluded any consideration of ID itself. To you, ID is a black box, and it only matters who thinks its empty, not what's actually inside.\n \nNo, I see it in evolutionists, and I provided the proof above. If I continue to provide evidence of self motivated (not reactionary) political action by evolutionists,\n\n 'Continue'? When did you start? Books by atheists pulling apart religion don't count at all. If you sincerely believe your neighbour is selling snake-oil, isn't it a reaction to attempt to warn people off?\n \nDifferent people have different definitions of what &#8220;works&#8221;. The Biblical account of creation, male and female - how they relate to each other - &#8220;works&#8221; pretty well. \n\n In what sense? You mean in the sense that woman was created for no other purpose than to keep man company? That she wasn't worth creating in her own right? :) Sorry, I'm just not following what's supposed to 'work' about that particular narrative. Does it continue to 'work' when you factor in the gill slits we develop as embryos, or the tail we grow and (usually) reabsorb? \n \nIt&#8217;s a worldview thing. That all the good and bad, the twists and turns, the complications of this one little planet happened as a cosmic accident with no purpose doesn&#8217;t make a bit of sense to me at all. \n\n And that's absolutely fine - I wouldn't dream of claiming that you are certainly wrong. Now, me personally, I don't see that postulating a god for whom we serve a purpose solves anything, because it only begs the question: if you need to be created for a purpose in order to have one, what's god's purpose? After all, a common anti-atheist slippery-slope argument is to say that if there's no god, then all our works are ultimately purposeless so we might as well not bother. But our works serve our purposes; if that isn't good enough, then us serving god's purpose isn't good enough either, unless he has a purpose, defined by something else - and so on. And if you say it's sufficient for us to have a purpose, that so long as there's a rung higher than us on the ladder, we can be happy in our place - well, society occupies that higher rung, just as you occupy the rung above the individual cells of which your body is composed.\n \n The core issue, though, is that all this philosophical 'worldview' stuff regarding purpose has nothing to do with the literal truth of genesis, which is a (so far as we can tell, fictional) narrative of natural history. Let's forget evolution for a moment, and stop pretending that it's a black-and-white choice between it and biblical literalism. Just examine genesis on its own. I'm sure you'll agree that as a narrative it could be wrong in every respect, and yet god could still be responsible for our existence, still take a personal interest in our lives, still judge our behaviour, still have sent Jesus to us. So why should the fact that it is wrong in most respects give you a moment's pause? I would hazard a guess that you simply like believing you possess an infallible spiritual manual, by which you can live your life and everything will be OK. I think that in the end it's that you're loath to abandon, and everything else is a convenient and plausible-sounding distraction.",

When part of species 'A' migrates, becomes reproductively isolated, and undergoes microevolution to the point it no longer can or does interbreed with other descendents of 'A' even when they encounter each other, speciation is said to have occurred, and that whole process constitutes macroevolution. \n \n One might as well ask why it took so long to come up with something as simple as E=MC2 :) It might seem obvious after the fact, but a lot of careful science lies behind our current understanding of the processes of speciation and the vital role played by factors like reproductive isolation.\n \n That's irrelevant. I wouldn't need to make one single change of a type not already observed occuring naturally in the lab. I would be 'intelligently' mimicking natural events - the outcome would be the same either way.\n \n That's absolutely fair comment - which is why I tried to remember to say 'in principle' :) I have no idea what the series of microevolutionary changes would be to rewind a chimp and wind the common ancestor forward into a human being. However, we do know that 1) none of the differences are impossible to achieve naturally, and 2) there's overwhelming evidence that parallel evolution from a common ancestor did in fact happen.\n \n Imagine you're shown the following evidence: two guys going into a room carrying a deck of cards and a wad of cash each. Then several snapshots from inside the room, showing the guys playing poker and one of them with a bigger and bigger stack beside him. Finally, you see both guys leave, one with all the cash and the other with none. You know perfectly well what has happened, even if you can't reconstruct every single hand dealt. That's analogous to the situation we find ourselves in with human evolution: we see an inarguable fossil convergence of human and primate lineages, backed up to the hilt by analysis of genetic differences between us and the other great apes. \n\n \n Your poker anology works very well with creationism too. The snapshots from inside the room could represent the pages of the Bible. Even if I can't reconstruct every detail of just how God did everything. Why do most evolutionists demand that creationists provide them? \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] I'd like to see some clear proof that they were from evolution, that they would not have been developed with biology alone - Darwinless biology. You won't of course \n\n \n \n \nWell, no, because it's an impossible demand and a meaningless exercise to boot. DNA evidence helps convict murderers who might have been convicted on the strength of other evidence anyway. It's not possible to say for sure exactly which convictions depend utterly upon DNA evidence, but we can say it leads to more successful convictions. Similarly, would our knowledge of biology be as advanced as it is now without an understanding of evolution? No. \n\n \n It's an impossible demand because of what I said in my previous post, that evolution and biology have been combined over such a long period of time that they couldn't be separated today if we had to. Especially with other methods of thinking about biology - like ID - politically out of the equation. \n \n \nHaving read hardly any of the books you listed, I couldn't say - although if The God Delusion is a representative example I'm happy to go along with the premise that analysing the shortcomings of religion is a central theme. Even so, they too are little more than a corollary; a sideshow - just like our discussion here. \n\n \n It's far more than a harmless little sideshow, it really does penetrate society. \n \n You don't have to carefully read each book to come to the conclusion that they analyze the shortcomings of religion - the titles of them, and internet reviews and comments clearly tell us that. They also clearly tell us that analyzation isn't the only motive of the books, they tell us that moving on / disregarding religion is in society's best interests. I have a copy of Stenger's \"God Delusion\" book - in the final chapter he gets around to put downs of US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia, as well as president Bush. The innocence of the science of evolution can quickly get into one-sided politics, it seems. \n \n \nThere the focus is clearly upon rebutting creationism in its various pseudo-scientific guises, not upon pulling apart Genesis. As are the others you linked:\n\n \n \n Yes, it consists of all those diverse religious affiliations, and seeks to protect the science of evolution against religious interference. There seems to be many organizations like this - I've heard it all before, it's been explained to me many times. Many devout Christians don't want science to be interfered with by religion. Even though they're religious, their personal religion shouldn't interfere with something that has nothing to do with religion. Kenneth Miller, an evolutionist loving Christian, is like that. Judge John Jones of the Dover trial is like that. Most Christians are evolutionists - they all bend over backwards to make sure the FACT of evolution is kept separate from religious views. It all makes sense, except for one little problem;\n \n Why do all these Christians say nothing when evolution is used as a weapon against their religion by atheists? \n \n They're just passive like that? I'm supposed to really believe that? It's completely impossible for them to be pretend Christians?\n \n \nOf course it's reactionary. But it's not a reaction to a philosophy, it's a reaction to the published results of a methodology and the fact those results are contributing to lots and lots of successful science. It's often said evolution encroaching on religious territory, but that's not true. It merely falsifies narratives of natural history you've decided to entangle with your spiritual beliefs. \n\n \n It IS true, and in addition to contributing to lots and lots of good science, it's contributing to lots and lots of societal degeneration. As the introduction to the Wedge Document states;\n \n \nThe proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Its influence can be detected in most, if not all, of the West's greatest achievements, including representative democracy, human rights, free enterprise, and progress in the arts and sciences.\n \n Yet a little over a century ago, this cardinal idea came under wholesale attack by intellectuals drawing on the discoveries of modern science. Debunking the traditional conceptions of both God and man, thinkers such as Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud portrayed humans not as moral and spiritual beings, but as animals or machines who inhabited a universe ruled by purely impersonal forces and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the unbending forces of biology, chemistry, and environment. This materialistic conception of reality eventually infected virtually every area of our culture, from politics and economics to literature and art\n The cultural consequences of this triumph of materialism were devastating. Materialists denied the existence of objective moral standards, claiming that environment dictates our behavior and beliefs. Such moral relativism was uncritically adopted by much of the social sciences, and it still undergirds much of modern economics, political science, psychology and sociology.\n \n Materialists also undermined personal responsibility by asserting that human thoughts and behaviors are dictated by our biology and environment. The results can be seen in modern approaches to criminal justice, product liability, and welfare. In the materialist scheme of things, everyone is a victim and no one can be held accountable for his or her actions.\n \n Finally, materialism spawned a virulent strain of utopianism. Thinking they could engineer the perfect society through the application of scientific knowledge, materialist reformers advocated coercive government programs that falsely promised to create heaven on earth. \n\n \n The Wedge Strategy - Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture\n \n Do you deny that these things are happening? How about the results of this study, concerning new lows about dishonesty in school children;\n \n \nAs bad as these numbers are, it appears they understate the level of dishonesty exhibited by America's youth. More than one in four (26 percent) confessed they lied on at least one or two questions on the survey. Experts agree that dishonesty on surveys usually is an attempt to conceal misconduct.\n \n Despite these high levels of dishonesty, the respondents have a high self-image when it comes to ethics. A whopping 93 percent said they were satisfied with their personal ethics and character and 77 percent said that when it comes to doing what is right, I am better than most people I know. \n\n \n CHARACTER COUNTS!: Programs: Ethics of American Youth Survey: Josephson Institute's Report Card\n \n Goes along perfectly with what this says about the decline in school children's behavior;\n \n \nAmerica's public schools today are far from where they were originally. Evolutionary teaching and practice are everywhere-in the science curriculum, of course, but also in the philosophy of law taught in law schools today, and in the age segregation and emphasis on peer groupings that abound in schools. Even Supreme Court justices have an evolutionary basis in law that affects the way they decide education cases.\n The downhill trend in the schools is already far progressed. In fact, practically every moral measurement for schools is on a downhill trend. Interestingly, these statistics break significantly for the worse in the mid 1960s,60 correlating with two significant events. First, the BSCS61 textbooks were released, reemphasizing evolution as a unifying concept in science. Second, the Supreme Court removed prayer and Bible reading from the schools. Why should students be expected to behave well when they are taught that they are just animals, and the absolutes of the Scriptures are banished from the classroom? \n\n \n Evolution in American education and the demise of its public school system\n \n \nScience doesn't get to choose which theories agree with the universe, and it doesn't get to choose what is written in the bible. If the universe contradicts the bible, there's only one possible source of error. \n\n \n There's no possible source of error in those humans who are observing the universe? \n \n \nIf the bible had contained an accurate narrative of the natural history of Earth, science would have confirmed it - or at the very least, it would have confirmed that it was within the bounds of possibility. Has the bible's inaccuracy proved a boon for atheists? Yes, but I don't think it's justified in the final analysis. God's existence (or otherwise) does not depend upon the accuracy of what we believe about him or about the way he's done things. I think the human race will eventually come to terms with the reality of common descent, and everyone will carry on much as they did before, no doubt downplaying the significance of the whole embarrassing affair, much as we do now with Galileo. \n\n \n I doubt if they'll carry on much as they did before - western governments will be much different if the political views of those like the book authors I noted above become reality. \n \n \nIt's impossible to say 'never' with certainty, but I think it very unlikely. Would we have developed flight if there were no birds or winged insects to put the idea in our heads? A truly vast proportion of what we now take for granted as 'human inventions' can be traced back to the observation of a natural phenomenon, which tends to suggest that inspiration from nature was required for our development of evolutionary algorithms. \n\n \n It's impossible to say with certainty what commercial products we wouldn't have (if any) because of Darwinism. We don't need it to observe birds and get ideas about flying. \n \n \nI think you're wandering off topic here. You demanded a commercial application for common descent. I pointed out that our knowledge of common descent saves paleontologists time and money by helping them focus their efforts. That's a direct consequence of a very specific bit of knowledge, which has to be right in order to achieve the benefit it does. It doesn't matter what 'lead to' the creation of maps; the point is that maps have direct commercial application. I'm not invoking any sequential leeway at all. \n\n \n You've made a somewhat convincing case that evolution (depending on it's definition this week) has contributed to the development of some commercial products, but how much and how significantly is all pretty much subjective - in the eyes of the beholder depending on worldviews. As the wedge document introduction said, the belief in the God of creation gave us the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Atheists don't agree of course. It's subjective. \n \n \nOne could as easily say that man's habit of creating of things motivated him to invent a god who created things. Even if we don't go that far, it's only necessary to believe god greated things in order to be inspired to emulate him. That belief, unlike the contents of a map or our knowledge of common descent, does not have to be correct to yield the benefits described.\n \n That wasn't my implication. Evolutionary principles allow us to make modern computer chips, just like relativity enables us to make accurate GPS. The exact same universal principles Darwin perceived operating in nature.\n \n True up to a point - but not any more. These days plane designs are modelled, varied, filtered - evolved in a simulator, in short, before ever going into production. Evolution is a way of making things better than we can design them to be via other methods. I even explained why in our other recent thread.\n \n Now you're getting the hang of it :) You're correct that we don't need to have evolved, although we do have to be able to evolve - evolutionary principles do have to work - in order for better computer chips to emerge from the same process. But I never claimed that computer chips were a direct spin-off from our understanding of common descent, only a commercial spin off of evolutionary theory.\n \n I'm sure you'd love to come to that conclusion, but in reality there is a clear and straightforward distinction between beliefs that need to be correct in order to bear fruit, and those that do not. So far, every single 'product of creation' has been a 'product whose development was inspired by a belief in creation'. I'm not detracting from the value of that in the slightest - I'm quite prepared to be convinced that belief in god has inspired humanity. But inspiring is not the same as enabling. Aerodynamics enable the construction of working aircraft. Evolutionary principles enable the design of modern computer chips. Our understanding of common descent enables efficient paleontology, as well as inspiring the discovery of evolutionary principles. \n\n \n Inspire vs enable? Evolution inspires AND enables, and creation/religion only inspires? And sometimes I'm told that science and religion are completely unrelated. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nOriginally posted by Peeling] I don't think you appreciate almost all of the negative emotion provoked by creationism and ID within the scientific community is professional rather than philosophical in nature. You simply assume that because you are primarily angered philosophically by evolution, the same must apply in reverse. \n \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] No, I see it in evolutionists, and I provided the proof above. If I continue to provide evidence of self motivated (not reactionary) political action by evolutionists, do you think you could show an equally long list of political action by creationists? That's more than just a reaction to something evolutionists have done? I don't think you could. Philosophical anger in the creation/evolution debate is much worse from the evolutionist side. \n\n \n \n'Continue'? When did you start? Books by atheists pulling apart religion don't count at all. \n\n \n Why don't they \"count\"? The double standard is amazing! I \"started\" when I showed that evolutionists are angered philosophically by religion! Evolutionist anger is everywhere! I don't assume it. \n \n Day 1 (Sam Harris): Why Are Atheists So Angry? | Jewcy.com\n \n I'll finish later.",

   "To finish up;\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] Different people have different definitions of what \"works\". The Biblical account of creation, male and female - how they relate to each other - \"works\" pretty well. \n\n \n \nIn what sense? You mean in the sense that woman was created for no other purpose than to keep man company? That she wasn't worth creating in her own right? Sorry, I'm just not following what's supposed to 'work' about that particular narrative. Does it continue to 'work' when you factor in the gill slits we develop as embryos, or the tail we grow and (usually) reabsorb? \n\n \n In relationship senses - emotional senses, in senses that go along with the guidelines for living that are in other parts of the Bible. What works for a full, meaningful life isn't measured in nothing but mechanical, scientific applications. But it's just as miraculous, just as complex. One thing is for sure, men liking and trying to impress women - and women liking and trying to impress men creates a whole lot more commercial products than anything evolution has ever done! Do you agree? :) If this world didn't have women in it I'd probably be far too motionless and lethargic to even bother to post here. emoticon_emb\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] It's a worldview thing. That all the good and bad, the twists and turns, the complications of this one little planet happened as a cosmic accident with no purpose doesn't make a bit of sense to me at all. \n\n \n \nAnd that's absolutely fine - I wouldn't dream of claiming that you are certainly wrong. Now, me personally, I don't see that postulating a god for whom we serve a purpose solves anything, because it only begs the question: if you need to be created for a purpose in order to have one, what's god's purpose? After all, a common anti-atheist slippery-slope argument is to say that if there's no god, then all our works are ultimately purposeless so we might as well not bother. But our works serve our purposes; if that isn't good enough, then us serving god's purpose isn't good enough either, unless he has a purpose, defined by something else - and so on. And if you say it's sufficient for us to have a purpose, that so long as there's a rung higher than us on the ladder, we can be happy in our place - well, society occupies that higher rung, just as you occupy the rung above the individual cells of which your body is composed.\n \n The core issue, though, is that all this philosophical 'worldview' stuff regarding purpose has nothing to do with the literal truth of genesis, which is a (so far as we can tell, fictional) narrative of natural history. Let's forget evolution for a moment, and stop pretending that it's a black-and-white choice between it and biblical literalism. Just examine genesis on its own. I'm sure you'll agree that as a narrative it could be wrong in every respect, and yet god could still be responsible for our existence, still take a personal interest in our lives, still judge our behaviour, still have sent Jesus to us. So why should the fact that it is wrong in most respects give you a moment's pause? I would hazard a guess that you simply like believing you possess an infallible spiritual manual, by which you can live your life and everything will be OK. I think that in the end it's that you're loath to abandon, and everything else is a convenient and plausible-sounding distraction. \n\n \n No, you don't realize that while my knowledge of Christianity is more limited than that of many others, it's complete enough to know that if Genesis is wrong, the rest of Christianity becomes weak and largely meaningless - at least meaningless enough to have to take a back seat to what would then be the ultimate source of judgment and knowledge in political matters - science and scientists. Considering all the weakness of science and scientists in this post alone, a backseat to that would be a shaky place to be.",

The deduction that the men were playing poker for money is the narrative we construct to tie that evidence together.

The innocence of the science of evolution can quickly get into one-sided politics, it seems. \n\n I haven't read the put-downs in question so I can't comment on their nature. Did Stenger say evolution proved Bush's foreign policy was terrible? Probably not :)\n \n You're still failing to grasp the core truth in all this: the fact of common descent could not be used against religion if that religion got it right in the first place. If the bible or any other religious manual had told a story that matched what we can plainly see around us, the scientific confirmation of evolution would have been a massive boost.\n \nIt all makes sense, except for one little problem;\n \n Why do all these Christians say nothing when evolution is used as a weapon against their religion by atheists?\n \n They're just passive like that? I'm supposed to really believe that? It's completely impossible for them to be pretend Christians?\n\n jyoshu doesn't say nothing :)\n \n Seriously though, I don't think it's impossible for a person to be a pretend Christian. But I do think it's stretching things somewhat to suppose that every single person who isn't taking up arms against evolution is faking their faith. It seems far more sensible to me to suppose they are following Saint Augustine's advice: preserving the good name of their church and holy book by speaking out against a vocal minority who would shackle its precious spiritual lessons to falsified narratives of natural history.\n \n Or consider it thus: as Christians who are also intellectually convinced of the truth of common descent and evolution, what are they supposed to do? Lie? Deny something they themselves understand to be true, in order to score points against atheists? Is that the way it should work - ends justifying the means? I don't think so. I think they understand the way to nullify evolution's potential for use as weapon against religion (a potential, don't forget, that exists only because it is clearly and demonstrably true) is to show that religion can accommodate it, that evolution isn't a weapon against spiritual beliefs after all.\n \n Doesn't that make sense to you? Before anyone can use the truth of evolution as a bludgeon to destroy faith, one must first believe evolution contradicts faith. And what are you and other creationists busy doing? Telling everyone who'll listen that evolution contradicts their faith, and that anyone who says different is a 'pretend Christian'. Way to go :)\n \n(Various social issues supposedly caused by evolution) Do you deny that these things are happening?\n\n I read a fictional book recently where a man - a staunch public critic of modern lax morality and the 'culture of victimhood' - was presented with a dilemma. He was shown two doors and told that behind each was a killer, both of whom had been led to believe that he had provided the evidence that convicted them. The man behind door A had done ten years' hard time as punishment, the one behind door B had been given counselling and rehabilitation. To escape, all the man had to do was pick a door, and make it past the killer on the other side to freedom.\n \n Which door do you think he picked?\n \n Anyway, once again we are wandering off the topic. Whatever social lessons anyone's tried to derive from the fact of our evolution, whether they were correct or not and what effect they've had, is a fascinating subject but not one for this thread.\n \n What I will say is: if you're going to criticise secular efforts at building a better society, you need to appreciate that from my point of view, all such efforts are ultimately secular, including the bible, the quran and all other spiritual manuals. The only difference is, they employ loyalty to a deity, rather than loyalty to a country or some other intangible ideal, to bind people together. I have an open mind as to whether that's a good or bad thing, in whole or in part; I'm not obliged to scorn it just because I don't think a personal god exists to be believed in. After all, there are many things we rely upon that exist only by common agreement, money being the classic example.\n \n(Universe vs Literal Genesis - only one loser)There's no possible source of error in those humans who are observing the universe?\n\n Sure there is. But when mistakes are made, theories don't work - and when they do work, you know you're on the right track. That's how we know the humans who wrote Genesis made mistakes.\n \nIt's impossible to say with certainty what commercial products we wouldn't have (if any) because of Darwinism. We don't need it to observe birds and get ideas about flying. \n\n I didn't say we did. I said that we know about flying because nature did it first, and because that's very often the case with our 'inventions', it's reasonable to suppose commercial products of evolutionary principles also owe their existence to our inspiration from nature.\n \nAs the wedge document introduction said, the belief in the God of creation gave us the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Atheists don't agree of course. It's subjective.\n\n You're right about it being subjective, and the interpretation being worldview-dependent, but you're wrong about why and how. I'm quite happy to be convinced that the principles upon which western civilisation were founded can be traced back to one religion or another. I'm even ready to be convinced that they can be traced back to a belief in a god of creation. I'm not obliged to deny that just because I happen to be an atheist. My view is simply that such a belief, or indeed any religion - just like socialism or communism - is a construct of the human mind. We are their authors. The god of creation doesn't have to actually exist for a belief in him to have the social consequences it allegedly did.\n \nInspire vs enable? Evolution inspires AND enables, and creation/religion only inspires? And sometimes I'm told that science and religion are completely unrelated. emoticon_rolleyes \n\n That's hardly what I meant :) Our observation of common descent in nature, like our observation of flying creatures, inspired investigations resulting in the discovery of evolutionary principles, which in turn enabled derivative commercial products. Perhaps the word 'inspired' is wrong; it seems to you to have philosophical and emotional overtones which I didn't intend to apply. 'Clued us in', maybe? Not the same kind of 'inspiration' a fervent belief would supply, anyway. Sorry about that.\n \nWhy don't they \"count\"? The double standard is amazing! I \"started\" when I showed that evolutionists are angered philosophically by religion!\n\n Except you didn't show that. You showed some atheists are angered by the - to them undeserved - influence religion continues to have over moden thinking. Of course these atheists are evolutionists - but that's not why they write those books. They write them because they believe their neighbour is being sold snake-oil. I'll ask you again: doesn't that count as a reaction?\n \n(In what sense does Genesis 'work' for human beings) In relationship senses - emotional senses, in senses that go along with the guidelines for living that are in other parts of the Bible. What works for a full, meaningful life isn't measured in nothing but mechanical, scientific applications. But it's just as miraculous, just as complex.\n\n Could you be more specific, maybe? What exactly does Genesis, uniquely, tell us about men and women that has relevance or application?\n \n \nOne thing is for sure, men liking and trying to impress women - and women liking and trying to impress men creates a whole lot more commercial products than anything evolution has ever done! Do you agree? :)\n\n Ooh, bad choice of example! You really think evolution has less to say about the sexes liking and trying to impress each other than the bible? :)\n \nNo, you don't realize that while my knowledge of Christianity is more limited than that of many others, it's complete enough to know that if Genesis is wrong, the rest of Christianity becomes weak and largely meaningless \n\n But why?

If science and scientists can come up with theories in a lab - however testable, repeatable, and observable they may be considered - your worldview tells you to take them much more seriously than any written history that may contradict it. My worldview tells me to accept written history at a level above some present-day scientific contradictions against it. For example, if we got a group of the best scientists on earth - yet foreign to the U.S. and unaware of it's history - to search for scientific evidence about details of the U.S. civil war (digging up and examining soldiers bodies, asking their relatives today what they know about the conflict etc) I have no doubt they'd come up with something radically different than the historic writings that have been maintained on it. \n \n \nAnd do you think that opinion should be suppressed?

Stenger seems to think that it goes without saying that we shouldn't have gone into Iraq. If it were possible to undo all that we've done in Iraq - never have gone in - put Hussein back in power etc. - I think the world would be worse off, and so do millions of other Americans. Just because the good that was accomplished there goes largely unreported in the media doesn't mean it didn't happen.\n \n \nYou're still failing to grasp the core truth in all this: the fact of common descent could not be used against religion if that religion got it right in the first place. If the bible or any other religious manual had told a story that matched what we can plainly see around us, the scientific confirmation of evolution would have been a massive boost. \n\n \n We can't plainly see common descent around us. It may get more and more plain in the minds of those who choose to believe it, but not to everyone. \n \n \nSeriously though, I don't think it's impossible for a person to be a pretend Christian. But I do think it's stretching things somewhat to suppose that every single person who isn't taking up arms against evolution is faking their faith. It seems far more sensible to me to suppose they are following Saint Augustine's advice: preserving the good name of their church and holy book by speaking out against a vocal minority who would shackle its precious spiritual lessons to falsified narratives of natural history.\n \n Or consider it thus: as Christians who are also intellectually convinced of the truth of common descent and evolution, what are they supposed to do? Lie? Deny something they themselves understand to be true, in order to score points against atheists? Is that the way it should work - ends justifying the means? I don't think so. I think they understand the way to nullify evolution's potential for use as weapon against religion (a potential, don't forget, that exists only because it is clearly and demonstrably true) is to show that religion can accommodate it, that evolution isn't a weapon against spiritual beliefs after all.\n \n Doesn't that make sense to you? \n\n \n Yes it does make sense, but only if they completely disregard 2Timothy 3;16, and drop the Bible down several hundred levels, to the point that it becomes equal to human endeavors - subject to human falsification. \n \n \nBefore anyone can use the truth of evolution as a bludgeon to destroy faith, one must first believe evolution contradicts faith. And what are you and other creationists busy doing? Telling everyone who'll listen that evolution contradicts their faith, and that anyone who says different is a 'pretend Christian'. Way to go :) \n\n \n We're telling everyone that some evolutionists can contradict their faith - that there may be some pretend Christians involved. Several places in the Bible warn against false teachings, stressed to the extent that I believe goes further than just a two-way, right-wrong, heaven/hell thing. 2Timothy 4; 3,4;\n \n \n \"For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. \n\n \n That's a societal reference, not a personal reference IMO. \n \n \nI read a fictional book recently where a man - a staunch public critic of modern lax morality and the 'culture of victimhood' - was presented with a dilemma. He was shown two doors and told that behind each was a killer, both of whom had been led to believe that he had provided the evidence that convicted them. The man behind door A had done ten years' hard time as punishment, the one behind door B had been given counselling and rehabilitation. To escape, all the man had to do was pick a door, and make it past the killer on the other side to freedom.\n \n Which door do you think he picked? \n\n \n Looks like liberal propaganda to me. He'd pick door B, because that person would be nicer to him since he didn't hold him accountable for his crime. The person he originally killed wasn't important. He was just an accident of evolution. Now if the rehab worked, we can move on and just forget the original victim. If it didn't, he'll kill someone else. \n \n You don't agree? Most atheists wouldn't, and most theistic evolutionists wouldn't. Maybe there really is something to Timothy's warning above. \n \n \nAnyway, once again we are wandering off the topic. Whatever social lessons anyone's tried to derive from the fact of our evolution, whether they were correct or not and what effect they've had, is a fascinating subject but not one for this thread. \n\n \n I agree, we may have to do that one sometime. The Obama presidency could very well inspire it. emoticon_frazzled\n \n \nWhat I will say is: if you're going to criticise secular efforts at building a better society, you need to appreciate that from my point of view, all such efforts are ultimately secular, including the bible, the quran and all other spiritual manuals. The only difference is, they employ loyalty to a deity, rather than loyalty to a country or some other intangible ideal, to bind people together. I have an open mind as to whether that's a good or bad thing, in whole or in part; I'm not obliged to scorn it just because I don't think a personal god exists to be believed in. After all, there are many things we rely upon that exist only by common agreement, money being the classic example. \n\n \n I basically agree, but what I highlighted in your post is very important - loyalty has to be somewhere. If a person's number 1 loyalty isn't with God, then it has to be channeled somewhere else. Maybe in evolution, maybe in global warming alarmism, but quite often in a person, usually a tyrant. That's what worries me most about atheists - where is their loyalty, and what does the object of their loyalty want from me? \n \n \nSure there is. But when mistakes are made, theories don't work - and when they do work, you know you're on the right track. That's how we know the humans who wrote Genesis made mistakes. \n\n \n I don't think that's always true. Fallacies can spawn a whole row of attractive looking things. How far can they go before they fall apart? Sometimes a long way, longer than many people might see in their lifetimes. \n \n \nI didn't say we did. I said that we know about flying because nature did it first, and because that's very often the case with our 'inventions', it's reasonable to suppose commercial products of evolutionary principles also owe their existence to our inspiration from nature. \n\n \n Then they're not exclusively evolutionary! If we can be inspired by things that many people believe God has done, especially if confirmed by the Bible, evolution can't say it's contradictions to the book of Genesis provided that inspiration. \n \n \nYou're right about it being subjective, and the interpretation being worldview-dependent, but you're wrong about why and how. I'm quite happy to be convinced that the principles upon which western civilisation were founded can be traced back to one religion or another. I'm even ready to be convinced that they can be traced back to a belief in a god of creation. I'm not obliged to deny that just because I happen to be an atheist. My view is simply that such a belief, or indeed any religion - just like socialism or communism - is a construct of the human mind. We are their authors. The god of creation doesn't have to actually exist for a belief in him to have the social consequences it allegedly did. \n\n \n And it's the same with evolution! Common descent didn't have to actually happen for an application of slight, countless modifications to result in computer chips that we have today. You don't agree? What's the difference? \n \n \nThat's hardly what I meant :) Our observation of common descent in nature, like our observation of flying creatures, inspired investigations resulting in the discovery of evolutionary principles, which in turn enabled derivative commercial products. Perhaps the word 'inspired' is wrong; it seems to you to have philosophical and emotional overtones which I didn't intend to apply. 'Clued us in', maybe? Not the same kind of 'inspiration' a fervent belief would supply, anyway. Sorry about that. \n\n \n Again, I don't see a bit of difference if faith in evolution clues us in, or if faith in God clues us in. \n \n \nExcept you didn't show that. You showed some atheists are angered by the - to them undeserved - influence religion continues to have over moden thinking. Of course these atheists are evolutionists - but that's not why they write those books. They write them because they believe their neighbour is being sold snake-oil. I'll ask you again: doesn't that count as a reaction? \n\n \n There is anger on both sides - I guess it's natural for both of us to think there's more on the other side. I think Christianity has a better (lighter)suspicion record concerning snake-oil than does evolution. \n \n \nCould you be more specific, maybe? What exactly does Genesis, uniquely, tell us about men and women that has relevance or application? \n\n \n That they are unique from animals. The basics in Genesis about man/woman relationships are more detailed in several other places in the Bible, like most of the last (31st) chapter of Proverbs, or most all of the book of Song of Solomon. \n \n \nOoh, bad choice of example! You really think evolution has less to say about the sexes liking and trying to impress each other than the bible? :) \n\n \n Yes, a lot less! The Bible shows a distinct elevation of man's behavior over animals - evolution shows no distinction at all.\n \n And I think it was a good choice of example! How would \"commercial-products-of-male/female-relationships-as-described-in-the-Bible\" look alongside of commercial products of evolution? \n \n \nBut why? Explain it to me. Why is it so crucial for god to have created us by that specific method?\n\n \n It's in that link I gave. But to sum it up as briefly as I can, Genesis says that when things were first created, they were \"very good\". There's little that's very good about evolutionary development, mostly pain, misery, ghastliness. \"Danger #4 from that list is one of the most basic;\n \n \nThe Bible describes man as being completely ensnared by sin after Adam's fall (Romans 7:18-19). Only those persons who realize that they are sinful and lost will seek the Savior who \"came to save that which was lost\" (Luke 19:10).\n However, evolution knows no sin in the biblical sense of missing one's purpose (in relation to God). Sin is made meaningless, and that is exactly the opposite of what the Holy Spirit does - He declares sin to be sinful. If sin is seen as a harmless evolutionary factor, then one has lost the key for finding God, which is not resolved by adding \"God\" to the evolutionary scenario. \n\n \n And, from danger #6;\n \n \nHowever, the sinner Adam and the Savior Jesus are linked together in the Bible - Romans 5:16-18. Thus any view which mythologizes Adam undermines the biblical basis of Jesus' work of redemption. \n\n \n Jesus' work of redemption is what it's all about. Though many Christian denominations disagree on how baptism should be done, how Holy Communion should be practiced, how much wine we should drink, how long church services should be, or many other details, they don't tamper in any way with Jesus work of redemption. When the Biblical history of the reason for that redemption is re-written, it's clear to me that it gets involved with those several Bible verses that warn about false teachers. And it gets even more clear when I find a complete absence of any notable theistic-evolution church, and (though there are a few exceptions) most theistic evolutionists generally agree with atheists on political matters. \n \n If you need more detail about why it's important for God to have created us by one specific method, take a drive through this fun-filled thread again, from two years ago. You stopped by then, but only briefly. I got the last word on that one!! - very rare - (just a few posts after being called a really bad name.) You might even check out the anger ratio there, and tell me what you see. :)",

   "For example, if we got a group of the best scientists on earth - yet foreign to the U.S. and unaware of it's history - to search for scientific evidence about details of the U.S. civil war (digging up and examining soldiers bodies, asking their relatives today what they know about the conflict etc) I have no doubt they'd come up with something radically different than the historic writings that have been maintained on it. \n\n It's interesting you think that. Excluding the 'asking relatives' part, which would unquestionably introduce personal bias, and assuming the historical accounts are indeed accurate, I can't think of any reason why a scientific investigation of the evidence would contradict them. Can you? Sure, such an investigation might well fail to unearth evidence backing up every single documented historical fact, but that's not the same thing as finding evidence that actively refutes what's in the history books.\n \n Like I said to AA, I really don't think we have to agree to disagree here. There are circumstances where you would not hold historical accounts above other kinds of evidence, and I do not automatically take absence of evidence as evidence of absence. \n \n If you say you went shopping yesterday, I'll believe you, even if you can't provide the receipts. On the other hand, if I say I flew to the moon yesterday, you'd want some pretty convincing supporting evidence to back up that historical, eyewitness account. Or if I said I went to work yesterday, but you had CCTV footage of me going to a football match, which would you believe? \n \n So no, I don't think you can pretend this is a cut'n'dried worldview difference concerning historical testimony, about which we just have to 'agree to disagree'. You extend the bible in particular special treatment.\n \nOver in the other thread, I showed the quotes of one of the Dover\"theistic evolutionists\" who claimed that \"science cannot touch theology\". If science is used as a weapon against it by any prominent figure whatsoever, it really is touching it! \n\n Oooh, no; that's completely wrong. Whether or not something can be leveraged to change or reinforce someone's perception of an issue is quite seperate from whether it has any genuine logical impact. And it works both ways, too: I've long ago lost count of how many completely irrelevant anti-evolution arguments are presented here as 'the last nail in the coffin of a dying theory'. The entire creationist campaign is based on such argumentation.\n \n \nDid Stenger say evolution proved Bush's foreign policy was terrible?\n \n Yes, on page 246, he said Bush's belief in God caused poor foreign policy. \n\n Well then no, he didn't say evolution proved Bush's foreign policy was terrible, did he? Nor did he even say Bush's belief in God caused poor foreign policy. Based on the quote, he said that Bush's belief that he was doing god's work invading another country, and the public's fellow-feeling to that effect, caused and abetted poor foreign policy. It's an appalling misrepresentation on your part, to claim that Stenger sat down and applied 'evolution' to politics. \n \nI still believe it, and so do millions of other Americans. Stenger seems to think that it goes without saying that we shouldn't have gone into Iraq. If it were possible to undo all that we've done in Iraq - never have gone in - put Hussein back in power etc. - I think the world would be worse off, and so do millions of other Americans. Just because the good that was accomplished there goes largely unreported in the media doesn't mean it didn't happen.\n\n Off-topic, but I think it's wrong to pretend the only alternative to doing exactly what was done was to do nothing. Perhaps an invasion was necessary, perhaps toppling Saddam was necessary. Was it necessary, when a celebrating Iraqi people sponteneously called elections in the wake of the invasion, to veto their choices and install a government hand-picked for their willingness to allow the country's state-owned infrastructure and resources to be strip-mined by American businesses? Was it necessary to put hundreds of thousands of Iraqis out of work, letting their factories and refineries stand idle while using Iraqi state money to pay foreign contractors to import raw materials and services at several times the cost? Contractors who weren't vetted, often had no experience or realistic chance of completing their work, and who scooted out of the country leaving hospitals unbuilt and unequipped as soon as the money ran out? The insurgency was not a response to the invasion, but to the vile economic rape of a country already suffering after years of sanctions, conducted at the point of American guns.\n \nWe can't plainly see common descent around us. It may get more and more plain in the minds of those who choose to believe it, but not to everyone.\n\n Obviously your mileage is going to vary here :) I think it's true to say that to anyone without a vested interest in common descent not being true, the evidence is clear-cut.\n \n(Theistic evolutionists and their motivation) Yes it does make sense, but only if they completely disregard 2Timothy 3;16, and drop the Bible down several hundred levels, to the point that it becomes equal to human endeavors - subject to human falsification.\n\n I'm not saying it's without consequence. I'm just saying you can do it without being a 'pretend Christian'.\n \n What freaks me out a little, still, is how you talk as if the theistic evolutionist's decision to treat the bible as allegorical in some respects, or your decision to treat it as literal truth, makes it so. The bible doesn't become literally true just because you decide to act like it is, just because you think it would be nicer that way. Nor does it become allegorical because of the theistic evolutionist's decision, or become an imaginative secular work because of mine. It is what it is - all we can do is try to make the best possible judgement. And I think it's fair to say that biblical literalism involves the unwarranted exclusion of far, far more evidence than theistic evolution.\n \n(Creationists are forcing people into a false dichotomy by saying evolution is incompatible with Christianity) We're telling everyone that some evolutionists can contradict their faith - that there may be some pretend Christians involved. Several places in the Bible warn against false teachings, stressed to the extent that I believe goes further than just a two-way, right-wrong, heaven/hell thing. 2Timothy 4; 3,4;\n\n Ok, but I'm right to say that you both hold and strongly evangelise the view that evolution and Christianity are incompatible, yes?\n \n( The Door Dilemma ) Looks like liberal propaganda to me. He'd pick door B, because that person would be nicer to him since he didn't hold him accountable for his crime. The person he originally killed wasn't important. He was just an accident of evolution. Now if the rehab worked, we can move on and just forget the original victim. If it didn't, he'll kill someone else. \n \n\n That's an extremely ugly worldview you have there. Demonising atheists and humanists below the point of even qualifying as human. It's quite frightening to know that's what you think of me, and you believe yourself to be my moral superior for thinking like that.\n \nYou don't agree? Most atheists wouldn't, and most theistic evolutionists wouldn't. Maybe there really is something to Timothy's warning above.\n\n Damn right I don't agree. I'd take the time to correct your insulting and offensive characterisation, if the thought of prostrating myself for your approval wasn't too demeaning to stomach right now.\n \nI basically agree, but what I highlighted in your post is very important - loyalty has to be somewhere. If a person's number 1 loyalty isn't with God, then it has to be channeled somewhere else. Maybe in evolution, maybe in global warming alarmism, but quite often in a person, usually a tyrant. That's what worries me most about atheists - where is their loyalty, and what does the object of their loyalty want from me?\n\n Most gods have been tyrants - or rather, that's how the priesthoods have wielded them: obey or suffer. The Christian god is a tyrant. Talking about being 'loyal' to evolution or global warming strikes me as a bit of a non-sequitur though. It's not always possible to just yank one word out of a sentence, cram in another, and still make sense :)\n \n It was something of an epiphany, though, reading the bolded words above. So much about the way you view the issue clicked into place for me. You think of atheists as a collective. It honestly never occurred to me before now to look at things with that particular filter installed.\n \n If one assumes atheists are a collective, like Christians or Muslims, it begs the question: where is their manifesto? Where is their bible? Their statement of common purpose? They must have one, because that's how collectives work. So the fact they aren't actively advertising it means it must be sneaky, stealthy and underhand - and the ones who say there is no such manifesto must be lying to cover it up. You summed it up neatly: to what are they loyal, and what does it want from me? And of course one thing most atheists have in common is an acceptance of evolution, making it a convenient lightning-rod for your suspicions.\n \n Except... thinking of atheists as a collective is like thinking of people who don't support Manchester United as a collective. It's fundamentally wrong; there's no commonality of purpose, no 'agenda'. Sure, within that sprawling, disparate mass you'll be able to pick out genuine collectives, some of whom (eg the supporters of other teams) might be actively antithetical to Man U, but to assume they're representative of the whole is... well, it looks like paranoia, to those who haven't made the mistake of imagining the collective to exist in the first place.\n \n That's why I've been so baffled when you start with evolution and segue off into politics and worldviews and all the rest of it. I haven't the first clue what the political views of other atheists might be, whether they're communist, capitalist, socialist - being an atheist is a decision not to join a collective. Nor am I wedded to evolution, or any particular flavour of it. As the leading explanation for our present form of existence, with plenty of compelling evidence to support it, I find it extremely convincing - but it's not a defining property of my life. I speak up in its defence here, on these forums, partly because I enjoy the mental workout, partly because I appreciate the value of the methods by which evolution was discovered, and partly because I don't like to see collectives with unconvincing manifestos trying to trick people into signing up by propagating misinformation.\n \n(theories that work prove we're on the right track) I don't think that's always true. Fallacies can spawn a whole row of attractive looking things. How far can they go before they fall apart? Sometimes a long way, longer than many people might see in their lifetimes.\n\n How very true! Not a terribly compelling argument for hanging onto things when they have fallen apart, though...\n \n(It's fair to say observation of common descent and evolution in nature was a necessary prerequisite subsequent understanding of evolutionary principles) Then they're not exclusively evolutionary! If we can be inspired by things that many people believe God has done, especially if confirmed by the Bible, evolution can't say it's contradictions to the book of Genesis provided that inspiration.\n\n Sorry, but I really don't understand what you're trying to say here. We saw common descent and evolution in nature, and from that deduced evolutionary principles. It's nothing to do with genesis. What are you trying to say the bible is responsible for, exactly?\n \nAnd it's the same with evolution! Common descent didn't have to actually happen for an application of slight, countless modifications to result in computer chips that we have today. You don't agree? What's the difference?\n\n I do agree. I've been agreeing for several posts now. You just don't seem to be listening :)\n \n Common descent in nature inspired the search for and discovery of evolutionary principles, which in turn enabled commercial products like modern computer chips. If you want me to say it another way, I will: I credit the evolutionary principles with commercial products like modern computer chips. I credit common descent in nature with inspiring the discovery of those principles. Two completely seperate things. Clear?\n \nAgain, I don't see a bit of difference if faith in evolution clues us in, or if faith in God clues us in.\n\n Argh! I'm not saying there is a difference, so long as we're talking about inspiration!\n \n The difference is this: a belief in god can inspire someone to accomplish something even if god doesn't exist. The belief can be right or wrong and it makes no odds. An understanding of aerodynamics, on the other hand, can only enable manned flight if the understanding is correct.\n \n Imagine a child is about to walk out into traffic without looking. He thinks he hears someone calling him, and stops to look back - narrowly avoiding being run over.\n \n Imagine another child, who carefully looks both ways before crossing safely.\n \n Neither child got run over, but do they deserve equal credit for this feat? No. The first child didn't have to be right: he just got lucky.\n \n(What exactly does Genesis, uniquely, tell us about men and women that has relevance or application?) That they are unique from animals. The basics in Genesis about man/woman relationships are more detailed in several other places in the Bible, like most of the last (31st) chapter of Proverbs, or most all of the book of Song of Solomon. \n\n Well, the rest of the bible isn't Genesis, so that's hardly relevant to the matter in hand. As for being distinct from animals... for one, that's nothing to do with the relationship between men and women, and for two, we are distinct; obviously so. How is sharing a common biological ancestor with other creatures, in a tree of life ultimately spawned by god, any more demeaning than us all emerging from the mind of the same designer? Who, by the way, clearly re-used all kinds of cobbled-together stuff from other animals in our construction, including any number of broken bits? If the bible said we were created by a different god than the other animals, I could understand the aversion, but this just baffles me.\n \n We're still drawing a blank on the relevance of literal genesis to the relationship between men and women.\n \nYes, a lot less! The Bible shows a distinct elevation of man's behavior over animals - evolution shows no distinction at all.\n \n And I think it was a good choice of example! How would \"commercial-products-of-male/female-relationships-as-described-in-the-Bible\" look alongside of commercial products of evolution? \n\n Put those goalposts back where you got them :) You talked about men liking and wanting to impress women, and women liking and wanting to impress men. Elevation of behaviour over other animals wasn't mentioned - and even if it had been, you're utterly wrong to say that evolution implies we've no reason to behave 'better' than animals. On the contrary, it helps to show us that we are different from animals, physically and mentally, because of the development of that behaviour. Our empathy, our cooperation and commitment to one another, even to complete strangers, is intimately connected with our success and intellectual development and enlightenment as a species. We have morals because morals work. We should endeavour to overcome our base impulses because that path really does lead down to the degradation of the human race - we know because we've spent a million years or more struggling up it :) \n \n Remember what I've been saying, how if the bible was correct science would confirm it? How ironic that it's the bible's spiritual message science has confirmed, yet you're dedicating your free time to insisting that it is wrong.\n \n Also, I presume you're referring to marriage as a commercial product inspired by the bible? Fair point - with the caveat that, once again, the bible in no way has to be right for that particular commercial enterprise to succeed. It just has to be believed. Going back to common descent and evolution, you are right that common descent need only be believed in order to have inspired the discovery of evolutionary principles, but those principles have to be correct in order for commercial applications based upon them to succeed. That's the distinction I'm drawing.\n \nIt's in that link I gave. But to sum it up as briefly as I can, Genesis says that when things were first created, they were \"very good\". There's little that's very good about evolutionary development, mostly pain, misery, ghastliness. \n\n Which, if they were part of creation, were good. To say otherwise is to second guess god; to apply your human standards to his behaviour and judge it unworthy. If god is perfect it is because he defines perfection, not because he jumps through your hoops.",

Can you? \n\n \n Yes - the \"asking relatives\" part would be very similar to the way scientists seek each others opinions today. Same applications of personal bias. Also, if they missed something important that actually happened, it could cause them to veer down erroneous paths, and come to false conclusions. They could have taken note of how strong the Confederacy was at the beginning, while somehow missing the Unions strengths at the end - missing....General Shermans march through Georgia, etc. Then they could have taken notice of how amazingly messed up things are today in the northern cities of Detroit and Chicago, and determined that the south won the war!!

I know the claim is that if something better came along that Darwinism would be abandoned by science, but it's not a believable claim in light of the fierce support of Darwinism. \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] Over in the other thread, I showed the quotes of one of the Dover\"theistic evolutionists\" who claimed that \"science cannot touch theology\".

The word \"science\" is so vague that it can be applied either way depending on the situation, blended either way, switched back and fourth at will? Logic tells us that at least one of them is wrong! It's possible for both of them to be wrong, as I believe they are, but one of them has to be! If they both want to be right, they don't have equal claim to the word \"science\" - if they're honest, one of them would give up that word. But they won't - they can get by with calling all of intelligent design 'religion', and let the words 'evolution', even the word 'science' to live a double life! \n \n There's no other subject that has such interchangeability! Those who practice it can blend Stenger's statement and Rehm's statement any time, anywhere, any way they need to. Yet if one person uses intelligent design to forward religion, then ALL of intelligent design is religious, and is thrown out of the scientific realm! \n \n Some of intelligent design can be used to promote religion, but scientific searches for specified complexity and evidence of design are separate from it, in exactly the same way that Stenger and Rehm's differences are separate. Yet ID is painted with only the religious brush, while science can't be painted with the atheist brush. The double standard is crystal clear. If there's no agreeing to disagree above, there's no agreeing to disagree here, is there? \n \n \nAnd it works both ways, too: I've long ago lost count of how many completely irrelevant anti-evolution arguments are presented here as 'the last nail in the coffin of a dying theory'. The entire creationist campaign is based on such argumentation. \n\n \n It sure does work both ways! I've lost count of all the anti-creation arguments presented here as the last nail in the coffin for creationists. \n \n \nWell then no, he didn't say evolution proved Bush's foreign policy was terrible, did he? Nor did he even say Bush's belief in God caused poor foreign policy. Based on the quote, he said that Bush's belief that he was doing god's work invading another country, and the public's fellow-feeling to that effect, caused and abetted poor foreign policy. It's an appalling misrepresentation on your part, to claim that Stenger sat down and applied 'evolution' to politics. \n\n \n We were talking about how science and evolution can be used as a weapon against religion , as we were discussing Stenger's book \"...How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist\", coupled with his claims that Bush's foreign policy was terrible. When you asked \"Did Stenger say evolution proved Bush's foreign policy was terrible\", I didn't stop and analyze if it was a trick question - a switcharoo between the words \"science\" and \"evolution\" - I answered it based on Stenger's secularism. Secularism vs belief in God are the only two choices in town when a secularist is taking issue with a believer in God concerning political decisions. It wasn't me who made an appalling misrepresentation. Let me put it this way - Stenger was clearly implying that if Bush had a godless worldview, that he would have practiced better foreign policy. \n \n \nOff-topic, but I think it's wrong to pretend the only alternative to doing exactly what was done was to do nothing. Perhaps an invasion was necessary, perhaps toppling Saddam was necessary. Was it necessary, when a celebrating Iraqi people sponteneously called elections in the wake of the invasion, to veto their choices and install a government hand-picked for their willingness to allow the country's state-owned infrastructure and resources to be strip-mined by American businesses? Was it necessary to put hundreds of thousands of Iraqis out of work, letting their factories and refineries stand idle while using Iraqi state money to pay foreign contractors to import raw materials and services at several times the cost? Contractors who weren't vetted, often had no experience or realistic chance of completing their work, and who scooted out of the country leaving hospitals unbuilt and unequipped as soon as the money ran out? The insurgency was not a response to the invasion, but to the vile economic rape of a country already suffering after years of sanctions, conducted at the point of American guns. \n\n \n What I said was on topic because it was an example of Stengers book - what you said did take it too far off topic. But you give the standard Godless political opinions of U.S. involvement in Iraq, so it's not a problem. :)\n \n \nObviously your mileage is going to vary here :) I think it's true to say that to anyone without a vested interest in common descent not being true, the evidence is clear-cut.\n \n I'm not saying it's without consequence. I'm just saying you can do it without being a 'pretend Christian'.\n \n What freaks me out a little, still, is how you talk as if the theistic evolutionist's decision to treat the bible as allegorical in some respects, or your decision to treat it as literal truth, makes it so. The bible doesn't become literally true just because you decide to act like it is, just because you think it would be nicer that way. Nor does it become allegorical because of the theistic evolutionist's decision, or become an imaginative secular work because of mine. It is what it is - all we can do is try to make the best possible judgement. And I think it's fair to say that biblical literalism involves the unwarranted exclusion of far, far more evidence than theistic evolution. \n\n \n I'm not saying it makes it so, I'm saying it gives it political power. There is a difference. \n \n \nOk, but I'm right to say that you both hold and strongly evangelise the view that evolution and Christianity are incompatible, yes? \n\n \n It depends on the ever changing definition of evolution. If I say that common descent and Christianity are incompatible, most evolutionists will immediately shout that I think changes within kinds don't happen, therefore all creationists are scientific illiterates just like me!\n \n \nThat's an extremely ugly worldview you have there. Demonising atheists and humanists below the point of even qualifying as human. It's quite frightening to know that's what you think of me, and you believe yourself to be my moral superior for thinking like that. \n\n \n What I said wasn't worded very well and maybe you took it the wrong way. That scenario was simply repeated by you, it wasn't originated by you. It looked like the author of your book was wracking their brain to try to find a scenario - no matter how unrealistic - to place a staunch public critic of modern lax morality and the 'culture of victimhood' in an uncomfortable position because of his traditional, conservative views of justice. \n \n I didn't intend to imply that I considered myself your moral superior, I intended to show my difference of opinion to that of yours and the theistic evolutionist. Your view (there is no god) and the theistic evolutionists view (god is weak and irrelevant) puts science/humans in a similar position. You would probably both have a similar opinion on criminal rehabilitation. If you have similar opinions on global warming - if we can cool the planet, surely we can rehabilitate anyone we want! If we turn a rehabilitated murderer lose, and he murders again, then our reasons for it can continue to go in opposite directions. Yours may be that we kept him locked up for too long and made him too angry. Mine would be that we're secondary to God and that we may not always have the capacity to rehabilitate, and since the Bible says \"whosoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed\", sometimes (each murder case has to be individually analyzed of course) thoughts of rehabilitation should not be considered. Just a few years ago in the US we had two men who rigged a car so that one of them could lay in the trunk and shoot people through a small hole, a tail light opening or something similar, and just pick innocent bystanders off, just for fun. Just sit there for a few minutes and watch the reactions, panic, terror, then slowly drive away. Took several murders before the law was able to figure out how they were doing it without detection. Maybe some psychiatrists would feel compassion for the car-murderers I described above, and seek to rehabilitate them with public money. I don't agree. It's just my opinion. \n \n \nDamn right I don't agree. I'd take the time to correct your insulting and offensive characterisation, if the thought of prostrating myself for your approval wasn't too demeaning to stomach right now. \n\n \n Any of us who have been posters here for any length of time have had our stomachs turned at one time or another. Compassion for completely innocent murder victims / the thoughts of murderers laughing at our justice system - has always been one of my major soft spots. I won't bother to describe to you the exact details of what I'd like to see done to the two car-murderers I described above. \n It would involve a length of rope and a stout tree. \n \n \nMost gods have been tyrants - or rather, that's how the priesthoods have wielded them: obey or suffer. The Christian god is a tyrant. Talking about being 'loyal' to evolution or global warming strikes me as a bit of a non-sequitur though. It's not always possible to just yank one word out of a sentence, cram in another, and still make sense :)\n \n It was something of an epiphany, though, reading the bolded words above. So much about the way you view the issue clicked into place for me. You think of atheists as a collective. It honestly never occurred to me before now to look at things with that particular filter installed. \n\n \n After picking myself up off the floor, I have to say that I believe you're being sincere. I sometimes find myself wishing you were from the US so we could cover more US politics. At times like this I'm glad you're not, I know you're not brainwashed by our Democrat party like many posters here are. \n \n There are exceptions to every rule of course, some non-militant atheists have very conservative political views, but not many. There are several minor, and one or two major collectives for most atheists. \n \n \nIf one assumes atheists are a collective, like Christians or Muslims, it begs the question: where is their manifesto? \n\n \n The Humanist Manifesto Do you have a basic disagreement with it? I do. \n \n \nWhere is their bible? \n\n \n There are many - Origin of Species, Dawkins books, Stengers books, Harris books, Dennets books. A lot of variation, but they obviously don't disagree with each other in basics. \n \n \nTheir statement of common purpose? They must have one, because that's how collectives work. So the fact they aren't actively advertising it means it must be sneaky, stealthy and underhand - and the ones who say there is no such manifesto must be lying to cover it up. \n\n \n There's no covering up going on! There's little if any attempt made by websites like Talkorigins, NoanswersinGenesis, Panda's thumb, American Atheists, many others, to distinguish themselves from each other. There's nothing sneaky or stealthy about a disdain for George Bush from just about any atheist website, or news organization. \n \n The editorial boards of countless major newspapers across the U.S. - largely atheist, largely liberal - big government, environmentalist, George Bush haters. \n \n \nYou summed it up neatly: to what are they loyal, and what does it want from me? And of course one thing most atheists have in common is an acceptance of evolution, making it a convenient lightning-rod for your suspicions. \n\n \n I sum everything up neatly. :p\n \n That makes them loyal to science and scientists! It leads to tyrants like Al Gore, and he wants a lot from me! He doesn't like the fact that I use an internal combustion engine to make a living. \n \n \nExcept... thinking of atheists as a collective is like thinking of people who don't support Manchester United as a collective. It's fundamentally wrong; there's no commonality of purpose, no 'agenda'. Sure, within that sprawling, disparate mass you'll be able to pick out genuine collectives, some of whom (eg the supporters of other teams) might be actively antithetical to Man U, but to assume they're representative of the whole is... well, it looks like paranoia, to those who haven't made the mistake of imagining the collective to exist in the first place. \n\n \n The collectivism is environmentalism, re-distribution of wealth, big government. Science as the last word in knowledge for political decisions. \n \n \nThat's why I've been so baffled when you start with evolution and segue off into politics and worldviews and all the rest of it. I haven't the first clue what the political views of other atheists might be, whether they're communist, capitalist, socialist - being an atheist is a decision not to join a collective. Nor am I wedded to evolution, or any particular flavour of it. As the leading explanation for our present form of existence, with plenty of compelling evidence to support it, I find it extremely convincing - but it's not a defining property of my life. I speak up in its defence here, on these forums, partly because I enjoy the mental workout, partly because I appreciate the value of the methods by which evolution was discovered, and partly because I don't like to see collectives with unconvincing manifestos trying to trick people into signing up by propagating misinformation. \n\n \n There's a lot of diversity in Christianity. Other than the central theme of Christ crucified, details take off in different directions pretty quickly from denomination to denomination. (I believe that's the way God likes it - that's another subject however) \n \n The \"mental workout\" - a good way to describe it for me too. :)\n \n I see less diversity in atheism than I do Christianity. Your not knowing about political views of atheists is simply the result of your not paying attention. I can't tell a dimes worth of difference between at least 10 or 15 other atheist posters here, concerning their political views. Richard Dawkins is described as having \"socialist\" leanings. Most Bush haters do. Stenger does. When the subject comes up at sites like talkorigins, NoanswersinGenesis, American Atheists, you'll find that they do too. Here is one of the opening paragraphs from the Humanist Manefesto that I linked above;\n \n \nToday man's larger understanding of the universe, his scientific achievements, and deeper appreciation of brotherhood, have created a situation which requires a new statement of the means and purposes of religion. Such a vital, fearless, and frank religion capable of furnishing adequate social goals and personal satisfactions may appear to many people as a complete break with the past. While this age does owe a vast debt to the traditional religions, it is none the less obvious that any religion that can hope to be a synthesizing and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present. It is a responsibility which rests upon this generation. \n\n \n Progress! Liberalism! Environmentalism! Collectivism for atheism!\n \n \nOrignially posted by marc9000] (theories that work prove we're on the right track) I don't think that's always true. Fallacies can spawn a whole row of attractive looking things. How far can they go before they fall apart? Sometimes a long way, longer than many people might see in their lifetimes. \n\n \n \nHow very true! Not a terribly compelling argument for hanging onto things when they have fallen apart, though...\n\n \n Yes, I know! :) I was thinking about Piltdown man. He got started in 1912 and didn't get exposed as a fraud until 1953. That means a child born around 1900 learned about Piltdown man as a teenager, and, if he/she lived long enough, finally found out the truth after becoming a grandparent in most cases. If they died young, well it was the truth for them their whole lives. But many of us still kept hanging on to evolution, didn't we? \n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000] (It's fair to say observation of common descent and evolution in nature was a necessary prerequisite subsequent understanding of evolutionary principles) Then they're not exclusively evolutionary! If we can be inspired by things that many people believe God has done, especially if confirmed by the Bible, evolution can't say it's contradictions to the book of Genesis provided that inspiration. \n\n \n \nSorry, but I really don't understand what you're trying to say here. We saw common descent and evolution in nature, and from that deduced evolutionary principles. It's nothing to do with genesis. What are you trying to say the bible is responsible for, exactly? \n\n \n We see a God that created, that loves, that likes beautiful things, etc. It was an inspiration to do the same, in whatever capacity we are able. \n \n \nI do agree. I've been agreeing for several posts now. You just don't seem to be listening :) \n\n \n You haven't been exactly agreeing. You've been saying that inspiring (creationism) isn't the same as enabling (evolution) I'm saying that inspiring vs enabling are too close to distinguish between, that they are equal in creation inspiration/ enabling vs evolutionary inspiration/ enabling. \n \n \nCommon descent in nature inspired the search for and discovery of evolutionary principles, which in turn enabled commercial products like modern computer chips. If you want me to say it another way, I will: I credit the evolutionary principles with commercial products like modern computer chips. I credit common descent in nature with inspiring the discovery of those principles. Two completely seperate things. Clear? \n\n \n Yes, and I credit creationism for inspiring one man and one woman to go to an extra effort in many cases to be loyal to each other for an entire lifetime, and I credit the teachings of Christ, as well as Proverbs, Song of Solomon, others, with providing guidelines on just how to do it, enabling so many to successfully do it. \n \n So this thread starters attempt to elevate evolution above creationism by using commercial products alone pretty well failed for him, didn't it? \n \n \nArgh! I'm not saying there is a difference, so long as we're talking about inspiration! \n\n \n Do you think that's what this thread's starter was talking about? I do, and it backfired on him, didn't it? \n \n \nThe difference is this: a belief in god can inspire someone to accomplish something even if god doesn't exist. The belief can be right or wrong and it makes no odds. An understanding of aerodynamics, on the other hand, can only enable manned flight if the understanding is correct.\n \n Imagine a child is about to walk out into traffic without looking. He thinks he hears someone calling him, and stops to look back - narrowly avoiding being run over.\n \n Imagine another child, who carefully looks both ways before crossing safely.\n \n Neither child got run over, but do they deserve equal credit for this feat? No. The first child didn't have to be right: he just got lucky.\n\n \n I don't see a difference - don't see how your example applies. A belief in the accomplishments of small, progressive change doesn't have to be true in biology for it to enable the design of computer chips. \n \n \nWell, the rest of the bible isn't Genesis, so that's hardly relevant to the matter in hand. As for being distinct from animals... for one, that's nothing to do with the relationship between men and women, and for two, we are distinct; obviously so. How is sharing a common biological ancestor with other creatures, in a tree of life ultimately spawned by god, any more demeaning than us all emerging from the mind of the same designer? Who, by the way, clearly re-used all kinds of cobbled-together stuff from other animals in our construction, including any number of broken bits? If the bible said we were created by a different god than the other animals, I could understand the aversion, but this just baffles me.\n \n We're still drawing a blank on the relevance of literal genesis to the relationship between men and women. \n\n \n We're not, you are. We don't see dogs and cats and mice and rats and countless other animals picking out their mates at an early age and going to great pains to remain loyal to that mate for their whole lives. We wouldn't see humans do it near as much without Genesis, the foundation for the entire Bible. The foundation - the ministry AnswersinGenesis has that name for that specific reason. That if a person has questions about most anything in Christianity, how we should live, why does any part of the Bible say what it says, why we are like we are, the answers to our questions are always in Genesis. \n \n \nPut those goalposts back where you got them :) \n\n \n The title of this thread is \"commercial products of creationism\". The implication from the opening post was that the evolution belief was superior to the creationist belief because it inspires/enables us to have more/better commercial products. When our discussion leads to new thoughts of the inspiration/enabling of commercial products in creation, my calling it out isn't moving goalposts. \n \n \nYou talked about men liking and wanting to impress women, and women liking and wanting to impress men. Elevation of behaviour over other animals wasn't mentioned - and even if it had been, you're utterly wrong to say that evolution implies we've no reason to behave 'better' than animals. On the contrary, it helps to show us that we are different from animals, physically and mentally, because of the development of that behaviour. Our empathy, our cooperation and commitment to one another, even to complete strangers, is intimately connected with our success and intellectual development and enlightenment as a species. We have morals because morals work. We should endeavour to overcome our base impulses because that path really does lead down to the degradation of the human race - we know because we've spent a million years or more struggling up it :) \n \n Remember what I've been saying, how if the bible was correct science would confirm it? How ironic that it's the bible's spiritual message science has confirmed, yet you're dedicating your free time to insisting that it is wrong. \n\n \n It's amazing to me that science can claim authority on human behavior. It would be nice if it confirmed the Bible's spiritual message to the letter. But there are important differences, aren't there? Science is a lot easier on same-sex relationships than the Bible is, isn't it? Science confirms our \"commitment to one another\" with scientific, big government authority, right? Gun control is confirmed by science to a much more clear degree than the Bible does? Abortion has much more flexibility with science? The difference between Biblical authority vs scientific authority seems to be just about the same as the differences between Republicans and Democrats! \n \n \nAlso, I presume you're referring to marriage as a commercial product inspired by the bible? Fair point - with the caveat that, once again, the bible in no way has to be right for that particular commercial enterprise to succeed. It just has to be believed. Going back to common descent and evolution, you are right that common descent need only be believed in order to have inspired the discovery of evolutionary principles, but those principles have to be correct in order for commercial applications based upon them to succeed. That's the distinction I'm drawing. \n\n \n Not marriage as the product itself, but the products that are spawned by it. The jewelry business, so many products in the home that are intended to please two opposite sex adults who have a commitment to one another. It's an arrangement that works, it's been proven, it has to be correct to have stood the test of time that it has. \n \n \nWhich, if they were part of creation, were good. To say otherwise is to second guess god; to apply your human standards to his behaviour and judge it unworthy. If god is perfect it is because he defines perfection, not because he jumps through your hoops.\n\n \n I'm not applying my standards to it, I'm applying His as explained throughout the Bible. In the beginning, before the first man sinned, there was no pain, no \"painful toil\", no \"thorns and thistles\", and no death! You can't have evolution without a lot of death.",

   "There is so much wrong with this screed, that I'll leave it to poor old Peeling to refute at his leisure....\n \n \nYou can&#8217;t have evolution without a lot of death.\n\n \n That was about the only thing I agreed with. Yes, Virginia, you can't have evolution without death. You can't have life without death, and you cannot have life without evolution.\n \n Let's look at a couple of odd comments:\n \n \nWhatever. I do extend the Bible special treatment, I&#8217;ll admit that, but it&#8216;s no different than the way evolutionists extend special treatment to Darwinism. I know the claim is that if something better came along that Darwinism would be abandoned by science, but it&#8217;s not a believable claim in light of the fierce support of Darwinism.\n\n \n Well, I wouldn't expect a reactionary religious fundamentalist to believe it, because these guys do not think the same way scientists think. But actually, yes... had the scientific evidence accumulated over the last 150 years disproved Darwin, then no biologist today would be a Darwinian. Instead, all biologists are Darwinians because Darwin seems to have got it basically right. Oh, there's things Darwin didn't get right, and there have been developments in non-Darwinian theories of evolution that are important, but Darwin's insight into the power of natural selection to hone design from random variation remains central to biology.\n \n \nI&#8217;ve lost count of all the anti-creation arguments presented here as the last nail in the coffin for creationists.\n\n \n Some corpses don't have the sense to stay decently dead!\n \n \nPeeling: If one assumes atheists are a collective, like Christians or Muslims, it begs the question: where is their manifesto?\n The Humanist Manifesto Do you have a basic disagreement with it? I do.\n\n \n I guess I must not be a \"real\" atheist! I've never read the Humanist Manifesto. Perhaps it's because I have a distrust of documents with \"Manifesto\" in their title, probably because British political parties produce them before elections. Or at least they used to, and they became a bit of a joke.\n \n I have read Dawkins and Dennett, of course, but I have also read Hans Kung and Ken Miller. (The meatier manifestos of the American religious right are generally too stomache-churning to attempt.) But there is about as much agreement amongst atheists on political issues as there is among Christians. Atheists are found on the left and the right, and they generally do not base their political philosophy on Darwinism, Social or otherwise. \n \n It is actually pretty ironic to see far right apologists condemn evolution for being the source of excesses on the left and right! Apparently, Darwin was the devil incarnate, omnipotent in his ability to corrupt all human endeavor of every political persuasion. Scary, but totally devoid of logic. How can Darwin be responsible for Communist collectivism AND fascist Social Darwinism at the same time? Makes no sense, but then, not much from that corner does.\n \n It seems to me that the American religious right, deprived of the godless Commie devil by the economic and political collapse of the former Soviet Union, and the conversion of China to a form of state capitalism, have been casting around for something to get paranoid and sweaty about. So they invent an atheistic monolithic giant whom they can frighten their children (and not incidentally themselves) with. That, and/or gays. They need an enemy to be against.\n \n \nIt&#8217;s amazing to me that science can claim authority on human behavior.\n\n \n It is amazing to me that anyone can think such twaddle. It's true that scientists are researching human behaviour, and finding evolutionary explanations for some of it. But only an authoritarian mind would leap to the paranoid conclusion that this other monolithic myth, capital-S \"Science\" or scientism, is trying to control behaviour, or claim authority over it. \n \n Science, in fact, stands for the antithesis of authoritarianism, which is why the authoritarian mind, especially if it is a religious one, finds science so awkward to handle. Science thrives on skepticism, on challenges to authority. Almost every scientific advance has been built on the corpses of older and more established theories. Science is frequently revolutionary in nature (though of course that isn't its only characteristic), some revolutions being quiet and scarecely noticeable and some upsetting and almost violent. Current scientific orthodoxy regularly gets radically modified or overthrown, only to grow into an orthodoxy in its own right, till the next big idea comes along.\n \n The authoritarian mind instinctively revolts against revolutions. It abhors change. It is suspicious of novelty. It fears reform. It adheres rigidly to the status quo, and defers slavishly to whatever it has set up as an authority. In the case of Creationists, the authority they have set up is their interpretation of their bible. It is no wonder they are so resistant to the wonders revealed by science -- science does challenge their chosen authority, and challenges it very effectively.\n \n I have not yet read Stenger's book, as I am wary of claims that science can disprove something as evanescent and mythical as a deity. Science might as well try to disprove there's an invisible dragon in Carl Sagan's garage. But Stenger is surely right if he points out that science is incompatible with certain types of religious beliefs, such as those held in America by the right-wing fundamentalists. The book of Genesis cannot be held as literally true, yet compatible with scientific revelation.",

   "Yes - the &#8220;asking relatives&#8221; part would be very similar to the way scientists seek each others opinions today. Same applications of personal bias. \n\n You really do commit some grievous sins against analogy, you know. Even if scientists did do as you claim, it still wouldn't be equivalent to soliciting biased opinions from the descendants of those involved.\n \nAlso, if they missed something important that actually happened, it could cause them to veer down erroneous paths, and come to false conclusions. They could have taken note of how strong the Confederacy was at the beginning, while somehow missing the Unions strengths at the end - missing&#8230;.General Shermans march through Georgia, etc. \n\n You're proceeding from the assumption that scientists completely disregard all historical documents. They don't. They look for further evidence that could support or disprove the documented events. So the claim they would 'miss' something so prominently recorded has no teeth.\n \nWhatever. I do extend the Bible special treatment, I&#8217;ll admit that, but it&#8216;s no different than the way evolutionists extend special treatment to Darwinism. I know the claim is that if something better came along that Darwinism would be abandoned by science, but it&#8217;s not a believable claim in light of the fierce support of Darwinism. \n\n Except that many advances have been made since Darwin. The theory is far more sophisticated than he ever knew it to be. He was still right as far as his theories went, but he didn't see the whole picture - couldn't have done, given that genes were unknown in his day.\n \n It's good that we agree it is the bible, rather than documentary evidence in general, to which you attach special importance. That fact will come in handy later.\n \nIf only you would allow intelligent design to live that double life!\n\n But I do, and it does! I've said all along, I would never oppose the scientific investigation of ID. Nor would I try to prevent Dembski et al publishing their abysmal pop-science polemics. So to say I employ a double standard is clearly wrong. The point where my opinions of ID and evolution diverge is the science classroom, in which evolution has earned its place and ID thus far has not.\n \nStenger; &#8230;science shows that God does not exist.\n Rehm&#8230;..science cannot touch theology\n \n You&#8217;re saying that they&#8217;re both right? The word &#8220;science&#8221; is so vague that it can be applied either way depending on the situation, blended either way, switched back and fourth at will? Logic tells us that at least one of them is wrong!\n\n I don't recall ever saying they were both right. As I said, I haven't read Stenger's book and I'm not acquainted with his arguments. Perhaps he's perceived something I haven't and I will end up agreeing with him; perhaps not.\n \nYet if one person uses intelligent design to forward religion, then ALL of intelligent design is religious, and is thrown out of the scientific realm! \n\n ID is thrown out of the science classroom because it is, right now, ####. The fact it is being used to forward religion takes on special significance because it is ####. That's why so many religious teachers and scientists oppose it: it is harming the reputation of their religion.\n \nSome of intelligent design can be used to promote religion, but scientific searches for specified complexity and evidence of design are separate from it, in exactly the same way that Stenger and Rehm&#8217;s differences are separate. Yet ID is painted with only the religious brush, while science can&#8217;t be painted with the atheist brush. The double standard is crystal clear. If there&#8217;s no agreeing to disagree above, there&#8217;s no agreeing to disagree here, is there? \n\n Like I said, there's no double standard. Stenger and Dembski can both write their philosophical treatises, and can both pursue scientific careers. If ID was any use, its religious affiliations would be meaningless.\n \nIt sure does work both ways! I&#8217;ve lost count of all the anti-creation arguments presented here as the last nail in the coffin for creationists.\n\n And yet you remain unconvinced, yes? So my point is proved: whether something can change your mind or not is unrelated to whether or not it is logically correct. Good - so you won't be making any more claims that evolution is a weapon against religion just because some people try to swing it like one.\n \nLet me put it this way - Stenger was clearly implying that if Bush had a godless worldview, that he would have practiced better foreign policy.\n\n Based on the quote, he wasn't actually saying that either. After all, a godless Bush remains a thundering XXXXX, so it wouldn't be all plain sailing :)\n \n Seriously, though, I generally agree that is what Stenger was angling for. But let's track back. You said:\n \nI have a copy of Stenger's \"God Delusion\" book - in the final chapter he gets around to put downs of US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia, as well as president Bush. The innocence of the science of evolution can quickly get into one-sided politics, it seems.\n\n So I asked if evolution was used to criticise Bush. You said yes. Which is wrong, isn't it? Stenger made a straightforward criticism of religion's influence on politics.\n \nBut you give the standard Godless political opinions of U.S. involvement in Iraq, so it&#8217;s not a problem. :)\n\n If you think they're opinions, you need to do some reading around the subject.\n \n(Influence of theistic evolution) I&#8217;m not saying it makes it so, I&#8217;m saying it gives it political power. There is a difference. \n\n Or perhaps it just risks undermining the overweening political influence of your preferred version of Christianity?\n \n(You believe evolution and christianity are incompatible) It depends on the ever changing definition of evolution. If I say that common descent and Christianity are incompatible, most evolutionists will immediately shout that I think changes within kinds don&#8217;t happen, therefore all creationists are scientific illiterates just like me!\n\n I really don't know who you're talking to when you bang on about evolution changing definitions. I'm pretty sure it can't be me. You know perfectly well that evolution is both an umbrella term used by the layman, and has a specific biological meaning. If you're uncomfortable with that level of subtlety, why not stop complaining about it and start using more specific terms? I asked if you thought evolution and Christianity were incompatible. It wouldn't kill you to simply say \"Common descent is out, but allele frequency change is OK.\" You know, answer the question? :)\n \n \n(The killer dilemma)It looked like the author of your book was wracking their brain to try to find a scenario - no matter how unrealistic - to place a staunch public critic of modern lax morality and the 'culture of victimhood' in an uncomfortable position because of his traditional, conservative views of justice. \n\n Certainly the scenario threw matters into sharper relief than one would expect in everyday life, but I don't think there's anything unrealistic about having to co-exist with convicted criminals. I note you still picked the rehabilitated offender, even if you did concoct a self-serving excuse for it. One can only presume this 'third way' came about because you couldn't think of any way of justifying a decision to pick the 'hard time' door :)\n \n \nYour view (there is no god) and the theistic evolutionists view (god is weak and irrelevant) \n\n Just because you don't appreciate the elegance required for god to have used evolution to create humanity doesn't mean those who do think less of god for doing it.\n \nMaybe some psychiatrists would feel compassion for the car-murderers I described above, and seek to rehabilitate them with public money. I don&#8217;t agree. It&#8217;s just my opinion.\n\n I understand the sentiment. You just want to keep it simple: it was their choice, nobody else's, to do those terrible things, so let's just lock them up or stick a needle in them and make them go away. But you need to stop thinking that anyone who disagrees you on this is a bleeding-heart liberal. I would make every effort to rehabilitate those offenders, not out of compassion for them, but in order to learn. What contributed to them becoming such failed experiments in humanity? I don't want to absolve them of blame; I don't want to make them victims. I want to know why they were killers, so that maybe we can steer even a few other people away from that route in life. Even if external influences only put a few percentage points of slant on their decision to do as they did, isn't that valuable information if we can translate that into a few percentage points fewer offenders, and thus victims?\n \nThere are exceptions to every rule of course, some non-militant atheists have very conservative political views, but not many. There are several minor, and one or two major collectives for most atheists.\n\n If the Democratic party were dependent upon atheists for their vote, they would never poll higher than 20% :)\n \nThe Humanist Manifesto Do you have a basic disagreement with it? I do. \n\n That's a manifesto for religious humanism, not atheism. If you want to say that religious humanists have got it in for traditional religion, based on that manifesto I'd agree. But the fact remains that being an atheist does not entail joining a collective.\n \nThere are many - Origin of Species, Dawkins books, Stengers books, Harris books, Dennets books. A lot of variation, but they obviously don&#8217;t disagree with each other in basics. \n\n I really ought to have put /rhetorical around my words emoticon_rolleyes\n \n This is demonstrating my point exactly: because you've decided atheists are a collective, you've decided they must have a manifesto (so you picked one that suited your needs) and they must have a bible (so you picked some that suited your needs). And you won't be told otherwise :)\n \nThere&#8217;s no covering up going on! There&#8217;s little if any attempt made by websites like Talkorigins, NoanswersinGenesis, Panda&#8217;s thumb, American Atheists, many others, to distinguish themselves from each other.\n\n Perhaps it doesn't occur to them they might be confused for one another?\n \nThat makes them loyal to science and scientists! It leads to tyrants like Al Gore, and he wants a lot from me! He doesn&#8217;t like the fact that I use an internal combustion engine to make a living. \n\n I sympathise with the difficulties you must be facing, but I can't help but imagine the manufacturers of asbestos felt much the same way, once upon a time. Was getting rid of that all a bunch of earth-worship, too?\n \nI see less diversity in atheism than I do Christianity. Your not knowing about political views of atheists is simply the result of your not paying attention.\n\n Quite possibly. I find politics too depressing to take much of an interest, most of the time.\n \nI was thinking about Piltdown man. He got started in 1912 and didn&#8217;t get exposed as a fraud until 1953. That means a child born around 1900 learned about Piltdown man as a teenager, and, if he/she lived long enough, finally found out the truth after becoming a grandparent in most cases. If they died young, well it was the truth for them their whole lives. But many of us still kept hanging on to evolution, didn&#8217;t we?\n\n And the fraudulence of Piltdown Man impacts evolution... how, exactly?\n \n Does anyone still 'hang on' to the truth of Piltdown Man? No? Then your example has no relevance. It was debunked, and abandoned. Literal genesis has been debunked, yet its adherents remain obstinate. \n \nWe see a God that created, that loves, that likes beautiful things, etc. It was an inspiration to do the same, in whatever capacity we are able. \n\n Like I said, I'm not arguing about inspiration - even if I do think you have it backwards :)\n \nYou haven&#8217;t been exactly agreeing. You&#8217;ve been saying that inspiring (creationism) isn&#8217;t the same as enabling (evolution) I&#8217;m saying that inspiring vs enabling are too close to distinguish between, that they are equal in creation inspiration/ enabling vs evolutionary inspiration/ enabling. \n\n But creationism doesn't enable anything. It doesn't have to be right to accomplish what is has. It just needs to be believed. Aerodynamics keep planes in the air because they're correct, not because we think they're correct. Evolutionary principles produce better computer chips because they work, not because we think they work. When you can produce evidence of a product of creationism that requires creationism to be correct, you'll have shown equivalence.\n \nYes, and I credit creationism for inspiring one man and one woman to go to an extra effort in many cases to be loyal to each other for an entire lifetime, and I credit the teachings of Christ, as well as Proverbs, Song of Solomon, others, with providing guidelines on just how to do it, enabling so many to successfully do it. \n\n Great! So the marital guidence is sound (according to you anyway). Does Genesis have to be literally true for that advice to work?\n \nSo this thread starters attempt to elevate evolution above creationism by using commercial products alone pretty well failed for him, didn&#8217;t it? \n\n It's certainly not as clear-cut as it first appears, because as you and AA rightly pointed out, people do act upon their beliefs and accomplish things as a result. I still think it's not the same as devising a theory whose commercial utilility derives from its correctness, but then the OP wasn't that specific.\n \nA belief in the accomplishments of small, progressive change doesn&#8217;t have to be true in biology for it to enable the design of computer chips. \n\n Evolutionary principles of inheritable variation, competition and selection do have to work in order for it to be possible for us to evolve better computer chips. Just as E=MC2 ties matter and energy together, showing they are interchangeable, so Darwin's principles of evolution tie design and testing together to prove that they are interchangeable. \n \n \nWe don&#8217;t see dogs and cats and mice and rats and countless other animals picking out their mates at an early age and going to great pains to remain loyal to that mate for their whole lives.\n\n Well... yes we do, actually. Life-pairing does occur elsewhere in nature.\n \nWe wouldn&#8217;t see humans do it near as much without Genesis, the foundation for the entire Bible. The foundation - the ministry AnswersinGenesis has that name for that specific reason. That if a person has questions about most anything in Christianity, how we should live, why does any part of the Bible say what it says, why we are like we are, the answers to our questions are always in Genesis. \n\n All you keep saying (and linking to) is that if we disbelieve literal Genesis it's harder to take the rest of the bible seriously - which would be true no matter what Genesis contained. You're not meeting the challenge; you're not showing anything relevant specifically in genesis itself.\n \nWhen our discussion leads to new thoughts of the inspiration/enabling of commercial products in creation, my calling it out isn&#8216;t moving goalposts. \n\n Fair enough. It derailed the subtopic under discussion at little, that's all.\n \nIt&#8217;s amazing to me that science can claim authority on human behavior. \n\n That's a truly frightful strawman :) All I said was that science has confirmed that we really are different, that we really do need morals to be the creatures we are. And you're still not happy. \n \n(marriage) It&#8217;s an arrangement that works, it&#8217;s been proven, it has to be correct to have stood the test of time that it has. \n\n Monogamy? Sure. Does genesis have to be literally true for monogamy to be a good fit for the modern human psyche? No.\n \nI&#8217;m not applying my standards to it, I&#8217;m applying His as explained throughout the Bible. In the beginning, before the first man sinned, there was no pain, no &#8220;painful toil&#8221;, no &#8220;thorns and thistles&#8221;, and no death! You can&#8217;t have evolution without a lot of death.\n\n Well, if it's as explicit as you say, that bit must be wrong too; sorry :) There has been a lot of death; a hell of a lot. Far more than could ever occur in a global flood, however catastrophic. It's just one more fact we have to deal with.\n \n \n I'm going to propose we call an amicable halt at this point. I think it's clear we more or less agree upon the matter of the original topic, as it was phrased anyway. A stricter application of criteria, such as I imposed, yields a different result but I don't think I was justified in reading that into the OP.",

Maybe we could do another judged one. \n\n Sounds like fun :)\n \nYou have a nice holiday season. :)\n\n You too.\n \n \nSo, in conclusion, were there actually any comercial products (other than religious artifacts and books) that have a basis in creationism or even creation science? My reading is no. None whatsoever.\n\n It's really not that simple. If one stipulates that to qualify, a commercial product must depend for its success upon the correctness of the underlying theory, then no: creationism and creation science are barren ground. But it's perfectly possible for something to have commercial application without needing to work. Music, for instance, or Harry Potter.\n \n The point of this challenge was to highlight the difference between evolution and creationism in terms of productive science. And there is a vast difference in that respect, no question of it. But extending that argument to the commercial arena weakens it substantially, because people aren't obliged to spend money only on stuff that works. The commercial success of homeopathy is testament to that. Heck, the very foundation of commerce itself is a shared delusion: that a coin or a piece of paper or a few electrons whizzing through a computer is somehow 'worth' as much as food you can actually put in your mouth or a roof you can actually shelter under. So in respect of its purpose, I think this thread fails: it leaves science's comfort zone (stuff that has to actually work) and tries to tackle religion on its turf (stuff that just has to be appealing).",
