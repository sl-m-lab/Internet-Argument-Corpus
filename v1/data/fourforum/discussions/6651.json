As such, the scripture would change, even if the message delivered was identical, depending no when the scripture was written down.

It might not be right, but I think it's perfectly understandable and somewhat inevitable. Why should we take another generation's interpretation on something, when we can make our own? After all, the previous generation added their own interpretations anyway, just like the generation before them and so on.\n \n Secondly, scripture is often ambiguous. While you may not change the actual scripture, you can change the interpretation of it, to fit with the current ideologies of the time. You can claim this is wrong, but it's exactly what was done when it was originally written down.\n \n I'll clarify my thoughts in the morning as they're a bit haphazard at the moment.

   "The brain isn't the issue. The issue is, as you say, context. It's a question of \"what's done.\" We know, now, that rape is wrong, always. 2000 years ago, raping the women of your enemies was fine, it was practically part of a solider's pay. Trying to explain to a Roman soldier why rape was wrong wouldn't have worked. You would be going up against everything he had been taught, everything that he had absorbed from birth about how the world works. It's not that the Roman soldier thought rape was ok, Roman society thought it was ok. To be a Roman was to think that rape was ok sometimes. It would be like someone from the future trying to convince you that owning a dog was the same as slavery, and just as evil. You know that owning a dog isn't evil, you've know that all your life, and everyone around you knows it. It's part of our culture, it's part of who we are, and no amount of explanation would convince you otherwise. It would take generations of slow change before anyone could think that owning a dog was wrong. \n\n then the obvious solution is a new bible. i understand your reasoning, and it seems sound. its very clear that what society accepted as ok 2000 years ago is very different to what is accepted as ok today. and it varied among cultures as well. what seemed ok to the semitic culture 2000 years ago is very different from what is ok to the american/western culture today.\n \n the issue is that the semites of 2000 years ago wrote down their code of ok's and taboos. interestingly enough, in the very bible, those semites had written down an earlier code of ok's and taboos some 4000 years before that. the 2000 year ago culture realized that the 4000 year old code was obsolete to their time and culture, so they rewrote the code themselves. \n \n we are today trying to apply this code in our own culture in our modern time. in fact, it gets more confusing because we are trying to adhere to both the outdated (now 6000 year old) code, as well as the then updated 2000 year old code. we are expecting 2 conflicting, and both very ancient, moral codes to apply to our modern culture and time.\n \n and then in the future, when the culture undergoes more paradigm shifts, and increasingly faster rates, what then? should we then expect them to try to adhere to the same ancient semitic culture code of ok's and taboos? if the semites then could come up with their own moral code applicable to their cultur a the time, why is it we cannot now come up with our own?\n \nHe could, naturally, simply implant the truth in people's brains, but then free will goes out the window, right? Other than that, it doesn't matter how good the craftsman is if the materials are flawed. There is only so much people can change, only so fast that society can learn. If God wanted to change that, he'd have to change what it meant to be human. He seems not to have wanted to do that.\n\n having the truth does not hamper free will. in fact, the truth about the consequences of all options available is the only way to take full advantage of free will. if you dont know the truth about the consequence of an option, you either are believing a lie, drawing your own conclusion, or being totally ignorant as to what to expect. this is what causes us to regret decisions that resulted in unexpected negative results.\n \n if god implants the truth about right and wrong in everybody's mind, then more informed decisions can be made, but it does not take away free will.",

   "That is why I like the Jewish interpetation about A&E over the christain version. One of the interpretations is that god KNEW Adam and Eve would not resist, so he set them up. so they COULD learn to make choices between good and evil. If that was not done, man would have remained ignorant in the garden forever, and not be able to make good choices, so he can get closer to god.\n\n giving adam and eve free will resulted in more humans moving further away from god than moving closer to him. if god's intention was to draw men closer to him, then this seemed like a terrible strategy.",

And above all why choose to do so through the heterogeneous collected scriptures of an obscure tribe of nomadic herders?\n \n This is obviously a disingenuous question for me to ask, as I'm sure everyone here knows my atheistic views. The bible, as a prescription for human behaviour, is no more god-given than any other religion's scripture. In its christian version it even tacitly acknowledges that what was expedient to proscribe and prescribe 6000 years ago had changed by 2000 years ago.\n \n It is a little surprising that a Bronze Age tribe's rule-book can operate at all in a modern nation state. That it does so is helped by that fact that even those who live by the Old Testament have quietly glossed over the requirements for bullock burning and the stoning of disobedient children, and most of the rules that are left - don't kill, don't steal, be good to your parents - are pretty much those of all human societies anyway. The zealous hounding of gays by the Leviticus-minded remains a bone of contention, but will dwindle as the present generation of homophobes ages and fades away.\n \n In short, religious teachings - even those ostensibly based on infallible scripture - will continue to adapt to changing social circumstances.",
