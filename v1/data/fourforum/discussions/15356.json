   "Of course, no one here wants anyone to hate gays. Back to the topic ...\n The fact is, this kind of 'protest' rarely does any good. It's often ends up calling more attention to the act itself rather than what is being protested, and therefore tends to turn people off.\n \n One of the most famous examples of this sort of thing:\n \"The organization, or offshoots of it, have at times faced criticism for being too militant. Their disagreements with Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor on issues related to sex education in New York City Public Schools, as well as the Cardinal's public views on homosexuality, led to the first Stop the Church protest on December 10, 1989 at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York,[23] in which it's estimated 4500 ACT-UP and WHAM! members gathered outside St. Patrick's Cathedral to protest the Church's perceived homophobia, and their opposition to safe sex education and abortion. 111 activists were arrested.[24] Some activists entered the Cathedral, interrupted Mass, chanted slogans, or lay down in the aisles.[25] One protestor broke a communion wafer and threw it to the floor.[25] As a result of the St. Patrick's Cathedral action, ACT-UP was publicly condemned by Mayor Edward Koch and some media for what they viewed as militancy and disrespect. ACT-UP's account of the event notes that \"The news media choose to focus on, and distort, a single Catholic demonstrator's personal protest involving a communion wafer.\" However, the Cathedral protest was criticized as \"stupid and wrong-headed\" by others in the LGBT community, while one ACT-UP leader denounced the protest as an \"utter failure\" and a \"selfish, macho thing.\"[26]\"\n \n From Wikipedia\n Personally, I liked Gingrich's response after the coward dumped a load of glitter on he and his wife (after he had approached Gingrich under false pretenses, I might add): \"Nice to live in a free country.\" Then goes right on signing books.",
