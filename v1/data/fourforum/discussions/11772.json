I'm a leftist, but I can damn well see that there's hardly anything socialist in Bush actions, much less marxist.\n \n Everyone loved the bubble while it was pushing everything up, and the few who warned were ignored (see some of daewoo's debates here from a while ago), and now that it's starting to burst, it's obvious that something has to be done to soften the impact. Even if it means parachutes for the guilty. If we, or rather you, the US hegemony, don't do anything, the results will hurt even more.\n \n Me, I'd start by going through the troublesome enterprises and confiscating every manager's bonus for 10 years back...",
