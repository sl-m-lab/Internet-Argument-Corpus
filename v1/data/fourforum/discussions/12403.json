   "Modern Little Red Hen \n \n The Modern Little Red Hen\n \n \nOnce upon a time, there was a little red hen who scratched about the barnyard until she uncovered some grains of wheat. She called her neighbors and said, \"If we plant this wheat, we shall have bread to eat. Who will help me to plant it?\"\n \n \n \"Not I,\" said the cow.\n \"Not I,\" said the duck.\n \"Not I,\" said the pig.\n \"Not I,\" said the goose.\n \n \n \"Then I will,\" said the little red hen, and she did. The wheat grew tall and ripened into golden grain.\n \"Who will help me reap my wheat?\" asked the little red hen.\n \n \n \"Not I,\" said the Duck.\n \"Out of my classification,\" said the pig.\n \"I'd lose my seniority,\" said the cow.\n \"I'd lose my unemployment compensation,\" said the goose.\n \n \n \"Then I will,\" said the little red hen, and she did. \n At last it came time to bake the bread. \"Who will help me bake the bread?\" asked the little red hen.\n \n \n \"That would be overtime for me ,\" said the cow.\n \"I'd lose my welfare benefits,\" said the duck.\n \"I'm a dropout and never learned how,\" said the pig.\n \"If I'm to be the only helper, that's discrimination,\" said the goose. \n \n \n \"Then I will,\" said the little red hen. She baked five loaves and held them up for her neighbors to see. \n They all wanted some - in fact demanded a share. But the little red hen said, \"No, I can eat the five loaves myself.\"\n \n \n \"Excess profits!\" yelled the cow.\n \"Capitalist leech!\" cried the duck.\n \"I demand equal rights!\" shouted the Goose.\n \n \n The pig just grunted. Then they hurriedly painted \"unfair\" picket signs and marched around, shouting obscenities.\n \n \n The government agent came and said to the little red hen, \"You must not be greedy.\"\n \n \n \"But I earned the bread,\" said the little red hen.\n \n \n \"Exactly,\" said the agent. \"That is the wonderful free-enterprise system. Anyone in the barnyard can earn as much as he wants. But, under government regulations, the productive workers must divide their product with the idle.\"\n \n \n And they lived happily ever after. But the little red hen's neighbors wondered why she never again baked bread. \n",

   "[sarc] Socialism is only a means of being fair. [/sarc]\n \n I think it has been shown that socialism is fair only in that it disperses mediocrity and misery to all except those that work for the government. (They get perks.)\n \n Analogous to the hen deciding not to bake bread again is the decision of would-be investors to decline expansion when faced with the burden of supporting lazy, good-for-nothing welfare bums that expect to be provided all their means of survival in exchange for a vote for the socialist party.\n \n After socialism wins a sustained majority, the progression continues toward dictatorial communism where mediocrity and misery are more widespread yet still not visited upon those in control...the chosen few. There will always be government limousines to transport the fat cats to and from various functions all being arranged and paid for by the government, financed by the sale of goods and services manufactured in government owned businesses and confiscated natural resources of a miserable nation.",
