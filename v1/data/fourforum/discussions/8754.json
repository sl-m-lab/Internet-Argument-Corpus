I like to look at things from more then one perspective. At this time, I am not really interested in the legal or philosophical arguments. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n There are a couple of fairly well known moral arguments \"in favor\" of abortion ('in favor' is in quotes because the arguments are not necessarily that abortion is moral, but that it is not immoral).\n \n The Violinist Argument is one:\n \n I propose, then, that we grant that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception. How does the argument go from here? Something like this, I take it. Every person has a right to life. So the fetus has a right to life. No doubt the mother has a right to decide what shall happen in and to her body; everyone would grant that. But surely a person's right to life is stronger and more stringent than the mother's right to decide what happens in and to her body, and so outweighs it. So the fetus may not be killed; an abortion may not be performed. \n \n It sounds plausible. But now let me ask you to imagine this. You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, \"Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you-we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist now is plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you. \n \n Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation? No doubt it would be very nice of you if you did, a great kindness. But do you have to accede to it? What if it were not nine months, but nine years? Or longer still? What if the director of the hospital says, \"Tough luck, I agree, but you've now got to stay in bed, with the violinist plugged into you, for the rest of your life. Because remember this. All persons have a right to life, and violinists are persons. Granted you have a right to decide what happens in and to your body, but a person's right to life outweighs your right to decide what happens in and to your body. So you cannot ever be unplugged from him.\" I imagine you would regard this as outrageous,[2] which suggests that something really is wrong with that plausible-sounding argument I mentioned a moment ago.\n \n Another is a very long argument that takes a different approach to the moral question by examining our obligation to the fetus. I posted only a small section below:\n \n  Until the 20th week, the cut-off date for an actual \"abortion\" to occur, there is no complex cerebral cortex and no major central nervous activity. That is a condition universally regarded as a state of death in adults. An adult human being in such a state cannot really be \"killed,\" just unplugged. And such an act would not be disrespectful of their individual existence because that existence has already ceased, and only a body remains. Even if we were able to regenerate a brain-dead patient's cerebral cortex, using the genetic blueprint in her cells, we would still fail to resurrect her. We would instead merely create an identical twin inside a used body, with an infantile mind and no memories, no complex personality traits, and no intellectual skills. Although this fresh brain would be ready to learn and develop anew, it would be a different person. None of the unique features of the deceased would exist any more--the only mental features that would survive are the very same features that would be shared by any natural identical twins. \n \n The fetus before quickening is in the very same state as this hypothetical regenerated person. And the analogy of identical twins is a crucial one. Twins share the exact same blueprint for brain and body, and there is nothing \"individual\" about a blueprint that can be shared by more than one individual person--their individuality does not derive from their blueprint, but from their unique personal development, which begins almost certainly before birth, but without any doubt upon birth, when there can be no mistake that novel sensory data has begun transforming the brain and educating it in unique ways. None of this individualization can occur before the existence of a complex cortex that can be individualized (pre-fifth-month)--certainly none before there is a central nerve organ of any kind (pre-third-month). Therefore, an individual human (as opposed to a vacant body) cannot exist when a medically-defined abortion occurs. This entails that abortion cannot counter our shared value for individual human existence. \n \n In one argument, we have no moral obligation to the fetus because the morality does not apply when there is no unique human consciousness. In the other, even were we to have the same moral obligation to the fetus as we would to an adult, we would never have a moral obligation to allow anyone to live attached to us against our will.",

Abortion groups are funded in part yearly by govt. grants--yours and my tax dollars. Planned Parenthood alone took in $265 million in govt. grant money in 2004. That may not matter to you, but it does to me. Then there's the reality that killing hundreds of thousands of unborn fetuses every year robs the workforce considerably over time. It's been estimated that there has been around 40 million abortions performed since 1973. Considering that's well over 10% of the current U.S. population, I'd say the effects on workforce economy over time are pretty staggering. When you adjust for the fact that there would be 16 year period until those children would have been old enough to be employed, and that some of those children would grow up unemployed, it's still a huge amount lost from the workforce economy--and the age issue would cease to matter over time because eventually they all would have reached legal employment age.\n \n By the way, phrases you use like \"male dominance\" are very telling.

   "I don't understand why you are perceived to be pro-life. What is your reasoning for being \"open\" to abortions early in the pregnancy?\n\n \n Well, there's not a lot of difference, IMO, between a truly centrist pro-lifer and truly centrist pro-choicer. I think the difference ultimately comes down to which one ultimately should be valued the most. Since the choice of abortion terminates an entire lifetime from, the point of viability, I can't in good conscience value the life of the fetus less than the issues a woman faces in a typical pregnancy. But from a legal standpoint I believe abortion should be illegal after the 1st trimester. In that sense I guess I pro-life from a legal standpoint from the 2nd trimester on. The reason I can accept abortions early on is that the baby usually has viability outside the womb somewhere along the 2nd trimester give current technology.\n \n In some ways, I guess only opposing abortion from the 2nd trimester on is a glass half full/half empty issue in terms of whether that's pro-life or pro-choice.\n \n \nClearly you have some beef with the economics of abortion-it's a lucrative business - but then you have no problem bringing up what abortion has done to the detriment of our workforce and economy. *All that money we could've had if the wimmin had been forced to spawn!* This is one of the most ridiculous prolife arguments What's ethical now?\n\n \n That's why I prefaced it with \"ethical reasons aside\".

Are you prochoice or prolife?\n\n \n I think of myself as a moderate pro-lifer. Also, please undserstand that I don't LIKE the idea of abortion at ANY point in a pregnancy.

Maybe you should do the same count.\n \n Of course abortion impacts men, but don't even start on how it's some sort of unfair disservice to men. Women and children have been taking up the slack for lazy, mean, selfish, bastards - and getting the short end of the stick since the dawn of civilization.
