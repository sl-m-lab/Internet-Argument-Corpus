Most of these people are Muslim.\n \n Slavery still exists in the world because Islam refuses to repudiate it.\n\n \n Slavery still exists in this world because it is a cost effective way to manage a massive number of prisoners. I think that if you take a hard look, many of the slavery operations curently being operated in Africa were set up by none other than the CIA. \n \n For just a moment imagine that you are the president of a poor African country. You have just emerged sucessfully from a civil war. What do you do with the captured enemy fighters? If you simply execute them you incur the wrath of the international community. You cannot possible afford to keep them imprisoned, and if you release them, they pick up arms again and the civil war continues. So what do you do? You allow a back room slavery market to occur and you sell them off as slaves, essentially using your civilian population as your jailers and recouping part of the cost of the war.\n \n It is FAR, FAR from a perfect system, but it is the best most of these places can do.",

You had no control over it and different customs and moralities where in play.\n\n I'm not exactly too sure where the debate is intended to go. So I'll respond based upon what was mentioned...\n \n Paragraph 1: I did not see the rather absurd sight.\n \n Paragraph 2: That wasn't exactly a question but my response isn't meant to get technical. I think in recent history, the United States is the only country in the Western world (or most of it anyway) for one, the slaves got free approximately 145 years ago. (Eye blink for the world.) The second deal was that it was one of few times where the owners were a distinct race and the slaves were a distinct race. Before in other cultures, most of the slaves were more than one race. Slaves in ancient greece and in ancient Rome were of no particular race for example.\n \n Paragraph 3: I could not agree more. Who came up with the lame idea of paying for the sins of the father anyway?",

Why is there no outcry to end slavery in countries that still practice it today?\n\n \n I totally agree with you. But the other side can compare it to you benefiting from someone else's wrongdoing. If I rob a bank and then give you my money, should you have to give it back to the people who would have gotten it?\n \n But I still say all whites weren't slave owners and all blacks weren't slaves. Should we only make the people who are decended from slave owners pay? How do we prove that?\n \n Also, blacks fought so much for racial equality, and now they're (I'm using they very loosely here, only a few) demanding racial superiority through Affirmative Action and reparations.",
