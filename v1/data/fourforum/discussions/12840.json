   "I don't know why they call those groups 'Anonymous' when one of the first requirements is to identify yourself.\n \n But, oh well...\n \n \n Hi, I'm Zardoz and I'm an atheist.\n I get off on bashing religious nutters and enjoy watching bloodthirsty sectarian violence since I know all I have to do is sit back and watch the 'faithful' kill each other off in new and interesting ways.\n \n \n In this thread, ONLY atheists and agnostics are allowed.\n If a religious nutter shows up, we'll hurl abuse at them until they show their true colors or go away. \n \n Here, we'll discuss our afliction of intelligence and rational thought and seek better ways to over-come this blight...this curse...this dis-ease.\n We'll come up with new and interesting dissing techniques to use against the believers. We'll discuss how we can be moral and ethical without an archaic religious text to 'guide us'. We'll also discuss the benefits to breaking sacred traditions and laws.\n And, along the way, I'm sure we'll also find something else to discuss.\n \n And as rewards for innovative ways in doing all these things, we'll award each other with milk and cookies or a nice slice of pie. emoticon_xhoho\n \n So, if you ever find yourself in one of those :xbanghead arguments with a tru(tm) believah on this forum, you can come here and mock them comfortable in the knowledge that that's all we exist to do...being a 'thorn in the side' as you will.\n \n I'd just like to thank gawd who created us with this explicit reason for existing.\n And let us remember the Surreality prayer; \"We change the things we don't like, accept the things we do like and mock all the rest.\"",
