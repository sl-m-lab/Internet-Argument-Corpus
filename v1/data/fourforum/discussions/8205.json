Mar 3, 2006 (AP)- A small-town police chief was accused in a federal lawsuit Thursday of stopping a would-be rescuer from performing CPR on a gay heart attack victim because he assumed the ailing man had HIV and posed a health risk. \n \n Claude Green, 43, died June 21 after being stricken yards from City Hall in Welch, a community of about 2,400. \n \n The American Civil Liberties Union sued on behalf of his mother. \n \n Police Chief Bobby Bowman called the allegations \"a boldface lie.\" He said that he called an ambulance and that Green was taken to the hospital in \"no more than nine minutes.\" \n \n \"No one refused him CPR as his sister and mom are saying. They can do what they want, but if they're saying I refused him CPR, that is no way true,\" Bowman said. \n \n The lawsuit accuses Bowman of pulling off Green's friend Billy Snead as Snead was performing chest compressions on the man. Snead was a passenger in Green's pickup truck when Green collapsed; Snead had managed to pull over the vehicle. \n \n Snead said in an interview that he didn't realize at first it was Bowman giving the order and continued working on his friend. Bowman repeated his command to get away, saying that Green was HIV positive, then grabbed Snead by the shoulders and told him to sit on the curb, Snead said. \n \n \"He was a police officer so I got out the way. I assumed he would help. I didn't want to be a hindrance,\" Snead said. \"He also told the ambulance drivers that he was HIV positive and to be careful.\" \n \n Green was pronounced dead at the hospital after about 30 minutes of attempts to revive him. \n http://abcnews.go.com/US/LegalCenter/wireStory?id=1682606\n\n As much as we would both like to think that such concerns aren't real, they are VERY real.\n \n It is very possible, and in fact I believe probable, that Skip isn't the type of person to perform the job differently for gays and straights.\n But to pretend that the question has no validity is just plain not acknowledging the reality that we live in...\n \n \n \nI ask that you think of it this way, with a different issue . . . if a person was anti-religious and happened to have the view that religious people shouldn't get to speak out in public, would you be opposed to someone like that being a fireman?\n\n Jyoshu.

I just don't see the real value of these sort of questions.\n\n It's possible they could lie.\n But they could also tell the truth.\n \n And quite frankly, I would rather ask the question to weed out those who would tell the truth...\n ... and for those who lied, use that lie against them if the prejudice interferes with their job in the future.\n \n \n \nI don't discount that it happens, and do acknowledge that there are people out there that do that sort of thing. But I really do believe that it's the definite exception rather than the rule, and personal ideology shouldn't be made part of something like a job interview.\n\n I think it would be an exception as well.\n But if you see an indicator that might point to an \"exception\", I think the question should be asked.\n \n Consider the flip side of things. The question doesn't get asked.\n If Skip had been the type of man to let a gay couple's house burn to spite gays, don't you think that the gay couple would have had grounds to sue the city in such a situation?\n \n Part of this is just the city covering its own XXX. If they ask the question, and the guy lies, they have helped to cover their own XXX by asking the question.",

   "Your response baffles me. Sometimes, I can at least empathize and understand your view, even if I don't support it. Here, I can't comprehend it at all. We agree the question's answer is up for grabs. That we can't just assume the answer to the question. But then you claim the not knowing of the answer to the question is the reason he \"shouldn't have been asked in the first place\"??? Maybe it's a loss of context, but that is how I'm seeing your response, and it makes no sense to me. It's the fact that we DO NOT know that leads us to such an important question.\n\n \n I interpreted your response of \"there's no pat definite answer\" as an understanding on your part that questions like these don't always have specific answers. They are complicated issues of personal ideology. Perhaps that's not what you really meant. I would think that a job interview should limit it's questions to things that for which there can be definitive answers rather than something vague. And again, I would think the best thing to do is to hire people based on their past qualifications, meaning that if there is something on their record to indicate they would be a poor fireman (by not giving equal service to gay people) then they shouldn't be hired. Again, I see no difference in this situation and a situation where person applying to be a fireman or policeman were asked if he was an athiest out of fear he might not treat religious people fairly. Now if there is something in the person's record that indicates he might not, that's different. Again, let the record speak.\n \n \nAnd quite frankly, whether or not this man has prejudices which would prevent him from doing his job IS a qualification for this job.\n If you disagree, you'll have to explain why...\n\n \n I don't disagree, but that could be covered under a question like \"do you have any feelings or prejudices against any group or individuals that would prevent you from helping them\" or \"will you serve all people equally?\" They don't have to get into a person's individual ideological beliefs. \n \n I know quite a few volunteer firefighters, and I can tell you that they all do it because they enjoy it. They like to put out fires. I've seriously considered it myself. And they aren't going to put everyone through a litmus test about being gay before they carry them out of a building. Something like that would be so rare that it's downright unnecessary to bring it up, IMO. Do you not realize that there are many, many people out there already as firefighters, police, and EMS that have the moral view that gay marriage is wrong? It's a very common view. People usually understand that helping people in their public service role and having that ideology are two different things. One has no bearing on the other any more than, say, if they had the view that Democrats are better for the country than Republicans, or vice versa. \n \n \nTell me. Which is better.\n \n 1) Finding out a police officer has prejudices against gays which could get a gay man killed BEFORE he gets a gay man killed?\n \n 2) or Finding out a police officer has prejudices against gays which DID get a gay man killed BECAUSE his prejudices got in the way of saving a gay man's life?\n\n \n And that's why we have public records. We trust people that if they're going to take an oath of public service (as police and firefighters do) that they will keep that oath and honor it. Asking personal questions about every specific ideological hangup a person could have is not only begs the question, it probably takes time away from questions that really are important. Frankly I'd much rather the focus be on whether or not a person knows or is capable of knowing the precedures, tactics, and limits of their public service role than getting into personal ideology and beliefs. We tend to assume a person is going to conduct themselves professionally and properly REGARDLESS of their religious and/or moral ideleological beliefs when they are hired--I don't see why this issue should be any different. We tend to assume they are going to act professionally and impartially if they are religious, or if they happen to be pro-life, or if they happen to be Republican/democrat, etc. In fact, those questions aren't asked unless theres a REASON from the record. I don't see why this should be any different.\n \n \nAnd quite frankly, I would rather ask the question to weed out those who would tell the truth...\n\n \n So just how many ideological issues are you for going into? Religious affiliation? After all, they may not give equal service to people of other religions or athiests. Political party? After all, can we trust them to give equal protection to a Republican if they're a Democrat? How about the abortion issue? By golly, what if it's an abortion clinic that's on fire? Or a church that protests abortions (and the fireman is pro-choice)? This could go on . . . I think the assumption that a firefighter or policeperson means it when they take their oath should be sufficient UNLESS there is something in their prior service record that indicates differently. Otherwise, it gets absurd going into all the possible idelogical hangups that could be a problem.",

   "I suspect that there's more going on here than is reported in the three articles (there's certainly more going on than Ms. Gallagher would indicate -- her bias is blatent). \n \n This is small town America, where interpersonal issues often crop up in all sorts of ways.

The fireman doesn't just \"have a position on gay marriage\". He signed a petition to void the marriages that have taken place in Massachusetts, including that of the Selectman who asked the question. To expect one's neighbors to ignore something like that is naive.\n \n \nI find it pretty insulting that someone would even think that a position on the issue of gay marriage would even have anything to DO with whether or not someone would give equal protection as a fireman. \n\n \n I would find it pretty insulting that someone would sign a petition to dissolve my marriage. \n \n As others here have pointed out, gay people have every reason to wonder about the commitment to equal protection of those who serve the public. Maybe you've never encountered blatent, personal hostility from a government authority and have never had a police officer call you a XXXXXX and spit in your direction while doing so. I have. Yet I still appreciate the job cops and others do, because most of them aren't like that... anymore.

The man puts out fires and rescues people. Do you really think he's going to stop and ask people before he carries them out of a burning building \"wait . . . are you gay? Because if you are I'm sorry someone else will have to do this.\" This idea that someone's political and/or ideological view on a public referendum issue should have any bearing on whether he should be allowed to do other things is scary, if you ask me. It's stepping into the realm of thought-police fascism.\n\n \n I agree with you... it IS scary. Having to wonder what reaction you're going to get when you ask for help is that last thing you should have to worry about in an emergency. And talk about fascism! Having the state dissolve someone's marriage!\n \n \nAt least, we shouldn't assume that it would.\n\n \n No one assumed anything. He was asked a question.

That's all the time it takes.\n At best, all you're doing is nitpicking, based solely on your opinion that the question shouldn't have been asked. You're nitpicking over 30 seconds.\n \n People's personal prejudices aren't part of \"public record\" until SOME ACTUAL ACTION has been taken to demonstrate those prejudices. Sometimes that action is benign. Sometimes it's much more serious.\n \n I see no reason to not just ask the question.

There are a variety of law-suits demonstrating how religious, pro-life organizations have acted NOT in accordance with their profession, but RATHER in accordance with their personal beliefs in cases where their \"pro-life\" beliefs became relevant.\n I thought you and I had even discussed one of those cases, did we not?\n \n So, no.

You act as though that's somehow a dangerous or far worse view than it is--as if they're KKK members or something and that it's going to cause violent behavior. They simply see marriage differently than you. This firefighter had the view that most people have. People sign petitions all the time for various issues--doesn't mean they hate people.

A committee of his fellow townspeople, all volunteers themselves, some of them probably friends of his, chose not to elect him to a position of leadership in the firefighting group. That means that the people there unanimously found some reason to pass over his name.

It is any opinion. So if you hate the child shooter and wish harm upon him than that would make you a bigot I suppose...who is to say that is so bad in this case?\n \n\n That's interesting. You may be the only person out there who would call being opposed to child shooting a case of bigotry. That's just, very special.\n \n \n\n Proof and evidence are used interchangable in my sentence. \n\n And there's the problem. \"Proof\" and \"evidence\" are different words with different meanings, and if you use them interchangably than no one will be able to understand whatever it is you're trying to say. You see the problem? This would probably explain your apparantly bizarre stance on bigotry as well. You've probably decided that bigotry and, I don't know, opinionated are interchangable.
