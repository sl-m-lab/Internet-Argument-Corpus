   "I saw these points on this website: \n http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=767&issue_id=100\n \n Can an admendment to the US Constitution be declared unconstitutional? \n Here are some points made from this website. \n If the admendment passes (which I seriously doubt) and it conflicts with other parts of the constitution, how does that get resolved? \n \n \n The proposed amendment would violate the constitutional equal protection guarantee. Marriage brings legal benefits, such as property and inheritance rights, rights to hospital visitation, tax and insurance benefits, to name just a few. Under the proposed amendment, adults who remain or become unmarried or who are part of committed same-sex relationships may be denied these benefits. This unequal legal treatment of otherwise equal people is an unconstitutional side effect of the proposal.\n \n The proposed amendment would violate the non-establishment and free exercise of religion clauses of the First Amendment. Many recognized religious groups solemnize marriage vows between two men and between two women. The proposed amendment would deny the free exercise of religion to those who practice religions that recognize gay and lesbian marriages. And, it would confer federal constitutional endorsement on those religions that recognize only heterosexual marriage.\n \n The proposed amendment would restrict the civil rights of a particular group and would permanently legalize discrimination against that group by means of the Constitution. The proposed amendment would rescind state authority to establish civil rights and civil liberties in family law more expansive than the federal minimum. State laws such as domestic partnership laws; adoption, foster care, and kinship care laws; inheritance laws; and legal protections for unmarried persons, including elderly single persons, widows, and widowers, would be impacted.\n \n The proposed amendment identifies a group for discrimination. The cost to society, if the proposed amendment were to succeed, would be heavy indeed. Discrimination is hurtful and divisive. Discrimination denies individuals the human dignity of being able to determine their own life's course. And, it drives painful wedges through our communities and families.",

   "I saw these points on this website: \n http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=767&issue_id=100\n \n Can an admendment to the US Constitution be declared unconstitutional? \n\n \n Certainly--the 18th amendment is one such example and was reversed with the 21st amendment. \n \n \nHere are some points made from this website. \n If the admendment passes (which I seriously doubt) and it conflicts with other parts of the constitution, how does that get resolved? \n\n \n That FMA is a bad idea I agree with you; not for the reasons you put forth, but simply because it's really not necessary. Most of the points from the article are simply part of the ongoing debate on the issue of gay marriage and reflect the typical arguments made.\n \n But a couple of things are glaringly odd:\n Under the proposed amendment, adults who remain or become unmarried may be denied these benefits. \n\n Why would you want single people to receive marriage benefits?\n The proposed amendment would violate the non-establishment and free exercise of religion clauses of the First Amendment. Many recognized religious groups solemnize marriage vows between two men and between two women. The proposed amendment would deny the free exercise of religion to those who practice religions that recognize gay and lesbian marriages.\n\n This is a VERY weak argument. Solemnizing a marriage is not a religious act; that's why a justice of the peace can do it as well. The wedding ceremony may be an act of religion (not the same as solemnization), but they do that now without gay marriage being recognized. Under the amendment they would STILL do gay weddings, without it being recognized. The only way they could claim that this would be an example of violation of the free exercise of religion would be if laws were put in place preventing churches from conducting gay weddings. That's not what the FMA seeks to do at all.",

If churches are still going to perform samesex marriages regardless of what the law says then what is the point of banning civil marriage? Unless it goes to my point that anti gay christians want to control the lives af gay people and this is a convientinet way of doing it. Since they are powerless to stop some denominations from perfoming the gay weddings.\n \n I agree with former senator Danforth http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/04/043006danforth.htm",
