Maybe not.\n\n \n I not only have a reasonable answer DrD, I have THE answer. But the atheists and unbelievers in anything spiritual will reject it as they refuse to admit to or recognize that there is a complete spiritual side to humanity that they are blind to.\n John 4:22 You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.\n \n Jhn 8:12 Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, \"I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.\"\n You see, Jesus was a Jew, and the light of the World. Also, ever since Abraham, God has adopted the Jews as His chosen people. It was through the Jew that salvation came into the World. So since the World is a place of Spiritual darkness, and the darkness hates the light, and the Jew was the vehicle through which God delivered the Spiritual light to the World, this causes the World at large to hate the Jew. It is totally a spiritual hatred that the forces of darkness have for Gods gift of salvation that brings the wrath of an unsaved World down on the Jewish people. And here is a supporting verse to that effect.\n Eph 6:12 For we are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood, but against the evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against those mighty powers of darkness who rule this world, and against wicked spirits in the heavenly realms.",

Make vague threats of eternal suffering upon the deaths of those who disagree with you\n \n Then step 6.\n \n See, Archie remembered the steps!\n\n \n Your assertion that I have threatened anyone of anything is false TQ. It is impossible for me to threaten any type of eternal suffering as I have no power at all to condemn anyone. What I will do is promise you that what the verses I posted say is true. That is not a threat but a promise. there is a huge difference which I expect you to be able to comprehend. \n \n Now let's just test this to see if you understand the difference between one who has no power to condemn, warning you of a coming judgment, and the source of the judgment itself. Is this passage me condemning anyone, or is it God warning of a coming judgment? And please note the bolded as it is good advice that many will condemn themselves because of their own evil actions. \n \n Jud 1:5 I must remind you-and you know it well-that even though the Lord[fn2] rescued the whole nation of Israel from Egypt, he later destroyed every one of those who did not remain faithful.\n Jud 1:6 And I remind you of the angels who did not stay within the limits of authority God gave them but left the place where they belonged. God has kept them chained in prisons of darkness, waiting for the day of judgment.\n Jud 1:7 And don't forget the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns, which were filled with sexual immorality and every kind of sexual perversion. Those cities were destroyed by fire and are a warning of the eternal fire that will punish all who are evil.\n Jud 1:8 Yet these false teachers, who claim authority from their dreams, live immoral lives, defy authority, and scoff at the power of the glorious ones.[fn3]\n Jud 1:9 But even Michael, one of the mightiest of the angels, did not dare accuse Satan of blasphemy, but simply said, \"The Lord rebuke you.\" (This took place when Michael was arguing with Satan about Moses' body.)\n Jud 1:10 But these people mock and curse the things they do not understand. Like animals, they do whatever their instincts tell them, and they bring about their own destruction.\n Jud 1:11 How terrible it will be for them! For they follow the evil example of Cain, who killed his brother. Like Balaam, they will do anything for money. And like Korah, they will perish because of their rebellion.\n Jud 1:12 When these people join you in fellowship meals celebrating the love of the Lord, they are like dangerous reefs that can shipwreck you.[fn4] They are shameless in the way they care only about themselves. They are like clouds blowing over dry land without giving rain, promising much but producing nothing. They are like trees without fruit at harvesttime. They are not only dead but doubly dead, for they have been pulled out by the roots.\n Jud 1:13 They are like wild waves of the sea, churning up the dirty foam of their shameful deeds. They are wandering stars, heading for everlasting gloom and darkness.\n Jud 1:14 Now Enoch, who lived seven generations after Adam, prophesied about these people. He said, \"Look, the Lord is coming with thousands of his holy ones.\n Jud 1:15 He will bring the people of the world to judgment. He will convict the ungodly of all the evil things they have done in rebellion and of all the insults that godless sinners have spoken against him.\"[fn5]\n Jud 1:16 These people are grumblers and complainers, doing whatever evil they feel like. They are loudmouthed braggarts, and they flatter others to get favors in return.\n Jud 1:17 But you, my dear friends, must remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ told you,\n Jud 1:18 that in the last times there would be scoffers whose purpose in life is to enjoy themselves in every evil way imaginable.\n Jud 1:19 Now they are here, and they are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They live by natural instinct because they do not have God's Spirit living in them.\n Jud 1:20 But you, dear friends, must continue to build your lives on the foundation of your holy faith. And continue to pray as you are directed by the Holy Spirit.[fn6]",

They should be shown no mercy or kindness,[4] afforded no legal protection,[5] and these \"poisonous envenomed worms\" should be drafted into forced labor or expelled for all time.[6] He also seems to advocate their murder, writing \"[w]e are at fault in not slaying them.\"[7]\n\n He didn't seem to discourage it.",

That's where the confusion arose.\n \n Doesn't change the fact that it still makes your original assertion wrong however.\n\n \n Uh, no I'm not TQ. I'm talking about people who were, and are both Jewish and faithful to the religion. My best friend is a born again Jew and He refers to himself as a COMPLETED JEW. Where as Gentiles are converted to Christianity when they become Born Again, to a Jew it is simply embracing what God originally intended for them as Gods Chosen People. Salvation came to the Jew first, and then the gentile.\n Rom 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.\n And here is the crux of what it meant for the Jew to reject Messiah which was foreseen and prophesied in both Psalms and Isaiah, before Jesus Himself reminded the people of the Old Testament Prophecy that He would fulfill Himself.\n Psa 118:22 The stone [which] the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone.\n \n Isa 28:16 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: \"Behold, I lay in Zion a stone for a foundation, A tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; Whoever believes will not act hastily.\n Mat 21:42 \n Jesus said to them, \"Have you never read in the Scriptures:\n \n 'The stone which the builders rejected\n Has become the chief cornerstone.\n This was the LORD's doing,\n And it is marvelous in our eyes'?[fn10]\n \n Mat 21:43 \n \"Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it.\n Mat 21:44 \n \"And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.\"\n As it is written, Jesus the Christ is the Cornerstone of humanities Salvation; the Jews are the builders of the relationship upon which He built that Salvation. But because the Jew rejected that free gift, Jesus became the cornerstone of the Gentiles, faith.\n \n Here is the promise that God made to Abraham...\n Gen 12:1 \n NOW the LORD had said to Abram:\n \n \"Get out of your country,\n From your family\n And from your father's house,\n To a land that I will show you.\n Gen 12:2 \n I will make you a great nation;\n I will bless you\n And make your name great;\n And you shall be a blessing.\n Gen 12:3 \n I will bless those who bless you,\n And I will curse him who curses you;\n And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.\"\n And here is the COVENANT God made with Abraham and his descendants.\n Gen 15:18 On the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: \"To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates--\n \n Gen 17:2 And I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.\"\n Yet, even though the Jews rejected the promised Messiah when He came, God has not forgotten His covenant with them. \n Hbr 8:1 \n NOW this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,\n Hbr 8:2 \n a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man.\n Hbr 8:3 \n For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer.\n Hbr 8:4 \n For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;\n Hbr 8:5 \n who serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, \"See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.\"[fn1]\n Hbr 8:6 \n But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.\n Hbr 8:7 \n For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.\n Hbr 8:8 \n Because finding fault with them, He says: \"Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah--\n Hbr 8:9 \n \"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the LORD.\n Hbr 8:10 \n \"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.\n Hbr 8:11 \n \"None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.\n Hbr 8:12 \n \"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds[fn2] I will remember no more.\"[fn3]\n Hbr 8:13 \n In that He says, \"A new covenant,\" He has made the first obsolete.

   "Why does the world, for the most part, dislike or hate the Jews? Why does this attitide continue through the centuries without resolve?\n \n Ex.: We hated Germany while Hitler was in charge however we do not carry that hatred today. Likewise with the Japanese, Italy, Russia.\n \n I certainly hope it doesn't go back to their religious beliefs. This would be rather self-defeating and has outlived any possible validity in the past. \n \n It appears to me that if a large part of the world's population is on the same page with this disgruntled belief, there has to be something of which I am unaware. On the other hand, are the Jews such agitators that no one can live with them?\n \n Maybe someone here has a reasonable answer. Maybe not.\n\n We did not hate Germany, We hated Hitler. Following that war, and probably mostly because of the devastation to the Jewish people perpetrated then, we (the UN) stole land from people who had lived there for centuries, and gave it to the Jews. This is not an act of hatred. If they're public image is poor now, it's because of he way they've conducted themselves toward the native population since 1948, ignoring EVERY YEAR, U N proposition 194, which has been adopted EVERY YEAR, outlining the palestinian's right to return to their lands.\n Other than the Israeli controversy, I'm unaware of any mass anti-semitism. Perhaps you could make yourself more clear. The Jewish diaspora seems well integrated into all of their various countries of residence.",

Perhaps it is both but there must be some \"logical\" reason for the wide-spread feeling. On the other hand, maybe not.",

   "Archie, you're original assertion is posted below:\n \n \n...since the World is a place of Spiritual darkness, and the darkness hates the light, and the Jew was the vehicle through which God delivered the Spiritual light to the World, this causes the World at large to hate the Jew. It is totally a spiritual hatred that the forces of darkness have for Gods gift of salvation that brings the wrath of an unsaved World down on the Jewish people. And here is a supporting verse to that effect.\n\n \n So, since the majority of anti-semitism over the centuries has been church inspired, explain to me how it's us evil, spiritually dead, haters (ie-not Archies) who are the ones carrying out all this hatred of the Jews. After all, the spiritually enlightened christians should have been protecting the Jews, not condoning or inciting the anti-semitism according to you.
