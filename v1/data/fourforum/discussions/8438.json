No one on the gay side is attacking anyone's family. However, the anti-gay side are attacking families by giving some families inferior status, because those families have gays.

Gays want to contribute positively to the esteemed social institutions such as family and marriage, just like everyone else. Gays want to be a part of everything in the society in which they live, and not kept out because they are gay. The motivation is not a malevolent one towards society or its institutions.
