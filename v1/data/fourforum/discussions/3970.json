   "Jesus said that the (books of the) law and the prophets spoke about him. The New Testament provides numerous fulfillments of Old Testament prophecies about a coming Messiah / God / Savior. And, until many centuries after Christ (about 900 - 1,000 A.D.), quite a few distinquished Jewish rabbis believed many Messianic passages, such as Isaiah 53 (\"And the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all\") spoke about the coming Messiah. If Jesus is God then he's the same one who gave Moses the Ten Commandments (note \"THE  Angel of the Lord\" in the Burning Bush passage - where angel in Hebrew can mean \"messenger\") on Mount Sinai, and clarified the law in the Sermon on the Mount. If Jesus is the Jewish Messiah as is claimed, then OT Judaism (in God's eyes) is a dead religion apart from Christ. This Thread is for a discussion on the issues involved.",

   "Isaiah 53 - A Messianic Prophecy \n \n 3 He was despised and rejected by men, \n \n a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. \n \n Like one from whom men hide their faces \n \n he was despised, and we esteemed him not. \n \n 4 Surely he took up our infirmities \n \n and carried our sorrows, \n \n yet we considered him stricken by God, \n \n smitten by him, and afflicted. \n \n 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, \n \n he was crushed for our iniquities; \n \n the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, \n \n and by his wounds we are healed. \n \n 6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray, \n \n each of us has turned to his own way; \n \n and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.\n \n \"Our Rabbis with one voice accept and affirm the opinion that the prophet (Isaiah) is speaking of the Messiah, and we shall ourselves also adhere to the same view.\" - Jewish Rabbi Moses Alschech (1508-1600)\n \n New Testament fulfillment: Acts 8:27-35",

   "The Son of David\n \n THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES\n \n \"Behold, the days are coming,\" says the LORD, \"That I will raise up to (King) David a Branch of righteousness; a King shall reign and prosper, and execute judgement and righteousness in the earth. In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell safely; now this is His name by which He will be called: THE LORD (Jehovah) OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.\" (Jeremiah 23:5-6 )\n \n THE RABBINIC WRITINGS\n \n Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise up to David the MESSIAH, who is righteous, and he will reign a King, and shall prosper, and execute the judgement of truth and justice in the earth. (Targum Jonathan)\n \n (messiahpages)\n \n In addition to Isaiah 9:6-7, this is another prophecy which proclaims that God will incarnate as a mortal, which Christ did. Modern Judaism teaches that there is one God, but not a Trinity. They do not base this on their own Scriptures (which they should give more credence to) but on Rabbinic Commentary. It should also be obvious that, according to the Rabbinic quote from the Targum Jonathan above, this scripture speaks of the coming Messiah. Put two and two together and you have a coming Messiah, born of the line of King David, who will be Jehovah God (incarnate). Only Christ fits this bill.",
