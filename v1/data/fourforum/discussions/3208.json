   "Look out for those PNAC/AEI neo-con guys.\n \n http://www.williambowles.info/ini/ini-040.html\n \nBreakfast in Baghdad - lunch in Tehran and dinner in Pyongyang?\n In late March 2003, the leading ideologues of the 'New American Century', Richard Perle, William Kristol and Michael Ledeen, author of the \"Terror Masters\" and all 'fellows' of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) met over breakfast to crow over Bush Junior's invasion of Iraq but,\n \n \"Kristol bewailed the failure of Bush's father to take Baghdad. This resulted in a regrettable \"lack of awe\" among Arabs, said he. Perle joked that there were more anti-war demonstrators in San Francisco than Iraqis willing to fight for their country. Ledeen said France and Germany had reached \"new lows of disgustingness\" by \"shoring up tyrannical regimes.\" Then he went into his mantra about the need for \"a longer war.\"\n \n \"Kristol urged that we split Germany off from France but noted that such \"intelligent diplomacy may be too much to hope for from the State Department.\" When Perle declared that \"Americans are not vindictive,\" Ledeen interrupted to say that, in the case of France, he certainly hoped we would be.\"\n \n Where do we go after Iraq? The logic of the Bush Doctrine - \"We will not permit the world's worst dictators to threaten us with the world's most dangerous weapons\" - points to a clash with Iran. Iran is also the preferred target of Ariel Sharon, who seems frustrated he has not been invited to do target acquisition for the U.S. Air Force.\"\n Source: http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=31725\n\n \n\n Ledeen and co, live in hope but lacking any kind of rationale for an outright invasion, it's all they can hope for, right now. We can be sure however, that the CIA as well as elements of the Israeli intelligence are operating inside Iran.\n \n \"But the intensity and frequency of the campaign against Tehran picked up dramatically earlier this month. On May 5, Standard Editor William Kristol, whose office is six floors below the AEI, wrote that the United States was \"already in a death struggle with Iran over the future of Iraq\" and that \"the next great battle - not, we hope, a military battle - will be for Iran\".\n \n The very next day, the AEI hosted an all-day conference entitled \"The Future of Iran: Mullahcracy, Democracy and the War on Terror\", whose speakers included Ledeen, Sobhani, Gerecht, Morris Amitay of the neo-conservative Jewish Institute for National Security Studies and Uri Lubrani from the Israeli Defense Ministry.\n\n \n This is interesting:\n \n\"[T]here is one problem,' says Akins. 'Whatever makes them think free elections in Syria or Saudi Arabia will produce pro-Western governments wanting peace with Israel? They would produce anti-Western governments committed to the destruction of Israel.\"\n \n \"\"Fareed Zakaria, former editor of Foreign Affairs, believes the administration is 'wrong, if it believes a successful war will make the world snap out of a deep and widening distrust and resentment of American policy. What worries people around the world above all else is a world shaped and dominated by one country - the United States.\"\"\n Source: http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4647248,00.html\n\n \n This also reminds us that Colin Powell called these guys the \"****ing Crazies.\"\n \n Gotta love Pat Buchanan ;)\n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=31725\n \nWhat President Bush is faced with is one of those computer chess games, where defeating it in stage one and two is easy, but stages three, four and five become progressively more difficult. He took down the Taliban regime with almost no casualties. Taking down Saddam required a quarter of a million men. What will it take to take down Iran or North Korea, or both? Can Americans be persuaded that these regimes had something to do with 9-11 and must be smashed, else we are not safe?\n\n \n\n What do we do if the Turks decide their vital interest in not having an independent Kurdistan requires a permanent Turkish army presence in northern Iraq?\n\n \n And the Kurds should get their own state. It's the least we could do since we sold Saddam the weapons to kill them AND they are the ones who actually captured Saddam Hussein, then gave him to us.\n http://www.oldamericancentury.org/saddam_capture.htm\n \n Well, are we on the road to world domination yet?",

Iran with a nuclear weapon would really concern me...\n\n \n That reactor had already been inspected by the IAEA and certified as \"not suitable for weapons use\" \n \n Why was it a good thing that Israel took it out? \n \n That is like when they took out the reactor being built in Syria, which had also been certified as a non weapon reactor, and was in fact ebing built as part of a trade agreement with the EU (part of an infrastructure improvement program).\n \n It will be interesting to see if Israel will blow the reactor in syria up again now that it is being rebuilt by a partnership composed of british and german companies. Teh british government has already gauranteed the securty of the reactor (from israeli attack).\n \n The real danger these reactors seemed to pose, since they were not suitable for production of weapons grade material, was in that with infrastructure improvements and trade agreements Iraq and Syria are both (or in Iraqs case, was before the gulf war) posied to become virtual economic superpowers in the ME. Israel, as a fairly pathetic welfare state, of course does not wish to seen this happen.\n \n Are we really going to let them ensure that other nations in the region fail economically just to preserve their self image as a regional superpower?",

The power reactor they were building, though, was not suitable for the purpose (would have taken several hundred years to get together enough material for a single bomb). A new reactor would have been needed. There is really no grey area in this. Either you are running a reactor which produces wqeapons grade material or you are not, and the IAEA certainly knows the difference.\n \n As to the second part, unlike in both Iraq and Syria, where the IAEA was on site (an IAEA inspector was actualyl injured in the attack in syria), the IAEA has not been in north korea. They were simply voicing an opinion based on the very limited amount of intel that had been gathered. In the case of Syria and Iraq, they were there, they had approved the plans for the reactors and were actually supervising the construction and providing technical support.

   "According to the man they produced some fuel for nuclear weapons in that reactor... I'd tend to believe the guy who ran the program. That's what he's said. \n\n \n No, they produced some fuel (less than a gram) in a 2 MW research reactor they had recieved from the chinese. They still have this reactor. It was the larger power reactor that the IAEA declared not for weapons use that israel destroyed. \n \n The research reactor was similar to the ones you find scattered across N america in the better colleges (even K-state has one). Good luck getting enough material to build a bomb from one of those.\n \n There are major differences between a reactor that is for the production of weapons grade material and one that is not. they are serious design differences and any decent physics professor can pick them out in a blueprint. Those reactors were simply NOT CAPABLE OF PRODUCING WEAPONS GRADE MATERIAL IN ANY USABLE QUANTITY. There is really no debate here, regardless of what you may or may not have read. We are talking serious design differences. In order to get weapons grade material out of a reactor which is specifically designed NOT to produce it, you have to bend or break several known laws regarding nuclear fusion. The Iranians are not that smart. \n \n \nAnd the IAEA had nuclear inspectors in North Korea\n\n \n They had inspectors in N korea who were not allowed to inspect N koreas gas graphite reactor (which , in contrast to the reactors destroyed by israel, is specifically designed to produce eweapons grade waste). The last time they were allowed to sample the waste from the reactor was 1997. \n \n It wasn't until 1999 that the IAEA discovered that critical parts from the Yongbyon reactor (a 50MW reactor) were missing, despite the fact that there were IAEA inspectors on site (though not actually allowed inside). they concluded that since the components had not been removed while the inspectors were there, they must have been removed in 1993 or 1994, before the inspectors showed up.\n \n By contrast, the IAEA approved the plans for botht the IRaqi and syrian reactors. They were both certified by the IAEA as not suitable for production of weapons grade material, and the IAEA had multiple inspectors and technical advisors actually working in the control room of the reactors assisting in getting it set up. In the case fo the Syrian reactor, the senior IAEA advisor on site was to act as the plant manager for the first 5 years of operation. \n \n In the case of the Iraqi reactor, several key components, along with part of the uranium being used to test the reactor, came directly form the US department of energy despite the fact that the reactor was actually a french designe. The Iraqi reactor was theoretically capable of prducing weapons grade material in trace amounts, though teh IAEA pointed out (both before construction began and after the Israeli raid) that in order to recover plutonium from the waste, Iraq would need such a massive complex that it would be absolutly impossible for them to carry it off without the world knowing. Iraq newver built, started to build, or, as far as we know, planned to build such a complex. It owuld have been much cheaper to build a new reactor in secret that produces large quantities of easily refined weapons grade material\n \n Unlike the situation in N korea where the IAEA has been complaining for years about the lack of cooperation with their inspectors, the IAEA condemned the attacks in Iraq, claiming that Iraq was following every IAEA guidline, inspecotrs had 24 hour a day, unfettered access tot eh facility, and there was absolutly no possibility that weapons development was going on there. \n \n \n In the same report, they pointed out that the only reactor that the IAEA was aware of that was cpapble of porducing weapons grade material and was not regulated and inspected by the IAEA is israels reactor at dimona (which is presumed to be a graphite/gas reactor, thogugh there is, of course, no confirmation for this since the israelis still refuse to admit that they even have a reactor).",

My grandfatehr once told me that if you poke a snake iwth a stick and it bites you, you got what you deserved,\n \n I think it is a virtual certainty that more nations will be developing nuclear programs. The world took note of how America is doing business these days. Iraq, which was a threat to nobody, was invaded, tens of thousands killed, government removed, and the entire place basically destroyed. N Korea who allegedly has nuclear warheads sitting on top of missiles capable of reaching the contenental united states, we try to buy off. \n \n I know if I was the leader of another country, ANY other country, I would be scrambling to get a few nukes in my arsenal.",
