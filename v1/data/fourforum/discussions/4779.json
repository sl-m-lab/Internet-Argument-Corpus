   "Don't know if this will help anyone or not, but the common law natural right of self defense, including the recognized conditions allowing the exercise of the right through use of deadly force, is not only centuries old but alive and well today. Here is an outline I use to teach the Law of Self-defense in Virginia to people who take a handgun safety course while seeking a concealed carry permit. I cannot say whether this law would apply in any other state, but Virginia has done little more than adopt the old English Common Law understanding of self-defense....\n \n \n I. DEFINITION OF SELF DEFENSE\n \n A. Self defense is a law of necessity. (For example, if threatened with a knife in a parking lot, you can't get in your car, go home, get your gun, and return to use it in self defense). \n B . The amount of force used in self defense must be reasonable under the circumstances.\n C. Deadly force cannot be used in self defense unless there is a reasonable fear that the person is in danger of being killed or suffering great bodily harm.\n D. Deadly force is most often defined as using a deadly weapon (see section V, Malice), but hands and fists can be deadly weapons when they are repeatedly used against an unresisting or incapacitated person.\n C. Self defense is viewed from the mind of the person acting in self defense. (ie. Does this person have a reasonable fear of some harm that justifies his acting in self defense and justifies his belief that the force used was reasonable under the circumstances).\n F. Two types of self defense: Justifiable (no fault) and Excusable (partly to blame for the conflict).\n G. The general self defense jury instruction:\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the amount of force used in self-defense must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened, and that the defendant is not allowed to use deadly force in self-defense unless he reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of being killed or that he was in danger of great bodily harm. \n \n II. JUSTIFIABLE SELF DEFENSE\n \n A. Justifiable self defense occurs where you are not at fault for creating the situation that leads you to use self defense. (example: you are approached by a stranger on the street who pulls out a knife and threatens to kill you if you do not give him your money).\n B. No \"retreat to the wall\" required when the self defense is justified. You may stand your ground and defend yourself.\n C. Same principles of self defense from section I apply. (ie., amount of force used must be reasonable, etc.).\n D. Jury instruction:\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT if you believe that the defendant was without fault in provoking or bringing on the difficulty, and that the defendant reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of harm, then the defendant had the right to use such force as was reasonably necessary to protect himself from the threatened harm. If you further believe that the defendant used no more force that was reasonably necessary to protect himself from the threatened harm, then you shall find the defendant not guilty.\n \n III. EXCUSABLE SELF DEFENSE\n \n A. Excusable self defense occurs when you are partly to blame for the conflict which causes you to use self defense. (example. You get mad at a man and hit him with your fist in a parking lot. He goes to his car, pulls out a knife, and comes back towards you threatening to kill you.)\n B. You must first cease any assault you are committing.\n C. You must declare that you desire peace.\n D. You must \"retreat to the wall\" and do everything possible to avoid having to defend yourself.\n E. If you cannot retreat and are forced to defend yourself, then the same principles of\n self-defense from section I apply. (ie., amount of force used must be reasonable, etc.).\n F. Jury instruction:\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT if the evidence showed the defendant was to some degree at fault in provoking or bringing on the difficulty, and if you further find that when attacked:\n 1. He retreated as far as he safely could under the circumstances;\n 2. In a good faith attempt to abandon the fight;\n 3. Made known his desire for peace by word or act;\n 4. He reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of bodily harm; and\n 5. He used no more force that was reasonably necessary to protect himself from the threatened harm, then you shall find the defendant not guilty. \n \n IV. DEFENSE OF OTHERS\n \n A Self defense applies to the defense of others.\n B. Force used to defend others must be reasonable under the circumstances.\n C. Deadly force cannot be used to defend others unless you reasonably fear that the person you are defending is in danger of being killed or suffering great bodily harm.\n D. Defense of others is viewed from the mind of the person acting to defend another. When defending another, you must reasonably believe that the person you are defending is a faultless victim of the assault you are defending against.\n E. Case law:\n \n \"Thus, under the majority view, in order to justifiably defend another, the defendant must reasonably believe that the person being defended was free from fault; whether the defended person was, in fact, free from fault is legally irrelevant to the defense in those jurisdictions. This view is based on the principle that one should not be convicted of a crime for attempting to protect one whom he or she perceives to be a faultless victim from a violent assault. Under this approach, the policy of the law is to encourage individuals to come to the aid of perceived victims of assault. We find this position to be well-grounded in principle and policy. Accordingly, we hold that the law pertaining to defense of others is that one may avail himself or herself of the defense only where he or she reasonably believes, based on the attendant circumstances, that the person defended is without fault in provoking the fray.\" Foster v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 380, 386, 412 S.E.2d 198, ___ (1991)\n \n \n V. MALICE\n \n A. There can be no self defense when the person acts with malice.\n B. Malice can be inferred from the deliberate use of a firearm or other deadly weapon in an unjustified attack.\n C. Malice is an essential element of murder.\n D. Note that self defense (in cases where the judge or jury believes the defendant truly acted in self defense) does constitute a \"legal excuse or justification\" under the first of the two instructions that follow in this section.\n E. Jury Instructions:\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT malice is the state of mind which results in the intentional doing of a wrongful act to another without legal excuse or justification, at a time when the mind of the actor is under the control of reason. Malice may result from any unlawful or unjustifiable motive including anger, hatred or revenge. Malice may be inferred from any deliberate willful and cruel act against another, however sudden.\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT you may infer malice from the deliberate use of a deadly weapon unless, from all the evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to whether malice existed. A deadly weapon is any object or instrument, not part of the human body, that is likely to cause death or great bodily injury because of the manner and under the circumstances in which it is used. \n \n VI. RIGHT TO ARM\n \n A. A person who reasonably fears that he will suffer serious bodily harm from an imminent attack has the right to arm himself for his self defense. (note this now applies even to convicted felons, who may sieze a firearm and use it to defend themselves in a sudden emergency without fear of conviction for possession of the firearm by a felon)\n B. No malice will be inferred from the mere fact that the defendant armed himself under these circumstances.\n C. Jury instruction:\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY that when a person reasonably apprehends that another intends to attack him for the purpose of doing him serious bodily harm, then such person has the right to arm himself for his own necessary self defense and if he has reasonable grounds to believe that an attack will be made upon him then no inference of malice can be drawn from the fact of such preparation.\n \n VII. DEFENSE OF PROPERTY\n \n A. A person has NO RIGHT TO USE DEADLY FORCE solely to defend his personal property. This applies where you are only defending your property and NOT defending yourself or your family. (example, you CANNOT shoot someone in the back while they are running across your yard with your TV)\n B. A person has NO RIGHT TO THREATEN THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE solely to defend his property. (This is a recent change in the law). (Example, it is a crime to brandish a firearm to run someone off who is breaking into your unoccupied car in a parking lot [but, how many people do you think will go to the magistrate to swear out the following warrant: \"look, I was trying to break into this dude's car when he ran up and scared me by pointing a gun at me and telling me he was going to shoot me.\"])\n C. A person has NO RIGHT TO USE OR THREATEN THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE solely to run off a mere trespasser on their open land (beyond the curtilage surrounding the home).\n C. The policy behind these laws on defending property and land holds that human life is far more important than your TV or your car or the grass that gets trampled.\n D. But remember that most home burglary situations involve defending not only your property but yourself, your spouse, and your children who are in the home.\n E. Also, there is case law in Virginia for the \"castle doctrine.\" This doctrine holds that one may use deadly force to defend his home to keep aggressors out of the home. \n F. Case law:\n \n 1. Defense of property\n (Facts: defendant brandished a rifle to scare off a car repo man) \"Even if [the] actions [of the person threatening the defendant's property] were unwarranted or illegal, the defendant, as an owner of personal property, did not have the right to assert or defend his possessory rights thereto by the use of deadly force. In Montgomery v. Commonwealth, 98 Va. 840, 842-43, 36 S.E. 371, 372 (1900), we said: The law is clearly stated by a learned judge in State v. Morgan, 3 Ired. 186, 38 Am. Dec. 714, as follows: \"When it is said that a man may rightfully use as much force as is necessary for the protection of his person and property, it should be recollected that this rule is subject to this most important modification, that he shall not, except in extreme cases, endanger human life or do great bodily harm. It is not every right of person, and still less of property, that can lawfully be asserted, or every wrong that may rightfully be redressed by extreme remedies. There is a recklessness and a wanton disregard of humanity and social duty in taking or endeavoring to take, the life of a fellow-being, in order to save one's self from a comparatively slight wrong, which is essentially wicked, and the law abhors. You may not kill, because you cannot otherwise effect your object, although the object sought to be effected is right. You can only kill to save life or limb, or prevent a great crime, or to accomplish a necessary public duty.\" See, also, 1 Bishop on New C. L., secs. 839, 841, 850. However, the defendant contends, and the Court of Appeals held, that these principles do not apply when there is a mere threat to use deadly force in protection of personal property. We do not agree. Moreover, the owner of land has no right to assault a mere trespasser with a deadly weapon. Montgomery, 98 Va. at 844, 36 S.E. at 373. For these reasons, we agree with the trial court that a deadly weapon may not be brandished solely in defense of personal property.\" Commonwealth v. Alexander, 260 Va. 238, 242, 531 S.E.2d 567, ___ (2000).\n 2. Cases mentioning the \"Castle Doctrine\"\n \"The use of deadly force to prevent threatened harm to property is never justified except in defense of habitation. . . .[the remainder of this quote comes from a footnote to the preceding sentence] The use of deadly force, in defense of \"property\" can also be justifiable, but the classic formulation lists only arson or burglary as crimes against property which can justify the use of deadly force. . . . Even then the use of deadly force must have been necessary. Defense of habitation and justifiable self-defense overlap in the \"castle doctrine\" which states that one may, without retreating, use force, to include deadly force if necessary, to keep aggressors out of his own house. This part of the castle doctrine is one aspect of defense of habitation. . . . [T]he justification exists in the curtilage as well as the castle. Roger D. Groot, Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia 114 (3rd ed. 1994). The defense of habitation and the castle doctrine have not been raised in this case.\"  Alexander v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 771, 780, 508 S.E.2d 912, ___ (1999).\n But see also  the following old case which holds that the use of deadly force to repel a home invasion must be premised on a reasonable fear of death or bodily injury, or damage to or theft of property in the home:\n \"The owner may resist the entry, but he has no right to kill, unless it be rendered necessary to prevent loss of life or great bodily harm. If he kills where there is not a reasonable ground of apprehension of imminent danger to his person or property, it is manslaughter, and if done with malice, express or implied, it is then murder.\"  Harrigan and Thompson's Criminal Defences, volume 1, page 963, note 861. See Carroll v. State, 23 Ala. 28, 58 Am. Dec. 282; Pond v. People, 8 Mich. 150; Greschia v. People, 53 Ill. 295; Fortune v. Commonwealth, 133 Va. 669, 688, 112 S.E. 861, overruling Parrish v. Commonwealth, 81 Va. 1. Bausell v. Commonwealth, 165 Va. 669, 687-688, 181 S.E. 453, ___ (1935)",

   "Although I dont live in Virginia I appreciate you throwin that document up there.\n Is there a link to the Pennsylvania laws like that..that was very informative\n\n \n Sorry, I don't know PA's law or if there is a link to it. Va follows the old common law rules for self defense. \n \n From what I have read of the new (and much criticized by the media elite) Florida self defense bill, it sounds like Florida is just returning to the old common law standard for justifiable self-defense, where retreat to the wall is not required when faced with a threat of deadly force. The first I heard of the new law change in Fla. was from the misfortune of watching a CBS nightly news story on it. The reporter said with disbelief in his voice (the kind of \"my God what are they doing!\" panic you hear when someone passes a law they don't like) that the new law states that if you shoot someone you are actually presumed innocent of any crime. My only comment on this is that the reporter obviously knows nothing of our legal system. Whenever any person is prosecuted for any crime, whether in Fla. or anywhere else in America, that person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I thought about e-mailing our standard jury instruction to the CBS guy:\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the defendant is presumed innocent. You should not assume the defendant is guilty because he has been indicted and is on trial. This presumption of innocence remains with the defendant throughout the trial and is enough to require you to find the defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. This does not require proof beyond all possible doubt, nor is the Commonwealth required to disprove every conceivable circumstance of innocence. However, suspicion or probability of guilt is not enough for a conviction.\n There is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence.\n A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your sound judgment after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case.\n \n In any event, I have heard the re-tread of the same old arguments again about Fla. becoming the \"wild, wild west,\" \"traffic accidents becoming shootouts,\" and Fla. becoming the \"gunshine state.\" These are the same arguments which were made when Fla. adopted a concealed carry law. I believe they will prove just as ignorant now as they did then.",
