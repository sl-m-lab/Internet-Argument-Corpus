   "Bush 'is planning nuclear strikes on Iran's secret sites'\n By Philip Sherwell in Washington\n (Filed: 09/04/2006)\n \n The Bush administration is planning to use nuclear weapons against Iran, to prevent it acquiring its own atomic warheads, claims an investigative writer with high-level Pentagon and intelligence contacts.\n \n President George W Bush is said to be so alarmed by the threat of Iran's hard-line leader, Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, that privately he refers to him as \"the new Hitler\", says Seymour Hersh, who broke the story of the Abu Ghraib Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal.\n \n \n Mahmoud Ahmedinejad: 'The new Hitler' \n Some US military chiefs have unsuccessfully urged the White House to drop the nuclear option from its war plans, Hersh writes in The New Yorker magazine. The conviction that Mr Ahmedinejad would attack Israel or US forces in the Middle East, if Iran obtains atomic weapons, is what drives American planning for the destruction of Teheran's nuclear programme.\n \n Hersh claims that one of the plans, presented to the White House by the Pentagon, entails the use of a bunker-buster tactical nuclear weapon, such as the B61-11, against underground nuclear sites. One alleged target is Iran's main centrifuge plant, at Natanz, 200 miles south of Teheran.\n \n Although Iran claims that its nuclear programme is peaceful, US and European intelligence agencies are certain that Teheran is trying to develop atomic weapons. In contrast to the run-up to the Iraq invasion, there are no disagreements within Western intelligence about Iran's plans.\n \n This newspaper disclosed recently that senior Pentagon strategists are updating plans to strike Iran's nuclear sites with long-distance B2 bombers and submarine-launched missiles. And last week, the Sunday Telegraph reported a secret meeting at the Ministry of Defence where military chiefs and officials from Downing Street and the Foreign Office discussed the consequences of an American-led attack on Iran, and Britain's role in any such action.\n \n The military option is opposed by London and other European capitals. But there are growing fears in No 10 and the Foreign Office that the British-led push for a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear stand-off, will be swept aside by hawks in Washington. Hersh says that within the Bush administration, there are concerns that even a pummelling by conventional strikes, may not sufficiently damage Iran's buried nuclear plants.\n \n \n Click to enlarge \n Iran has been developing a series of bunkers and facilities to provide hidden command centres for its leaders and to protect its nuclear infrastructure. The lack of reliable intelligence about these subterranean facilities, is fuelling pressure for tactical nuclear weapons to be included in the strike plans as the only guaranteed means to destroy all the sites simultaneously.\n \n The attention given to the nuclear option has created serious misgivings among the joint chiefs of staff, and some officers have talked about resigning, Hersh has been told. The military chiefs sought to remove the nuclear option from the evolving war plans for Iran, without success, a former senior intelligence officer said.\n \n The Pentagon consultant on the war on terror confirmed that some in the administration were looking seriously at this option, which he linked to a resurgence of interest in tactical nuclear weapons among defence department political appointees.\n \n The election of Mr Ahmedinejad last year, has hardened attitudes within the Bush Administration. The Iranian president has said that Israel should be \"wiped off the map\". He has drafted in former fellow Revolutionary Guards commanders to run the nuclear programme, in further signs that he is preparing to back his threats with action.\n \n Mr Bush and others in the White House view him as a potential Adolf Hitler, a former senior intelligence official told Hersh. \"That's the name they're using. They say, 'Will Iran get a strategic weapon and threaten another world war?' \"\n \n Despite America's public commitment to diplomacy, there is a growing belief in Washington that the only solution to the crisis is regime change. A senior Pentagon consultant said that Mr Bush believes that he must do \"what no Democrat or Republican, if elected in the future, would have the courage to do,\" and \"that saving Iran is going to be his legacy\".\n \n Publicly, the US insists it remains committed to diplomacy to solve the crisis. But with Russia apparently intent on vetoing any threat of punitive action at the UN, the Bush administration is also planning for unilateral military action. Hersh repeated his claims that the US has intensified clandestine activities inside Iran, using special forces to identify targets and establish contact with anti-Teheran ethnic-minority groups.\n \n The senior defence officials said that Mr Bush is \"determined to deny Iran the opportunity to begin a pilot programme, planned for this spring, to enrich uranium\".\n\n \n OK this is scary, The US admin seems to have gone off on one already if this report is accurate. \"Saving Iran\" is going to be Bush's \"Legacy\"? Ouch!\n Doesn't that put a time limit on potential action?\n Iran should be dealt with but this seems to be an over-reaction to say the least.",

Ouch!\n Doesn't that put a time limit on potential action?\n Iran should be dealt with but this seems to be an over-reaction to say the least.\n\n \n Most of Irans bunkers are so deeply buried that conventional weapons cannot touch them. In order for any kindof strike against Iran to be meaningful, we have to use nuclear bunker busters. The down side to this is that while they ARE low yield devices, the fallout will still be devestating. Many of the Iranian bunkers or near, and in some cases even directly under, populated areas. \n \n I shudder to think what the results of this are likely to be should we actually undertake this foolish course of action. I cannot imagine anything that would more completely unite and mobilize anti american interests around the world than the unprovoked use of nuclear weapons. \n \n I would imagine that immediatly following we could expect missile strikes against our bases in Iraq, and even if the Iranians did not intentionally slow the flow of oil out of Iran, such massive infrastructure damage would almost certainly cause a production slowdown, sending the cost of oil skyrocketing.\n \n I have no doubt that Bush is planning this. I would be surprised if he was not. He has shown a complete and utter detachment from reality since his first day in office. The sad part of this is that Europe is likely to bear the brunt of the terrorist response to this, likely with Iran supplying materials for dirty boms, since the US is on the other side of the wolrd and geographically isolated. It is too bad that Europeans are spineless and can be counted on to be american lap dogs. I wonder how many tens of thousands will have to die before they grow a pair and stand up.",

Pakistan did not sign the non-proliferation agreement, has been subject to US sanctions for developing nuclear weapons, but always emerges as a US ally over a long period of time beginning with USSR occupation of Afghanistan, through the Taliban, through 'democratic' Afghanistan. As a MAD situation with India and US ally, Pakistan's instability would IMO offer more of a threat of all-out nuclear war than Iran.\n \n Considering we've (US) never really seriously chastised any other nation recently gaining nuclear weapons capability, including N. Korea, I have to stay with the opinion that US saber rattling at Iran isn't predicated on nuclear weapons development or Israel, but because of Iran's threat to the Petrodollar and elastic US debt. But there's never even a hint of that problem by US administration or US media. Using fear to motivate US public opinion is the current game, facts not being required.",

   "The Iranians may be obstructive to the IAEA but they are all within legal boundries concerning nuclear plants. Who is threatening who with nuclear weapons here really and who has even used them to send a political message before? Well...\n \n Iran will make a bomb, be sure about it, and it's little that can be done about it now when the specter of US military might grows ever thinner and the bancruptcy of their state threatens. The Russians and the Chinese are heavily invested and couldn't care less if US might lessens. They just want a soft fall so their own rise isn't inhibited. \n \n About our spinelessness here in Europe I think it's about sitting on the fence. No one but us knows better about the failures of badly implemented foreign policies and we are just fine with letting US be the bully. Colonial memories actually seem to have made a lesson. Remember our history and the period after WW2 which is unheard of as up to now. We're living in a Pax Europa that our ancestors would envy us. To start the old sabre rattling games just seem...archaic at the moment.",

   "Guys, get real. The Americans do not have the guts to nuke the Iranians. One, DAEWOO is right. Their facilities are deep in the ground, and not even a bunkerbuster would nab them.\n Second, Americans do not have the nuts to do it. \n Here are some reasons why. In 1996, the International Court, or World Court said Nuclear Weapons are illegal. Use in war, or even threatening to use them, is illegal. So, if we nuked Iran, I am sure Americans would be under sanctions or something. All Islamic people, and probably half of Europe would be angry. I know for one, my country would be really ticked.\n Nuclear strikes are not going to happen. If they do happen, you can say bye bye Amerika. Because we would be under international pressure. Russia and China would be real ticked, probably the other nuclear powers fighting this standoff, all the Arabs and Muslims, and probably even Amerika itself. Anti-Nuclear Weapons protesters would march all over the country, and so on.\n I can't say for sure, but Bush better watch his back. They way he is handling the Iranian nuclear standoff, he is likely to drag this nation into another war. He is running his mouth right now, and it needs to stop. He says he is going to possibly nuke the Iranian sites. Well, lets see here. If he does that, there is a possibility of Iran declaring war on Amerika, and even China and Russia joining in.\n Plus, Iran is a small country compared to ours. It probably would take up six states in America. But, if we nuked their country, radiation would screw the people up. Take Japan for instance. We nuked their country on August 6 and August 9. For generations, women were giving birth to deformed babies, people died of radiation, and parts of Japan are still toxic. Iran woud suffer the same fate.\n I am all for nukes. But, we should not use them on these sites. They are full of Uranium and plutonium and other radioactive and explosive materials, that if we nuke them, you are going to have an explosion bigger than ever. \n -Sergei",

We don't have to be in the U.N if we don't want to.\n But, still, we won't nuke another country. You can guarantee if they nuke a country, I will be angry.",

   "If Iran is indeed trying to develop nuclear weapons, as the Western intelligence agencies say, then they have done it in a very sly manner. Since, as Daewoo says, the facilities are buried so far underground that only nuclear weapons could dislodge them and since any nuclear strike would not only set a very dangerous new precedent but severely hurt the nearby large civilian population centers, it seems that we have far more to lose on the world stage by striking than by not striking. We may not have any realistic choice, then, other than to accept that Iran may have nuclear weapons in a few years. \n \n I don't think that Iran would be foolish enough to launch a first strike against, for ex., Israel.
