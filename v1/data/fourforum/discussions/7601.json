   "Hate that Bush is spying on Americans? How about this idea...\n Encourage everyone you know to make a phone call to a Muslim country. Just think how much fun the NSA (National Security Agency) will have trying to figure out who is a spy if thousands of regular Americans start making oversea calls to nations Bush considers suspect. \n \n Don't know anyone in Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, etc? Just do a search on google for phone numbers in those countries. I did one and found a good source: http://www.numberway.com/phone-numbers/301/ And if they speak English (or you speak their language) make a friend!\n \n Pass this grass roots idea on!",
