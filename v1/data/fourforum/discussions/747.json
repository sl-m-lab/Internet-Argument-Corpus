   "If it has a net negative impact on the economy (as the CBO estimates it will), then it get's rid of jobs.\n \n But even if you accept Bush's figures (1.6 million jobs created!) its still remarkably inefficient. As New York Times Columnist (and Princeton Economics Professor) Paul Krugman pointed out: if you divide the 726 billion dollar figure by the 1.6 million jobs created, you're spending approximately $453,750/job created. The national median income is around $30,000. There, the government could hire all 1.6 million people themselves at a salary 10x the national median, and STILL spend less money than it does on this tax cut. Or, you could hire them at the national median income and be able to hire 11.6 million people. Either way, the Bush Tax Cut is remarkably inefficient for its purported goals.",
