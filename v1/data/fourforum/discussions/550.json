   "emoticon_xbouncer Hey...anyone, how about this; According to Pat Robertson Allah is not God.\n From his website:\"PAT ROBERTSON: Under no circumstances is Jehovah, the God of the Bible, and Allah, of the Koran, the same. First of all, the God of the Bible is a God of love and redemption, who sent His Son into the world to die for our sins. Allah tells people to die for him in order to get salvation, but there is no understanding of salvation. \"\n \n How does the \"average\" Christian feel about this person's view? Personally, I would think they would be embarrassed to have such an arrogant ignoramous representing them. I have heard the argument that only Allah requires the sacrifices of followers lives...what about all those Christian martyrs?
