   "I can't really agree with this. Many atheists adopt what they believe is radical moral relativism today, but few, if any, do so consistently. You will find atheists with the one hand declaring the subjectivity of all ethics, and with the other declaring \"racism is always wrong\". \n \n In practise you will find many declared subjectivists practicing a variety of non-judgementalism, where it is believed wrong to judge anyone or anything as better than anything else. (Except if someone else is deemed to have judged something, in which case they are fair game). So mass murder can be ok, as long as it's done for politically correct reasons, but woe betide any white male who speaks with a southern accent.\n \n Atheist subjectivity is more often a product of indoctrination by the education system than a genuine philosophy. The education system in turn is reflecting a vulgarised version of 1960s - 1970s poststructuralist thought.\n \n Incidentally Richard Dawkins, world's foremost atheist, is a prominent opponent of relativism.\nHow dare you write back a respectful disagreeing response! Consider your post reported for violating the sacred rule of just calling me an XXXXX from the start.\n \n \n Now that I cleared that up...\n \n I find that the logical conclusion of atheism has to be a relativist perspective which is why many may believe this. The problem is there are people smart enough to realize such a perspective just doesn't work and thus adjust atheism to fit this deficiency. \n \n Dawkins and many other atheists have realized this but oddly enough work back from a conclusion to the beginning, I feel. What you end up with now is many variants of atheism that all point to something to \"hang the moral hat\" on. Often times I hear the morals come from survival (as one example). I think all these end up with the same flaw...mainly that it ruins their current moral code by either going against it or being some form of circular reasoning. What I have found is that the end result of this basically the atheist creates a type of god in the form of some inherent truth that exists long before anything else existed. At that point you are really at no different beginning than the religious person...just with a self created god and this has its own problems. I don't think Dawkins ever gets there. Dawkins, I believe, uses almost a confusion type of fallacy to make his arguments. He tends to set up something like \"if there is a god he would do x,y,z\" and then he proceeds to debunk x,y, and z. The conclusion from this is atheism.",

   "Another instance of the media's double standard?\n \n\n Palin Channels Feinstein\n GOP Leader's Handy Note-Taking Follows in Footsteps of State's Senior Democrat\n ________________________________________\n Thursday, February 11, 2010\n By Jerry Roberts (Contact)\n When Sarah Palin wrote a cheat sheet for an interview on her hand last weekend, liberal commentators predictably bashed her&#8201;-&#8201;although the ex-Republican veep candidate did nothing that California's top Democrat hadn't done before.\n From Arianna Huffington to Andrea Mitchell, lefty pundits pounced on Palin, after photos showed that she'd scribbled brief talking points on her palm&#8201;-&#8201;\"energy, cuts, tax, lift American spirits\"&#8201;-&#8201;before sitting for questions during last weekend's big, conservative Tea Party convention.\n Capitol Letters\n Veteran California political scribes recalled, however, that now-senior Senator Dianne Feinstein pulled the same stunt during a crucial debate when she unsuccessfully ran for governor against Pete Wilson. Back in October 1990, Feinstein and Wilson had their one-and-only debate of the campaign; nervous before the statewide televised event, DiFi scrawled three words&#8201;-&#8201;\"growth, education, choice\" on her palm in blue marker, to remind her of the policy themes she wanted to sound.\n Her action technically violated a ground rule, on which the campaigns had agreed, against bringing notes to the podium. When reporters challenged her about it after the debate, Feinstein hid her hand behind her back, said, \"I'm not going to show you,\" and walked away.\n The Santa Barbara Independent Palin Channels Feinstein\n",

   "The sources you went to also have no credibility which is more important. Sorry but \"my brother and a couple guys on a military forum said so\" is not a valid source by any rational standard. \n \n And as far as I'm concerned they have as much knowledge of military training as you. Because they are on a military forum doesn't tell me anything. Even more so when talking about the military where you have hundreds of different units over different time periods..etc...where things might be different and you got the opinion of like 2 people. Who would buy that! Talk about appeal to authority fallacy.\n \n A number of alleged soldiers you mean...of which we have no proof of rank, area, or expertise. Get a military general with an expertise in explosives to say so and I'd believe it....for that matter any known expert and I'd believe it. Daewoo even discredited what one of them about C4 and stomping on it which makes me trust them less. \n\n \n All you have done here steeeeve is continue to insist that you reject these mens opinions about the wrongness of using a hand grenade as a hammer because you have no first hand access to evidence of their standing as militarily trained soldiers. Had I gone to a knitting forum seeking to ask this question of participants, you might have a point. But in an imperfect world as we live in, I went to the perfect source to ask such a question and these men did share their military qualifications for answering my query. Your refusal to accept them as the best source available is disingenuous at best and dishonest at worst. You see steeeeve, I know my brother served as a Drill Instructor which is why I asked his opinion. Had he agreed with daewoo, I would have dropped the issue immediately since I'm not looking to defend a weak position.\n \n \n Because you responded to it and continued. Don't try and give me the \"I didn't start it\" routine again. You both derailed the thread and just like both of us are derailing this one and YOU started it.\n\n \n Really? How am I derailing this thread by defending my part in running daewoo off in a debate where he started lying and claimed it was evidence of his logic? Just as you brought up daewoo leaving here and attempted to blame it on the quality of debate here as if it's these debaters fault daewoo left here. Let me be clear about this; daewoo ran off with his tail between his legs because I shoved his irrational debating style, non existent logic and dishonesty as he was proven to be some military poser right down his throat for all to see. In other words, he is a fraud and I proved it.\n \n So let me deal with your very clear objection that my military source was bogus and no proof of anything real or reliable at all. Here is the military forum I joined and asked the question of. A Question for as many soldiers as possible: - All Military Everyone can see and judge for themselves how I phrased my question, and if I was seeking to sway the feed back I received. And you will see that regarding the trip wire kit daewoo mentioned which he said had a nail enclosed to bang in with the base of the grenade was in fact to replace the ignition pin with for easy discharge as a booby trap. These soldiers proved they correctly understood procedure since they posted info which any other soldier could have called them on if they were wrong in their claims. \n \n You don't even find it curious that daewoo never saw fit to log on and defend himself against the opinions of the so called fellow soldiers who were allegedly his own comrades in Arms. To summarize steeeve, you need to learn the difference between derailing a thread and rightfully responding to someone who derails the thread by making an off topic argument which deserves a response. Both daewoo and you have derailed the threads in question and all I did was respond accordingly.",

He came into office seeking to unite the country, and his initial approval ratings ranked among the best for post-World War II presidents, including an average of 41% approval from Republicans in his first week in office. But he quickly lost most of his Republican support, with his approval rating among Republicans dropping below 30% in mid-February and below 20% in August. Throughout the year, his approval rating among Democrats exceeded 80%, and it showed little decline even as his overall approval rating fell from the mid-60s to roughly 50%.\n Obama's Approval Most Polarized for First-Year President\n \n",

Do you think we buy snake oil, too? emoticon_rolleyes\n First, the major media is in love with Obama. He has been on major TV, hosting shows from the Whitehouse, giving briefs, etc., over 150 times in his first year. The only station that doesn't swoon over his every word is Fox News, so maybe the reason lies elsewhere. For instance, the public is against socialized medicine, it's against increased governmental spending, it's against trying terrorists in NYC, it's against closing Gitmo, yet the president continues to ram his agenda down the American public's throats. \n His ratings suck because his policies suck, not because the GOP or Fox News says so.",

Have you paid attention to ANY of the healthcare debacle? ! In the committee proceedings, two Republicans joined the Democrats. Once out of committee, all of Democrats in the Senate voted for it, despite the people's opposition. Up until the Democrats lost the Senate race in MA, they have all been following Reid and Pelosi off the cliff. Now, some of the smartest Democrats are resigning while others scramble back to a more moderate stance to save their bacon in November. \n We have a INCOMPETENT Democratic President and an INCOMPETENT Democratic Congress and you want to blame Republicans?!

I don't doubt the republicans are better at it...I think they both probably try the same amount. I mention this because democrats are no saints just because they stink at attacking. It is just another thing they are bad at. It has been my experience that democrats have bad ideas and good intentions while republicans have good ideas and bad intentions. At the end of the day that leaves you with no good ideas implemented and a lot of bickering. When the republicans get back congress they will probably revert back to how they acted in 2000-2006 mainly because Obama is worthless.
