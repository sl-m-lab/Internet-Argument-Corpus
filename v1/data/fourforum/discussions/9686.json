   "http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_mary_sha_070325_the_real_gay_agenda.htm\n \n This is such a simple issue, why does everyone have to complicate the matter? Gay agenda = equality. This Op-ed is well written.\n \n John and Chris have been together for three decades. They've raised two healthy and well-adjusted children, who have themselves grown up, gotten married, and provided John and Chris with two beautiful grandchildren so far.\n \n When they were in their twenties, Chris worked two jobs to put John through medical school. They've stayed together through good times and bad. Their love and their devotion to each other have remained strong even as most other residents of their suburban Philadelphia neighborhood have divorced, remarried, and in some cases divorced again.\n \n Sound like the ideal marriage? Yes, it might, if only John and Chris could get married. But, you see, John and Chris are both men, and Pennsylvania does not recognize same-sex marriages.\n \n Some might suggest that they move to nearby New Jersey, where marriage-like civil unions recently became legal. But it's not so easy to uproot a family. There are homes and careers involved. Besides, telling John and Chris to move to Jersey to find equality is like telling someone to move out of the country if they don't like the way their tax dollars are being spent. Moving to Jersey would mean giving up on Pennsylvania. Better to stay and fight for equality at home in the Keystone State.\n \n And equality is really all they want. That's really all there is to the so-called \"gay agenda\". Simple equality. No special privileges, just the same privileges as everyone else.\n \n Those who oppose same-sex marriage say that it would undermine the institution of marriage. But isn't heterosexual infidelity already doing that?\n \n I fail to see how legalizing same-sex marriage would have any effect on heterosexual marriages. As James Carville once said, \"I was against gay marriage until I found out I didn't have to have one.\" No, anyone who feels that his own heterosexual marriage would be threatened if gays could marry obviously has some very deep issues that can't be fixed through legislation.\n \n This country was founded on the principle that all people - not just the heterosexual ones - are created equal. It's time to make that principle a reality. It's time for the homophobes of America to stop worrying about what consenting adults are doing in the privacy of their own homes. After all, time and time again we've seen that those who want to control what goes on in other people's bedrooms seem to have the most to hide in their own. (Can you say \"Ted Haggard\"?)\n \n Our soldiers are dying in Iraq and Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden is still on the loose, and 13 million children in this country suffer from hunger due to poverty. Don't we have more important things to worry about than what the gay couple down the street might be doing behind closed doors?\n \n And aren't the principles of freedom and equality better for this country, and for humankind in general, than a policy of bigotry and hate?",

   "Every so often, I see these type of articles or posts, where someone takes a an apparently benign situation of a gay couple and tries to use it as a straw man to answer the \"gay agenda\" thing. It attempts to use a single story of a situation to refute the idea that the gay rights movement has an agenda. We must keep in mind that this sort of post is not a real argument, but rather more an appeal to emotion. But it is an interesting tactic, so let's break this down more carefully, shall we?\n \n \nThis is such a simple issue, why does everyone have to complicate the matter? \n\n \n Because, in point of fact, it is not a simple issue. Telling the story of one gay couple and their one situation does not even come close to encompassing the entire issue. There are many facets to this matter, such as the effects it would have on society and culture, the legal ramifications, the legal precedents involved, whether the issues should be resolved via civil unions, etc.\n \n \nSound like the ideal marriage? Yes, it might, if only John and Chris could get married. But, you see, John and Chris are both men, and Pennsylvania does not recognize same-sex marriages.\n\n \n It sounds like two people that have decided to be together, and have found fulfillment to some level in ea other. It may or may not sound like \"marriage.\" What's interesting here is that the issue at hand is legal recognition of gay unions, not whether the two have a healthy relationship. So why does this article try to pass off the story of how emotionally close these two are as speaking to the legal issue? It says it \"sounds like a marriage\" but that they can't get married in PA. But to the extent that they can be as close as they are, they most certainly CAN get married; they just don't have legal recognition. No one is saying the two in the article cannot be emotionally close to ea other if they so choose. It seems this article addresses one issue and tries to pass it off as addressing another (the legal one).\n \n \nSome might suggest that they move to nearby New Jersey, where marriage-like civil unions recently became legal. But it's not so easy to uproot a family. There are homes and careers involved. Besides, telling John and Chris to move to Jersey to find equality is like telling someone to move out of the country if they don't like the way their tax dollars are being spent. Moving to Jersey would mean giving up on Pennsylvania. Better to stay and fight for equality at home in the Keystone State.\n\n \n But here we have an interesting change of motivation. Suddenly the couple no longer cites their relationship as motivation for their decisions, but rather their desire to participate in activism. \"Better to stay and fight for equality\" in their own state? The focus in the article subtly shifts from the the story of an emotional closeness as answer to the \"agenda\" accusation to talking about how legal benefits are given in one place and not the other. And so what happened to the original (ill-conceived) premise that this was to refute the idea of a gay rights movement agenda? Wait, here it is ...\n \n \nAnd equality is really all they want. That's really all there is to the so-called \"gay agenda\". Simple equality. No special privileges, just the same privileges as everyone else.\n\n \n And here we are back to the straw man. Note how the article author decides to refute the idea of a \"gay agenda\" rather than a \"gay rights agenda.\" Clearly it is easier to argue against the idea of an agenda in terms of emotional relationships and persons rather than the obvious legal and protest movement that is clearly going on in this country. Why would the author shy away entirely from discussing protests, court cases, lawsuits, etc. in favor of the emotional closeness of a single couple? Clearly it is because emotional-impact is easier to achieve than presenting sound arguments. But it does not reasonably speak to refuting the idea of a gay rights agenda, nor does it speak as a rational argument toward legal recognition of gay unions. If the issue at hand in this country were about whether gays should be allowed to become emotionally-close to one another, THEN the article might have some real relevance. But gay people are not prevented from doing that by law.\n \n \nThose who oppose same-sex marriage say that it would undermine the institution of marriage. But isn't heterosexual infidelity already doing that?\n\n \n Here we find an attempt to sway the issue to heterosexual infidelity; but there are two huge problems with this argument ... a.) heterosexuals have not claimed that their infidelity does not undermine the institution of marriage. Many would probably agree that it does; and b.) the issue is a red herring given that no one has premised that the institution depends on fidelity in the first place, unlike gender. It may indeed do so, but that is a much different discussion. Pitting fidelity against gender is comparing apples and oranges.\n \n \nI fail to see how legalizing same-sex marriage would have any effect on heterosexual marriages. As James Carville once said, \"I was against gay marriage until I found out I didn't have to have one.\" No, anyone who feels that his own heterosexual marriage would be threatened if gays could marry obviously has some very deep issues that can't be fixed through legislation.\n\n \n This is an oft-used tactic--switching the issue from the effect it would have on the institution of marriage to arguing over the effect it would have on someone's individual marriage. Very transparent to those of us who see the subtle change. This is the same sort of bad argumentation that goes on when a gay marriage proponent asks \"how would YOUR marriage be harmed?\" Well of course, no one said any particular specific marriage would be harmed; this is nothing more than a disingenuous misuse of semantics (in that marriage can refer to a specific union or the institution in society) as a 'switcheroo' strawman.\n \n \nThis country was founded on the principle that all people - not just the heterosexual ones - are created equal. It's time to make that principle a reality. It's time for the homophobes of America to stop worrying about what consenting adults are doing in the privacy of their own homes.\n\n \n Whoa ... that was actually starting to at least resemble a rational argument until the step off into unfounded motivations. Who said this had anything to do with people worrying about what goes on in peoples' homes? Maybe for some it does, but who knows? If the gay rights movement indeed has sound arguments and holds the rational side as many of them believe they do, why should it matter if people \"worry\" about what gays do in their homes anyway? That statement has no bearing.\n \n \nOur soldiers are dying in Iraq and Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden is still on the loose, and 13 million children in this country suffer from hunger due to poverty. Don't we have more important things to worry about than what the gay couple down the street might be doing behind closed doors?\n\n \n Oh my. Now we are seeing completely unrelated issues being conflated here, as if they have any bearing on each other at all. The hunt for Bin Laden and the efforts to eliminate poverty can and do go on completely independently of the gay rights debates in society. If Bin Laden were found and poverty were eliminated, the legal gay marriage debate would still go on, and conversely, if the legal gay marriage debate were resolved, the Bin Laden hunt and anti-poverty efforts would still go on. It's not like this author has demonstrated in any way that efforts to fight poverty and find Bin Laden are being hindered somehow by the gay rights debate. Believe it or not it, is ok for society to work on multiple issues at once. \n \n \nAnd aren't the principles of freedom and equality better for this country, and for humankind in general, than a policy of bigotry and hate?\n\n \n Well this is clearly begging the question. How has it been proven that society overlooking other relationship-types in giving legal recognition was out of \"bigotry\" and \"hatred\"? It's not like, as marriage benefits were assigned, people likely sat down and said \"everyone but gays!\" No, they naturally based policy on the way society understood marriage to be--between two people of opposite genders. There was no hate in doing that--it was just basic normal decision-making.\n \n So the bottom line is this ... if you are going to fight toward legal recognition of any given union arrangement, then make the arguments necessary to do so. Finding a single couple who happens to be emotionally close simply doesn't cut the mustard as any sort of compelling legal argument. Certainly it could possibly stir emotions, and that is no doubt the real reason this article was written. In that sense, it may have some value. But let's not try to pass it off as some argument toward a legal matter, or as any sort of argument refuting the idea that the gay rights movement has an agenda, because it's not.",

How can one possibly fictional couple be evidence that a whole sub-section of our society, many members of which carry on as they do in the annual Gay Pride Parades then be held up as pillars of our Society worthy of being trusted with adoption rights and raising the next generation of Americans ?

Because the homosexual lifestyle is never going to miraculously become natural and normal somehow, even though that is the agenda of the Gay crusaders.

You exclude your selves by acting so far outside what society sees as normal and healthy for our children to observe at a parade for example. \n \n Why must gays march as outlandish, flamboyant, and promiscuous freaks at the St. Patricks day Parade ? Or the gay pride parade ? Why can't they blend in with banners that say we're gay but just like you ? You know why ? Because you aren't just like us. The Radical Gay movement like XXXXX Nation and the rest of them are intent on shocking and forcing the rest of us to accept your outlandish lifestyle rather than to blend into normal society as a positive contributing member.\n \n Tell me this, do tourists who visit San Fran visit the gay section for its culture, class and high quality of life, or for its filth, decadence, and free flowing sex shops, and clubs ? If you don't know the answer to that, let me tell ya, It aint the Museums that draws them in. So if the homosexual agenda and lifestyle were allowed flow freely everywhere, wouldn't you turn the whole Country into the same pit of depravity that the already existing gay hotspots have become ? Here, see what I mean ?\n www.sanfrancisco.com/gay/\n \n And here are residents who complain about the X rated store windows in the Castro district. And do the store owners care about the publics opinion ? Not on your life. We must respect and accept your extreme lifestyle but when you offend our sensibilities and expose our children to adult X rated gay porn in your store windows, your loving response is to tell us to move if we dont like it.

There is no danger of homosexuality spreading into the heterosexual population--it is against the heterosexual nature to do that.

Because the homosexual lifestyle is never going to miraculously become natural and normal somehow, even though that is the agenda of the Gay crusaders. To make our teachers gay, our boy scout leaders gay, anyone and everyone who is guiding our young into adulthood can show them that man on man love is a right and normal activity when it in fact leads to nothing but death in the end. \n\n \n That is you opinion and and exactly the attitude of privledge I am talking about. Some one who is privledged views themselves as normal and others as abnormal, they veiw themselves as better then others. Just as you view yourself as better then gay people. (I am not comparing race and sexuality when I make this next statement I am only giving an example of another kind of privledge.) For centuries, christians included, white people considered themselves normal and the other races where inferior to white people. White people felt they were intitled to something because they viewed themselves as normal and the others as inferior. This is the essence of white privledge. Now white people do not always see this but white privledge is very evident to people of color and you have to step into the shoes of a person of color to truely understand how unjust white privledge is. \n \n It is attitudes such as the one you are displaying is stopping me from being viewed as normal, and natural. You think that by society accepting gay people as normal and natural that we are somhow taking something from you. \n I do not understand how my being gay and our quest for acceptance and equality is forcing you to live by my standards. Am I saying that you must become gay? I am not out there making or supporting laws against your freedom to marry, your right to adopt. I am not working against your right not to be fired, thrown out of your home, denied employment, andmedical treatment because of how you are.

Because you view them wrong for yourself that does not mean they are wrong for everyone. When you support laws that take other peoples choices away because of your beliefs this makes you wrong. You must extend the same acceptence you enjoy to others. I gaurentee that if christian groups just kept to themselves and stopped all thier meddeling into politics, and pushing their moral agendas onto the lives of others, the reactions against christians would stop. Alass they can not they must make everyone live by their moral, repressed standard. Jesus commands you to treat others as you would have them treat you. So I ask again is the way you are treating and excluding gay people the way you would want gay people to treat you? \n \n \n \n\n Wrong, you are asking us to adopt your lifestyle as normal and an acceptible part of society. You want us to adopt your life principles and activities as normal. And your canned talking points such astreating your family EQUALLY and not EXCLUDING gay people is just so much rubbish. You exclude your selves by acting so far outside what society sees as normal and healthy for our children to observe at a parade for example. \n \n Why must gays march as outlandish, flamboyant, and promiscuous freaks at the St. Patricks day Parade ?

If you don't know the answer to that, let me tell ya, It aint the Museums that draws them in. So if the homosexual agenda and lifestyle were allowed flow freely everywhere, wouldn't you turn the whole Country into the same pit of depravity that the already existing gay hotspots have become ?

And do the store owners care about the publics opinion ? Not on your life. We must respect and accept your extreme lifestyle but when you offend our sensibilities and expose our children to adult X rated gay porn in your store windows, your loving response is to tell us to move if we dont like it. Why the double standard matt ? Why can't gays be good and responsible neighbors who are also concerned about children if your community so sincerely wants to be main streamed into the rest of society ?

I just don't see how that's a sound argument. I mean, one could just as easily argue that we should outlaw staying celibate throughout one's life and make 'baby-making' mandatory, because if everyone adopted being celibate as a universal lifestyle, it would lead to the extinction of the human race in only one generation. So by your logic, staying single and not getting pregnant in one's lifetime is a self-destructive lifestyle that would lead to the end of humanity if adopted as universal.

If that were the case, then we might as well make legal anything that we know CAN'T lead to everyone adopting the behavior and that we know CAN'T lead to the society's destruction.

I don't even think YOU are abnormal, but your lifestyle is abnormal Matt. It is an excercise of lustful expression that leads to no longterm benefit to humanity at all.

After, and since 9/11/01 I have stuck out like a sore thumb with my very arabic name of Ali ******. And what makes you think I would think owning human beings is normal and justified because whites are superior than blacks ? The whole concept you raise is ludicrous when applied to me. I do see from the minorities perspective, being one and all. And I know that all people were created equally by my God who loves us all equally, no matter what our lifestyle is, AND THAT INCLUDES YOU AND ALL GAY PEOPLE MATT, NO MATTER HOW YOU TRY TO DEMONIZE AND LIE ABOUT WHAT I STAND FOR AND BELIEVE. \n \n \nIt is attitudes such as the one you are displaying is stopping me from being viewed as normal, and natural.

Yet all these things are currently on your agenda and the agenda or the reactionary, fundamentalist right.\n\n \n More lies Matt ? Why must you twist and change what I say in order to defend your position ? It is homosexuality that isn't normal, not you. You can fit into society just fine but your lifestyle is destructive to you and all who participate in it. And you are taking something from me by normalizing the gay attitudes and lifestyle. Just as I showed here in this link which you conveniently ignored. \n http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la...home-headlines\n \n The gay community has shown far too many times that as soon as they get a foothold into traditional society, they will corrupt it and never respect the bounds that decent people want to live within. They will put their perferse lifestyle out there and tell everyone else if you don't like it then move, just as they do and did in the Castro districe in San Fran. But if we tell the gay community the same thing, that we don't want you infecting our children and communities, all of a sudden we're privelaged, bigots, haters and homophobic, when all we want is to not raise our children or be exposed to the depraved lifestyle you participate in. \n \n \nWhen you as a christian actively support laws that deny freedom to others beacuse of your religious beliefs you are in the wrong and yes you are the enemy of free choice since you are stopping others from doing something you view as wrong. Because you view them wrong for yourself that does not mean they are wrong for everyone. When you support laws that take other peoples choices away because of your beliefs this makes you wrong. You must extend the same acceptence you enjoy to others.\n\n \n Before you attempt to marginalize christians and turn us into the great roadblock of freedom, let's correct your flawed example. In the 2004 election cycle, 13 States had the Gay Marriage initiative question on the ballot. In every State, the people voted against Gay Marriage. Now these were the people of the State, not the churches or Christians only whose votes were counted. And to further my aregument, right now in Massachussets the DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE along with their DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR is breaking the law as established in the State Constitution and refusing to allow the people of Mass to vote on the Gay Marriage issue in favor of the Legislature pushing it through under cover of darkness in the middle of the night. If the Gay Lobby is so confident that the people, and not just the Religious Right will support their efforts then why break the law to win ? Why not trust the vote and support of the people ?\n \n As to supporting laws that take others rights away, I haven't and wouldn't do that. You have a right to marry a woman just as I do. You have a right to human and civil protections against violent attacks just as I do, You have a right to work, live where you want to, buy a house where you want to, travel where you want to, shop where you want to, dine where you want to, go anywhere you want to just like me and black people, hispanics and asians. What you don't have the right to are extra special exemptions that go beyond what the rest of us have a right to. And that is as it should be.\n \n Your greivance is that we aren't reshaping all of society to satisfy your unnatural desires and lifestyle and I will fight to defend the status quo untill I cease to live given the defined circumstances outlined here.\n \n \n \n \nI gaurentee that if christian groups just kept to themselves and stopped all thier meddeling into politics, and pushing their moral agendas onto the lives of others, the reactions against christians would stop. Alass they can not they must make everyone live by their moral, repressed standard. Jesus commands you to treat others as you would have them treat you. So I ask again is the way you are treating and excluding gay people the way you would want gay people to treat you?\n\n \n You realise how easilly I could parrot this back to you and it would apply perfectly don't you ? But I wont do that. I will say though that if the gay community would just slink away and quietly blend into society, and not ask us to accept your lifestyle as normal then many of these conflicts would dissipate into nothingness. But the reality is that just as your side is pushing as hard as you can to normalize the gay lifestyle, my side will continue to fight against the hijacking of our Civilization by your unnatural perversions that are practiced as if they are good for society when they lead to death, personal pain, disease and misery in the end for those who participate in the lifestyle.\n \n And I'll bet you could write a book of the personal stories of gay guys you have known and the emotional and psychological traumas they have suffered because of this lifestyle. The guilt and self condemnation they suffered from wasn't caused by those who reject them but by the deep set guilt that comes from within each person who is convicted of the wrongs they do. Just as the adulterer who feels tremendous guilt for fornicating outside of marriage. It is the same guilt for different reasons. One Gay, one Straight. So don't blame society or Christians for the guilt and pain suffered by being in rebellion to the natural laws that guide us if we are to be in balance with what is healthy and right in this World. \n \n \nI do not consider any sexual activity, even done in the open, between consenting adults morally wrong at all.\n\n \n Which is why I used the term reprobate to define your lifestyle in a post above. Did you bother looking the word up ? Because you define it.",

   " I don't even think YOU are abnormal, but your lifestyle is abnormal Matt. It is an excercise of lustful expression that leads to no longterm benefit to humanity at all. I'm sorry if that truth hurts you, but it's the truth none the less.\n\n \n This \"truth\" is merely your opinion. You are entitled to misuided opinions, of course, but just calling it the truth doesn't make it so. Could a longterm benefit to society be happy, adjusted people who are then able to be productive members of society?\n \n \n \n \n It is homosexuality that isn't normal, not you. You can fit into society just fine but your lifestyle is destructive to you and all who participate in it. And you are taking something from me by normalizing the gay attitudes and lifestyle. Just as I showed here in this link which you conveniently ignored. \n http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la...home-headlines\n\n \n Couldn't get the link to work. There is no evidence that homosexuality is destructive to all who participate in it. That is your opinion. \n \n \n \n \n The gay community has shown far too many times that as soon as they get a foothold into traditional society, they will corrupt it and never respect the bounds that decent people want to live within. They will put their perferse lifestyle out there and tell everyone else if you don't like it then move, just as they do and did in the Castro districe in San Fran. \n\n \n The Castro district is a highly desirable area of SF. Straight people would love to be able to move there and often do, because the gay community has transformed it. I am not saying that having the homos move in necessarily does anything to real estate in general (or anything else), but your example is dead wrong. Have you ever been there? Or this just another cliche example that you are parroting?\n \n \n I will fight to defend the status quo untill I cease to live given the defined circumstances outlined here.\n\n \n The status quo is that gay people exist. Always have and always will. They are not a threat to anyone. The only example of a threat that you have been able to muster is the ludicrous idea that if 100% of society became gay that procreation would stop. That's too silly to even comment on. \n \n \n \n \n \n And I'll bet you could write a book of the personal stories of gay guys you have known and the emotional and psychological traumas they have suffered because of this lifestyle. The guilt and self condemnation they suffered from wasn't caused by those who reject them but by the deep set guilt that comes from within each person who is convicted of the wrongs they do. \n\n \n Again. Only your opinion. Every psychological study done shows that homosexuals have no more or less psychological impairment than anyone else. The extent that they do often stems from the externally applied scorn they experience from people like you. People who form opinions about others based on subjective, unsubstantiated feelings. That is the very definition of prejudice, to form opinions on an unknown individual based on preconceived ideas. \n \n I don't know where you get these ideas, but they are not based in fact. I am quite certain you have no gays friends, or these delusional ideas would evaportate.",

By indoctrinating the young in school, they assure the next generation will be as pliable as clay to shape into Godless puppets as are being represented here by you defenders of this unnatural lifestyle. \n \n The \"Dirty Dozen\" Checklist: Does Your School Promote Homosexuality?\n \n \n \n For concerned students, parents and communities\n \n -------------------------------------------\n \n The activities and policies below may sound nice, but in reality protect and promote homosexuality and sexual promiscuity, putting students directly in harm's way instead of cautioning them about risky behavior.\n \n Is your school jumping on this foolish bandwagon?\n \n \n 1.__ A \"safe schools\" non-harassment program\n \n Assumption: Claims that students involved in homosexuality need to be protected because they are at higher risk for harassment and violence.\n \n Problems: Protects dangerous behavior and silences those who believe homosexuality is wrong. Assumes that some students are naturally homosexual, and that it is not risky behavior. Also assumes that these students need special safeguards not extended to other students, and that a well-enforced, equitable non-harassment policy is insufficient.\n \n Result: The behavior of homosexuality becomes essentially endorsed by the school, because it protects the option for any student to engage in it. Ends up labeling anyone who objects to homosexuality as a potential \"harasser.\"\n \n \n 2.__ A homosexual student club\n \n Assumption: That students involved in homosexuality are a self-contained minority who need higher self-esteem and greater comfort with homosexual behavior. \n \n Problems: Establishes adult/community support for participation in homosexuality with all its known risks. Ironically, in most schools, HIV educational programs about the risks of this behavior are fully supported. A club provides a venue where students curious about this behavior, but who have not yet engaged in it, can readily meet students and even adult advisors to begin homosexual relationships-with school support! With the emphasis on homophobia, these clubs become breeding grounds for hostility, where bigoted attitudes are nurtured against anyone who objects to homosexual behavior, objections which can save a student's life.\n \n Results: Communities and families become divided on this basic issue, and student lives and welfare are put at extreme risk based on misinformation.\n \n \n 3._Non-discrimination policy based on \"sexual orientation\"\n \n Assumption: That people practicing homosexual behavior are a minority group different from other people. Also, that they are in need of special protection based on homosexuality.\n \n Problems: Underlying message is that homosexuality is acceptable in the school environment for anyone who wants to engage in it. Ends up labeling all objections to homosexuality as problematic, rather than the dangerous, immoral behavior itself. Homosexual practices can and do change over time.\n \n Results: Students and teachers who want to engage in homosexuality, bisexuality etc. are protected in doing so, and in expressing this to others in the school system. This in essence becomes an endorsement of a behavior which should actually be discouraged.\n \n 4.__ Programs to stop \"homophobia,\" \"hate\" or \"bias\"\n \n Assumptions: That there is something wrong with objecting to homosexuality. That homosexual behavior is a minority issue like racial status. Any objections to homosexual behavior are said to originate from \"hate\" and are connected to violence against homosexuals. Such programs also claim there is no difference between expressed hatred of homosexuals and commonplace moral objections.\n \n Problems: Puts those who object to homosexuality for any reason on the defensive. Causes those who have objections to remain silent, leaving an open field for radical student, teacher or outside groups to define \"hate\" and discrimination however they wish. Flies in the face of freedom of religion, freedom of association and freedom of speech. \n \n Examples: 1) GLSEN (radical homosexual activist group) teaching manual, \"Tackling Gay Issues in School,\" which focuses on non-respectful tactics to silence all objections to the full expression of homosexuality. It also encourages student experimentation.\n \n 2) Programs about \"differences\" and \"diversity\" which usually combine positive values like acceptance of racial differences, with dangerous acceptance of homosexual lifestyles. AT&T's program \"Opening the Doors to Diversity: Voices from the Middle School\" is one of these. 3)The Department of Justice also sponsors programs on reducing \"hate\" that make this same erroneous connection, as do the videos \"It's Elementary\" and \"That's a Family,\" and the play \"Cootie Shots.\"\n \n Results: Christians, conservatives and in fact, all supporters of traditional values are accused of \"hate.\" Instances of harassment are linked to those who would never commit such acts. Students are not warned about homosexuality, so more will experiment with this high-risk behavior.\n \n \n 5._Pro-homosexual literature added to curricula and libraries; \n pro-family material bypassed or discarded.\n \n Assumptions: That stories involving homosexuality, even if sexually graphic in nature, provide necessary \"support\" for students who \"are\" homosexual, and provide education for all students about the need to accept this lifestyle. Material supporting the traditional family is viewed as discriminatory.\n \n Problems: Dangerous misinformation is packaged as \"diversity\" and the content of much of the material for older students qualifies as obscenity.\n \n Examples: The following books have been the focus of parent objections in schools around the country.\n Elementary grades:\n My Two Uncles; The Duke Who Outlawed Jellybeans; Daddy's Roommate; Heather Has Two Mommies; One Dad, Two Dads, Brown Dad, Blue Dad\n \n Middle school and high school:\n Entries from a Hot Pink Notebook; Am I Blue?; Annie on My Mind; Athletic Shorts; Becoming Visible; Who Framed Lorenzo Garcia?; Tommy Stands Alone; Two Teenagers in Twenty; Invisible Life; Just As I Am; This Too Shall Pass; Understanding Sexual Identity; A History of Western Society (textbook)\n \n 6._AIDS and \"safe sex\" education programs\n \n Assumptions: That all students are at risk of AIDS; that all students need to be taught about use of condoms for \"safe sex.\" Acceptance of homosexuality is heavily encouraged in these programs. \n \n Problems: Only students engaging in homosexual encounters, anal sex, or using intravenous drugs are at high risk, so the graphic nature of such programs is unnecessary. Besides, condoms don't protect against HIV fully, or against other STDs well at all. The use of the term 'abstinence' is tossed around, but in the context of condom use, experimentation, not abstinence, is the take-away message students receive.\n \n Examples: \"Reducing the Risk of HIV and STD,\" \"Becoming a Responsible Teen,\" \"Be Proud !Be Responsible,\" and any program endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control or Planned Parenthood, both of which are committed to \"safe sex\" programs.\n \n Results: Students accept sexual permissiveness as the norm. Classroom activities and studies involving condom use, obtaining contraceptives, and the option of abortion fuel this trend. Marriage-free language and values also accelerate the likelihood of early sexual activity and ongoing irresponsibility.\n \n \n Other \"red-flags\" for community concern...\n \n 7.__Teachers/staff who are openly homosexual\n Not positive role models for students. Close student-teacher relationships are high-risk.\n \n 8._ Involvement in your school of radical pro-homosexual groups like\n GLSEN, PFLAG, & Lambda Legal Defense Fund\n These groups are well-funded and looking for fights. Any objectors will be subject to public disgrace.\n \n 9._Celebrating \"gay pride\" month or \"coming out\" day\n There is nothing to celebrate about encouraging kids to adopt dangerous sexual practices.\n \n 10._Exhibits/films on families headed by homosexuals\n Tries to put a conventional face on problem behavior.\n \n 11._ Students & parents with concerns being silenced\n Intimidation goes hand-in-hand with the expressed goal of \"ending homophobia.\"\n \n 12._ Teacher in-service meetings promoting diversity and complaining about \"homophobia\"\n Often required now by school systems, these programs foster attitudes of hostility toward tradition-minded parents, who are portrayed as trouble-makers.\n \n ----------------------- -------------------------\n How Does Your School Score?\n \n 8 - 12 = A signal that corruption is widespread and entrenched within the system. Look for heavy influence of radical homosexual groups, using attention-hungry teens, parents and teachers to front their issues. Sexual promiscuity is undoubtedly rising among students and teachers, and academics are likely to be suffering. Get the kids you care about out of this school now.\n \n 4 - 7 = This is a school under assault. The school board has been indoctrinated and the administration and staff probably has many open homosexuals. Parents can save this school only by massive re-education and some big changes at election time. \n \n 1 - 3 = Selected administrators and teachers are sympathetic to homosexuality, but there is obviously a core that retains common sense and high standards. Parent involvement will work to turn this school around. \n \n 0 = Low-risk for student endangerment. Indicates a school system that genuinely protects students, maintains high health standards and moral integrity, and keeps its focus on education, not social engineering.\n \n \n This checklist may be copied and duplicated in its entirety for your local use.\n \n Copyright 2000 Mission:America. \n \n http://www.missionamerica.com/agenda.php?articlenum=11",

Now leave America and take a look at Africa. AIDs as a GLOBAL epidemic is primarily a heterosexual problem.\n \n And thelmoose is right. HIV does not thrive in feces. Take a biology course.\n \n \nI don't have to. I have known gay teens and how torn and different they feel, and how they struggle with not feeling the same urges for girls as their other friends who have those natural desires during adolescence. That isn't social pressure they are feeling, it's innate understanding of what is natural and struggling with the fact that their urges are unnatural.\n\n \n I dare you anyway - just for giggles. If you are so damned sure - ask them. I knew gay teens, too. They tell a very different story. If you actually do know gay kids - I suspect they are in your church and its not really hard to see why they would then feel like #### about themselves. Good work there.\n \n \nNo it isn't.

   "Isn't it strange that AIDS was tracked directly back to the Gay Bath Houses in 1980 before HIV even had a name. Weird huh ? Now can you prove that forcing human fecal matter into lesions opened within the anal cavity as a result of anal sex isn't a contributing factor it transferring the HIV ?\n\n \n We've been through this long ago in this forum. Also, no one is saying anal sex doesn't transfer HIV. It can be tracked to a lot of situations, gay and straight. \n \n \nI don't have to. I have known gay teens and how torn and different they feel, and how they struggle with not feeling the same urges for girls as their other friends who have those natural desires during adolescence. That isn't social pressure they are feeling, it's innate understanding of what is natural and struggling with the fact that their urges are unnatural.\n\n \n I have a hard time believing any gay people open up to you this much, given your very negative attitude. How do you know? If there is so much inner struggle against one's being gay, being gay must be natural. However, I think you just meant to say being gay is evil. Well, okay, before I am accused of putting word in your mouth, you meant unnatural to indicate negativity, not literally unnatural, as humans, who are part of nature, have these gay feelings. You believe being straight is better than being gay.\n \n \nNo it isn't. Nobody is putting these kids down when they condemn themselves for feeling different, out of place and like they don't belong. They get this message when they watch TV, see movies and read magazines about the real world they live in every day.\n\n \n You just desribed a great deal of society. What message do you think it is giving; put downs, feeling that gays don't belong or are different? Don't you think we should be in a society where simply being different from the norm is not viewed negatively?\n \n \n By talking about these issues it helps them cope and deal with being different.\n\n \n Talking about it the way you do? I don't think so.\n \n \nBut by accepting the lifestyle as normal is to encourage a lifetime of emptiness and quiet desperation.\n\n \n Denying who you are, trying to be something you are not, makes you feel empty and desperate, not secure and fulfilled.\n \n \nYes, your ignorance specifically. You think that by accepting the gayness, you are evolved. When you are nothing more than a self destructive enabler. You don't even know the difference between accepting a homosexual into your life and accepting homosexuality into your life. I have and do accept gays in my life. I love them and care about and for them.\n\n \n Lip service. No, you don't care about or love gays. You hate gays for their gayness, and for everything you believe gays and their gayness represent in society. That's clear from your posts. \n \n \nBut I don't enable sin, I don't support it nor do I encourage it.\n\n \n This is so tiresome. The fact that you say you are Christian, does not mean you are acting in a good, enlightened, loving or compassionate manner. It does not mean you are helping gays. Don't hide behind religion, or Christianity. What you are doing is propagating anti-gay hate.",

   "Just to show how whacked out the looky loos are when they come back and attack my responses but never respond to this ridiculous statement that has no basis in fact at all because I don't have an attitude of privilage, nor do I think I'm better than you, or gays in general. I don't even think YOU are abnormal, but your lifestyle is abnormal Matt. It is an excercise of lustful expression that leads to no longterm benefit to humanity at all. I'm sorry if that truth hurts you, but it's the truth none the less.\n\n \n Yes you do you think you \"lifestyle\" is better then gay peoples. Regardless of where it is leading it is still my choice and something you are opposed to and trying to take away by supporting anti gay laws and policies. Yet you do not see me, or any other gay person, out there opposing you or you choices\n \n\n For you to make that type of example and apply it to me shows just how little you know about me. I am a minority with a minorities name so I can't hide my minority status by blending in to society. After, and since 9/11/01 I have stuck out like a sore thumb with my very arabic name of Ali ******. And what makes you think I would think owning human beings is normal and justified because whites are superior than blacks ? The whole concept you raise is ludicrous when applied to me. I do see from the minorities perspective, being one and all. And I know that all people were created equally by my God who loves us all equally, no matter what our lifestyle is, AND THAT INCLUDES YOU AND ALL GAY PEOPLE MATT, NO MATTER HOW YOU TRY TO DEMONIZE AND LIE ABOUT WHAT I STAND FOR AND BELIEVE. \n\n Appearently you did not read since I was not comparing race and sexuality. My point was to compare one privledge to another. I am glad then that you as a minority understand white privledge. Why can you then notsee heterosexual privledge. I as a white person understand what white privledge is so why as a heterosexual can you not understand what heterosexual privledge is? Knowing more, that you are part of a minority, makes me sad that you could be so cruel as not to see the injustice and that you do not have empathy. It makes me sad that you can not put yourself in someone elses shoes and treat others as you want to be treated.\n \n \n \n\n More lies Matt ? Why must you twist and change what I say in order to defend your position ? It is homosexuality that isn't normal, not you. You can fit into society just fine but your lifestyle is destructive to you and all who participate in it. And you are taking something from me by normalizing the gay attitudes and lifestyle. Just as I showed here in this link which you conveniently ignored. \n http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la...home-headlines\n My homosexuality is a part of me and not something that I should or could discard. So when you call homosexuality abnormal you are calling me as a person abnormal. You as a heterosexual believe that being heterosexal is normal and that being homosexual is not normal; that is a position of priveldge, to view some people as less then you, and that is the truth and I am sorry if it hurts.\n \n \n \n \n\n The gay community has shown far too many times that as soon as they get a foothold into traditional society, they will corrupt it and never respect the bounds that decent people want to live within. They will put their perferse lifestyle out there and tell everyone else if you don't like it then move, just as they do and did in the Castro districe in San Fran. But if we tell the gay community the same thing, that we don't want you infecting our children and communities, all of a sudden we're privelaged, bigots, haters and homophobic, when all we want is to not raise our children or be exposed to the depraved lifestyle you participate in. \n\n \n You want to take our choices away. You are those things, to gay people, if you view homosexuality as a sin and not equal heterosexuality. My freedom should not be suppressed because you made the choice to have children. It is you responsiblity to raise your children not mine and my freedoms should not be curtailed because you fail in that aspect.\n \n \n \n\n Before you attempt to marginalize christians and turn us into the great roadblock of freedom, let's correct your flawed example. In the 2004 election cycle, 13 States had the Gay Marriage initiative question on the ballot. In every State, the people voted against Gay Marriage. Now these were the people of the State, not the churches or Christians only whose votes were counted. And to further my aregument, right now in Massachussets the DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE along with their DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR is breaking the law as established in the State Constitution and refusing to allow the people of Mass to vote on the Gay Marriage issue in favor of the Legislature pushing it through under cover of darkness in the middle of the night. If the Gay Lobby is so confident that the people, and not just the Religious Right will support their efforts then why break the law to win ? Why not trust the vote and support of the people ?\n\n And every organization that put those amendments on the ballot where christian organizations. So yes christians are a road block to freedom because not one non christian organization is fighting gay marriage. I wouldn't crow too loudly because it will soon be the other way around and those same christian organizations will not be able to stop us at the ballot any more.\n \n \n \n \n\n As to supporting laws that take others rights away, I haven't and wouldn't do that. You have a right to marry a woman just as I do. You have a right to human and civil protections against violent attacks just as I do, You have a right to work, live where you want to, buy a house where you want to, travel where you want to, shop where you want to, dine where you want to, go anywhere you want to just like me and black people, hispanics and asians. What you don't have the right to are extra special exemptions that go beyond what the rest of us have a right to. And that is as it should be.\n \n Your greivance is that we aren't reshaping all of society to satisfy your unnatural desires and lifestyle and I will fight to defend the status quo untill I cease to live given the defined circumstances outlined here.\n You get to marry the person of your choice, I do not. I could be fired from my job tomorrow because I am gay and you as a hetero could not. I could still be beaten to death because I am gay.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n You realise how easilly I could parrot this back to you and it would apply perfectly don't you ? But I wont do that. I will say though that if the gay community would just slink away and quietly blend into society, and not ask us to accept your lifestyle as normal then many of these conflicts would dissipate into nothingness. But the reality is that just as your side is pushing as hard as you can to normalize the gay lifestyle, my side will continue to fight against the hijacking of our Civilization by your unnatural perversions that are practiced as if they are good for society when they lead to death, personal pain, disease and misery in the end for those who participate in the lifestyle.\n \n Your beliefs should not be the basis for my life. Because you believe something is unnatural does not make it so. Once again you are only trying to protect you privledge. When you use the words hijack, and unnatural preversions. You do not want gay people to exist or at least from your statement be visable.\n \n\n And I'll bet you could write a book of the personal stories of gay guys you have known and the emotional and psychological traumas they have suffered because of this lifestyle. The guilt and self condemnation they suffered from wasn't caused by those who reject them but by the deep set guilt that comes from within each person who is convicted of the wrongs they do. Just as the adulterer who feels tremendous guilt for fornicating outside of marriage. It is the same guilt for different reasons. One Gay, one Straight. So don't blame society or Christians for the guilt and pain suffered by being in rebellion to the natural laws that guide us if we are to be in balance with what is healthy and right in this World. \n We suffer because of :xcensored comming from the religious right,http://www.hatecrime.org/subpages/hatespeech/hate.html who make gay people feel sub human because of who they are. I have to say you have been a classic example for your religions views.\n \n \n \n\n Which is why I used the term reprobate to define your lifestyle in a post above. Did you bother looking the word up ? Because you define it.\n\n \n So because I don't attach shame and guilt too but celebrate sexuality I am a reprobate?",

You as a heterosexual believe that being heterosexal is normal and that being homosexual is not normal; that is a position of priveldge, to view some people as less then you, and that is the truth and I am sorry if it hurts.\n \n Now this argument has traction. There is much hullabaloo about whether homosexuality is genetic or a \"choice.\" Personally, I think the choice argument is bunk. I don't recall the point in my life where I chose heterosexuality. If you accept that homosexuality is genetic, than parallels to the race question are indeed compelling.\n \n On the other hand, the genetic question raises another question: Is homosexuality a BEHAVIOR, or an IDENTITY. Matthew posits that it is an identity. It is his defining characteristic and he could not make himself less homosexual. Unlike race; however, homosexuality is not a trait that can be readily observed as the individual goes about his daily life. \n \n But homosexuality is not the only trait that has a genetic link. Alcoholism has a strong genetic link as well. I am a raging alcoholic. Hell, I am probably in the top 10 nationally. You know you are an alcoholic when you receive a personal thank you from Mr. Gallo. But the question is: am I an ALCOHOLIC? Is what I am as a person defined by my behavior, be it rooted in genetics or no? Is alcoholism, that behavior that rules me and threatens to define me what I AM, or a behavior I engage in willingly or no. Am I an alcoholic only when drinking or at all times of my life? Do laws against public intoxication unfairly target me and my lifestyle? Does the religious right hate ME or my behavior? If I choose to be intoxicated, why should the society that values sobriety have the right to tell me what to do? Why do I have to hide my identity at work? ####, I forgot if I was agreeing with Matthew or disagreeing...Oh well, Cheers! \n \n Normality is a funny thing. If you take 100 people, perchance 10 will be considered abnormal for one reason or another. The remaining 90 may then look about and realize another 10 that do not believe as they do. Reduced thus to 80, surely someone may be found who does not subscribe to the same social habits. And so we may go down the ever dwindling normality population casting out poor haircuts, loud music, low slung pants and piercings until the only normal person left is me. But I have doubts about myself as well...\n \n You get to marry the person of your choice, I do not. I could be fired from my job tomorrow because I am gay and you as a hetero could not. I could still be beaten to death because I am gay.\n \n I could be fired for being an alcoholic. My office has a strict policy on such things, so I feel your pain. If you WERE beaten to death, your assailant could be convicted of a hate crime and sent away for longer than if he had beaten a heterosexual, or an alcoholic for that matter.

   "Former Christian Right Homophobe Sees the Error of His Ways\n \n An interesting interview with a former AFA board member Joe Murray at Pam's House Blend.\n\n \n Here's the interview Sam was referring to: http://www.alternet.org/sex/49912/ \n \n Excerpt:\nAfter adopting the AFA party line for some time, something in the back of my head kept tearing away at my conscience. How could AFA, an earthly organization, declare the divine intention of God and condemn the souls of homosexuals? How was it that men could make the declaration of who was getting into Heaven, and who was getting the one-way ticket to Hades?\n \n I thought who are these people to say who is getting into Heaven and who is not? I thought of the story of Joan of Arc, who, when she was being burnt at the stake, was asked the question of whether she would go to Heaven.\n \n Her response? \"If I am not, may it please God to put me in it; if I am, may it please God to keep me there.\" In other words, it is God, not man, who decides who gets to pass through the gates of Heaven. So, how could groups like AFA even hint that gays were doomed to hell? This smacked of the politics of man, not the divine mercy of God.\n \n Then there was the fact that the gay issue had become over simplified -- a sure sign that some facts were missing. Where was the Biblical authority for the condemnation that all homosexuals were to bury in the fires of Hell? In order to answer that question, I decided to take an in depth study of the Bible to determine if what these conservative theologians were preaching was sound.\n \n As I studied the Bible, I found that the word \"sodomite\" that was used in Corinthians and Romans referred not to all homosexuals, but largely to the promiscuous behavior of the Roman/Greek bathhouses and the use of boy prostitutes.\n \n Take for instance, 1 Cor. 6:9-10, a verse commonly referred to support the argument that all forms of homosexuality are immoral. As I understand it, the Greek word translated as \"boy prostitutes\" may refer to catamites, i.e., the boys or young men kept for purposes of prostitution and the term translated for \"sodomites\" refers to all homosexual males who engaged in such practices with such boys. In other words, the condemnation of homosexuality in that passage, thus, refers only to homosexual males who engage the services of boy prostitutes -- it is a very narrow definition.\n \n To argue that this verse condemns all homosexuality ignores the true meaning of the words used. Rather than embrace the true meaning of the words and explore the possibility that some homosexual conduct may be permissible, such as that between two consenting adults, fundamentalists have opted to hijack this verse and fill in the gaps with the wisdom of the world. In other words, the definition was not as broad as many fundamentalists would argue, thus it left a huge opening as to whether gays in a committed relationship would be damned to hell.\n \n How could preachers preach such vehement messages towards gays when it was clear that the Bible was unclear at best, and silent at worse, on the issue? Why recklessly condemn a group of individuals? Why fixate on them when your congregation is knee-deep in divorce (Jesus had some pretty clear words on that issue)? And as for gluttony, how can preachers lecture gays on restraint, when churches host pot luck dinner after pot luck dinner, and not be deemed hypocritical?\n \n It was this hypocrisy that caused me to open my eyes. Those on the Christian right, for whatever reasons, have become fixated on homosexuality. They are obsessed by it and perverse form of vengeance appears to be fueling their inquisition. I may be wrong, but I think actions are speaking much louder than words here.\n \n The whole gay issue is no longer about the quest for the Truth; it is about fear and loathing. It is about shame and sorrow. It is anything but Christian.\n \n And if a person's sexual disposition is determined by birth, how can it be that these folks were created merely to be cast into Hell? The fundamentalist explanation makes no sense, but the view that only some homosexual behavior (see the verbiage used in Corinthians, etc.), and not all gays, is immoral does make sense.\n \n Thus was my evolution. I may not be right, but I think the Christian community must explore these issues openly and honestly if they are truly to remain Christian. We have an obligation to explore these issues and be open to the fact that the modern view on homosexuality may be wrong.\n \n While many on the right will argue I am soft on the issue and playing with souls, I believe that failure to seek the Truth and understand the Gospel is a worse sin. God gave us minds to exercise them, not be spoon fed information. I truly believe that if people actively seek the Truth, they will end up in the right place, but those who fail to embark on the journey will remain forever lost in the wilderness.\n",

   "QUOTE=Archangel;255846]Then tell me genius, in what way does men screwing other men up the anal cavity benefit humanity ? \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I am certain that it benefits society in the same way that men screwing women up the anal cavity does. What is your point? \n As heterosexual intercourse continues to crowd an already maxed out planet, please tell me how creating children that are born to die of starvation and/or neglect benefit humanity. Worry about the sexual activity that your god approves of, and feed the children born into starvation, as a result of that approved sexual activity. The same gay people you criticize are willing to feed and adopt these starving children, but your god would not approve of sending an innocent child into such a perverse environment. It's better that they starve. \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel: \n How do the diseases caused and passed on through such activity benefit humanity ? \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n The same way any disease benefits humanity. Diseases are not caused by gay sex or straight sex. They are also not passed on through gay or straight sex. They are passed on through unprotected sex.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n How does the guilt and self loathing experienced by young men who feel inadequate, and like freaks because they aren't attracted to women like all the other men they know in Society benefit humanity ? \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Of all the gay men I have known, the only cases of guilt, self loathing, etc I know of are a result of failed marriages and relationships to women. The fact that they used a woman to give the illusion that they were like most other men in society.\n The pressure of society to conform has made terrible victims of the unsuspecting women who marry these men. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n How does the high suicide rate among gay teens from this unreconciled guilt benefit humanity ? And how is that my religion talking and not just plain old common sense ?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n . When relgion starts talking we are informed that a supreme being that YOU chose to believe made a woman called Eve from a rib bone of a man called Adam, who he formed from mud. Common sense tells us that people are not created through such means.\n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n And why are you supposedly wise, loving and accepting people of the World not concerned and sensitive to these very real downsides and consequences of this destructive lifestyle if you are TRULY so concerned and accepting of Gays ? \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n A destructive lifestyle is a destructive lifestyle, it is not a gay lifestyle. There is no such thing as a gay lifesyle per say. People who are gay have \"lives\". People who are straight have \"lives\" Gay people find seek romance with members of the same sex. Straight people seek romance with members of the opposite sex. Some gay people are honest and hard working, some are lazy thieves. Ditto for straight folk. It doesn't get complicated until YOU start judging people based on a book YOU have read, that YOU believe to be the word of the god that YOU just happen to believe in. Life is not all about YOU. \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Why is only this hateful and bigoted Christian recognizing these negative consequences and sensitive enough to be actually concerned about the suffering they endure enough to raise and discuss these issues ? \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n If you are truly concerned about the sufferring that some gay people possibly endure, then leave them alone. Your mindset is what causes the pain, not their sexual orientation.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n like I said before, flaming ignorant hypocrites who can't see past your twisted perspective as you encourage those you claim to love and support right into the destructive lifestyle they're heading toward.[/QUOTE]\n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n You speak with such conviction about that which you know nothing of. Sexual orientation has nothing to do with leading a destructive life. If that were the case we would have to declare the lifestyles of heterosexuals destructive as well. Heterosexuals tend to reproduce as a result of their sex acts. They create the nexy generation of murderers, thieves, liars, atheists, and last but not least..................homosexuals. It is only heterosexuals who are able to understand the sanctity of marriage, but it takes second place to the sanctity of divorce. It is only heterosexuals that understand the sanctity of second third, and fourth marriages as well. Despite the facts, I still support and encourage heterosexuals to live their lives as they see fit. When I have enough time to harass and degrade a group of people based on my opinions, I have entirely too much time.",

Look at all of the Great Civilization that have preceeded us and you will see that just prior to their collapse, they fell into sexual immorality, greed, hedonism and just all around sinful depraved existances. \n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n If I am wrong about gay rights then I must be wrong about your freedom to be a Christian. \"What one does affects us all.\" That is complete and utter hogwash. Is that why one man goes to a synagogue and one man goes to a church, and a third man doesn't attend either? \n \n \n Archangel:\n My moral problem with Gays has nothing to to with feeling better than they are or refusing to fellowship with them. Why can't you people understand that my concern for gays is based in love and not hate or contempt for them, but for the lifestyle.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Gay people have lives, just like everybody else. Your contempt for their lives is your misfortune not theirs. Do you have any idea that your beliefs disgust other people? It's a two way street pal. People put up with you just as you put up with them. No special perks for morality crusaders.\n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Just as I would warn a friend who cheated on his wife like it was a sport, so must I warn a Gay that his lifestyle will only lead to death and despair in the end. If this bothers you then tough, because my right to speak the truth isn't determined by your right to listen.\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I have already told you that in a previous post. And what you speak has nothing to do with truth. It has to do with what you believe to be true. That is not the same thing.\n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n Again, we rise or fall together as a people. Our National Morality is a factor in our very survival. \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Until you learn what it means to be polite and respectful to your fellow citizens, how dare you speak of national morality. The basis for morality is treating others as you would like to be treated. It is not the regulation of peoples sex lives. That is really a perverted obsession. You invest time and energy into the sex lives of gay men. You have described what it is (you think) they do. You have exposed it and attached labels to it. I cannot help but wonder why a staight man would wallow in such mud? I have never wondered what straight people or lesbians or even other gay men do with one another,,,,let alone make judgement calls on it. Who is the deviant here? The homosexuals having sex together, or you, the heterosexual describing what your imagination has created an image of? No matter what your intentions are, you need to stay out of people's bedrooms. \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n You people are too ignorant to not be able to see that the Islam you defend against Bush hates us in part because of this very issue, in addition to the way our women dress and our sexual immoralty and depravity. \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n I have never defended terrorists, but I have defended Islam, as I would Christianity if it were under unjust attack. If we did not bully and take advantage of those people like we have for some 75 years or more, they would have no problem with the way our women dress. And if they do have a problem with it now, what do you propose our women do? \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel:\n They call us infidels because of our sexual morrays, but you think it's just a personal choice that effects nobody else at all. Talk about being asleep at the wheel ?\n\n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n What is the term they use for people like you who deny \"Allah\" and declare Jesus Christ the one true god. Your personal choice to be a Christian makes infidels and sexual deviants look like Mary Poppins in comparison. Try to refrain from calling other people ignorant until you can at least see your own. As long as I remain a human being, my ignorance will always be by my side. It's when I start believing it's no longer there is when I loose my perspective on life.",

   "State should give gay couples equal rights\n \n Monitor staff\n April 01. 2007 10:00AM\n \n O\n n Wednesday, the House will be asked to right a historic wrong by approving civil unions granting same-sex couples all the state rights enjoyed by heterosexual couples. It should do so resoundingly. It is antithetical to freedom to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n \n That said, the Senate should not pass the bill in haste but give civil unions a full public hearing. It would serve no one's interest, least of all the gay couples who would benefit from the change, if opponents believe they have been railroaded. If the Senate passes the bill after ample discussion, Gov. John Lynch should affirm the importance of equal rights for all by signing it.\n\n \n Could you actually post an argument.

Maybe youneed to find something to do with your lives other than insult and poke sticks in other peoples eyes. \n \n So what would you like to discuss about gay rights?\n\n \n WOW! Just how old are you? Take another look back at the arguments that have been posted here. There are many that I disagree with but they are still arguments. So far you have posted not one single argument.\n \n Here is an excellent argument from EMutz:\n \nMy homosexuality is a part of me and not something that I should or could discard. So when you call homosexuality abnormal you are calling me as a person abnormal. You as a heterosexual believe that being heterosexal is normal and that being homosexual is not normal; that is a position of priveldge, to view some people as less then you, and that is the truth and I am sorry if it hurts.\n \n\n Now this argument has traction. There is much hullabaloo about whether homosexuality is genetic or a \"choice.\" Personally, I think the choice argument is bunk. I don't recall the point in my life where I chose heterosexuality. If you accept that homosexuality is genetic, than parallels to the race question are indeed compelling.\n \n On the other hand, the genetic question raises another question: Is homosexuality a BEHAVIOR, or an IDENTITY. Matthew posits that it is an identity. It is his defining characteristic and he could not make himself less homosexual. Unlike race; however, homosexuality is not a trait that can be readily observed as the individual goes about his daily life. \n \n But homosexuality is not the only trait that has a genetic link. Alcoholism has a strong genetic link as well. I am a raging alcoholic. Hell, I am probably in the top 10 nationally. You know you are an alcoholic when you receive a personal thank you from Mr. Gallo. But the question is: am I an ALCOHOLIC? Is what I am as a person defined by my behavior, be it rooted in genetics or no? Is alcoholism, that behavior that rules me and threatens to define me what I AM, or a behavior I engage in willingly or no. Am I an alcoholic only when drinking or at all times of my life? Do laws against public intoxication unfairly target me and my lifestyle? Does the religious right hate ME or my behavior? If I choose to be intoxicated, why should the society that values sobriety have the right to tell me what to do? Why do I have to hide my identity at work? ####, I forgot if I was agreeing with Matthew or disagreeing...Oh well, Cheers! \n \n Normality is a funny thing. If you take 100 people, perchance 10 will be considered abnormal for one reason or another. The remaining 90 may then look about and realize another 10 that do not believe as they do. Reduced thus to 80, surely someone may be found who does not subscribe to the same social habits. And so we may go down the ever dwindling normality population casting out poor haircuts, loud music, low slung pants and piercings until the only normal person left is me. But I have doubts about myself as well...\n \n \nYou get to marry the person of your choice, I do not. I could be fired from my job tomorrow because I am gay and you as a hetero could not. I could still be beaten to death because I am gay.\n \n\n I could be fired for being an alcoholic. My office has a strict policy on such things, so I feel your pain. If you WERE beaten to death, your assailant could be convicted of a hate crime and sent away for longer than if he had beaten a heterosexual, or an alcoholic for that matter. Wait a minute...That seems a bit...unequal...\n \n\n \n I have included the actual arguments he was replying to. He gives analysis, logic, his personal opinion stated as his personal opinion instead of as evidence, in short a perfectly legitimate and nicely crafted argument. Perhaps, sam, you could respond accordingly, with a similar argument instead of accusing everyone of being \"mean angry people\".\n \n You actually start the vestiges of an argument with:\nI was raised Christian, and always admired a religion that taught forgiveness, love, compassion, charity, and treating your neighbor the way you would like to be treated. I also loved the words of a man who believed that judment was God's, and clearly not ours.\n \n How sad to see the hi-jacking of this lovely religion by a depraved band of people who hate in the name of Jesus - who judge others in the name of Christianity - who show no compassion, no love, no understanding. They practice a capitalist brand of Christianity: I've got mine, and that's all that matters. \"My God doesn't like Your love - so you are evil! You get nothing. Your love means nothing!\" they cry.\n \n Last I checked, I saw no prohibitions against homosexuality in the 10 Commandments, nor in the words of Jesus.\n \n It makes me wonder if most of these so-called Christians truly understand that book from which they quote.\n \n\n \n But it is just a slam on a group of people with whom you disagree. I agree that christianity is a religion of love. I do not agree that there is nothing in the bible about homosexuality. I note that you limited it to the words of Jesus and the 10 commandments. However that is not a legitimate use of that material as it eliminates more than 90% of the context from which those things are taken. Ignoring the context is a poor method of interpretation and will always lead to missing the point.\n \n Nowhere does the bible say that christians should hate homosexuals, but the letters of Paul make it clear that homosexuality is not a behavior that comes from trusting God. He equates it with other behaviors such as lying and stealing. The bible says that theives and liers are to be loved too. My understanding of it is that people are to be loved. Those items the bible speaks against, it declares as harmful to people and therefore should be hated because of what it does to a person and their relationship with God. The bible makes that relationship paramount, over all others (You shall have no other Gods before me).\n \n I tend to agree that homosexuality is an identity. However the same can be said to be true of alcoholism and other things that are harmful to a person so claiming it as an identity does not necessarily mean that it is good. The issue is what is good for the person and what is not. All else is irrelevant.\n \n \n Now, likely as not you will say that I am attacking homosexuals because you don't seem to be able to look at things objectively. If you are able to do that, go after my analysis and not me. I invite your debate samiinh.",

I don't think so.\n\n \n In the first place, I do not have a god or church. Again you attack me not my arguments. I did not say it was an attribute like alcoholism. I merely pointed out that just claiming it as an identity does not make it good or right. It is an illogical argument. I am arguing about the logic not equating the two. I said that the bible equated it with lying and stealing as it places something else in the place of God. That is all. You misstate my contentions and then you attack me, just as I predicted. However, at least this is an attempt at argumentation. Please continue with your analysis.\n \n In the second place, I don't think I took a position on whether or not it was good or bad. I simply went after the argument that Jesus does not say it is bad and the ten commandments do not say it. Your argument is illogical and I pointed out the whys of that.\n \n ShadowPikachu: I did not take a personal position as I do not desire to argue my personal viewpoints.

It seems to not serve an evolutionary purpose in that it cannot lead to reproduction. It does not seem to serve a \"moral\" (for lack of a better term) purpose as it models a \"gender role\" confusion to children whose identities are still up for grabs at a young age.\n \n NOw, that says nothing about a persons ability to love a person of the same sex. The biggest problem I have is when we start defining love in terms of sexuality. That realllllllllllllllllly blurs things. I would definitiely avoid that. Much of the gay community SEEMS to define themselves by who they want to have sex with. I do not identify myself, primarily, as heterosexual.

We are not defining love in terms of sexuality, but in terms of commitment.\n\n \n Hello Davenport and welcome. I note that you define your \"relationship\" as homosexual and not YOURSELF, primarily anyway. I would say that is a good thing. When we start defining ourselves by one attribute then I think we are truly missing the boat.\n \n Your question is a difficult one for me. How do you define \"value\". That is a very philosophical concept and has many meanings to many people. Commitment to another person is a good thing except when that becomes \"codependent\", then it is bad. You are now equating love and marriage and I do not see those as equivalent either. Love is a committment to the best interests of another regardless of the cost (at least that is my best definition). Marriage, in my humble opinion, has largely been a \"religious\" function. Not sure why folks who are gay even WANT a part in such things. It has gotten skewed in the states as it was co-opted by government. In ancient times when the governments were religious in nature, that made sense. The US government is largely secular, at least from reading the constitution, and therefore, in my opinion should opt out of the marriage thing all together. I think there should be no marriage penalty tax, no licensing fees (although I do think bloodtests and associated fees are acceptable for protection against genetic inbreeding as that leads to genetic drift which is essentially bad for the species) and no involvement one way or the other by governments.\n \n The problem comes in sharing property etc and with divorce. In my opinion (once again) that is already dealt with through civil contracts for homosexual and heterosexual couples.\n \n Government incentivizes marriage to some degree to promote reproduction in the population. I think, currently in US society, a change in policy nationally to include homosexual couples could lead to an enormous burden on business as they try to cope with the sudden influx of health expense coverages which is already taxing business nationally due to rising insurance costs. \n \n Additionally, this is an area that has been historically left to the states as part of the separation of powers. A national law would not likely pass the constitutional test and a constitutional amendment would not pass at this point in time. Not that it should not be considered, but the current evidence is that society will not generally accept it.\n \n My opinions about it are more pragmatic and have little to do with morality. As I said before, people who are gay, are people AND being gay is irrelevant as far as how I relate to them (aside from the obvious, that I am not gayemoticon_xangel ).\n \n I hope this is helpful to you. And welcome again.\n \n Huck",

   " \n As to what is right and wrong where homosexuality is concerned, I am not sure I can say. It seems to not serve an evolutionary purpose in that it cannot lead to reproduction. It does not seem to serve a \"moral\" (for lack of a better term) purpose as it models a \"gender role\" confusion to children whose identities are still up for grabs at a young age.\n\n \n I am not sure what your criteria for right and wrong are, but the above are confused. \n \n I am not sure whether something has \"an evolutionary purpose\" makes it wrong or right, assuming you are referring to morally wrong or right. Even so, if the presence of homosexuality in a gene or meme pool serves some evolutionary advantage such that it is replicated, it may well have \"an evolutionary purpose.\" You also have a narrow definition of moral purpose. And your example is not correct. Homosexuality does not \"model gender role confusion\" whatever that is. First, gender identity is not the same as sexual identity. Second, we don't know how or when children adopt these various identities, likely it is at a very young age, but we do know that children \"exposed\" to homosexuality, such as those raised by same-sex parents are no more or less likely to be homosexual or have any kind of confusion, gender or otherwise, than any other kids.\n \n \n NOw, that says nothing about a persons ability to love a person of the same sex. The biggest problem I have is when we start defining love in terms of sexuality. That realllllllllllllllllly blurs things. I would definitiely avoid that. Much of the gay community SEEMS to define themselves by who they want to have sex with. I do not identify myself, primarily, as heterosexual. I certainly am that, but I do not have heterosexual pride day nor do I even bring up my sexual preference, ever (except in this one particular post). Now, I have little in the way of statistics to back this part up so it is just my opinion based on my limited experience and not for argumentation.\n \n\n \n I agree. We don't love in terms of sexuality. Love is love. Sexuality is sexuality. But when it comes to pairing up, you do it with those to whom you are sexually attracted. You can love your male friends, but you don't date or marry them. \n \n The gay community defines itself \"by who they want to have sex with\" only when you are talking about sexual identity, because that is the topic at hand. I have a sexual orientation and identity, but that is only one part of me. I find to relevant to talk about it when talking about sexual orientation; doesn't that make sense? It seems most frustrating to me that sex and aids and anuses is the only thing that many straight people think of when they ever think about gays (Archangel!)\n \n You most certainly do identify yourself as heterosexual. How could you not? It is tacit, you don't even ever have to think about it. Have you ever dated, do you wear a wedding ring, did you go to the prom, have you ever behave along the lines of customary boy/girl sexual identity roles???? You don't bring up your sexual identity nor do you have a hetero pride day because you don't have to. If you have never been taught to be ashamed of your sexual orientation, declaring yourself proud of it seems a little unnecessary.",

   "Thanks, Huck.\n \n Here are a few responses (well-tread ground, I'm sure)...\n \nThe US government is largely secular, at least from reading the constitution, and therefore, in my opinion should opt out of the marriage thing all together.\n Snip\n \n The problem comes in sharing property etc and with divorce. In my opinion (once again) that is already dealt with through civil contracts for homosexual and heterosexual couples. \n\n \n In an ideal world, I suppose that's true. However, civil contracts now (and not in a theoretical world) cannot match the over a thousand benefits a heterosexual couple gets from a simple marriage contract. Although my partner and I have a perfectly legal civil union here in Connecticut, there is no means of conveying these rights beyond these state lines. Also, the legal red tape one would have to cut through to assure that my husband and I are protected is insurmountable, and no guarantee that it would be honored in any number of courts.\n \n \nGovernment incentivizes marriage to some degree to promote reproduction in the population. I think, currently in US society, a change in policy nationally to include homosexual couples could lead to an enormous burden on business as they try to cope with the sudden influx of health expense coverages which is already taxing business nationally due to rising insurance costs. \n\n \n Although you might be right about the government incentivizing marriage to promote reproduction, reproduction is not a requirement of marriage. And if this is the case, then I could point to any number of gay parents with children.\n \n Furthermore, committed gay couples support heterosexual marriages by paying taxes - as do our insurance payments. Why should this be a burden on their marriages if it isn't an unfair burden on ours? After all, we pay the same taxes - for which we do not receive equal benefits.\n \n \nAdditionally, this is an area that has been historically left to the states as part of the separation of powers. A national law would not likely pass the constitutional test and a constitutional amendment would not pass at this point in time. Not that it should not be considered, but the current evidence is that society will not generally accept it.\n\n \n Hey, I'm all for that - as long as when I fill out that lovely little Income Tax form, I can check the married box and receive the same benefits as my childless sister and her husband. How's that sound?\n \n \nMy opinions about it are more pragmatic and have little to do with morality. \n Huck\n\n \n My opinions are pragmatic, too.

   "The Impact on Washington's Budget of\n Allowing Same-Sex Couples to Marry\n Introduction to the report by M.V. Lee Badgett, PhD\n by Demian\n \u00a9 June 17, 2006, Demian\n \n One of the complaints made by those wishing to stop legal marriage, is that it will cost too much, in terms of benefits and the like. This argument supposes that finances are more critical than allowing all citizens to be treated equally and have access to a most critical civil right.\n \n This report shows the likely financial scenario that the state would likely make enormous financial gains, once allowing legal marriage.\n \n The Report's Key Findings\n \n * Allowing same-sex couples to marry in Washington will boost the state budget by $3.9 million to $5.7 million annually.\n * Approximately 7,950 of Washington's same-sex couples will marry in the short term.\n * State expenditures on means-tested public benefits programs will fall.\n * State retail sales tax revenues will rise.\n * Any impact on estate tax revenue will be negligible.\n * Administrative cost increases will be minimal.\n * No increases in court system expenditures are likely to result.\n * Same-sex marriage will have no impact on property tax revenue.\n * The state will experience a minor decrease in real estate excise tax revenue.\n * The state will incur a slight increase in costs for state employee retirement benefits. \n \n This June 2006 report is in PDF format:\n \n The Impact on Washington's Budget of Allowing Same-Sex Couples to Marry\n \n The study is authored by:\n M.V.

   "There are a lot of different issues here. If you are talking simply about extending health benefits to workers with domestic partners, it is not clear of the financial impact. Insurers use actuarial data and there is not enough history to have clear answers. \n \n I think \"By and large they would increase costs significantly\" is not a statement that can be made with any kind of assurance. It also depends on what scale you are talking. Samiinh's info was looking at a larger, statewide perspective, versus the individual corporate perspective. \n \n If you place additional folks to the rolls of bene's, the costs will go up for that service. There does not appear to be an actuarially significant adverse medical risk to having homosexuals, per se, in the rolls, despite the concerns. Whenever you add any people who may have previously been uninsured, that is a higher risk than adding previously insured persons. Because the role of \"domestic partner\", which includes gay and straight, is not standardized, you run the risk of some fraud. On the other hand, I have known several uninsured single people who married purely for convenience to another person to get health benefits when a chronic illness struck. \n \n Even so, many companies have felt that is makes good business sense to offer this benefit. You cannot attract good employees without adequate benefits. Offering the proper benefits helps you to hire more productive workers, reduce turnover and absenteeism and improve worker satisfaction, all of which can be immensely profitable.\n \n None of this speaks to whether it is the right thing to do. Offering differential benefits to different employees is not fair. \n \n [As an aside, my business offers (after jumping through a bunch of hoops that I was glad to do) domestic partner benefits. My partner's insurance was lousy and a poor value. Unfortunately, the feds can't allow this as a deduction and I pay nearly a grand a year in taxes on that. We may be making a monetary mistake here.]",

   "Civil unions diminish marriage relationship\n Gary H. Cote, Epsom\n \n For the Monitor\n April 06. 2007 8:00AM\n \n U\n nderstanding that Gov. Lynch will probably soon be faced with an enormous decision, and that he desires to do what is right, I offer an opinion for his consideration regarding the civil union issue.\n \n Though many promote civil unions as raising the standard and extending freedom and privilege, it actually diminishes the marriage relationship. The civil union movement simply raises itself up by reducing the marriage covenant to be on par with its agenda and seeks the same rights assuming the same relationship exists. Any time one raises itself up by bringing another down, pride is central to its cause. The marriage relationship is certainly not the same as a civil union relationship, and could never be.\n \n Many could call the civil union vote noble, but there is nothing civil or noble about this union, as it promotes everything that wars against godliness and societal value. Think of the chaos in courts as each so-called union dissolves and property issues and children are distributed. And who do the children truly belong to since they are products of some other relationship? Lawsuits will abound!\n \n This movement, seeking the same rights as marriage, is actually looking for affirmation, acceptance and approval. They want a legal statement that confirms their lifestyle as though that makes it right before God and before the laws of natural man. Right can never be just what the people want, or what a few demand, or what some select leaders claim. True rightness is based solely in accordance with God's character, who will one day judge us all for what we have done or not done.\n \n With the utmost respect, I encourage the governor to deny this civil union bill and put an end to such decay within our state's moral and civil well-being.",

Now it's time to let others in. We've been paying your expenses all along; now it's our turn.\n\n \n \n Ah, there ye have it: The nature of the argument. Is marriage a right or a benefit? If the argument can clearly be made that marriage is a right, not a benefit conferred upon those who meet a statutory definition, then the argument wins; however, in the case of the medical insurance benefit, we are talking about a benefit meted out by a private employer as a means to attract and maintain a workforce. It is not a entitlement. Moreover, with another year of 15% increase in medical insurance costs, small business owners cannot be terribly happy about the idea of additional expense.\n \n Nevertheless, you are correct in the statement that the cost/benefits analysis jes don't wash. You cannot deny someone basic civil rights because it saves ye money. Those in opposition do not hold that these benefits are attached to a civil right, if I guess correctly. The key is convincing society that it IS a right. Ye do not accomplish this by arguing the economics. The economics should not be an issue to ye. \n \n It would be worth asking the question: Why have heterosexual couples been \"enjoying these benefits for years.\" I would be curious to see everyone's perspective.",

   "\n It would be worth asking the question: Why have heterosexual couples been \"enjoying these benefits for years.\" I would be curious to see everyone's perspective.\n\n \n Marriage confers so many rights and benefits, of legal, social, or economic nature, that no one answer will cover them all. However, for a very large number of them the answers boils down to one of convenience. If you want to help people, it's often easier to help them as a family unit rather then as a collection of individuals. It's also recognized that families generally share finances, so treating families as a single financial entity make sense. Thus you get tax breaks, insurance for the whole family on one plan, a boat load of rights for the next of kin, etc etc. Simply put, some things in life are tricky, these benefits and rights make them easier, and the simplest way to convey these perks is to couples who have demonstrated a commitment to forming a life together. Straights have had a sanctioned means of demonstrating that commitment; gays haven't. That's why straights get the perks while gays have been excluded.",

The fact that separate but equal schools systems are only separate and not equal is attributed to the fact that two facilities run by two administrations, each being fed from a political system administered by humans can never be equalized. We recognized that and proceeded to equalize treatment by integrating students under a single roof. I doubt that things are yet truly equal because of prejudices that live in the hearts of those who run the programs, but it is better than trying to run two school systems, each with it's own set of rules.\n \n Likewise, there is no need for a totally separate set of laws governing gay unions. Gay unions can be included under the existing laws where applicable, leaving all to be governed by one system...married couples and gay unions, just as white students and black students are governed by one set of rules in a single schoolhouse.

That would be a very stupid approach, for many reasons, which I have gone into before.\nQuite so. It would be unwieldy to rewrite all marriage laws in every state. What would not be so bad is to write one law, known as an Amendment to the Constitution that says all legal unions between persons shall entitle the pair to all applicable rights, privileges and benefits offered to married couples in each state. This would make it Federal law. It would apply in all states and would require that no couple be denied those applicable rights because of the gender of either half of the couple.\n \n You'll come nearer getting this than you will redefining marriage.\n \n \n\n So here we go again.

It doesn't exist.\"\n \n You have not presented any legitimate reason to exclude gays, that's my point. \nI'm not trying to exclude gays.\n \n \n And I have never ever ever said I \"needed\" to redefine the word. \"Need\" is your hangup, not mine.

If you want to argue against what I am saying, address easy, fair, and just.\nFairness and justness seem to mean nearly the same to you. They are not. Justice can be attached to the procedures followed in enforcing an unfair law.\n \n Justice for gays is being provided today in accordance with the law. At present, you do not have some of the rights afforded to married couples. This is just...it is not fair to gay couples.\n \n Easy is not a valid descriptor of what you propose. It will not be easy to change the definition of marriage. First of all, where will you start..at the state level or the federal level? There are already drives on to reaffirm the definition of marriage...even suggestions of a Constitutional Amendment to do so. The thought of gays being called 'married' is repugnant to many people...maybe not in your circle of friends, but throughout the entire population of the US, I doubt you'll get much support for that idea.\n \n If rights and dignity are all you want, then you'd best strive to get the rights. Dignity will be long coming as it implies esteem granted by others. Writing a law that says someone must respect you is not going to make it happen. Your worthiness is a given. You are worthy of the rights. Honor and esteem will not come with a redefinition. Contrarily, I believe increased vilification and separation would follow such a step.\n \n Fair is likewise not a valid descriptor when you consider that a sizeable majority of people do not want it to happen. Sure, it would be fair to you and all who want it, but you are a small part of the group that we try to please with government and laws. If I count that many more people saying it's not fair than people saying it is, then it is unfair.\n \n What is fair is to give all couples the same rights regardless of their type. Married couples and Gay couples can share the same rights without being falsely identified as being the same. All you have to do is conjure up some laws that grant the rights to both...after you settle on a name for yourselves.",

Just because (according to your sources - whatever they are) gays make up only 2-5% of the population, you assume 95-98% are opposed to equal rights for gays. Think again. Many heterosexuals support gay rights and gay equality - even gay marriage.\n \n So essentially, we are not asking that percentage of the population to adjust their moral compasses (after all, Orthodox Jews never have to adjust their compasses when you eat a piece of bacon).\n \n We are asking non-gay supporters to allow us to live and let live. The Christ I grew up with would have supported this philosophy. Pity your Christ seems to be devoid of his compassion.",

   "\n What would not be so bad is to write one law, known as an Amendment to the Constitution that says all legal unions between persons shall entitle the pair to all applicable rights, privileges and benefits offered to married couples in each state. This would make it Federal law. It would apply in all states and would require that no couple be denied those applicable rights because of the gender of either half of the couple.\n\n Again, you seem to be confused on several points. First off, the Constitution is not law, it's a guideline that laws must follow. Writing an amendment doesn't actually do anything, it just requires that something be done. You still have to actually go in and change all the laws, and gays will still have to spend countless hours suing to ensure that the changes get made. Secondly, the Federal government can't tell the states that they must have civil unions, that power is clearly left to the states. And finally, it would never pass. An impossible solution is no solution. I'm one of the more optomistic supporters of gay rights here, and I have no delusion that any sort of support for gay rights will make it into the constitution in my life time.\n \n \n\n See above.\n\n I did, You ignored most of my points, and came up with a \"solution\" which would work and can't be implemented.\n \n \n\n I'm not trying to exclude gays.\n\n Um, yes you are. From marriage.\n \n \n\n Fairness and justness seem to mean nearly the same to you. They are not. Justice can be attached to the procedures followed in enforcing an unfair law.\n\n Yes, justice has more to do with fairness then legality. If you don't see that then forget it, this is not the place for that debate.\n \n \n\n Easy is not a valid descriptor of what you propose. It will not be easy to change the definition of marriage. First of all, where will you start..at the state level or the federal level? There are already drives on to reaffirm the definition of marriage...even suggestions of a Constitutional Amendment to do so. The thought of gays being called 'married' is repugnant to many people...maybe not in your circle of friends, but throughout the entire population of the US, I doubt you'll get much support for that idea.\n\n Were you deliberately misreading me? Of course it won't be easy. But some means will be easier than others. Everything you've proposed is nigh on impossible, so by default my approach will be easier then what you've suggested.\n \n \n\n If rights and dignity are all you want, then you'd best strive to get the rights. Dignity will be long coming as it implies esteem granted by others. Writing a law that says someone must respect you is not going to make it happen. Your worthiness is a given. You are worthy of the rights. Honor and esteem will not come with a redefinition. Contrarily, I believe increased vilification and separation would follow such a step.\n\n Why the strawmen? Who said anything about writing a law mandating dignity or respect? \n \n \n\n Fair is likewise not a valid descriptor when you consider that a sizeable majority of people do not want it to happen. Sure, it would be fair to you and all who want it, but you are a small part of the group that we try to please with government and laws. If I count that many more people saying it's not fair than people saying it is, then it is unfair.\n\n You aren't really so morally uneducated as to believe that fair as a concept is defined by popular vote, are you? I'm not trying to be offensive here, but seriously, if you think that whatever the majority says is always correct and fair then there is no point even trying to discuss this with you. So please, tell me I misread you.\n \n \n\n What is fair is to give all couples the same rights regardless of their type. Married couples and Gay couples can share the same rights without being falsely identified as being the same. \n\n And for the upteenth time, what is the significant difference? Why does the gender matter so much? Why is it vital that only opposite sex couples be married? Why do you even care?",

Hale, Concord\n \n For the Monitor\n Apr 9, 2007\n \n Many opposed to civil unions are coming from honest and deeply held views. But their reasoning misses the point.\n \n Even before a quarter century of marriage, I had taken the view that a marriage might be threatened from the outside only by weaknesses from within. Just how can other people's living situations affect my marriage? Where, and what, is this \"threat\"? I have yet to see a single cultural or moral effect.\n \n I question those saying that \"this is being shoved down our throats.\" The legislation doesn't state that we all have to divorce and enter a same-sex marriage.\n \n And what is this \"agenda\" we hear so much about?\n \n And are the courts really going to be overwhelmed with dissolution cases?\n By far the worst and most obscene of the tired arguments is protesters putting their minds into other people's bedrooms - breaching the privacy of others and teaching this to their children. I don't recall this voyeuristic pornography as any part of my religious and moral training. This only allows the senseless hatred of parents to be perpetuated in their children.\n \n This is often done in the name of religion. What ethical faith claiming a God of love could ever agree with or support such an argument?\n \n The heterosexual marriage record has little to be proud of, with three out of five ending in divorce. What about the disrespect to marriage flagrantly displayed by heteros with many divorces or so-called \"celebrities\" engaged in drunken two-day \"marriages\" in Las Vegas?\n \n It is okay to disagree with civil unions if you are honest about it, but don't try to convince me with arguments based on mythology and bigotry.\n \n R.P.

You have yet to come up with any sound reason for changing the definition except for your misguided belief that changing it will make everything hunky-dory overnight. Changing the definition to exclude gender will do your movement more harm than good.\n\n \n Gays are human beings who deserve equal human rights and to be included in human society, unless there is a logical, rational reason why we shouldn't. I think a society that is equal and inclusive towards gays will be of great benefit to our movement. \n \n \nBeing taken away is the identity of married couples as heterosexual partners. If all couples are called married, then heterosexuality means nothing.\n\n \n What identity is that? The straight couple will still be married. All that is taken away is the exclusion of gays from being married. Heterosexual identity is not dependent on the ability to exclude, discriminate, or to not be associated with gays. \n \n \nJust as your homosexuality means a lot to you, heterosexuality means a lot to those who are.\n\n \n Well, good for them. However, I can't believe that the identity of the mighty and daily celebrated, heterosexual majority, is so fragile. \n \n \nYou cannot legislate respect. I can almost guarantee you that taking the meaning of marriage to another level by calling all couples married will do you more harm than good.\n\n \n I think it's part of the process of gaining respect, but not the entire process.\n \n \nThe lowering of the bar refers to the reduction in qualifying requirements. Heretofore, if people wanted to be married, they had to be oppositely sexed.\n\n \n It's changing the requirements to two persons. Changing is not the same thing as reducing.\n \n \nTo allow same sex marriages is definitely lowering the bar. I realize you have a problem differentiating between lowering the bar and admitting \"lower classes of people\". It's not a disparity of class that keeps you out. It's your unchangeable gender. You cannot be currently defined as 'married'. You must change the gender requirement associated with marriage. You must lower the bar. There are more people who share my view than do yours.\n\n \n \"Lowering the bar\", is a loaded phrase. It does imply that those who meet the current definition or the current qualifications are better, stronger, smarter, etc., than those who wish for a change which would include them.\n \n The majority is always right is a logical fallacy. Saying that marriage simply is different gender and that's the reason why it must remain different gender is circular. It's not an argument and begs the question. \n \n \nPerhaps if you attacked the problem of being denied rights rather than the problem that you do not qualify for marriage, you'd have success eventually...and get the rights you deserve.\n\n \n Lowering expectations, never gets one what is deserved. You will give us a few scraps from the table, provided we don't push to be included in an equal seat or become too big for our boots? It never works that way, when the argument is, we can't give them this, because of what they will want next.\n \n When any kind of recognition is argued for, the majority are afraid gays will want full equality, or they say it is somehow too close to what heterosexuals enjoy. The opposition also does not want to benefit or show equal recognition and respect or inclusion to something they don't like, even if it can't give a logical reason why they don't like it. \n \n \nI think you are doing nothing but causing the other side to become more entrenched in their beliefs regarding your silly insistence upon a change in definition.\n\n \n The opposition may be entrenched. It has no argument. There is a decreasing number of them, and a growing number who don't care either way, as the debate continues.\n \n \nYes I do. I've previously expressed my wonderment as to why gays don't actively seek acceptance from the churches rather than the government. That's where the social rewards are given. You appear to think that being able to call yourself 'married' will have some accompanying free respect from all the church members to pacify your need for acceptance.\n\n \n Everyone would naturally like acceptance.

The traditional marriage in the old testament was polygamous and about property.\n \n The transtion of marriage\n \n 10000000bce------<the christian/greek/roman/western era 2000ce, marriage=polygamous was about property and was aranged by as a property transaction by one family to another\n \n 2000ce------<1880ce, marriage =two people and was about property sometimes still aranged by the family sometimes not.\n \n 1880ce ------< current, marriage=two people and is about love and the two people invovled decide about the marriage.\n \n So seeing that marriage has changed why can it not change again. Marriage has allready been redefined from property satutus to love. If marriage is about love then anyone can marry anyone of their choice. If it is about property then you are right certain standards must be met. Then agian if you want a traditonal view of marriage I am sure that your wife views herself as your property.\n \n If the state is granting marriage they must call it the same for both heteros and gay people. I don't care what they call it as long as it is the same. If the state wants to issue civil unions then heteros must be given civil unions also and all marriage licenses must be retitled civil union.",

   "Which ones?\n\n Seriously? You really haven't been following this issue at all, have you?\n Arkansas: Legal status for unmarried persons which is identical or substantially similar to marital status shall not be valid or recognized in Arkansas,\n Georgia: No union between persons of the same sex shall be recognized by this state as entitled to the benefits of marriage\n Kentucky: A legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized\n N. Dakota: No other domestic union, however denominated, may be recognized as a marriage or given the same or substantially equivalent effect\n Ohio: This state and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage\n Oklahoma: Neither this Constitution nor any other provision of law shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups. \n Utah: No other domestic status or union, however denominated, between persons is valid or recognized or may be authorized, sanctioned, or given the same or substantially equivalent legal effect as a marriage.\n \n Those are just from the 2004 elections.\n \n \n\n ...and speaking of states, if you doubt you'd be able to get 37 states to ratify an amendment, how do you ever expect to get states to redefine marriage as you choose?\n \n\n All of them? Right now? Obviously it won't happen. But it has happened in one state already, and it could happen in other states soon. And their example, while it will scare some in the short term, can be used to educate them in the longer term, and show them that their fears are unfounded.\n \n \n\n ...and why do you question that an amendment to assure all applicable rights to gays would have better chances of being ratified if it also reaffirmed the current definition of marriage?\n\n I don't believe I commented on that in any way.\n \n \n\n ..and if your only interest is in the benefits and rights, why do you care how they are obtained.\n\n I have in fact explicitly said that that isn't the only interest.\n \n \n\n Taken away would be the meaning of the word 'marriage'. It is gender dependent because that is the way it is defined...a man and a woman marry each other.\n\n I'm still not getting you. So what if a definition changes? It happens all the time, and no one complains about losing anything. What is really being lost that has you so bugged? Use a whole paragraph to explain this, please. Don't be stingy with your words, spell it out in as much detail as you can.\n \n \n\n Being taken away is the identity of married couples as heterosexual partners. If all couples are called married, then heterosexuality means nothing. Just as your homosexuality means a lot to you, heterosexuality means a lot to those who are.\n \n\n My homosexuality? Nope, guess again. I'm as straight as you. I'm straight, and I'm married, and I still have no idea how any of that would change if gays got married too. My heterosexuality means I like women, my marriage means I want to spend the rest of my life with my wife, how is any of that threatened by gays getting married? I don't get it! \n \n \n\n The lowering of the bar refers to the reduction in qualifying requirements. Heretofore, if people wanted to be married, they had to be oppositely sexed. To allow same sex marriages is definitely lowering the bar. I realize you have a problem differentiating between lowering the bar and admitting \"lower classes of people\". It's not a disparity of class that keeps you out. It's your unchangeable gender. You cannot be currently defined as 'married'. You must change the gender requirement associated with marriage. You must lower the bar. There are more people who share my view than do yours.\n\n \"Lower the bar\" does generally have a negative conotation. If that's not what you're implying, if all you mean is \"change\", then just say change. And then explain why change is to be feared, what's so bad about it? Because things change all the time, and I don't see you fighting those changes. There's something about this change that's got you upset, and that's what I'm trying to get you to explain to me.\n \n \n\n Perhaps if you attacked the problem of being denied rights rather than the problem that you do not qualify for marriage, you'd have success eventually...and get the rights you deserve. \n\n I've explained why that statement is wrong, you didn't respond to most of my points. Go back and read them again if you like, they're still valid.",

They just want people to stop trying to get others to live by their beliefs. \n\n \n LOL. No expectation of change culturally at all huh, in terms of people's moral views about homosexuality and gay marriage? Sorry, I'm not buying that. If you had limited your comments here to ONLY opposing legal matters, you might have some ground to stand on there. You've argued just recently about how important it is for people to see gays as everyday people or that they have families like everyone else. When you argue that, you ARE trying to change peoples' beliefs. Why don't you just be honest here and say that you and your movement certainly ARE calling on people to change their beliefs? Because you are. If you weren't you wouldn't be trying to convince people that gay is not immoral.\n \n \nBut just as Jews are perfectly happy to let gentiles eat pork while they won't, why can't people just let gays be gay, without the protests and condemnation?\n\n \n The difference is that no one is out to try to get Jews to stop believing that eating pork is wrong.

   "I think we are without doubt seeking to get people who are anti-gay to change their beliefs about us. They are free not to do so, of course, because people have the right to believe whatever they want. But many people still hold beliefs about gay people that are based on myths and stereotypes and falsehoods. The more that people get to know gay people, the more likely they are to shed those false beliefs about us. \n \n We all have to make up their own minds about what we think is moral or immoral. The more accurate information we have, the better we are able to make such decisions for ourselves. I think that people who are not gay have a tremendous opportunity in forums like this one to get more accurate information about gay people, because they can interact with and engage in discussion with those of us who are gay. We gay people know more about ourselves than anyone else does, at least when it comes to our own experiences. We are thus a great source of information that can counter the myths and stereotypes and falsehoods that many folks have learned.",

   "I think there's another piece to this when it comes to our efforts to change people's beliefs about us and attitudes toward us. It has to do with the impact of people's beliefs on public policy. To me it makes no sense for someone to say that my being gay is wrong, because my being gay is just who I am. It's like saying that my being right-handed is wrong. I just am right-handed; there is no moral choice involved in that. Likewise, there is no moral choice involved in being gay; it's just who some of us are. \n \n Still, I honestly do not really care whether some other people believe that my being gay is wrong, so long as they do not use that belief as justification to deny me and my family and my friends equal and fair treatment under the law and in the public arena. Here's a parallel that can help illustrate what I mean. I know there are people who believe that divorce is wrong. But they are not, at least not currently, working to make divorce illegal for everyone in the society. I have no problem with people believing that divorce is wrong and choosing never to divorce themselves. I do have a problem with people actively trying to eliminate the possibility of divorce for everyone else, by passing laws that prohibit divorce. I also have a problem with people stigmatizing and discriminating against divorced people in the public arena. \n \n Of course there are limits to parallels, and I don't think we should overdraw the parallel between being gay and getting divorced. A major difference is that divorce is an action, while sexual orientation is not an action: it's just who some people are. Loving relationships between same-sex partners are an expression of who some people are. Divorce can be a result of many things, but it usually results from a marriage being broken, not from the natural expression of who people are.",

The former is an assertion that people do not have the freedom of their beliefs, and to argue this would be to undermine one of our fundamental freedoms as Americans and as people in the world. People have the right to hold their beliefs whether other people regard those beliefs as wrong or not. \n \n The latter argument is different, however. To say that someone else's beliefs are wrong is not to take away their right to believe what they wish. Rather, it is to engage in critical evaluation and discussion of ideas. You have the right to believe what you wish, ad other people have the right to say that those beliefs of yours are wrong and to present evidence and arguments for why those beliefs are wrong. \n \n There are beliefs that some people hold that I most certainly think are wrong. Racist beliefs, and anti-Semitic beliefs, and anti-gay beliefs are all beliefs that I think are wrong. Other people may think that some of my beliefs are wrong, and I do not fault anyone for saying that. I would push people who think my beliefs are wrong to explain why they think my beliefs are wrong. Engaging me in discussion about what beliefs are right and wrong is healthy, I think. It is not the same as suppressing people whose beliefs we disagree with. \n \n I think that we must ensure that people do not face discrimination or persecution for holding beliefs that others think are wrong. We have a long history of struggling as a society with differences in beliefs, with engaging in dialogue and discussion without the majority persecuting or discriminating against minority groups because of their different beliefs. The temptation to persecute and silence minorities (and I mean all kinds of minorities) is great, I think. We need always to respect people whose views are different and to honor their rights as people while engaging in discussion and plain speaking about what we believe and why. This is not easy.",

So that's why I think it's a bit disingenuous for anyone to claim that there is no expectation for conservative religious people to change their views or stop believing the way they do.\n\n \n To be honest, I do not care what conservative religious people believe about us gay people so long as they do not try to deny us equal rights under the law. To me the main point of changing popular attitudes is to get rid of the discriminatory laws and to enable us to live as fully equal citizens. I do not think we are sending a message to conservative religious people that they should stop believing what they believe. I think we are sending a message to conservative religious people that they should stop denying us equal rights. If that requires challenging what they believe about us, then we challenge it. The main point, though, is not to change attitudes for the sake of changing attitudes. The point is to win equal treatment under the law, including the right to marry our spouses legally. \n \n There is, however, another reason to challenge the beliefs of conservative religious people about gay people. That reason is children. The gay children of conservative religious parents often endure terrible rejection from their own families. I am a professor at a small college. I had a student some years ago who came out as a lesbian to her parents. They were conservative Christians, and they completely rejected their daughter. They cut off her funding for college, and she was forced to drop out. They told her that she was no longer welcome in their home, not on holidays, not ever. The student was eventually able to get independent student status, and she was able to finish college with significant financial aid. She said to me, \"I thought my parents would always be there for me. But I was wrong.\" It was terrible for her. \n \n In her senior year, the student won an award, and her mother came to see her get the award. It was an important step, the beginning of some healing. The parents did not come to her graduation, but at least her mother came to the award ceremony. I do not know what has happened between this student and her parents since then; the student graduated some years ago. But I have never forgotten this terrible thing that happened to her. It's one reason why I think we should challenge what people believe about us gay people, so this kind of family rupture does not happen to other young people.",

   ":xbanghead :re. My 2 cents, the 5-15%. Does the exact amount of us really matter? I suppose it reflects my experiences in this life. I've had experiences where the percent of gays was far higher than 15% and some where I was the only gay there. My graduating class was 100+, out of about 750. The fact still remains, I am not afforded the same rights as a hetro couple. I could(and people have been)thrown out of a hospital, because you are not family, refused the privilige of attending a funeral of a spouse, lost your home of 20-30 yrs because you were not married, I could go on but surely you get the point. I for one will leave the terminology \"Marriage\" to the Christians(both real and imagined). I don't care what you call the bond I share with my lady. I want the same privileges afforded a hetro couple. This would in no real way that anybody has come up with that I've ever heard of, damage the institution of marriage.
