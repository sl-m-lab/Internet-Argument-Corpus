Shouldn't the AFA just get a life to live, instead of wasting precious sands through the hourglass? Now, these fools will be walking around in washes that are not whiter than white, with no one to kiss them on account of bad breath, lax personal hygiene and yellow teeth, as they boycott Procter and Gamble's great line of products(it produces As The World Turns). \n \n The AFA has entire sites on this matter, and the hate is clear to see. They claim As The World Turns should be supporting what the AFA defines as proper family values. They link the gay kisses with warnings such as \"repulsive\". The fact is, there wasn't a word from the AFA and anti-gay Christians, these self-appointed guardians of traditional mores, when two major straight characters were involved in a plot to have frequent sex, not in love, comitment, feelings, mutual respect, or marriage; but for the sole purpose of providing the single, independent female of the duo, with a baby. This happened around the same time as the AFA complained about \"Nuke's\"(Luke and Noah's) first kiss on the show. \n \n We know what this is really about, don't we? The heterosexual characters can be involved in any monkey business shenanigans, but gay characters in a loving relationship, especially gay male characters, that's what gets the bigots up in arms.",

   "I would like to discuss the issue of \"open-mouthed\" kissing. \n \n First, why do the AHA and similar tight-assed prudish dickwad types need to make a distinction between that and closed-mouth kissing? Does separating the lips increase the perversion value of the osculation? (I suppose the open mouth is the first step to the proverbial French kiss, and we know how perverted -and unAmerican- anything French is.)\n \n Second, I watched the video. I observed a rather subdued, nearly chaste, kiss with no open mouth! The kiss was clearly closed-mouthed!\n \n I watched it over and over and over and over. I recorded it and projected it on a large screen. Even with this magnification, I saw nary a pixel of opening twixt the upper and lower lips!\n \n Fie on the AHA, I say, for their LIES!!!",
