   "Quote: \n Speaking to the Shinui faction, Sharon said, \"it pains me that, as someone who all his life defended Jews in the wars of Israel, I now need defense against Jews, for fear someone might try to harm me.\" \n \n \n Quote: \n Sharon on Monday called on the Justice Ministry to take \"energetic action to put an end to dangerous incitement\" from the right \n \n \n It seems as though Sharon has decided to beef up his security team, a little afraid he might be the next Rabin. For crying out loud he sounds like a Palestinian in the West Bank. He's afraid of the Jewish extreme that seeks his destruction. Sniff, sniff, I feel so bad . Maybe the fear he'll live in will be like a family of four hoping their house isn't the next to be demolished because of apartheid or that some trigger happy IDF soldier won't gun them down on their lawn. But that's the name of facist politics, one facist is always looking to take another one out. And I said crazed right wing settlers were worthless, how silly was I",

   "If we are lucky, one of those guys WILL take him out. As long as Sharon is in power, there is no hope for peace in Israel. \n \n I guess it makes him uncomfortable to be the target of assasination attempts. He doesn't seem to have any trouble with using his citizens as cannon fodder in pursuit of his racial and real estate agendas. Typical spineless politician.",

   "I think Sharon should suck it up and stop being such a big baby. Maybe he should talk to Allah because Hamas and Islamic Jihad members aren't afraid to walk down the street. I guess that after his Arab slaying days Sharon has faltered a bit, a little sad seeing a murderer losing his grip",

   "Many of our 'allies' seem to have a problem with dissatisfied citizenry. Pakistan's ex-general turned president spends a great deal of his resources constantly evading assignation attempts, complete with at least two decoy convoys for every motor trip he takes. \n \n Bush and Cheney have both been in our city for money gathering, and the security was unbelievable. Cheney had to be driven about a mile to another location. The main artery was blocked off in the middle of the afternoon, with local police squad cars blocking access to that artery two intersections deep on each side of the artery with helicopters buzzing overhead. I'm sure a swarm of F16s were above them. We're beginning to give freedom a funny taste.",

Sharon will be interesting to watch, since he can not really afford to bite the hand that feeds him. I think in Pakistan, they are already scaling back support for the US and backing off of the hunt for AQ. It makes one wonder how long it will be before pakistan is the new \"imminent threat\" to America. I also wonder exactly how we will deal with them, since they, too, have the bomb.",
