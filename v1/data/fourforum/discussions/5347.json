   "Who's to say that anyone Bush might appoint wouldn't strike down a constitutional amendment that bans gay marriage? The justices are not to be the puppets of the legislature or the president. Don't forget Richard Nixon's appointment of Harry Blackmun.\nThat's a sound point, one of the real fears of the traditionalists, and a good reason for a federal amendment. The tenth amendment is now more honored in the breach than in the observance.\n \n \nWhat will happen when these judges interpret that a law is unconstitutional and strike it down. Will they be legislating from the bench?\nYes, that's exactly what it is, but there is precedent for it. A federal judge overturned a Missouri state constitutional provision for school funding a few years ago, and ordered up his own formula. His formula failed miserably, at great cost to the citizens of the state, and was eventually abandoned. Like I said, the tenth amendment doesn't provide any protection from the federal judiciary.\n \n \nIn my opinion, we don't give the American people nearly enough credit to assume they can't be trusted with issues like this. Maybe, just maybe, the reason that many American people think gay marriage is wrong is simply because it IS.

What I don't accept is judges (individuals) deciding these issues, even going so far as to go against the American people. That is a VERY dangerous precedent that is much more monarchial than anything.\nAgreed in spades. For any representative government to work, two things are necessary: (1) All parties must accept the verdict of the ballot box, and (2) the winners must not overplay their hand and oppress the minorities by disenfranchising them. That said, no one will ever get everything he or she wants and it is not forbidden discrimination to deny the unqualified from admission to an institution as old as human society.",

After all, if enough of the public had not been behind them, civil rights for black people would never have come about, nor women's suffrage.\n\n \n Of course you are correct that those things could not have come around without the support of the American people, but you are wrong to think that a removal of slavery and equal rights for women would not have come about far sooner if our government had not established a dictatorship with George Washington as the leader. How many blacks were victims of slavery because we did not make one man a dictator? Instead, we established a form of government where such changes cannot come about until entire cultures of people die off because they are unwilling and too stubborn to change the long-held values they've been raised with. The south wasn't filled with evil people. Those opposed to equality for women were not evil. But they held a vision of what a \"moral\" society should be, and they were unable to change that opinion no matter how many they hurt. That is the tyranny we subject ourselves to by choosing democracy. The majority will always hold the idea that they are better than some minority, and we will always have tyranny of the majority.\n \n I don't mean to say that we should have established a dictatorship, for surely that would have destroyed liberty more readily than our current system, which presents a large number of checks and balances on the power of the majority (at least on a national level). Our current system is designed to maintain liberty, and to do its best to further it, but it does not always further it. We should never make the mistake of assuming that the majority will not oppress the minority; we should never make the mistake of assuming that the majority is right. \n \n Remember that with slavery, the majority was horribly wrong until the iron fist of the government forced it upon them. With women's rights, more than half the population was oppressed. It appears to me, that if slavery had been put up to a vote in Texas back before the civil war, and Texans voted to add an amendment to their state constitution legalizing slavery of blacks (which they would have), you could as simply say \"Maybe, just maybe, the reason that many American people think slavery of blacks is right is simply because it IS.\"\n \n That is unacceptable.\n \n \nIn my opinion, we don't give the American people nearly enough credit to assume they can't be trusted with issues like this.

What I don't accept is judges (individuals) deciding these issues, even going so far as to go against the American people. That is a VERY dangerous precedent that is much more monarchial than anything.\n\n \n I know that there was a time that America wanted slavery. I know that there was a time that America wanted women to be inferior. I know that there was a time when America wanted to (and did) kick out atheists. But I do not care what America wants. I care what helps the most people. And if America wants to help the most people, then I do not mind letting it. But to suggest that it is a good thing to allow the majority of Americans to vote on how many rights the minority gets is to ignore the reality of the tyranny of the majority. \n \n To hear you speak on monarchy, it sounds to me that you believe slavery, women's sufferage, segregation, or any past instance of tyranny of the majority was fixed by a majority vote of the people. But in reality, it was the national-level government officials and the judges who came to the aid of the minority, not the majority. And the majority disapproved of those decisions until they were replaced by a younger generation.\n \n Our Constitution is designed to give ulitmate power to the people but to prevent them from making decisions themselves. It is designed to allow them to decide which individuals make the decisions, but the majority does not get to make those decisions. Our Constitution gives the majority vote no power except the power to decide who is elected (in fact, it originally gave legislators the power to elect the Senate, not the people). It certainly gives the majority vote no power to change the Constitution. It does this because any one person or group cannot be trusted with power. The majority will abuse its power as surely as anyone else will, even if that majority is well-intentioned, and the majority will be held accountable to no one.\n \n The majority should never be trusted to decide the rights of the minority, and I think that is the most important thing I can say.\n \n \nYet it's interesting that quite a few states did this some time before Texas.

But I do understand that the majority of people in that state, although well-intentioned, hold a set of morals that I believe to be evil, one of which is the belief that gay couples should not be allowed to marry. Other states also hold that belief. Bush also holds a set of beliefs that I consider evil, although he again is well-intentioned.

   " but you are wrong to think that a removal of slavery and equal rights for women would not have come about far sooner if our government had not established a dictatorship with George Washington as the leader.\n \n \n Depends on the views of the dictator. That's the problem with dictatorships and judiciocracy--they put too much power in the hands of individuals.\n \n \n It appears to me, that if slavery had been put up to a vote in Texas back before the civil war, and Texans voted to add an amendment to their state constitution legalizing slavery of blacks (which they would have), you could as simply say \"Maybe, just maybe, the reason that many American people think slavery of blacks is right is simply because it IS.\"\n\n \n Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had. \n \n \nBut to suggest that it is a good thing to allow the majority of Americans to vote on how many rights the minority gets is to ignore the reality of the tyranny of the majority. \n\n \n The problem is that by assuming you are a legitimate minority being denied something you should have, you've jumped ahead of the American people. You're entire argument is based on a premise that is unfounded: that what gay people do is equivilent in nature and morality to real marriage. Marriage is a straight thing. And it rests on the unfounded premise that the majority is being tyrannical in this case. You're movement is trying to create a \"C\" when issues \"A\" and \"B\" are unresolved.\n \n \nTo hear you speak on monarchy, it sounds to me that you believe slavery, women's sufferage, segregation, or any past instance of tyranny of the majority was fixed by a majority vote of the people. But in reality, it was the national-level government officials and the judges who came to the aid of the minority, not the majority. And the majority disapproved of those decisions until they were replaced by a younger generation.\n\n \n That's easy to say, but in reality NOTHING on a national level in this country happens without enough people getting behind it. Even if it takes awhile. How did those judges get there? Did those national-level officials just step into office? No, they were elected, because enough people liked their views. No matter how you slice it, ultimately the will of the people is what enacts national changes--or at least it SHOULD be that way. And if, by elections and other processes that the American people ultimately decide marriage in this country should be changed, then I will accept that. But it doesn't need to happen outside of the American people at the will of individuals on benches.\n \n \nOur Constitution is designed to give ulitmate power to the people but to prevent them from making decisions themselves.\n\n \n Everyone has their own view of WHY we have a constitution. There are really probably a number of reasons. It does NOT grant minorites the power to decide sweeping moral questions for the rest of America, or to fundametally change time-honored institutions. I once heard someone, when asked \"who will protect us from the tyranny of the majority\" reply, \"and who will protect us from the tyranny of the minority?\" Both are legitimate questions and I think the latter is the more pertinent in this debate.",

   "...but you are wrong to think that a removal of slavery and equal rights for women would not have come about far sooner if our government had not established a dictatorship with George Washington as the leader.\nThat's an interesting choice of example. Do you really think a slaveholder would have freed the slaves earlier?? \n \n \nRemember that with slavery, the majority was horribly wrong until the iron fist of the government forced it upon them.\nUhhh... I think that should read \"iron fist of the majority\" that abolished an abominable custom. After all, Lincoln did win the election in 1860. When read correctly though, I think you have hit on a good analogy and example of the majority stamping out an immoral practice (which is quite relevant to this debate).\n \n \nWith women's rights, more than half the population was oppressed.\nBack in the old days when the tenth amendment was still in effect, states determined who was eligible to vote. Women were first allowed to vote in Wyoming, ca 1870, because of one energetic frontier schoolteacher (from South Pass City, now a restored ghost town) who worked hard to support candidates for the very first state legislature if they would write women's suffrage into the state constitution. That concept was adopted by more than half the states before it was writted into the US Constitution in 1920.\n \n Once again you have chosen a good example of bottom-up social change that would profit the gay activists to study.\n \n \nBut I do not care what America wants. I care what helps the most people.\n<shaking head in disbelief< Wow! You really need to place more trust in the people, and less in your own divinity.\n \n \nThe majority should never be trusted to decide the rights of the minority, and I think that is the most important thing I can say.\nWhere do YOU think the federal Constitution came from?",

   "And the backlash against activist judges in Mass. continues:\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,157267,00.html\n \n \n Saturday, May 21, 2005\n \n \n AUSTIN, Texas - The Texas Senate (search) approved a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriage with a 21-8 vote Saturday, sending the issue to voters.\n \n State law already prohibits same-sex marriages. If approved in a statewide vote in November, Texas (search) would join 14 states that statutorily and constitutionally ban same-sex marriage. Massachusetts is the only state that allows such marriages, although Vermont and Connecticut have approved same-sex civil unions.\n \n Opponents have criticized the ban as discrimination against gays and lesbians and warn it could harm heterosexual families if domestic partner benefits, powers of attorney and common law marriage are called into question.\n \n Sen. Todd Staples, R-Palestine, who sponsored the legislation in the Senate, said none of those scenarios would be affected and would not prevent same-sex couples from adopting children. The House has voted to ban gays from becoming foster parents, but that measure has received little support in the Senate.\n \n Staples rejected arguments the amendment would discriminate against gays and lesbians and the estimated 43,000 same-sex couples in Texas.\n \n Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, equated the amendment to Jim Crow-era laws that discriminated against blacks.\n \n \"At least they had the good sense to never write their bigotry into the state Constitution,\" said Ellis, who called the amendment \"trash.\"\n \n Staples said he is offended by accusations the amendment is anti-gay.\n \n \"There's a distinction between intimate associations and the right to have the government recognize or subsidize your arrangement,\" Staples said.\n\n \n \n Don't worry; its still against the law and won't hold up.",
