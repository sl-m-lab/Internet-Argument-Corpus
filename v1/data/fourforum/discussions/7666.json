   "LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- Don Knotts, who kept generations of TV audiences laughing as bumbling Deputy Barney Fife on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and would-be swinger landlord Ralph Furley on \"Three's Company,\" has died. He was 81.\n \n Knotts died Friday night of pulmonary and respiratory complications at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center, said Sherwin Bash, his friend and manager.\n \n Griffith, who had visited Knotts in the hospital before his death, said his longtime friend had a brilliant comedic mind and wrote some of the show's best scenes.\n \n \"Don was a small man ... but everything else about him was large: his mind, his expressions,\" Griffith told The Associated Press on Saturday. \"Don was special. There's nobody like him.\n \n\n Don Knotts\n \n A couple of weeks ago my spouse ordered a couple of Don Knotts film from Netflix, How To Frame A Figg and The Incredible Mr. Limpet. I will miss this talented man and it is true he was small in stature but big in talent. It is sad to read about all of the greats passing on.",

   "That is so sad. He is truly one of the great American comic actors. I had the pleasure not too long ago of seeing him live here in Kansas City in a production of On Golden Pond. He was fantastic in it. Really showed that he could play more than a high-strung funny man. Very talented. He will be missed dearly.",

I'm not sure why he spent so much time here, but I'm glad he did.",
