She paid the $100 deposit, scheduled a limousine rental and asked her date. \n She ran into a snag, however, and it has nothing to do with what shoes to wear. \n \n Administrators of the private, all-girls Catholic high school school don't like Murphy's choice of companion, and they've told her to find someone else or come alone. \n \n Murphy, a senior who is openly lesbian, wants to bring her girlfriend of six months, Lindsey Shelton, and believes school administrators are discriminating against them. \n \n \"They said, \"We want it to be traditional. It has to be boy and girl, tux and dress and all that stuff,' \" Murphy said. \"After I thought about it awhile, I said, \"That's not fair.' \" \n \n The disagreement has caused a buzz in the halls of the school, which will be closing in June after 87 years due to enrollment declines. Murphy circulated a petition and gathered signatures from at least a third of the 130 students.\n\n \n <snip<\n \n To put it simply, the private Catholic school, which will be closing at the end of the 2005-2006 academic year, has every right to set the rules concerning their events.",
