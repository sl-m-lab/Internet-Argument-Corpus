   "Maybe it is just me, but when I listen to O'Reilly talk politics, I get the sense that he would make for a great president. Some people have a problem with the fact that he works for Fox and therefore is labeled as a far right Conservative. I really don't see that in him. He doesn't sound to me like a crazy right-winger. He is more Conservative than Liberal though. He also sounds very passionate about doing what is in the interest of the US, what is fair for the people, and based on his history, I think he would be able to do a great job running the country. I also don't think is would be a common politician in that he sounds like he would use his time in office to make a difference instead of using that time to try and extend his career another 4 years or becoming corrupt and cashing in all he can in that time. He just strikes me as a person I'd trust to be in office more than I would trust any other politician that is running next year. What does everyone else think?",

   "I've heard him say that he hasn't ruled out running for elected office... and he says if he did he wouldn't care what people thought, he'd do what he though is right. I'd certainly be encouraging people to vote for him... I think he'd make a great president. If he made a run he might do it as an independent... so that would make it even more interesting.",

I think he is more conservative than liberal but he is still a mix of both and I think he isn't bound by political labels such as democrat or republican and is instead going to base his opinions by what he believes is right.

   "Quoted by Phat_Albert87 :\nAlthough I tend to despise those right-wing commentators (ESP. Ann Coulter), Bill O'Reilly is much more cautious and civil.\n \n \n You consider that a talk show host who yells at his guests to \"Shut up\" and /or cuts their mike when they start refuting his points as someone who is \"cautious and civil\"?\n \n Quoted by AMD4EVER:\n \nHe is a registered Independent as well.\n\n \n No he's not. He's been a registered Republican since 1994. He claims that he is a registered Republican but didn't know about it. He said that there was no independent box to check so he left it blank. According to his claim, the Great Republican Fairy saw a blank card and decided to recruit him to Republican. \n \n (Ok, I'm just having a little fun here. There is no Great Republican Fairy.)\n \n However, if you look at his registration card here , you can clearly see that it is checked 'Republican'.\n \n \nAlthough many would write off anyone who works for Fox News as conservative, I don't think that is a requirement to work there.\n\n \n Hannity is a Democrat so yes, you don't have to be a Republican to have a job. However, if you want to keep your job, you're not allowed to stick up for your beliefs. When was the last time you saw Hannity come off as anything other than a milquetoast type Democrat?\n \n \nI think he is more conservative than liberal but he is still a mix of both and I think he isn't bound by political labels such as democrat or republican and is instead going to base his opinions by what he believes is right.\n \n \n I can believe this.\n \n \nI think that is the type of politician that would go down in history as a great leader.\n\n \n You think that a great leader tells his opponents to \"Shut up!\"? How well do you think that would go over during a difficult negotiation against someone like North Korea?\n \n \nWhen was the last time that we had a president that did things just because they were the right thing to do and not because it would either help them get elected next term or it would simply please his political alliance? I'm not even saying that person would have to be O'Reilly. I think we just need someone who cares more about helping the US than they do about themselves and their political friends.\n \n \n If you think Bill wouldn't be in for anything other than Bill's sake, I think you're sadly mistaken.",

   "I am aware of O'Reilly doing that, Porkypine. However, I find this to be much more preferable to Coulter's inane liberal bashing and claim that the Bible gives us justification to \"rape the earth\". Think of it as a \"lesser of two evils\" sort of thing.",

   "Listening O'Reilly on the radio today I heard him give his solution to illegal immegration. He said he would put the national guard on the border of Mexico to stop the illegals from coming in and once that is done he will make all the illegals currently living here into US citizens in an orderly way. He suggested finger printing all current illegals here, giving them drivers licenses, and then assuming they can make it through 5 to 7 years without commiting any other crimes, he would make them US citizens.\n \n I like this idea. I hadn't heard anything like this one before but I think this one sounds like it is realistic and it could work. Whats everyone elses opinion?\n \n PS it was also very interesting that O'Reilly said \"When I am president\" before laying this all out. Hopefully he does run for office one day!",
