   "The Democrats unveil landmark health care legislation.\n \n ----------\n \n Washington - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Democrats opened an all-fronts charge today to pass a $1.5 trillion, 10-year health care overhaul by August, unveiling legislation that would tax the wealthy to pay for universal coverage, create a public insurance plan and require individuals to carry insurance and businesses to offer it.\n \n The bill would also begin wide-ranging experiments to change the way doctors and hospitals are paid in an effort to slow decades of relentless cost increases.\n \n The legislation arrived after a strong shove from President Obama at a White House meeting Monday, when he ordered Democratic House and Senate leaders to begin moving bills that have languished for months as opponents have gathered force and polls show public skepticism on the rise.\n \n (article in full at link)\n \n t r u t h o u t | House Democrats Unveil Landmark Health Care Legislation\n \n --------------------\n \n Given the influence of the healthcare industry's lobbyists on both major parties, I can't say this even closely competes with France's revolutionary spirit on that famous day, let alone their present day health care system, with a revolutionary ranking of #1 internationally, while ours is 37th and still dropping.\n \n On that note, single payer is the most obvious and sensible solution, and as proposed in HR 676 (Conyers) and the Senate version introduced by Sanders. Though I would be glad to see significant reform, even of this sort, go through. \n \n Now we look at the fine print. While comparing, too, to Congress' benefits. Which include dental and vision. (After they leave office, too.)\n \n Keeping in mind that, they should, indeed, be taxing the millionaires. In even greater amounts.\n \n Let them eat cake.",

Don't worry sir, your server Mrs. Pelosi will be by directly tell you your order. It will be out soon, Mr. Waxman is already plating it up. Not hungry you say? No problem, you can pay us for the meal anyway. Thank you for eating at the Trough of Ignorance Cafe.",

   "emoticon_xkill War in iraq- 500 billion, National Healthcare- 1.5 trillion, convincing a socialist that the government doesnt know best, priceless.\n \n Well here comes a debate I feared would return soon, I have never seen any politician propose something so counterproductive, costly, and socialist since the 800 billion stimulus package. Why would they even think about proposing that in the midst of a severe recession. It is just crazy that they would even try to get this past. No wonder people are standing up. No wonder the presidents approval rating has gone down. The government cannot run anything, with one exception of the military. Everything else they already run is not doing well. This is not th right thing to do. We need to improve upon our own system little by little, instead of changing completely, all at once.\n \n \n \n I was in a room on a bed dying, while they washed my brain with a dirty rag.- Unknown.",

   "The whole so called single payer, or public option solution being forced on us by the dems is a complete red herring and has no basis in reality when all is said and done. In other words, IT IS A LIE! The fact of the matter is that no private insurance companies can ever compete with the government in bringing insurance prices down since companies must figure out how to make a profit where as the government never concerns itself with making a profit.\n \n All it does is collect taxes and spend our money, so the inevitable result of this program will be to destroy the option of privately owned healthcare in america and place every middle and lower class american on the government controlled healthcare rationing roles. This is the reality which every american is becoming aware of and is why the masses are revolting against this final push for a truly socialist system which gives the government control over the very access to healthcare which submitting to this agenda will most assuredly accomplish.",

   "emoticon_wow In this case Mama, AKA the fed does not know best.\n In every plan the democrats propose I see one thing in common with all of the them, Spending money. Who knows what they are going to propose next. Another stimulus? Likely. The typical thing for democrats are that they think that the only way to get the country back on its feet is to put the government in complete control. I could go into huge detail in why this National Healthcare bill is counterproductive, costly, time-consuming, and socialist, but I want to sum it up with one point. The only thing the Dems care about is power.\n If you disagree with this, then feel free to reply, but I would really like to be convinced otherwise. This is a great nation, and it will only be great if power is always given to the people.\n \n \n \n -44j",
