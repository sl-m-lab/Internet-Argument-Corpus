   "Once More, Without Feeling: The GOP's misguided and confused campaign against judicial empathy.\n By Dahlia Lithwick\n Updated Monday, May 11, 2009, at 7:15 PM\n One is surely entitled to say that President Obama's repeated claim that he seeks \"empathy\" in a replacement for Justice David Souter is something less than a crisp constitutional standard. But the Republican war on empathy has started to border on the deranged, and you can't help but wonder to what purpose.\n \n Webster's defines empathy as \"the experiencing as one's own the feelings of another.\" Obama, in The Audacity of Hope, described empathy as \"a call to stand in somebody else's shoes and see through their eyes.\" To Obama, empathy chiefly means applying a principle his mother taught him: asking, \"How would that make you feel?\" before acting. Empathy in a judge does not mean stopping mid trial to tenderly clutch the defendant to your heart and weep. It doesn't mean reflexively giving one class of people an advantage over another because their lives are sad or difficult. When the president talks about empathy, he talks not of legal outcomes but of an intellectual and ethical process: the ability to think about the law from more than one perspective.\n \n But Republicans have gathered up their flaming torches and raised their fists to loudly denounce empathy and all empathy-based behavior as evil. Last Friday, RNC Chairman Michael Steele, sitting in for Bill Bennett on the Morning in America syndicated radio show, blurted out, \"Crazy nonsense empathetic! I'll give you empathy. Empathize right on your behind!\" Nice.\n\n The GOP's misguided and confusing campaign against judicial empathy. - By Dahlia Lithwick - Slate Magazine\n \n Poor heartless Republicans!\n \n What is it like to go through life without a heart?",

   "\n Poor heartless Republicans!\n \n What is it like to go through life without a heart?\n\n \n You deluded, flaming liberals should know.\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines that seeks to elevate the ways and \"wisdom\" of man above the wisdom and desires of God. Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal \"scholarship\" or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today's liberal elitists. \n \n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love,\" illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. \n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong,\" and \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it \"feels good, let's do it.\" The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their \"progressive\" mindset was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone \"over 30,\" and now they're over 30 and say, \"Trust us, and what we teach!\" Thank you, University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News - FOXNews.com Ward Churchill. \n \n One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is \"equality.\" The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to elevate women via the degradation of men, promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than relying on one's own personal initiative and work ethic), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance.\" However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom,\" liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws (note Canada), and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. \n \n It is certainly arguable, then, that \"progressive\" liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence. - Author Unknown",

However there are numerous reports of intimidation of the media by pro Ch\u00e1vez gangs that have been alleged to have issued violent threats against the media that does not support him. Ch\u00e1vez moved to start restrictions on the media with vaguely worded legislation that could allow him to suppress political content, although the initial scope of the law was restrictions on pornographic and violent content.\n \n In mid-March of 2005 Ch\u00e1vez passed legislation further clamping down on the press, by broadening controls on how the press can report articles deemed \"disrespectful\" or \"insulting\" of the government. Sentencing for such transgressions ranges between 20 and 40 months incarceration, depending on the gravity of the offense. Moreover laws have been passed against the media, tightening controls on what would be considered slanderous, carrying sentences up to 30 months and what would amount to tens of thousands of US dollars in fines.\n \n Numerous human rights organizations have expressed great concern over the incremental restrictions imposed by the Ch\u00e1vez regime on the Venezuelan media .\n \n ...\n \n Supreme Court\n To solidify his control over the Venezuelan Supreme Court, Ch\u00e1vez passed legislation in May 2003 to increase the number of Supreme Court Justices from 20 to 32 and appointing another 5 vacant posts, giving him a clear majority in the judicial branch of the government. He also allowed for the appointment of 32 reserve justices, all of which are loyal to him. It should also be noted that former justices were forced to resign after several \"politically sensitive rulings\". Many are very concerned that with the control of the courts, Chavez seems to have consolidated control over the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the government.\n \n\n \n Venezuelan democracy is a joke, just like Iranian democracy.\n \n Though communists always like to think there's some social class oppression or something. I'm not whining about how I think I'm being oppressed by rich people, even though I live in a lower-middle class family. The leftist hatred for success has roots in envy.",
