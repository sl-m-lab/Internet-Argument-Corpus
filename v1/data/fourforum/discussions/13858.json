How do you resolve this? How do you get them to agree when they have different angles on the issue? \n \n Each party does not agree. This means they will have to agree to disagree. There has to be a degree of respect that does not infringe upon the conscience of each recipient. If the secular establishment wants to force what it believes is right upon the religious person who thinks differently then that would not be showing due respect. \"Discrimination\" also needs to be defined. Is it discriminatory to look at an issue differently? No, it is not. The homosexual person needs to recognise that his or her sexual orientation is seen by others to be morally wrong. They may well believe it is simply a result of who they are. They may well believe that it is simply a result of the way they have been made. However, if others believe they have not been made that way and that their sexual orientation is a result of a lifestyle choice, that at a fundamental level is morally wrong, then this needs to be respected.\n\n \n Hey all right let's ask the tough questions. How about how to solve world hunger and peace by the weekend as a follow up?\n \n In the US we try to create a level playing field, emphasis on try. That means niether side is really going to get what they want. The best is usually what will they accept without marching in the streets.\n \n It isn't quite the same as racial issues or female rights, but both have relevaent aspects. A better example I believe is religion itself. Religion is definitly a choice. You may be born Christian, but that doesn't mean you are or will be. You can accept, change to another, go back anf then never think of it again. Being Christian, believe it or not you enjoy a great deal of freedom to practice your religion as you see fit. That wasn't always so. Going back to that level playing field. We don't force people to not think all black people steal or women are not smart or Jews are greedy or Christians are racist. Anyone is allowed to think all those and even express those views. What we do say is you have to act fairly. \n \n History has shown repeatedly that once the repressed are free they tend to celebrate by becoming oppressive themselves. By keeping things even everybody gets a piece of cake. Religion gets to do pretty much whatever it wants except when it comes to creating an unfair environment. Which to me is like playing Russian roulette. You start rearranging what is fair and one day it might be Baptists being told by Catholics or Muslims telling Christians or vice versa.\n \n I am curious though why gays are such a hot button. I mean Jesus specifically stated divorce and adultery are bad bad and bad. Christians don't protest about divorce laws or want to make adultery a crime. Jesus didn't say a word about gays, but they may as well be running around with horns a tail and a pentagram still smoking burned on their foreheads. \n \n I understand the bible says it's wrong, but why is this wrong so deserving of the attention it receives over other wrongs more prevalent and/or determined worse in the bible?",

   "Again I ask you: if the person were black and the one refusing the service was religiously opposed to black people--and in this country this was at one time a widespread phenomenon--or Jewish people, or Muslim, instead of gay, would that, in this day and age, warrant such behavior?\n\n \n Nobody can alter the colour of their skin. You are born a certain skin colour and that's it. Skin colour is a physical reality that cannot be denied. \n \n Now, a biblical church would argue that a homosexual lifestyle comes through choice. A homosexual person would respond by saying they were born that way. Who is right? Maybe this can be answered only through biological evidence. Until that happens we have a stalemate. I would argue that since heterosexuality is easily the predominant type of sexuality seen in \"human nature\" it is true to say that homosexuality is simply a lifestyle choice that does indeed conflict with that which is natural. Consider this: Homosexuality does not make sense in an evolutionary worldview. Why would \"evolution\" operate in such a way so as to produce a homosexual person since that would impact upon the survival value of the person in question? Procreation in the human race is dependent upon there being a male and female. \n \n \nLet me give you what may (or may not be) a parallel example: What if the \"job request\" is for medical services? In this country, we've had religion-based hospitals refuse medical care to homosexuals that were literally at death's door. \n \n It's one thing to be able to hold an opinion and speak or write that opinion. It's another when that opinion has a demonstrable affect on another person's life or right to a service.\n\n \n I do not see this as being a parallel example. Firstly, no true Christian hospital should ever refuse medical care to a homosexual person, and if they did I would argue they are not Christian. \n \n Here is something that I just cannot understand. Why would a homosexual person want to work for an organisation that views homosexuality as being morally wrong? In the case of hospitals, why apply to a hospital that only employs Christians, for example, when there are plenty of hospitals that would employ people who are homosexual? Why go down that road? Why should Christian adoption agencies have to close because they refuse to accept homosexual partners? Why can't homosexuals respect their ethos and apply somewhere else? Why do they get so angry to the point that they sue the Christian adoption agency? \n \n I believe in homosexual rights, they have the same rights as all, with the exception that they cannot and should not force their belief and practise upon another entity that holds to a different set of values and beliefs. \n \n In the world today there are many independent organisations. It's been that way for a very long time. Should these independent organisations bow to the state or do they not have the freedom to operate according to their ethos? \n \n I have rights like any other. But, do I have the right to be accepted for a job by a political party if I do not agree with their policies? \n \n How could I possibly hope to work for a political party if I did not hold to the core ethos of what the party believed? There are many jobs in politics that are universal between parties, for example an office clerk. What sense would it make for someone who is Republican to apply for a job working for the Democratic Party??",

For example, some pupils have learning difficulties and would not be able to cope with the work load, etc, of the other pupils. \n \n In the case of the church, we believe that segregation is necessary with regards to the faith and practise of an individual. No homosexual person should ever be turned away from attending a church. But, if that person wanted to become a member of the church (which would require them becoming a Christian) they would need to either give up their homosexual lifestyle or forfeit becoming a member.

   "Now, a biblical church would argue that a homosexual lifestyle comes through choice. A homosexual person would respond by saying they were born that way. Who is right? Maybe this can be answered only through biological evidence. Until that happens we have a stalemate.\nActually, there are mountains of evidence that we were \"born that way,\" all of which are routinely dismissed by Christians for whom that evidence is inconvenient. \n \n It is well documented that homosexuality is widespread thoughout nature, not just among humans. \n \n And if you would like me to post links documenting that the results of the many peer-reviewed studies concluding that there is a yet-undetermined biological cause to homosexuality, I will happily do so. (You can, however, find them on past posts in this forum, as well as many threads that have covered this topic in the past. This argument is not exactly a new one.) \n \n And what is your reaction to this fact: not one medical or sociological professional organization in the world considers homosexuality either a disease or a \"lifestyle choice.\" If it were the latter, why would anyone make such a choice, especially given that homosexuality is still illegal in 80 countries and punishable by death in five of them? What would be the motive for opening yourself to that level of discrimination or, more basically, rejecting what you would claim to be an innate heterosexuality to have emotional and sexual relations, to the point of wanting to marry, someone of the same sex, which--if we're not naturally inclined toward it--we should find repellent? \nI would argue that since heterosexuality is easily the predominant type of sexuality seen in \"nature\" it is true to say that homosexuality is simply a lifestyle choice that does indeed conflict with that which is natural.\n When did something that is not \"predominant\" become unnatural? Red hair is not predominant. Are redheads \"unnatural\"? Is being a redhead a \"lifestyle choice\"? It is well-documented that homosexuality is widespread thoughout nature, not just among humans. Are homosexual animals just making a \"lifestyle\" choice? Consider the thousands of people who fork out thousands of dollars to enter fraudulent \"conversion therapy\" programs to change their sexual nature. Why spend all that money if they can just \"un-choose\"? And why, despite the fact that the overwhelming number those who enter these (largely Christian) programs are highly-motivated to change, the programs have such a high percentage of failures? \n \n I would also add that one's religious belief most definitely IS a choice. Should we be able to discriminate against those whose religious beliefs our conscience strongly objects to, because they could \"change\" if they just put there minds to it?\nConsider this: Homosexuality does not make sense in an evolutionary worldview. Why would \"evolution\" operate in such a way so as to produce a homosexual person since that would impact upon the survival value of the person in question? Procreation in the human race is dependent upon there being a male and female. \n Consider this: homosexuality has existed since ancient times, yet the world is overcrowded to the point of using up its food, water, and other resources to an alarming degree. If there were no homosexuality, for all we know the human race might have overpopulated itself out of existence by now. You see, there are other ways an individual can benefit the species than simply adding to its numbers--adopting children abandoned by their natural parents, for one thing. \n \n Have you bothered googling \"homosexuality\" and \"evolution\"? After you wade through the myriad Christian-based sites making the same argument you've made, you'll find a number of science-based theories of why homosexuality is well documented as having persisted through all of recorded human existence (as long ago as ancient Egypt, anyway), in all eras and cultures. Regardless of WHY it has, however, the simple undeniable fact is that it HAS, and therefore must not have a detrimental effect on the propogation of the species.\n Firstly, no true Christian hospital should ever refuse medical care to a homosexual person, and if they did I would argue they are not Christian.\n This is a textbook example of the \"No True Scotsman\" fallacy: Atheism: Logic & Fallacies\n Furthermore, not only are there myriad cases of religious healthcare discrimination against gays (there was one a few years ago about a gay man turned away from a hospital in the snow no less, but I'm still searching for a link), but in his final moments in office, George W.Bush issued a federal rule that would allow a healthcare practioner to refuse to treat a gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender person for moral or religious reasons.\n \n \nHere is something that I just cannot understand. Why would a homosexual person want to work for an organisation that views homosexuality as being morally wrong? In the case of hospitals, why apply to a hospital that only employs Christians, for example, when there are plenty of hospitals that would employ people who are homosexual? \n You may have missed it, but jobs are exceedingly scarce these days. Is it right or moral, in these exceedingly troubled times, to deny employment to an otherwise qualified individial because one's chosen interpretation of an agrarian culture's mutually inconsistent oral records alleging the existence of a unverifiable supernatural ultra-being and transcribed millennia before the now widely accepted scientific and medical concept of homosexual sexual orientation was even hinted at, says it is?\n \n I agree with you to the point that I wouldn't want to work for employers who felt I was an \"abomination,\" and don't understand why anyone else would, but under current conditions, and in certain areas of the country, beggars can't afford to be choosers.\n \n \nWhy should Christian adoption agencies have to close because they refuse to accept homosexual partners? Why can't homosexuals respect their ethos and apply somewhere else? Why do they get so angry to the point that they sue the Christian adoption agency?\n If the agency purports up front to be discriminatory, you may have a point. (Do they deny adoption to Jews and atheists as well?) Can you link to a case where such an agency actually had to close? They couldn't find enough straight people to keep them in business? What happened to the children? Was the agency's \"ethos\" more important than finding them a home? \n\n I believe in homosexual rights, they have the same rights as all, with the exception that they cannot and should not force their belief and practise upon another entity that holds to a different set of values and beliefs.\n Let me say that I respect your civil tone and sincerity of your intentions. They are a far cry from the shrill hysteria we usually see on these forums from the more extreme religious posters. (You've no doubt read some of their posts by now, as they're extremely prolific in that regard.) You must understand, however, that gay people are not forcing any belief or practice on anyone. Being homosexual is not a \"belief,\" a \"lifestyle,\" or world view. It's just something that a lot of people ARE, and many of whom--contrary to the absurd \"choice\" claim--don't even want to be. My lifestyle is not the lifestyle of many of my gay friends, and is worlds removed from the salacious stereotypical charicature painted by Biblical literalists in the same way the Japanese were portrayed as bucktoothed slant-eyed demons in World War II. (It's called \"demonizing the enemy.\") \n \n We're not trying to \"turn\" anyone gay. That's a long-discredited notion that continues to be perpetrated by religious anti-gay organizations and that people who don't know any better, and haven't bothered to do any research outside of themselves or even seriously thought about, continue to unthinkingly accept as fact. \n \n We just want to be able to live our lives the same way everyone else does, with the same rights to life, liberty and happiness (which includes being able to marry the person we love--an emotion our opponents continually discount). We push back and become vocal only because we are denied those rights, when we're threatened, lied about, and treated as lepers.",

However the parallels are slightly similar on certain aspects. Let me explain.\n \n Gay people for example have not gone through years of slavery and degradation to that exact level. To try and compare the two would be a fallacy of sheer ignorance since we have never been slaves nor segregated on a national level in society.\n \n However, discrimination facing gay people faces similar overtones.

So that can be argued to not be exclusive to gay people alone.\n \n The prejudices we face are of a different sort. Our prejudice is more calculated, more exact and less broad. Due to a certain ignorance of gay people and a certain assumption or assumptions our prejudices stem from conflict of interest....\n \n The root of some of the most vile crimes toward gay people such as the murder of Matthew Sheppard can coincide with the calculated hatred the clan had towards black people or the civil rights workers during the early 50's and 60's.\n \n It is that cold calculated methodical and often deadly anger and unbridled rage that I personally see to be the real parallel between the two types of prejudice.

   "As a believer who is a member of a full gospel evangelical church, I can attest to the FACT that we have members of families in our church who are committed homosexuals, and they come to our church whenever that want to with no fear of rejection or expulsion ever, by any member there. We have a lesbian couple who attends almost weekly and they are received with open arms by one and all, including the Pastor and his wife. \n \n The only time we would have issue with them is if they stood before the church and attempted to promote homosexuality as being right and normal according to the bible. But even then all the Pastor would do is correct their spiritual error, not evict them. So this argument by the opposition that true bible believing churches have some vendetta against homosexuals because of their lifestyle is erroneous on all counts. We deal with them will love and acceptance at all times. Our only oppositions lies with the very secular homosexual culture which attempt to slander what we represent with lies and misinformation.\n\n \n I am glad that you raised this point because it gives me a chance to explain why I maintain that a church should be able to exclude people practising gay sex.\n There are two reasons\n One is that I believe that any church should have the right to exclude unrepentant sinners from attending .\n They should have a choice..there should be no laws preventing it .\n Certainly not in the same way as a golf club could exclude black people, women or Jews for instance.\n The second is that I suspect that there is a real hatred of the Christian church out there and there will be many attempts to marginalise religions with the Christian church in particular in the near future.\n I believe that many people who would like to see churches legally obliged to accept anyone within any part of the church whether they are believers or not.\n I dont think that they should be LEGALLY obliged to do anything of the sort.",

But in no way would I accept being forced to accept homosexuality as spiritually right and normal according to the bible. That is asking us to compromise our values and is wrong on all counts.\n\n \n First I agree religion should not be recquired to perform a marriage ceremony for anybody that is clearly an affront to their faith. Just as I wouldn't support a law recquireing The United Negro Fund to give preferential consideration to white supremicists. \n \n Having said that let's see if you are expressing your views honestly. Because honestly I think of you as a stand up philosopher. \n \n If I understand you correctly, if it wasn't prohibited by the bible you would be at least indifferent to gay people. Neither for or against not withstanding a dislike of certain individuals who happened to be gay, but not the group as a whole. Your issue is the idea of laws being enacted that would require religious groups to perform marriage or other religious ceremonies which are in direct conflict with doctrine.\n \n So here is the test. Although I don't think it's a key part of what gays want, would you oppose state recognition of civil unions that are legally the equivalent of marriage or same sex couples going to the Justice of the Peace or similar and leave with all the rights and obligations of opposite sex couples. Religious institutions that do not wish to perform ceremonies in conflict with doctrine may legally refrain from doing so.\n \n Sounds like everybody gets pretty much what they want within reason.\n \n Religion doesn't want that though does it. They are not content with freedom to worship as they see fit. They feel compelled and are directed to impose their beliefs on everybody. They feel justified because they believe they are right and everyone else is wrong. I have given a solution that gives religion the protection you claim is all you want and provides gays with what they want. Is that acceptable to you? If not, why?\n \n You seem to think that the militant gays are pushing the gay agenda with the primary objective being the obliteration of religion. What total trash. Gays are militant because they have the nerve to be vocal with their frustration at being ridiculed, beaten, killed, discriminated against and been subject to emotional and financial hardship from a legal system that doesn't recognize their relationships with one another. Is it their wish to want a stop to these things that makes them militant? Is it because having been pushed to the edge they push back? IS an agenda that looks to prevent what I have described something to look at as perilous to the nation or even religion? \n \n Individuals have the right to vote their conscience, but our nation is founded on the principals of freedom and equality. It may not always work perfect, but it does work. Protections exist in cases when conscience conflicts or attempts to undermine freedom and equality. Religion enjoys the benefits of that idea, as it should, but it should not be permitted to deny it to another. Your religious beliefs are yours, when you attempt to force them onto others you run the risk of succeeding and thereby potentially subjecting yourself to the same loss of protection or what is being experience now, a backlash from other groups who fear they may be next. \n \n Do you not see something wrong with trying to protect your freedoms by using them to prevent others from having them? If you want to inject religion into government then religion must be prepared to conform to the idea of equal treatment for those who don't believe like you do. If you can't, then don't. It's not complicated, stop making it something it isn't.",

You posted that not the general public, you selected those two groups and posted it, no one else.\n \n I post a link so maybe you can educate yourself since you are told about Bayard Rustin and your response is Wow how come this isn't more well known? Because you don't care to know. Had you looked at the link or spent 2 minutes looking yourself maybe you would have known. \n \n \n \n I understand my post just fine. Your the one whose back peddling and contradicting yourself. \n \n Bottom line it's your opinion that was expressed. Which comes from you. Which makes it about you. What else do you call it when you look down on people thinking there has never been any really significant people that was a part of that group, without even looking to confirm that. Why because you already know everything and so there wasn't a need.\n \n You'll deny it, but your just fooling yourself.\n\n \n I really dont see how you cannot understand such a simple point.\n Because there are no role models of the calibre of the black role models mentioned does not mean they dont exist, it means they are not being promoted.\n I have tried to state this in very simple terms but it seems you cannot grasp it.\n You really are are nincompoop.\n Please learn to reademoticon_xclown",

   "Right side of the law.... Please and by your law you'd be throwing rocks at my head outside the city gate....

   "The issue of homosexuality is never going to be resolved between true biblical Christianity and secular politics. Secular politics looks at homosexuality as simply a natural lifestyle, just like any other. Biblical Christianity looks at homosexuality as a moral issue. They look at homosexuality differently. How do you resolve this? How do you get them to agree when they have different angles on the issue? \n \n Each party does not agree. This means they will have to agree to disagree. There has to be a degree of respect that does not infringe upon the conscience of each recipient. If the secular establishment wants to force what it believes is right upon the religious person who thinks differently then that would not be showing due respect. \"Discrimination\" also needs to be defined. Is it discriminatory to look at an issue differently? No, it is not. The homosexual person needs to recognise that his or her sexual orientation is seen by others to be morally wrong. They may well believe it is simply a result of who they are. They may well believe that it is simply a result of the way they have been made. However, if others believe they have not been made that way and that their sexual orientation is a result of a lifestyle choice, that at a fundamental level is morally wrong, then this needs to be respected.\n\n You cannot expect someone to \"agree to disagree\" on what they consider a moral violation. You must show it to be moral or amoral.",

It was 3% that separated the margin for prop 8.\n \n \nThere is no guaranteed right to marry a member of the same sex.\n\n \n Well that much is clear..... However I sure would like to have the same rights as other married couples.....\n \n \nThe \"system\" was circumvented by activist gays that used the judicial branch to make law that was counter to the people's will. The people then used the power of the ballot to trump the activist court. \n\n \n Actually, I disagree. Sure the San Fransisco deal was a little over the top personally but it was certain groups who painted the prop 8 issue as a gay witch hunt. Seriously showing gay couples as a danger to children??? It's 1977 all over again. The same tired scare tactics....\n \n \n \nIIRC, gay marriage lost in every state ballot initiative.

Your rhetoric should be directed towards positive aspects, not continuous attempts to get the courts to ram gay marriage down the public's throat.\n\n \n First of all there is no rhetoric? I don't even donate to so called gay rights groups because personally I don't like big machines even big gay machines.... Their big, and dirty and personally I think their out of touch.\n \n \n The biggest issue here is that there is SO much infighting between these tired old queens!! I mean if you go onto any and I mean any gay political blog like towelroad or something it is the same old tired bitching back and forth back and forth.\n \n \n The gay community is so split it's not even funny. It's pathetic.... Back in the days of Harvey Milk everyone had something to lose! I mean anyone could have been stabbed walking home in the Castro or lost their job for being gay....\n \n People have lost sight of that, and personally it seems to be that alot of elitist queens could give two shits about \"rights\" their all in it for themselves.\n \n I honestly think that we as a community got where we are today with domestic partnerships and anti discrimination because the movement was built upon the shoulders of everyone working together. Everyone marched, everyone cared cause frankly everyone had something to lose....\n \n And well since AIDS hit in the 80's and killed alot of the activists then, there really was a huge gap. Now it's just splintered. I really think if there is to be any progress the in fighting has to stop.\n \n If it doesn't and it continues everything will just splinter and fall apart. Like you and I both agree on there is a huge PR issue with gay people...\n \n Mostly because there already are alot of cliches and such.... There really is no grassroots direction.... If only Harvey were still alive...",
