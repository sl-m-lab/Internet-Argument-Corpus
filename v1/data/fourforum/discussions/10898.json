All other explanations include some form of intelligent, purposeful organization. If that organizing intelligence is internal, that would make it no less no less intelligent. Theism is compatible with the concept of a natural organizing intelligence, but theism is not the only alternative to materialism. For instance:\n \n All living systems have some ability to respond to stimuli, intelligently and purposefully. Inanimate objects do not. All living systems have some of our own ability to override automatic function in times of emergency, and make novel, fallible, spontaneous, subjective choices. Living systems have ability to monitor their own level of function, recognize weaknesses, and to explore novel responses. Furthermore if function is not immediately restored, intelligently organized biological systems have the ability to explore other possibilities immediately, without being removed from action by \"natural selection\". \n \n If some people choose to call the creative intelligence of nature \"god\", I have no objection. As an agnostic, I don't speculate about the origin of mass, energy, electromagnetism, gravity, creative intelligence -- or anything else. Fanatical evangelical atheists would be the only people who feel obligated to do battle against the term \"intelligent design\".\n \n http://30145.myauthorsie.com/\n\n \n I would take issue with some of the above. For instance, there are many instences of beings acting with a sort of 'hive intelligence' like that of colonies of Ants. There are species of ants that actually 'Farm' aphids for their nectar. Any individual ant couldn't grasp what they are doing as a whole but it would be quite a stretch to say that there are 'Ant Gods' controlling the colony.\n I used to be a strong Agnostic, supporting the sort of Clockmaker image of god. However, the more I study Cosmology and Physics, the more I see that God isn't in the numbers.\n If most people subscribed to \"Nature as God\" idea, I wouldn't have a problem with that. The issue I take is with the people walking around damning everyone who doesn't subscribe to their EXACT beliefs to hell. Or the more radical types who think their god wants them to strap on a suicide vest. Catholicism has cost the human race almost 2000 years of development. Look at what we've done in the last couple hundred years since the church began to lose its power...",

   "So before Archie derails yet another thread, I'd like to take another stab at the original question. Intelligent trees mucking with their own DNA aside, if the \"intelligent designer\" isn't a god, then what could it be? About all I can come up with is aliens. David Brin does an interesting job playing with the idea in his Uplift series, but what he describes there doesn't cover the scenario described by creationists. We basically need aliens that can alter the DNA of living things all over the planet on a constant basis without leaving any other sort of physical evidence. IE, aliens with god-like powers. Can anyone else come up with any ideas?\n \n For the record, I know the IDers are actually talking about God, and think they're cleverly duping people with their word play. I'm just engaging in an intellectual excersise here.\n\n \n If there was some god that was the creator, then who created the creator?",

   "Panspermia aside. There is a HUGE difference between a sort of semi-cognizant Nature as a guiding hand and G.O.D. as in knows when you are sleeping, knows when you're awake, knows if you've been bad or good...\n \n That said. The fact that there is a very high probability that there were at least simple lifeforms on Mars long ago when that planet was much warmer and wetter than it is now. To me that argues for the propensity of the self organizing nature of life. In our 1 little solar system, that 2 planets would at least begin to form life, even simple life argues against God with a capital G doing it. I mean, obviously Mars didn't work out too well as a garden of eden. Right there, that shows fallibility on the part of any god that created it and it shows a high likelihood of starting anytime the right elements and temperatures are brought together in combination. Now any fallible god is no god whatsoever. \n http://euro.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2556&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0\n \n http://meteoritics.org/index.htm \n We (as humans) are nearly at the point of being able to create life from nothing. I'm not saying that WE are gods. But I'm quite sure that there's no big man in the sky keeping tabs on us. There's no purpose for it and there is certainly enough proof of 'false starts' and 'bad adaptations' that led to extinctions and etc... Again that argues against the hand of god making everything run like clockwork. Why would god purposely screw things up time and time again with branches of existences that just won't pass muster. \n That's why they arrested Galileo, he showed that the heavens and Earth weren't perfect and the thought that the heavenly sphere's weren't perfect was too much to bear, since God would only make things that work perfectly.\n \n \n Speaking of odds, AA, technically given enough space and atoms there will, eventually, through random combinations, be another person that looks just me arguing the other side of this issue....emoticon_xgood",

In that case I'd have to go back to the \"the whole point is Man\" answer. If the whole point is to set the stage for people, why not have things go extinct or take billions of years to do it? Time is meaningless to a God so there's no reason for him not to take his time having us show up. And all the lifeforms that were there before people may have been no more than biomass. Something had to be living in order to set the stage for us, but the exact species weren't important, so there was no reason to set things up such that nothing ever went extinct. You're looking at extinction as evidence of imperfection, but that would only be true if God wanted all species to last forever.

If the chunk of rock found in Antarctica truly shows that life started on a younger, warmer Mars as well, would that show fallibility? \n\n If you want to show fallability you need to show 1) That God wanted X to happen, and 2) that X didn't happen. Since God is defined as an omnipotent being that works in mysterious ways it's going to be pretty much impossible for you to prove point 1, for pretty much any circumstance. If life started on Mars and then ended up here, there's no way to show that that wasn't exactly what he wanted. You can't just keep coming up with scenarios that aren't neat and tidy, you need to show that God didn't want things to happen that way.\n \n \n\n Further, why would an omnipotent God bother to wait around for us when he could create the perfect conditions at any time? \n\n \n I did cover this before. For an immortal being the passage of time is meaningless, so why wouldn't he \"wait\", it would make no difference to him.
