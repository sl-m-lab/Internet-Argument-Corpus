   "Felos is a emoticon_xclown \n If he had such an ability which he himself claimed in the book, why didn't this 'communicating' lawyer tap into Terri and ask her directly what she wanted? emoticon_wow What better source for one's wishes than the one who is in such a state.\n \n But I find this interesting. According to the media, most people favored Terri being allowed to 'die.' I think those polls were slanted and people who were asked did not know much of the facts. Here's a tidbit on a Zogby poll. Didn't hear much about this one -\n \nPolls leading up to the death of Terri Schiavo made it appear Americans had formed a consensus in favor of ending her life. However, a new Zogby poll with fairer questions shows the nation clearly supporting Terri and her parents and wanting to protect the lives of other disabled patients. \n \n The Zogby poll found that, if a person becomes incapacitated and has not expressed their preference for medical treatment, as in Terri's case, 43 percent say \"the law presume that the person wants to live, even if the person is receiving food and water through a tube\" while just 30 percent disagree.\n \n Another Zogby question [bears] directly on Terri's circumstances.\n \n \"If a disabled person is not terminally ill, not in a coma, and not being kept alive on life support, and they have no written directive, should or should they not be denied food and water,\" the poll asked.\n \n A whopping 79 percent said the patient should not have food and water taken away while just 9 percent said yes.
