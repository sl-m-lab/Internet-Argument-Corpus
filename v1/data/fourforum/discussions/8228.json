Many churches teach woman should not preach, and as usual they are teaching what is according to the Bible, unscriptural.\n \n According to Scripture there were several woman messengers who proclaimed the good news (Matt. 28:1-10; Luke 24:9-11; John 4:28-30; 20:16-18). In Acts we have a prediction that God will pour out of His Spirit in the last days \"UPON ALL FLESH; and your sons and DAUGHTERS shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams; and upon my servants and upon my HANDMAIDENS I will pour out of my Spirit and they will prophesy.\" Prophesying is explained in 1 Cor. 14:3-4 as \"speaking unto MEN to edification and exhortation and comfort.\" Thats preaching, teaching, praying, in anyones language. and God says He will pour out His Spirit upon men and WOMEN to enable them to do this!\n These following passages prove to any unbiased mind that prophesying is for the church which has men and WOMEN members (1 Cor. 12:1-13; 14:1-6, 12, 24-26, 29-33).\n In Acts 21:8-9 we read Philip had four daughters that did prophecy or preach in the early church. \n In Romans 16 we have Phebe, Priscilla, Mary Junia, Tryphosa, Persis, all female names, women mentioned as laborers in the gospel.\n In Phil. 4:2-3 we have Euodias and Syntyche, two women who are emntioned as leaders in the local church at Philippi. They are refered to as \"those WOMEN which labored with me in the Gospel.\"\n \n Paul speakes of the Corinthian women prophesying and praying in church (1 Cor. 11:4; 14:1-5, 23-26). \n \n When paul said for women to \"keep silence in the church\" he was not speaking of women prophesying or praying, but he referred to asking their husbands certain things at church. He said, \"If they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home\" and not in the church (1 Cor. 14:34-35). But that they could speak and prophecy and pray in church is clear from 1 Cor. 11:4; 14:3-4, 23-26; and Acts 2:16-21.\n \n Women have been used in all ages by God, Read (Ex. 15:20; Judges 4:4; 2 Kings 22:14; 2 Chron. 34:22; Neh. 6:14; Isa. 8:3; Luke 1:39-56; 2:36).

Priests are men who carry out sacrifices. The apostles were the first priests to continue the memorial sacrifice of the Last Supper that paralleled Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. Jesus told them to \"do this in memory of me.\" So this sacrifice must be carried on eternally until Jesus comes again. Jesus is made present in this sacrifice throughout time and space.\n \n The Catholic Church's teaching on why women cannot become priests has to do with the Tradition that Jesus chose 12 men for his apostles and was telling us something by doing this. A more thorough explanation, however, can be found in Pope John Paul II's Theology of the Body. It has to do with the idea that men and women are equal in dignity but not identical in role or attributes. Just as a woman cannot be a husband nor a father, she cannot be a priest. A man cannot be a mother nor a wife (nor a nun).",
