   "Got any proof that Archangel said this?\n\n \n You must realize that obvious_childs name is specific and accurate in defining his debating style. He will take what I don't say and assume from that that I'm arguing in the affirmative on an issue. Just like a 12 year old might think, although to be fair child does have around 7 years or so on a 12 year old. Unfortunately he hasn't matured beyond that age so this is the quality of debate we get from him. See post 142, here: http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/12469-war-terror-hoax-4.html#post351632 This was the post which he used to take an issue I wasn't specifically focusing on to create his usual strawman argument. \n \n Notice the extensive post which he ignored in order to focus on the slightest perceived hole which wasn't even the focus of my post. Here's my complete post to Charlie in context as I responded to his post, and then see what little child gleans from it to attack me over.\n Hmm...not sure this will have relevance but..\n \n How many times has America declared wars on something that can never be won?\n \n Communism, war on drugs, war on prostitution, etc etc it's all the same thing and it never works to declare war on such things like this. You simply can't declare war on an ideal. It makes it impossible to win and quite frankly it's stupid. \n\n \n The cold war wasn't a shooting war charlie, it was a philosophical battle over differing political ideologies. And the war on drugs and prostitution etc. are terms of intent but also not shooting wars.\n \n The reason why mutually assured destruction worked was because the USSR wasn't a suicidal ideology which looked toward paradise existing in another plain of consciousness as radical islam does. When all was said and done, they wanted to survive to enjoy the fruits of their victory over the west.\n \n Islam has no such hang ups and would gladly nuke their own countries if they believed doing so would destroy us also. After all, to their way of thinking they are just sending faithful moslems they kill to paradise as martyrs.\n \n \nYou can't win all the time by forcing people, that just makes people angrier. Also, our support for certain regimes and their agendas (that sometimes are quite wrong) makes enemies. If there is anyone to blame, it is us, for having such arrogance into thinking the world loves us and that no one can touch us.\n\n \n Your reasoning distorts what our agenda is in fighting terrorism charlie. I have no interest in forcing people to think a certain way. What I do support is ridding the world of an ideology which uses murder, violence and fear to control their masses, and is fighting in order to impose that same control over us. \n \n You guys seem oblivious to the fact that this enemy has no conscience, no love for humanity at all. They are fighting in order to force the world into submission to their false god which according to their own actions defines evil such as this modern age has never dreamt could exist in a civilized world. You so easily ignore the link above which documents 10s of thousands of innocent civilian dead just since 2001. That list goes back to the 60s and if you want to search history, it goes all the way back to Mohammed who founded this evil ideology. \n \n So this isn't about forcing people to think as we do in capitalism or our pop culture. It is about freeing them to live in freedom from this violent and oppressive ideology which currently controls more than a billion people on Earth.\n \n \n Archangel, how can you also ignore our support for such nations that use rather questionable methods to keep stability? Israel are not angels, they have done pretty horrible things to people (I remember in one instance where a British journalist was killed by Israeli soldiers, even though he made sure they knew who he was.) and Saudi Arabia who is a big human rights violator. If you think this won't anger people, I have a bridge to sell you. It is our fault for supporting totalitarian and authoritarian regimes. It is our fault that we give money to these regimes, of which, they use to keep those people down. In the end it's really about money. \n\n \n I'm not here to defend any of the allies we have, some of which are almost as bad as the enemies we face in radical islam charlie. What separates these allies from the radicals is that these allies understand that we must all coexist in order to succeed as a world wide community. The radicals don't. They have adopted a scorched earth policy which means they will destroy anything and anyone they cannot win over for allah. \n \n Just as saddam Husein whom these schmucks have been defending did when he blew up 900 active oil wells in Kuwait which spewed black carbon smoke with all of the carcinogens and pollutants it contained into the atmosphere for months, and dumped untold millions of gallons of raw crude oil into the persian gulf, purposely killing wildlife and polluting the coast for hundreds of miles. He acted upon the belief that if he couldn't have Kuwait, he would burn it before leaving. According to your sides rationalizing, that was the coalitions fault for forcing him out of Kuwait.\n \n \nThe rich get richer and poorer get poorer, what are the poor to do? When someone offers them an opportunity to attack those they think have done major damage to them they take it. What do they have to lose after all? Islamic extremism provides this opportunity to them. If you remove the underlying cause of this, I assure you that Islamic extremism will die down rather quickly, but if you keep on supporting these governments and their way of doing things, nothing will stop them, but like I said, there's money in it.\n\n \n Although I agree with your synopsis of the over all problem, disagree completely with your inference that islam provides any type of solution for them. IT IS THE PROBLEM! For all the reasons mentioned above. \n \n I know as the simple person that I am that if the wealthy west had combined their wealth and resources 50 year ago which is how long we have been debating third world poverty, hunger and despair, that we could have wiped out 3rd world poverty and disease by now. All it takes is common sense which obviously all of the powers that be on earth combined are lacking. Either that or these powers that be have knowingly and purposely planned and manipulated world events in order to maintain an atmosphere of chaos and confusion as they made sure they were positioned to profit on every level of that chaos.\n \n Obviously this is just a personal belief which is based on nothing more than my conviction that if the powers that be really wanted to fix this world, then they could have truly accomplished it in the last 50 years with the advent of all of the wealth and technological advances which Man has accomplished in that period of time. But with all the dictators, despots and tyrants we have had to deal with in those 50 years, we had one thing in common with all of them. They, like us wanted to survive at the end of the day. Radical islam has no such compunctions as personal survival. It's their ideology which they are fighting for, not themselves. There is no way to negotiate with such an enemy. The only recourse is to destroy them.",
