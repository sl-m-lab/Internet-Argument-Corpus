First off, he maintains that the Justices are unqualified...not sure what he bases this on though. He then says they want to through out the constitution. No backing for that either and actually quit the opposite. He then makes some good points regarding our Media is 'dumbed\" down. I agree but he harps on it for 5 minutes...I sure hope he doesn't claim to be a valid news source.\n \n CSPAN is where it is at.",
