   "Nah, there will probably be far worse possibilities arrise before the eventual destruction of the entire planet. Somehow someone will invent something so powerful that if used anywhere on the planet it will kill everything. I doubt that nanotech will be the destruction of us all. It could actually end up being a very powerful tool and help us expand our civilization beyond just this planet. Human genetic tweaking would also benefit us in this way. Personally I consider this time to be one of great peace and don't believe there will be a major war between any of the largest nations any time soon. If there was to be one then it doesn't matter whether it is fought with advanced nanotech, lasers, blackholes, or plain old nuclear weapons, it will still have the same end result.",

   "Assemblers (as these type of nanobots are referred to so that they are distinguished from more conventional nanotech like non-circuitry and enzymes and similar 'biological' molecular machines) seem to be a physical impossibility for a variety of reasons.\n \n 'Stickyness'- most basic of nano tech and what is probably what most people think of, a little machne that moves molecules around physically, is based of the technology of atomic force mircoscopes (albeit one used ineptly;)). However trying to make one of these ut of something nothing will bond to is practically impossible, even Van der Waals forces (a force caused by the electrons not being in fixed places and therefore creating slightly mroe negative and positive areas that attract one another) will become a serious issue at this level. \n \n Heat- the heat these machines would produce is a very big issue and very likely to overcome the bonds holding your nano-bot together. Issue most used in modern sci-fi that has assemblers and wants to show their limitations.\n \n Specificity- nice easy examples here, as there are small devices that can move specific types of molecules and rearrange them, their called enzymes and are probably what real nanotech will most resemble- a molecule that digests or catalyses one reaction- not just in a biological system but a cocktail of them shoved in with some ground up ore could easily be used to refine it once you have the chemistry and protein folding sorted out. COuld even make a bacterium that secreted them and took in the processed ore into a vacoule making collection a lot easier- however this is some serious genetic designing and our knoweledge of chemisty and proteins isn't quite up to it properly yet. You could say that these enzyme cocktails are already controlled by a type of assembler- one that takes molecules from its surroundings and replicates itself, its called DNA and life.\n \n Power source- making a power source small enough is not at all easy if you want a range of tasks, even those used by bacteria are way too large if you actually want something to push moelcules around. Of course its no problem if you want a Quarry Germ, but that isn't really what we are after as true nanotech. Also power sources tend to be formed by very reactive chemcials, which is going to be another issue for keeping your nanobot functional-even we have a serious problem with oxygen being aprt of our power generation process and fossil records indicate that it practically wiped out all life several times before adaptions to deal with it came into being (mitochondrial respiration likely evolved as a mechanism to get rid of oxygen and stop it oxidising all the metabolites, only much later did it evolve into a way of providing energy, bioluminesense is another oxygen purging adaption originally)\n \n Speed- they really won't be very fast (as fast as the fastest enzymes that are approaching the same speed as moelcules diffuse into each other), admittedly individually very fast but the number you would need to build anyting would be astornomical, these things better be cheap becasue even exponential growth is going to take a while and the heat generated by a large group of assmeblers is going to destroy them all (you may be suprised how much energy is released in chemcial reactions, this times billions is going to get very hot) and are going to become damaged quite quickly (due to heat, getting gummed up in impurities bonding to it, being damaged by its own power source) so will need constant replacement.",
