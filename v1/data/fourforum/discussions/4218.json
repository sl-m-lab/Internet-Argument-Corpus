   "if this has been covered before, then i apologize up front: but i think that, even if its been made, this point bears re-iteration.\n \n that point is that the judicial system, no matter what it seems like its there to do, is intended to protect citizens from criminals- in ANY system! and i think 'violently insane' (aka pleading 'temporarily insane' and getting away, quite literally, with murder) if a DAMN good reason to lock somebody up. what if it happens again? and until we find an effective treatment for such disorders- if they exist in the first place, outside of the courtroom!- innocence by insanity should still translate to guilt!\n \n sorry, but this bugs me. it seems like a loophole in the system anybody could use to get out of violent offenses if they aren't drug related (don't set me off there)",

   "If a mentally ill person is 1) identified (many aren't diagnosed - a huge number of the mentally ill are homeless), 2) can't be/won't be treated, 3) AND is identified as a threat to themselves or others - they generally are institutionalized.\n \n HOWEVER - violence and mentall illness do not generally go hand in hand. For example - contrary to popular belief - most schizophrenics are passive. Most mental illness is treatable. Mentall illness does not automatically mean you are not aware that an action you take is wrong, it does not mean you can't be culpable.\n \n I think the general public is sorely misinformed about mental illness - and I blame TV drama for much of that.",
