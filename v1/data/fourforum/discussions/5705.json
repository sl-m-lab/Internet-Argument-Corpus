The inquisitive public deserves to know.\n \n \n I'd rather hear the explanation of that than to hear about Tom Cruise and his latest Bimbo fiance.\n\n \n What concerns me more than that, it how people can be so foolish to be duped into believing that these new allegations are even possible. \n \n First off, as a paramedic, I can tell you without a doubt that people who collapse in cardiac arrest for 40-70 minutes are dead. Not just brain dead, but dead dead. D-E-D dead. The only time people are resuscitated after substantial periods of time are in cases of cold water immersion, and even these are few and far between (and I somewhat doubt Terri was found in a tub of ice water). The longest period of time I had ever seen anyone down only to regain a pulse was approximately 10 minutes. The only reason this patient regained a pulse was because I pumped him full of enough Epinephrine to kill a horse. As you might guess, his pulse only lasted as long as the drug did. (as we like to say: if you give enough epi you can get a pulse out of a rock). There is no way she was down for 40-70 minutes prior to EMS, another 5 before EMS arrived, and then was able to be resuscitated with limited cardio-pulmonary damage. It just does not happen. \n \n I personally think the Jeb and the rest of the politicians need to get their hands out of this whole mess. This first off was and still is a family matter. And aside from that, if the medical examiner ruled the death as natural causes and non-suspicious, why would we need an investigation anyway? \n \n And why are we just now hearing about the \"hour\" that went by before he called EMS? Don't you think that if this was really the case, the familiy would have made us well aware of this before now? Honestly, I followed the case very closely, and this is the first time I heard of this magic hour coming up. Of course, I use my head enough to know that she could not possibly have been laying there for an hour, even half an hour before he called 911, otherwise the funeral would have been 15 years ago.",

You get a situation that's already critical, you have to do one hell of a lot to try everything, and even if it was impossible to succeed, you cannot help but feel a bit of guilt anyway. And the stakes are so high...\n\n I love my job. To me, it is one of the best things I could do (aside from flying planes...my other job). I enjoy going to work, which in my opinion is the most important part of a job. If you enjoy going to work, it is what you were meant to do. If you hate going to work, look for another job. It is strange how people make themselves miserable just by going to work, and continue to do so every day for years and years. \n \n As far as feeling any guilt...not really. I look at it this way: They called me, I did not call them. I am trained to do a job, and I just show up and do it. Most of the time, things go fine. Sometimes, no matter what you do, things still go to XXXX, and people occasionally die. This is simply part of life. I don't get upset when someone dies, I don't second guess myself, I don't think if only I could have done more. Some people let this job get to them far too much, which is why the average EMS career for paramedics is somewhere around 4 years (even that might be a bit generous around here). Some people never have a problem even on the worst of calls. I guess I just luckily fall into the latter group. Besides, what is more fun than being able to put big needles and tubes into people, pumping them full of mind altering and sometimes potentially dangerous drugs, and mopping up the dregs of society?",
