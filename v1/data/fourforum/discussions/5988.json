   "It wasn't too long ago that we could buy milk in gallon containers made of paper - remember? Okay, it was quite awhile back... :) But, I can still remember my little sister taking one of those old cartons out of the freezer (my mother had put stew into the empty carton and froze it for use later), and left it out too long. She was only about four or five years old at the time, thinking it was ice cream. My mother saw it on the table, thawed, and told one of my brothers to take it out to the hogs. My little brother got lazy and placed it on the hood of the tractor while he wondered off somewhere. Our dog somehow got on the tractor and stuck his nose into the carton, then his head to get all the stew he could. Later we found him running around, bouncing off trees with that carton on his head. It was a sight to see. That pic reminded of that.\n \n I guess these days, though, that the fireants would have licked the carton clean before the dog found it....",

   "That's nothing. \n \n I was helping out a friend running an internet link up shack for Renaissance Faire merchants that was open on \"off days.\" While I was setting up one morning I heard some really loud thumping. I assumed it was construction going at first. The noise got louder and louder, like it was right on top of me. So I decided to check it out. I kept looking up thinking it was someone doing roof work and couldn't see anyone on any of the roof tops. The sound was repetative, then I heard some rustling under the front porch of the shack.\n \n I knelt down to see what was rustling to see a badger banging it's head against the floor joists trying to get a mason jar off it's head!!! \n \n I went back in my shack and called the main office to get someone to come down and either 1) help get this poor critter free...or 2) take pictures!!! \n \n The site adminastrative assistant came running down the hill, camera in hand! \n We reached under the building with branches, trying to shuffle the badger to someplace where we could reach him. Thankfully he was just a pup and his claws weren't all that big yet!\n Finally we got the badger out from under the shack, but trying to get the jar off was even more fun!! \n \n Somewhere I have a pic of me holding the mason jar after it was over. But sincce both of us were trying to get the poor creature free, we didn't get any of the badger with the jar on it's head. Dang.... emoticon_emb",
