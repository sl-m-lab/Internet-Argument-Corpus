   "We have seen recently a lot of nonsense in various threads to the effect that the rules of moral behaviour, and corresponding notions of right and wrong, must necessarily be imposed on humankind by a superior being. In this view, the only alternative to such divinely imposed morality is no morality at all. I believe this to be a profoundly mistaken idea, based on a false premise.\n \n Moral codes form part of all known human cultures, extant and historical. The constraints of right and wrong, of acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, are never arbitrary ones: they are constraints which, in the short or the long term, promote the greater fitness and survival value of that culture. Moral constraints which become maladaptive are sooner or later revised: look, for example, at the relaxation over the last generation or two of attitudes to what used to be called 'living in sin' - a concept rendered largely redundant in an age of affluence, female financial independence, and social mobility.

Further evidence that the adoption of moral rules is an evolved trait comes from studies of their acquisition by small children.

So is there any common thread? What moral rules have in common is that they generally value the benefit of the group over the benefit of the individual: selfishness is generally 'wrong', altruism 'right'. Humans are social beings or they are nothing: in early human evolution, individual survival was wholly dependent on group survival. It is not hard to see how behaviours promoting group survival - what we now label moral behaviours - were subject to strong selective pressure in our early ancestors.\n \n So, I've set out my stall.

I think your analogy of the adoption of moral rules with the acquisition of language - i.e. by means of inbuilt software - is powerful and convincing.\n \n Hayek claims, which seems paradoxical to me, that our morals are neither instinctive nor a creation of reason, but constitute a separate tradition - between instinct and reason - a tradition of great importance in enabling us to adapt to problems and circumstances far exceeding our rational capacities. Our moral traditions, like many other aspects of our culture, developed concurrently with our reason, not as its product. \n \n The plasticity of morals you refer to, seems to originate somewhere between reason and evolved traits.",

   "The origins of the 'moral sense' (or propensity) in human beings are mysterious, but not, as I think John has shown, beyond all conjecture.\n \n Many people (including me) have difficulty accepting the relativity of morals and search for either a divine authority that imposes a moral law, or an argument that 'shows' how certain moral precepts seem to be universal. By 'universal', I mean that the same moral imperatives have been adopted in many different cultures over recorded history. It's easy to infer from this supposition, the existence of moral absolutes. But it is mistaken. \n \n If we move from the evolved trait in the individual person to social morality, perhaps we can envisage the original human ethical system was that of the small group - the hunter/gatherer tribe. These 'small group' ethics served the utility of both solidarity and altruism. Pre-literate tribes at the dawn of human history were each united by a shared purpose - rudimentary survival in an uncontrollable and hostile environment. This common purpose superseded the different purposes of the tribes' individual members.\n \n As time passed, agricultural techniques were developed and cities were founded. These events provided a basis for two further developments that made 'tribal' ethics untenable: economic trade and population growth. Trade placed members of closed communities in constant contact with 'foreigners' who usually did not share the group's purposes or beliefs. \n \n Morality became more diffuse as cultures were penetrated by the ethics of strangers. \n \n This coarse explanation of how social morality may have evolved can be applied, with necessary elaboration, to human conduct in the more 'sophisticated' societies that we suppose ourselves to inhabit.",

I should think that if it is observed that the deviant behavior creates a better situation for survival, it will be adopted by the culture in which it is exhibited--and eventually become part of the hard-wiring.\n \n There is also the wild card of the ability to think and reason, to be capable of having several different considerations of what is and what might be, the ability to choose what may be best.\n \n George Lakoff argues, for example, that the ability of humans to use metaphors in language may be a major factor in the devising of moral structure.\n \n And, what of artists and others, who think of new ways of seeing things? Maybe that's a function that's hard-wired in the human brain.",

   "To put it another way Adept (and yourself) claim as a 'truth' the fact that we're nothing but chemicals. A 'reality' such as love only exists because of that material influence. \"Love\" doesn't have an existence beyond your experience. It exists in no other form, but the material.\n \n Given that you believe this 'truth', and given that you believe that notions all stem from those chemicals, then the idea that you have the truth about this idea is also based on those chemicals. Which means that given the right change of chemicals that 'truth' would seem to you to be untrue. Your belief in your own idea as true, is not based on any sense of it being 'true' in any absolute sense. You simply believe it to be true because of the chemicals in your brain lining up in one way so as to allow you to believe it to be true.\n \n Unless you're arguing that it is true in an absolute sense, whether you believe it to be true, or not, which is to say that you then accept a proposition as true, that is independent of the chemical functions in your brain telling you that it is false. If you believe it to be 'true' in an absolute sense then you believe in a truth that is not dependant on the material. You still have a paradox on your hands.\n \n Some non-material things are discernable quite easily by us, but measuring them is difficult. This means that there are things beyond the material/measurable.\n \n I believe in non-material things. I believe that God exists. I believe that God is love. And I believe love exists. Whether you believe in love existing in any absolute sense doesn't matter because it exists independent of you (believing in it or not). The problems you have with the illogic dependence on the material/measurable are demonstrated in the paradoxical situation you create above. It's self-annihilation.\n \n I can even see and react to non-material things. Cold is something I react to, but it doesn't exist in the material sense, because it is the lack of the material and measurable, (heat). Same with darkness. We can see reactions of animals to darkness; they might sleep in the absence of light stimuli. You bump into furniture in the darkness; another affect.\n \n Other things I can feel (pain) which exists in a sense that is not measurable (not in a comparable sense). There are 'scales' for measuring pain, but these are not properly measurable insofar as we each have different reactions and tolerances to pain. If I pricked your finger you might burst into tears. Another person would not feel it. And the 'scales' people do use are only so they can get a measure of how you feel about your own pain; some scales are out of 20, some out of 10, and some less. (there's several just at http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/29721/32087.html#numerical ). So if you feel a pain and point to 5.4 out of 10 I don't know that that's the same intensity as when I feel pain and point to the same point on the same scale. The way I fee it is completely unique to me.\n \n Depression can be caused by peer pressure. Although we might be able to detect brain functions differing in a person suffering from depression we can't detect the actual cause; peer pressure. There is no measure for it. It exists, and has an effect on us.\n \n And to get back to the OP; the same goes for morals. I can sense something is good. You might even be able to detect a part of my brain functioning this, but 'goodness' is not itself a product of the material. Unless you know of a scale agreed upon by which we can measure 'good'. I'd be more than happy to review the journal that has published it.\n \n The very fact that these things exist outside of the material draws the mind to suspect something more than ourselves.\n \n \"My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such violent reaction against it? A man feels wet when he falls into water, because man is not a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course I could have given up my idea of justice by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too - for the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my fancies. Thus in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist - in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless - I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality - namely my idea of justice - was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know if it was dark. Dark would be a word without meaning.\n Lewis, C. S., (2002), \"The Complete C S Lewis\", (Harper; San Francisco), p30.",

What is justice? How did we arrive at a conclusion of what justice is all about?\n \n What if animals have a sense of justice?\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3116678.stm\n \n \nMonkeys show sense of justice\n By Dr David Whitehouse \n BBC News Online science editor \n Researchers taught brown capuchin monkeys to swap tokens for food. Usually they were happy to exchange this \"money\" for cucumber. \n \n But if they saw another monkey getting a grape - a more-liked food - they took offence. Some refused to work, others took the food and refused to eat it. \n \n Scientists say this work suggests that human's sense of justice is inherited and not a social construct. \n \n Differential reward experiment \n The research was carried out at Emory University in the US, by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal, and is reported in the journal Nature. \n \n \"I'm extremely interested in the evolution of cooperation,\" Sarah Brosnan told BBC News Online. \n \n \"One of the most interesting areas is the recent suggestion that human cooperation is made more effective by a sense of fairness.\" \n \n She wanted to find out if the human sense of fairness is an evolved behaviour or a cultural construct - the result of society's rules. \n \n So she and her colleagues devised an experiment using capuchin monkeys. \n \n Sarah Brosnan said: \"I chose the capuchin because they are very cooperative, and because they come from a very tolerant society. \n \n \"We designed a very simple experiment to see whether or not they react to differential rewards and efforts.\" \n \n Capuchins like cucumber, but they like grapes even more. So a system was devised whereby pairs of capuchins were treated differently after completing the same task. \n \n \"They had never before been in any sort of situation where they were differentially rewarded,\" she said. \n \n \"We put pairs of capuchins side by side and one of them would get the cucumber as a reward for a task.\" \n \n The partner sometimes got the same food reward but on other occasions got a grape, sometimes without even having to work for it.\" \n \n 'A highly unusual behaviour' \n The response was dramatic, the researchers said. \n \n \"We were looking for a very objective reaction and we got one. They typically refused the task they were set,\" Sarah Brosnan said. \n \n \"The other half of the time they would complete the task but wouldn't take the reward. That is a highly unusual behaviour. \n \n \"Sometimes they ignored the reward, sometimes they took it and threw it down,\" she added. \n \n The researchers were not surprised that the monkeys showed a sense of fairness, but they were taken aback that they would turn down an otherwise acceptable reward. \n \n \"They never showed a reaction against their partner, they never blamed them,\" Sarah Brosnan said. \n \n Commenting on the results, experts in the subject told BBC News Online that the idea of a long evolutionary history for a sense of fairness was an exciting one. \n \n However, they added that they would like to see more research involving more than just the five subjects tested in the Nature study. \n \n So does our instinctive feeling of fairness predate our species? \n \n \"It may well,\" Sarah Brosnan said, and further experiments are planned to see how extensive a sense of justice in the animal world is. \n \n \"We are currently repeating the study on chimpanzees, a great ape species, to learn something more about the evolutionary development of the sense of fairness. \n \n \"I suspect that there are other non-primate species with tolerant societies that will show the same behaviour.\" \n\n \n Hmmmm. Now, what of God and our understanding of justice?\n \nConsequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know if it was dark. Dark would be a word without meaning.\nC.S. Lewis\n \n Atheism, I fear, is not in the least simple, let alone \"too simple.\" A universe devoid of meaning? Well, one must ask, \"What is meaning?\" Why shouldn't, why couldn't, an atheist find meaning in the universe? We humans perceive what we perceive and create our world accordingly, as do capuchin monkeys, as do whales who can hear and perceive things that we do not, as do elephants who also have levels of perception that differ from those of humans.\n \n I have created my own world of meaning and what is meaningful, drawing from the context of my culture, what my parents taught me, what I learned along the way, what I have learned from my studies. So, what is meaning and what is justice and what is fairness and, of course, what is God?",

   "It's rather early in the morning and I haven't soused myself with coffee yet. What the devil is OP?\n\n Original Post (or Poster).\n [QUOTE=Bradamante]\n A very good answer. Would you value the 'nazi science' they conducted as 'good'?[QUOTE]\n \n Its a very complicated issue, and partly why I don't think you can just limit yourself the messages in the bible as a the sole arbeiter of 'Good', and calculating whether something is 'good' using the 'improving life/survival for all' version is pretty much impossible.\n \n The experiments themselves were not good, and this we can be pretty sure about with either definition (partly due to the Nazi philosophy not being scientificly accurate). They were not only inflincting suffering on people but also affecting the whole group as the category of people used in the experiments was broad and largely meaningless (especially if we include all the other groups like suspected gays, gypsies and political dissidents etc as well). By supporting them you would be increasing the chance that something unpleasant might happen to you or people like you.\n \n However the information learnt from these methods is neutral, it can be used for good things or bad things depending on whatever you want to do with it, which leads to the next bit.\n \n\n forgot to add, what you have here is a sense of 'good' that is wholly reliant on science; what we understand ow with regards to Cystic Fibrosis shapes whether you act 'good' (ie. take one course of action).\n More knowledge rather than science, which I think is the important thing - our perception of good and evil are entirely based on how much we know about a certain situation and whether the act is good or evil can shift depending on what we know. \n \n A person shooting and killing another would usually be classed as an evil act, but could become a good act if it was done by a cop to save the lives of several children who the dead man would have otherwise killed. However it would shift back to evil if the cop didn't know the circumstances and had just wanted to shoot someone or went on to hurt the children anyway. Raises questions about whether we can ever know all the facts (especially if we take into account future and possible future events, though we'll end up merging with free will and determinism) and if we can't then isn't all good and evil just subjective anyway?",
