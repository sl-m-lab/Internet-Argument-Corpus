   "  57% Say Gun Sales Up Due To Fear of More Gun Control \n Fifty-seven percent (57%) of Americans say gun sales are up in the United States because of a fear of increased government restriction on gun ownership. \n \n A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey shows that just 23% say gun sales have risen because of a fear of increased crime. Twenty-one percent (21%) are not sure. \n \n Sixty-three percent (63%) of men say the threat of more gun control is behind increased sales, compared to 51% of women. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of whites agree, while African-Americans are more closely divided on the question. \n \n Similarly, 65% of Republicans and 66% of those not affiliated with either major political party say gun sales are up due to a fear of increased government restriction. But a plurality of Democrats agrees by just 10 points. \n \n Seventy-one percent (71%) of Americans believe it is at least somewhat likely that President Obama will seek tougher gun control laws, including 43% who say it is very likely. \n \n In March, 43% of Americans said the United States needed more gun control laws, but 47% disagreed. This marked a slight drop in support for more gun control from last year. \n\n For the gun banners who are thinking, you paranoid delusional low lives! Uh. They have already tried.\n   57% Say Gun Sales Up Due To Fear of More Gun Control \n The Mexican government says guns purchased in the United States are responsible for much of the drug-related violence in Mexico and wants Obama to restrict gun sales in this country. Just 20% of U.S. voters think restricting U.S. gun sales will reduce drug-related violence in Mexico, and 70% disagree and oppose such restrictions. \n \n Seventy-five percent (75%) of Americans believe the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right of an average citizen to own a gun. \n",

   "Written By; Scott Wagner is a Police Academy Commander and Professor at Columbus State Community College in Columbus Ohio, and Commander of the 727 Counter Terror Training Unit. A 29 year law enforcement veteran, and current Deputy Sheriff, he is the Precision Marksman for the Union County Sheriff's Office SRT Team.\n   Note From a Cop \n The fear on the street is palpable. Ever since the election of Barack Obama as President of these United States in November 2008, coupled with the election of a democrat party majority in both the U.S. House and Senate, concern for the United States and personal safety has ignited like a fire in dry grass.\n \n <snip<\n \n What is odd about this new fear is that it is not coming from the average citizen gun owner out there, but it is coming from what to me is an almost shocking source: street cops.\n \n Street cops and SWAT cops that I know from various agencies - rural, suburban and metro - in my area are scared. Cops that before November 2008 never gave much thought (that I knew of anyway) to politics or more importantly to gun rights. For the most part, these are the guys that didn't generally have any interest in shooting or gun ownership beyond keeping track of where their duty gun is, and a few of them didn't even do that so well.\n \n The guys I am talking about now are some of the same guys who used to not even carry off duty on a regular basis- but not anymore. They don't scare easily, defenders of the Constitution of this State and the United States (as our oath of office reads), have been buying ARs, survival gear, and all the ammo they can lay their hands on. All of them (or I should say \"us\") have been discussing and have been acquiring guns to provide a layered perimeter defense.\n \n What are we suddenly so afraid of? Well in our discussions it seems to boil down to four areas...\n \n First, fear of federal government intrusion into our lives. Every time I look at or listen to the news, there is something new and intrusive coming out of the Obama administration and this Congress. New tax schemes, government-run Canadian-style healthcare, a volunteer citizen defense force (whatever that is, what happened to the National Guard?) equipped with funding similar to our military, forced voluntary \"service\" after retirement, a lack of a southern border with hordes of illegal and criminal aliens pouring over our border, the swine flu scare as well as government forced closing of thousands of privately held Chrysler and GM dealerships, which will be the final nail in the coffin for these companies and the list goes on and on.\n \n But these items in the news are just the tip of the iceberg. We can't see the full impact of these actions yet, but we don't know what was added into the thousand of pages of stimulus package bills in the dead of night yet. I predict however that when the plans contained in the stimulus packages go into effect, a lot of us are going to be surprised if not shocked by what has suddenly and sweepingly changed.\n \n What also scares us is the second, well-founded fear that there is an assault weapons ban looming, one that would make the Clinton Ban appear like a look of disdain in comparison. I remember well the 1990s and the Clinton years: the rise of militia groups, the \"black helicopter\" rumors and paranoia, all of which was motivated by the Brady Law and the Assault Weapon's ban. What if a new ban comes requiring registration or confiscation and turn-in of banned weapons as what happened in Australia?\n \n ...I foresee much civil disobedience coming down the road. Americans are citizens, and not subjects like the British, Canadians or Australians. They just don't always obey the law blindly and not one officer or citizen that I spoke to said anything like \"I hope I get to keep this gun for awhile before they are banned; They are fun to shoot, so I would hate to give it up.\" It isn't going to happen, so the cop on the street and the soldier on the base needs to think now what he will do if the orders come down. I think you all get what I am saying here.\n \n Which leads me to the third fear, that there is a revolution coming, yes, a revolution on the scale of the original American Revolution. You can hear this topic discussed on many of the talk radio shows by even the big name hosts. The possibility of an armed revolution against the U.S. government being discussed, albeit very gingerly and fleetingly and as something to be avoided, which it is. I never heard this mentioned in the 90s. One of my quietest, low profile officer friends brought it up the other day.\n \n He said that at some point in the near future, he felt there is going to be an armed revolt if things keep going the way they are. Something has got to give. I was shocked. Yes, I had heard this from some of my more radical cop friends in the past, but to hear it from a guy like this was unprecedented. Now, these guys are not saying this will happen to foment revolution, preach sedition or to even participate. They just want to be ready if it happens, to at least defend their families, because number four on the fear list is general societal chaos.\n \n Cops fear for their parents, wives, children or grandchildren more now than ever before. Most cops are encouraging their spouses and loved ones to get concealed carry permits. Not only that, but some of these same cops are buying gun mounts for their personal cars so they can carry an AR in the family ride at the ready all the time. They are also strapping on heavier forms of off-duty hardware. I have other friends that are issued ARs or subguns for tactical team use, who always have their gear with them and are planning on just commandeering these weapons for personal use in defending hearth and home.\n \n Final Notes\n \n This is pretty heady and maybe even dangerous stuff. Know fully that I am not advocating anything here. I am reflecting to you what I see and hear going on around me, and maybe saying things that haven't been said in the open, until now. It is something to think about.\n\n To our fellow Americans on the Left. Think carefully before you overplay your cards! \n \n But what do I know. I am just a dumb Hillbilly pickup driving, Dumb Bunny! emoticon_xdonno",

California filed by itself (147KB pdf) supporting the NRA.\n\n \n I agree. We can still argue whether the 2nd. Amendment recognizes an individual RKBA all we want, but SCOTUS has decided that issue. The legal focus has now turned to what I see are three issues. \n \n #1: Incorporation. \n \n Incorporation against the states through the doctrine of selective incorporation was never an issue in Heller-but it will likely become the major issue soon. Nordyke, for example, could provide the test case for the answer if SCOTUS accepted an appeal. In any event the issue of incorporation is vital.\n \n If the RKBA is not incorporated, then the only protection the individual RKBA has against state infringement would be a similar state constitutional guarantee. If a state does not have a RKBA provision, or if that state's supreme court ruled the state provision did not guarantee an individual RKBA, then the state would be free to enact a total ban on possession of any firearm. In other words, in this circumstance your RKBA would exist only at the discretion of your state legislator-regardless of what Heller says. \n \n #2: The test.\n \n Whenever a law is challenged on the grounds that it unconstitutionally infringes upon an individual right SCOTUS uses a test to evaluate the claim. \n \n The strongest test is called \"strict scrutiny\"-and it applies when laws infringing a \"fundamental right\" are challenged:\n \n Unquestionably we have held that a government practice or statute which restricts \"fundamental rights\" or which contains \"suspect classifications\" is to be subjected to \"strict scrutiny\" and can be justified only if it furthers a compelling government purpose and, even then, only if no less restrictive alternative is available. University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 357 (1978) [\"suspect classifications,\" by the way, refer to things like race-based preferences]\n \n This is the test I believe SCOTUS needs to adopt. In my opinion the other tests (intermediate scrutiny and rational basis) would leave the RKBA at the mercy of irritated lawmakers. The Heller majority evaded this issue entirely. All we know is what tests it rejected. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 62-63 (2008)\n \n A. Justice Breyer's offer of a new \"only if the judge thinks it's still worth having the right\" test is rejected:\n \n JUSTICE BREYER moves on to make a broad jurisprudential point: He criticizes us for declining to establish a level of scrutiny for evaluating Second Amendment restrictions. He proposes, explicitly at least, none of the traditionally expressed levels (strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, rational basis), but rather a judge-empowering \"interestbalancing inquiry\" that \"asks whether the statute burdens a protected interest in a way or to an extent that is out of proportion to the statute's salutary effects upon other important governmental interests.\" Post, at 10. After an exhaustive discussion of the arguments for and against gun control, JUSTICE BREYER arrives at his interestbalanced answer: because handgun violence is a problem, because the law is limited to an urban area, and because there were somewhat similar restrictions in the founding period (a false proposition that we have already discussed), the interest-balancing inquiry results in the constitutionality of the handgun ban. QED. \n We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \"interest-balancing\" approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government-even the Third Branch of Government-the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges' assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an \"interest-balancing\" approach to the prohibition of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie. See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclosure of state secrets, but not for the expression of extremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very product of an interest-balancing by the people-which JUSTICE BREYER would now conduct for them anew. And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\n \n B: A rejection of \"rational basis\"\n \n JUSTICE BREYER correctly notes that this law, like almost all laws, would pass rational-basis scrutiny. Post, at 8. But rational-basis scrutiny is a mode of analysis we have used when evaluating laws under constitutional commands that are themselves prohibitions on irrational laws. See, e.g., Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 9-10). In those cases, \"rational basis\"is not just the standard of scrutiny, but the very substance of the constitutional guarantee. Obviously, the same test could not be used to evaluate the extent to which a legislature may regulate a specific, enumerated right, be it the freedom of speech, the guarantee against double jeopardy, the right to counsel, or the right to keep and bear arms. See United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938) (\"There may be narrower scope for operation of the presumption of constitutionality [i.e., narrower than that provided by rational-basis review] when legislation appears on its face to be within a specific prohibition of the Constitution, such as those of the first ten amendments. . .\"). If all that was required to overcome the right to keep and bear arms was a rational basis, the Second Amendment would be redundant with the separate constitutional prohibitions on irrational laws, and would have no effect.\n \n #3: Fundamental/non-fundamental right status.\n \n This final issue is related to what test we use when reviewing a challenged law. If the right is viewed as \"fundamental,\" then the test used for an invasion of the core right will be \"strict scrutiny.\" Heller did not address the fundamental/non-fundamental issue. The closest the majority came was here-during a discussion of the meaning of the \"operative\" clause of the 2nd. A:\n \n By the time of the founding, the right to have arms had become fundamental for English subjects. See Malcolm 122-134. Blackstone, whose works, we have said, \"constituted the preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation,\" Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 715 (1999), cited the arms provision of the Bill of Rights as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen. See 1 Blackstone 136, 139-140 (1765). His description of it cannot possibly be thought to tie it to militia or military service. It was, he said, \"the natural right of resistance and self-preservation,\" District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 20 (2008)\n \n There are a number of opinions, however, which strongly suggest that all rights specifically enumerated in the BoR are deemed \"fundamental.\" These opinions take the trend of assuming the first 8 amendments enshrined fundamental rights, and they go on to say the 9th. A tells us there are other unenumerated rights which are also \"fundamental.\" For example: \n \n [T]he Ninth Amendment shows a belief of the Constitution's authors that fundamental rights exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments and an intent that the list of rights included there not be deemed exhaustive. Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 237 (1971)\n \n In any event, SCOTUS should in my opinion declare that the 2nd. A is a fundamental right. To do otherwise would open the door for others to attack different specific rights in the BoR as also being non-fundamental. It would be akin to a gun hater who also loved free speech/press, etc. pulling the house down upon himself because he wanted to pull out the \"rotten\" RKBA board.",

   "If only 1% of survey respondents had falsely claimed that they had used a gun to defend themselves then that could make the survey inaccurate by millions when extrapolated to the general population of America (since about 1% of the population is about 3 million). That's why it's difficult to accurately measure the frequency of a rare event with a survey. It's very easy to overestimate the frequency of such an event. On the other hand, if 25% responded that they owned a gun then it wouldn't make much difference if 1% lied. It wouldn't make much difference if there are 75 million gun owners or 72 million gun owners. \n \n \nCommon sense would suggest that falsely claiming defensive uses might help protect the 2A, in the minds of some gun advocates.\n\n Yes, and the person answering the survey questions is naturally likely to be biased in favor of themselves. From the perspective of another person that was present when the \"defensive gun use\" occurred, the gun owner may have been threatening an innocent person with their gun. But the surveyor doesn't get to hear the perspective of that innocent person.\n It's interesting that when people are both asked about their experiences defending themselves with a gun and being illegally threatened with a gun, more people report being threatened with a gun. That indicates that a lot of these reported \"defensive gun uses\" may actually be incidents in which gun owners illegally threatened someone with their guns. But again, in most defensive gun use surveys, the surveyor only hears the perspective of the person who brandished the gun (who of course wants to believe that they did the right thing).\n \n \"Even after excluding many reported firearm victimizations, far more survey respondents report having been threatened or intimidated with a gun than having used a gun to protect themselves. A majority of the reported self defense gun uses were rated as probably illegal by a majority of judges. This was so even under the assumption that the respondent had a permit to own and carry the gun, and that the respondent had described the event honestly. CONCLUSIONS: Guns are used to threaten and intimidate far more often than they are used in self defense. Most self reported self defense gun uses may well be illegal and against the interests of society.\"\n Gun use in the United States: results from two nat...[Inj Prev. 2000] - PubMed Result",

   "You're so wrong it's not even funny. The level of wrongness you present in your posts should be a criminal offense. \n \n There is absolutely no truth that the Second Amendment was designed to guarantee that blacks would always remain under the control of white slave owners. It's the various state governments, and the federal government after the Dred Scott case, that denied black people their Second Amendment rights. It's the government itself that declared black people aren't humans and aren't subject to the protections in the Bill of Rights.\n \n There's no way you can deny the fact that gun control is a purely and exclusively racist notion in nature.\n\n How are backgrounds checks racist? How was the AWB racist? People of all races were required to follow these laws. Furthermore, it seems that whites would be more affected by such restrictions since they more often choose to own guns.\n \n \n\n And...nothing else could've inspired slaves to rebel and demand better treatment?\n \n Nobody's arguing that racism didn't exist and that it wasn't used. But there's absolutely no proof whatsoever that the Second Amendment was designed as a slave controller tool.\n \n\n According to Article I of the Constitution, the militia could be called upon to \"suppress Insurrections\". Insurrections would include slave rebellions. The militia was composed of gun owning citizens. \n \n \n\n Disagreeing with affirmative action, and hating illegal immigrants who're treated like royalty, doesn't equal racism. It's disgust with the sissy approach we have to take to everything these days when minority members are involved, because treating criminals like actual criminals, regardless of ethnicity, is politically incorrect and racially insensitive. \n\n LOL! You're the one playing the race card in this thread- trying to obfuscate the issue by portraying gun control as something purely racist. You use the same tactics as your opponents when it suits your agenda. I'm not denying that there were some gun control laws that were racist in the past but the Second Amendment started out as being racist and sexist. In the beginning, the Second Amendment only protected the right of white men to keep and bear arms.",

I'm not denying that there were some gun control laws that were racist in the past but the Second Amendment started out as being racist and sexist. In the beginning, the Second Amendment only protected the right of white men to keep and bear arms.\n\n \n \n \n \n History\n \n The Racist Origins of Gun Control Laws Designed To Disarm Slaves, Freedmen, And African-Americans\n \n \n \n By Steve Ekwall\n \n \n \n OVERVIEW\n \n \n \n Before the Civil War ended, State \"Slave Codes\" prohibited slaves from owning guns. After President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and after the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolishing slavery was adopted and the Civil War ended in 1865, States persisted in prohibiting blacks, now freemen, from owning guns under laws renamed \"Black Codes.\" They did so on the basis that blacks were not citizens, and thus did not have the same rights, including the right to keep and bear arms protected in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as whites. This view was specifically articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in its infamous 1857 decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford to uphold slavery.\n \n \n \n The United States Congress overrode most portions of the Black Codes by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The legislative histories of both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as The Special Report of the Anti-Slavery Conference of 1867, are replete with denunciations of those particular statutes that denied blacks equal access to firearms. [Kates, \"Handgun Prohibition and the Original Meaning of the Second Amendment,\" 82 Mich. L. Rev. 204, 256 (1983)] However, facially neutral disarming through economic means laws remain in effect.\n \n \n \n After the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1878, most States turned to \"facially neutral\" business or transaction taxes on handgun purchases. However, the intention of these laws was not neutral. An article in Virginia 's official university law review called for a \"prohibitive tax...on the privilege\" of selling handguns as a way of disarming \"the son of Ham,\" whose \"cowardly practice of 'toting' guns has been one of the most fruitful sources of crime.... Let a negro board a railroad train with a quart of mean whiskey and a pistol in his grip and the chances are that there will be a murder, or at least a row, before he alights.\" [Comment, Carrying Concealed Weapons, 15 VA L. Reg. 391, 391-92 (1909); George Mason University Civil Rights Law Journal (GMU CR LJ), Vol. 2, No. 1, \"Gun Control and Racism,\" Stefan Tahmassebi, 1991, p. 75] Thus, many Southern States imposed high taxes or banned inexpensive guns so as to price blacks and poor whites out of the gun market.\n \n \n In the 1990s, \"gun control\" laws continue to be enacted so as to have a racist effect if not intent: Police-issued license and permit laws, unless drafted to require issuance to those not prohibited by law from owning guns, are routinely used to prevent lawful gun ownership among \"unpopular\" populations. Public housing residents, approximately 3 million Americans, are singled out for gun bans. \"Gun sweeps\" by police in \"high crime neighborhoods\" whereby vehicles and \"pedestrians who meet a specific profile that might indicate they are carrying a weapon\" are searched are becoming popular, and are being studied by the U.S. Department of Justice as \"Operation Ceasefire.\"",

Why don't you post some 18th Century gun laws here and explain how they are racist? Actually, gun control is protected by the Bill of Rights. Historian Jack Rakove explains,\n \"Like the Second Amendment, the Tenth Amendment takes the form of an ambiguously stated injunction which arguably adds little if anything to the positive content of the Constitution. Yet it is impossible to conceive how the Tenth Amendment could have excluded the traditional power of government to legislate broadly for public health and safety from the reserved powers of the states.\"\n Chicago-Kent Law Review\n \n So regulating guns for public safety is one of the powers reserved to the states which is protected by the Tenth Amendment. So if gun control is racist then the Tenth Amendment must be also. \n \n \n\n Another claim that you can't back up?

When the Constitution became the Supreme Law of the Land there were no black slaves in America, they were all still in Africa. Black slaves didn't come along until well after the ratification of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n\n You're unaware of basic facts in American history.

   "Galileo-\n \n The Constitution of the United States was ratified into law in 1787, the Second Amendment included. In 1775 British soldiers were sent by King George to take away America's supply of arms at Lexington and Concord. They didn't like this, fought back, and drove the British off their soil.\n \n You claim that the Framers, the Founding Fathers of this nation, crafted the Second Amendment for the express purpose of guaranteeing that no black man would ever be able to rise up against their masters and declare their own independence. The last time I checked there were no black British soldiers.\n \n Wise up you rabid gun hater! The Second Amendment was drafter for the express purpose of guaranteeing that the American people would be able to resist tyranny, not just from our own government but from foreign governments. It wasn't designed for the purpose of squashing slave rebellions; something that wasn't even occurring around the time of ratification.",

   "So why was the 14th Amendment necessary if my statement is untrue?\n\n \n My answer is this: \n \n The southern states all had long ago recognized many if not all of the same civil liberties contained within the BoR within their own constitutions. However, after emancipation a pattern emerged in which these rights were not enforced when the victims of infringement were blacks, and in many cases laws were also passed which directly infringed the black man's free exercise of these otherwise state recognized liberties. \n \n Congress had no power to force the southern states to protect these state constitutional rights. Congress also lacked the power to force the states to recognize the federal BoR because it was still viewed as only a check upon the power of the federal government. Therefore, the only way to protect the black man's civil liberties from racist infringement was to bind the states by amendment to respect the individual liberties in the BoR. \n In regards to the individual RKBA, see the following history I have posted before: \n \n ---\n \n I trust that everyone here recognizes that the practice of slavery in our nation's past was immoral. Yet did you know that in making this point abolitionists argued the RKBA recognized by the 2nd. A. was an individual right?\n \n The pre-eminent scholar amongst abolitionists was a man named Lysander Spooner. In 1845 he published a work entitled the \"Unconstitutionality of Slavery.\" Abolitionists deemed this work so important that the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society provided a copy of it to every member of Congress. In that work, Spooner argued that the words of the amendment:\n \n \"obviously recognize the natural right of all men \"to keep and bear arms\" for their personal defense: and prohibit both Congress and the State governments from infringing the right of \"the people\"--that is, any of the people--to do so. . . .This right of man \"to keep and bear arms,\" is a right palpably inconsistent with the idea of being a slave. Yet the right is secured as effectively to those whom the States presume to call slaves, as to any whom the States condescend to acknowledge free. Under this provision any man has a right either to give or sell arms to those persons whom the States call slaves; and there is no constitutional power, in either the national or State governments, that can punish him for so doing; or that can take those arms from the slaves; or that can make it criminal for the slaves to use them, if, from the inefficiency of the laws, it should become necessary for them to do so, in defense of their own lives or liberties; for this constitutional right to keep arms implies the constitutional right to use them, if need be, for the defense of one's liberty or life.\" Lysander Spooner, The Unconstitutionality of Slavery, p. 98 (1860 edition) [bold emphasis added] (Spooner obviously believe the BoR should apply to the states, something which no court had yet done)\n \n Did the abolition of slavery in the 13th. Amendment put an end to racist gun control measures in the reconstructed south? No. Remember, the BoR has always been held to be a check only upon the power of the federal government, not the states, and Congress quickly heard how the southern states were creating a system of de facto slavery by disenfranchising blacks, which included denying them the RKBA. See, for example, the following comments:\n \n [concerning the State of Kentucky] \"the civil law prohibits the colored man from bearing arms. . .their arms are taken from them by the civil authorities. . . .Thus, the right of the people to keep and bear arms as provided in the Constitution is infringed. . .\" Executive Document #30, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, pp. 233 and 236 (1866) [from the Report of the Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau]. [bold emphasis added]\n \n [from Mississippi's \"Act to Regulate the Relation of Master and Apprentice Relative to Freedmen, Free Negroes, and Mulattoes.\"] \"That no freedman, free negro or mulatto. . .not licensed to do so by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie knife. . .\" Laws of Mississippi, 1865, p. 165 (November 29, 1865).\n \n How were laws like this viewed by Congress? \"Northern Republicans professed to see this new legislation at the South the virtual re-enslavement of the Negroes.\" J. Burgess, Reconstruction and the Constitution, 1866-1876, p. 51-52 (1902).\n \n The complaints were not limited to the mere passage of laws, however:\n \n \"In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages on them. . . .\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 40 (December 13, 1865) [Speech of Senator Henry Wilson (Republican-Massachusetts)]\n \n Yet another Senator complained that the Mississippi state militia would roam throughout the state and habitually \"hang some freedmen or search negro houses for arms.\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, Senate Report Number 30, p. 813 (February 13, 1866) [Speech of Senator Lyman Trumball (Republican-Illinois)]\n \n Throughout all of this it was understood that the BoR was powerless to stop this state-sponsored oppression of the black man's RKBA, his right to vote, his right of free speech and assembly, etc. So what then was the response from Congress? The 14th. Amendment:\n \n All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. United States Constitution, 14th. Amendment, Section 1. \n \n This amendment was drafted for the express purpose of requiring the states to respect the individual citizen's rights contained within the BoR:\n \n \"This immortal bill of rights embodied in the Constitution, rested for its execution and enforcement hitherto upon the fidelity of the States. . . .The proposition pending before the House is simply a proposition to arm Congress. . .with the power to enforce this bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution today.\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 1033-34 (February 26, 1866) and p. 1088 (February 28, 1966) [Speeches by Congressman John A. Bingham (Republican-Ohio)]\n \n The RKBA was one of those individual rights which the House of Representatives intended to be protected by the 14th. Amendment:\n \n \"Sir, I find in the Constitution of the United States an article which declares that \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" For myself, I shall insist that the reconstructed rebels of Mississippi respect the Constitution in their local laws. . . .\"Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, p. 1838 (April 7, 1866) [Speech of congressman Sindey Clarke (Republican-Kansas)]. [bold emphasis added]\n \n \"The Constitution clearly describes that to be a republican form of government for which it was expressly framed. A government. . .where \"no law shall be made prohibiting a free exercise of religion;\". . .where \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed;\"\". . . Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 2, p. 1266 (March 24, 1866) [Speech of congressman Roswell Hart (Republican-New York)] [bold emphasis added]\n \n \"Make the colored man a citizen of the United States and he has every right which you or I have as citizens of the United States under the laws and Constitution of the United States. . . .He has a defined status; he has a country and a home; a right to defend himself and his wife and children; a right to bear arms. . . .\" Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 2, p. 1266 (March 8, 1866) [Speech of congressman Henry J. Raymond (Republican-New York)] [bold emphasis added]\n \n In the Senate, the 14th. A. was introduced by its sponsor, Senator Jacob Howard. Concerning its purpose, he said the following:\n \n \"To these privileges and immunities should be added the personal rights guaranteed and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution; such as the freedom of speech and of the press; the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances, a right appertaining to each and all the people; the right to keep and to bear arms; the right to be exempted from the quartering of soldiers in a house without the consent of the owner; the right to be exempt from unreasonable searches and seizures, and from any search or seizure except by virtue of a warrant issued upon a formal oath or affidavit; the right of an accused person to be informed of the nature of the accusation against him, and his right to be tried by an impartial jury of the vicinage; and also the right to be secure against excessive bail and against cruel and unusual punishments.. . .[A]ll these immunities, privileges, rights, thus guaranteed by the Constitution or recognized by it, are secured to the citizens solely as a citizen of the United States and as a party in their courts. They do not operate in the slightest degree as a restraint or prohibition upon State legislation. . . .The great object of the first section of this amendment is, therefore, to restrain the power of the States and compel them at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees...\"Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 3, p. 2765 (May 23, 1866) [Speech of Senator Jacob M. Howard (Republican-Michigan)] [bold emphasis added] Note this quote was also cited by Justices Black and Duncan in their concurring opinion in Duncan v. LOUISIANA, 391 U.S. 145, 167 (1968), which held that the 14th. Amendment required the states to honor a defendant's 6th. Amendment right to trial by jury in criminal cases.\n \n How did the Senate react to Senator Howard's description of the Amendment? \"In the entire Senate debate on the Fourteenth Amendment, running from May 23 to June 8, not a single senator challenged Senator Howard's declaration that Section 1 made the first eight amendments enforceable against the states.\" Irving Bryant, The Bill of Rights, p. 337 (1965). [bold emphasis added]\n \n See also how the black community viewed the RKBA and the 2nd. A, as illustrated by the following excerpts from editorials published in a major southern black newspaper of the time:\n \n Editor Loyal Georgian: Have colored persons a right to own and carry firearms?--A Colored Citizen\n Almost every day we are asked questions similar to the above. We answer certainly you have the same right to own and carry arms that other citizens have. You are not only free but citizens of the United States and as such entitled to the same privileges granted to other citizens by the Constitution. . . .\n [and]\n Article II, of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States, gives the people the right to bear arms, and states that this right shall not be infringed. Any person, white or black, may be disarmed if convicted of making an improper or dangerous use of weapons, but no military or civil officer has the right or authority to disarm any class of people, thereby placing them at the mercy of others. All men, without distinction of color, have the right to keep and bear arms to defend their homes, families or themselves.\" From issues of the Loyal Georgian, January 20, 27 and February 3, 1866.

Like Michael Bellisiles, the award winner of the Pulitzer Prize who had to return it because he claimed his work was garnered from courthouse evidence that had been destroyed in the San Francisco fire; this nut doesn't even have that much credibility.\n \n The Articles of Confederation stated that was the main reason to include the Second Amendment of which all of the original 10 are sanctions AGAINST GOVERNMENT EXERCISE OF POWER and belong to the people. Despite the misconceptions of some even on my side of the aisle, slavery was an institution under British rule, selling slaves captured by Muslims and transported on mainly Dutch and other foreign ships.\n \n The Constitution was and is a freedom document and no mention is made of an institution of slavery but of freedom from excessive government period. The Articles of Confederation use no or not to limit gov't 24 times in the Articles and 22 times in the BOR. It doesn't say a darn thing about slaves. Slaves were considered private property and the idea of a cruel master perpetrated by revisionists is romantic irony but is about as believable as someone beating a prize race horse to death because he passed gas. Why would there be so many blacks fighting for the South by their own choice? Slavery was a gov't position and remains so today, the XIVth freed the slaves? and made us all slaves! If you really believe bogus why are you for gun control? sarge has you pegged right, you and those who think like you are SLAVERS.\n \n Ever count how many government employees, not military, make up the government's standing army?

   "According to Professor Bogus:\n \n \"The Second Amendment was not enacted to provide a check on government tyranny; rather, it was written to assure the Southern states that Congress would not undermine the slave system by using its newly acquired constitutional authority over the militia to disarm the state militia and thereby destroy the South's principal instrument of slave control....\n \n \"When the delegates to the ratifying convention met in Richmond on June 2, 1788, they knew that the Northern states were increasingly disgusted by slavery....Abolition fervor was running strongly in the North. Vermont, though not yet recognized as an independent state, abolished slavery outright in 1777.[94] Pennsylvania,[95] Rhode Island,[96] and New York[97] had all enacted gradual emancipation legislation. Some Northerners were not satisfied with gradual methods. Frustrated by the failure to end slavery immediately, prominent New York citizens formed the New York Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves.[98]...\n \n \"Virginia was a state living in perpetual fear.[105] Fully forty-four percent of Virginia's total population was black,[106] and in some areas, particularly in the eastern part of the state, blacks constituted the majority. Whites were ever mindful that if the right opportunity presented itself, blacks might cut their heads off.[107]....\n \n \"In 1788, Americans did not fear foreign invasion.[188] Nor did Americans still harbor the illusion that the militia could effectively contest trained military forces.[189] As previously discussed, the militia had performed woefully during the war. Virginia's militia, in particular, had disgraced itself by bolting before firing a single shot in the critical battle of Camden, South Carolina.[190] The militia were the last and [Page 346] best defense against slave insurrection but practically useless against a professional army....\n \n \"Mason personally owned three hundred slaves.[201] He understood the critical role of the militia in preserving the slave system. He knew firsthand from service at the Philadelphia Convention that the North was not sanguine about the slavery compromise and he could not help fearing how Congress would exercise its authority over the militia....\n \n \"As a Virginian, Madison knew that the militia's prime function in his state, and throughout the South, was slave control. His use of the word 'security' is consistent with his writing the amendment for the specific purpose of assuring the Southern states, and particularly his constituents in Virginia, that the federal government would not undermine their security against slave insurrection by disarming the militia.\"\n University of California at Davis Law Review\n \n So when the Second Amendment talks about the security of a free state is it referring to security against slave rebellions?\n\n \n The short answer is no. Bogus is a biased researcher pushing a flawed product. I read his article when it was first published, and in my opinion it has not improved with age. But it is too easy to just say \"Bogus is biased and cannot be believed.\" Therefore, let me offer some specific criticisms of his work.\n \n The article was Bogus' attempt to validate a collective/state's right theory. I believe this is the first time (at least it was the first time I had seen it before) that anyone suggested Madison had a secretive hidden agenda with the 2nd. Amendment. In a nutshell, Bogus claims the real purpose of the 2nd. Amendment was that of mollifying the southern slaveholding states by giving them a RKBA amendment which merely promised the federal government could not disarm the state militias they needed to keep their slaves in check. When I first read his article I did not find any evidence to support his claim. Upon reading it again I still can find none. In the article Bogus explains his lack of evidence this way:\n \n \"The history of the Second Amendment was hidden by design.\"\n \n According to Bogus, this collective/state's right design was hidden so well that Madison fooled everyone with it, and that it took some 200 years for an associate law professor with an active imagination to first uncover the Amendment's real purpose. The problem I have with Bogus is he ignores the mountain of direct evidence-from both Madison's own pen as well as many, many of his contemporaries-which show they all believed the RKBA was an individual right. (I'll cite several examples later in another post if you want me too). This is called direct evidence, and Bogus does nothing to dispute or refute the mountain of direct written evidence against his theory.\n \n Instead, he selectively takes one word from the amendment (\"security\") and reads it out of context to support his claim (that \"security\" really means protection from slave uprising rather than the actual amendment language \"security of a free state\"-where men live in freedom without fear of a domestic tyrant) . In doing so Bogus chooses, for example, to also ignore the language \"the right of the people\"-as well he should, for being a law professor he either knows or should know that Madison chose to use this specific language in the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Amendments, and that in each instance it refers to an individual right (1st \"the right of the people peaceably to assemble\"; 2nd \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\"; 4th \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\")\n \n In my opinion it is a poor argument indeed to suggest that Madison would choose such explicit individual right language as a cloak for his hidden collective/state's right agenda. \n \n Bogus does correctly tell us of the anti-federalist fear that Congress-having exclusive Article 1 section 8 power to arm and equip the militias-could effectively disarm the militias by simply refusing to arm them. Yet in such a circumstance the states cannot arm their own militias without running afoul of the Article 6 supremacy clause. Bogus fails to clearly explain how his hidden agenda purpose of the 2nd amendment would assist the states were this to happen. Interestingly enough, however, Bogus does cite U.S. v. Miller, which if he read in its entirety he would find tells him (and us) that the militias of the day were primarily armed by men \"appear[ing] bearing arms supplied by themselves and in common use at the time.\" \n \n What Bogus fails (or refuses) to see in my opinion is that the purpose of the congressional power to arm the militias was to better ensure the standardization of militia arms, while the purpose of the 2nd. Amendment (at least that part dealing with militias) was to ensure the people could remain individually armed and provide a source of emergency arms for service-which the states were forbidden by the Constitution to provide-if needed to confront a tyrant and maintain a \"free state.\" \n \n In any event, if the purpose of the amendment was to ensure the collective states' \"right\" to have an armed militia to keep slaves in bondage, then the Amendment could have easily been clearly written to read \"the states shall have the power to concurrently arm their militias\" (or, the Article 1 section 8 congressional power clause could have been amended to grant the states concurrent power to arm their militias if Congress refused to do so). Madison (a slave owner himself before, during, and after his presidency) could have avoided all this risk of being so misunderstood by writing it this way. And if, as Bogus claims, slavery was so embarrassing then there is equally no need to mention the purpose of continuing slavery at all with this language. \n \n But Bogus presses on with his theory in his article. He wraps up his theory with an apology for not having any direct evidence to support it:\n \n \"The evidence that the Second Amendment was written to assure the South that the federal government would not disarm its militia is, I suggest, considerable. However, the evidence is almost entirely circumstantial.[303] If the thesis is sound, why is no direct evidence to be found supporting it?\"\n \n Here Bogus admits he cannot offer a single piece of direct evidence in support of his hidden agenda theory (a speech, a quote from private letters, etc.). But he goes on to tell us it's not his fault. Instead, he speculates that a stenographer's conspiracy may have existed to deny him direct evidence of his theory:\n \n \"That is, to the extent that express statements about slave control were made at ratifying conventions in the South or later in the First Congress, stenographers may have considered it both politic and convenient to abbreviate or omit those remarks.\"\n \n We are, therefore, truly fortunate to be able to rely upon professor Bogus' powers of divination to discover the true meaning of the 2nd. Amendment. And, perhaps knowing that such a mystical ability would be doubted, Bogus seeks to reassure the reader of the strength of circumstantial evidence were his power of divination actually on trial (in footnote 303):\n \n \"303. As evidence experts understand, however, circumstantial evidence can be just as strong and compelling as direct evidence and sometimes even more so. See JOHN HENRY WIGMORE, 1a EVIDENCE IN TRIALS AT COMMON LAW \u00a7 26, at 961 (rev. by Petter Tillers 1983); see also GRAHAM C. LILLY, AN INTRODUCTION TO THE LAW OF EVIDENCE 49 (3d ed. 1996).\"\n \n I am familiar with Wigmore's treatise, which is heavily relied upon in my state. I cite Bogus' claim about the power of circumstantial evidence here because I want to tell you he withholds from the reader the following contradictory and well known statement about this type of evidence:\n \n \"When the evidence is wholly circumstantial, as here, all necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The chain of necessary circumstances must be unbroken.\" Inge v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 360, 366, 228 S.E.2d 563, ___ (1976) \n \n That is, what Bogus hides from the reader with his \"my circumstantial evidence can be strong\" claim is that when, as he does, you rely wholly on circumstantial evidence, then it is only considered strong evidence when there are no facts, direct or otherwise, which contradict the circumstantial evidence's theory. As I said, I can give several quotes from Madison and others referring to the RKBA as an individual right, all of which Bogus simply chooses to ignore. \n \n In the end, Bogus' research methodology really seems to mirror that of Bellesiles'. This complaint was made about Bellesiles' research, which applies just as equally to Bogus' research: He showed up at a cocktail party and immediately stood up on his toes to peer over the crowded room of direct and contradictory evidence in search of a few circumstantial evidence friends.\n \n In his article Bogus reports from the cocktail party that there was: \"a tacit collaboration to leave unsaid what everyone so clearly understood.\" (the \"understanding\" being that the amendment is not about individual liberties but only intended to protect a state's right to arm its militia). \n \n This quote leads me to ask Bogus which conspiracy theory he is really relying upon now. Was it a conspiracy of the founders to leave this secret purpose unsaid between them? Or, as he suggested earlier, did the founders debate the wisdom of this secret purpose between themselves only to have the stenographers later conspire to edit it all out?) Regardless of which unproven conspiracy theory bogus relies upon to support his claim, I cannot resist offering at least one example of someone who either didn't get the message or who managed to avoid the censorship altogether:\n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, discussing the purpose of the Second Amendment in his \"Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution,\" published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1. (Emphasis added)\n \n \"It has appeared to me that a few well tempered observations on these propositions might have good effect. . . .It may perhaps be of use in the present turn of the public opinions in New York State . . .\" Tench Coxe, 12 Madison Papers, pp. 239-240 (Rutland Ed. 1979) [Letter from Coxe to Madison, June 18, 1789, offering his \"Remarks\" to help sway public opinion toward ratification of the proposed Bill of Rights during Madison's campaign for their adoption in New York].\n \n \"[Your] printed remarks enclosed [with your letter] are already I find in the Gazettes here. . . .[my proposed amendments are] therefore already indebted to the co-operation of your pen.\" Id. p. 257 (Rutland Ed. 1979) [Letter from Madison to Coxe, June 24, 1789, thanking him for the help with his \"Remarks\"].\n \n There, that's enough criticism for now of Bogus' bogus theory. In the end, I ask that you go back and read what has been written about the purpose and intent of the 14th. Amendment-and then consider this:\n \n Assuming for a moment that Bogus was correct-that the 2nd Amendment was intended to be only a states'/collective right to keep the sword in the hands of the southern states and allow them to hold the black man in bondage. Didn't the 14th. Amendment deliberately take that sword of out of the hands of the untrustworthy southern state governments and beat it into an individual right shield which applied to all citizens in all states-thereby providing the black man a means of defense against state sponsored oppression? \n \n In other words, assuming Bogus was correct, isn't his theory rendered moot by the 14th. Amendment?",

   "I always found it interesting that some Amendments were passed at a time of 'reconstruction' when Northern capetbaggers took every advantage of the South and during this time when the XIVth, XVth, XVIth and XVIIth Amendments were passed, the Southern States legislators were not permitted to convene and Secretary of State, Knox, presumed to \"deem them incorporated\". That is a statement and not a question.\n \n Slavery persisted in the North long after the EP was issued to make slavery an issue where it was NOT before for recruitment into the Northern armies. The first draft riots occured during Lincoln's presidency and when told what he was doing was unconstitutional, ordered the arrest of Chief Justice, Taney.\n \n Ghandi might well look upon this as \"the darkest(no pun intended) days of the Republic\".\n \n Walter Williams writes of these days when there were many black Confederate troops who volunteered while the North impressed them into service and servitude and rightly called it the \"War of Northern Agression\".\n \n Confederate General Robert E. Lee was NOT tried for any crime because of fear that and charges on their face would set him free. The North was afraid to try him on Constitutional charges!\n \n Recidivists such as Bogus chose not to talk about the Constitutional issues at question but to regurgitate an existing escuse for Northern Agression which still held slaves long after the war. The IXth amendment is/was the principle reason for the War of Northern Agression and had the con-gress had the Republic and the peoples as well as the founders' intent at heart there would never have been a war. The XIVth merely made slaves of us all! \n \n Justice W.O. Douglas, who wrote about this in a link I have already posted twice, was well aware of that salient fact and contended that the issue was still as valid now as it was now. We may soon see another 'rebellion' which he contended was due. I think we have signs today that prove him correct? As it was then, it is now and the States are rebelling at a federal government exceeding their mandated powers expressed in Article 1, section 8.\n \n The gun grabbers choose to make gun issues a point instead of slavery and so far the States are winning this war...at this time. I do not think the meaning of the implied powers will be meaningless as the battle of minds continue. The States, or the people rightfully have all the power not delegated to the Federal government in their hands. How the Feds choose to deal with this reigning in of their powers to their rightful Constitutional place will determine whether Justice Douglas fears or not?",

If I had attended Yale then maybe I would have avoided a typo I just corrected in my Carl Bogus criticism. \n I am a proud graduate of East Carolina University (but I went elsewhere for law school). \n \n Bogus' article has irked me over the years and when I saw it again I confess I let slip my inner pirate. He viewed the re-sighting of the Bogus law review article as the morning fog lifting to reveal once again the sail of a heavily laden and unsuspecting merchant ship and he cried out: \"Call up the watch below! Open the weapons lockers and arm the men with boarding axes! I intend to lay a course alongside him, fire a broadside into him, and then board him in the smoke!\" This type of thing has happened before, and when it does my hands seem to always translate these orders into sarcasm which I usually reserve for fools like the poster called \"Brady.\" Carl Bogus may be other things, but I do not think he is a fool.\n \n Therefore, I will say that it is perhaps unfair to criticize Bogus' work thus when he is not here to defend himself, but such is the nature of blogging.

Iatrogenic is a term used when a patient dies as a direct result of treatments by a physician, whether it is from misdiagnosis of the ailment or from adverse drug reactions used to treat the illness. (drug reactions are the most common cause).\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The National Academies website published an article titled \"Preventing Death and Injury From Medical Errors Requires Dramatic, System-Wide Changes.\" which you can read online at http://www4.nationalacademies.org/news.nsf/isbn/0309068371?OpenDocument or the book \"To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System\" at To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System - These show medical errors as a leading cause of death.\n \n Based on the findings of one major study, medical errors kill some 44,000 people in U.S. hospitals each year. Another study puts the number much higher, at 98,000. Even using the lower estimate, more people die from medical mistakes each year than from highway accidents, breast cancer, or AIDS. And deaths from medication errors that take place both in and out of hospitals are aid to be more than 7,000 annually.\n \n Footnote: Number of physicians in the U.S..........................................700,000\n Accidental deaths caused by physicians per year................120,000\n \n This information was sent to us indicating that it came from the Benton County News Tribune on the seventeenth of November, 1999",

But the argument that stricter gun laws in areas with more people from minority groups shows that gun control is racist is also entirely circumstantial. Furthermore, if gun laws in areas with a high percentage of minority groups are truly discriminatory then such laws could be challenged in our courts. So why isn't this happening? Probably because such \"discriminatory\" laws would not be considered discriminatory under US law. Some people seem quite willing to deviate from what constitutes discrimination under US law when it's convenient to their argument.\n\n \n I would point out that in a court of law circumstancial evidendence is held to a higher standard of proof. Yet I fear it is totally lost on you. \n \n Well here is a lot more Gun Defenses in the media than 44. But I doubt you will read.\n http://www.claytoncramer.com/gundefenseblog/blogger.html",

   "I'll let the Supreme Court decide that one. Regardless, states are still required to treat their citizens equally as far as restrictions on guns go. A state or city, for example, can't ban only Latinos from owning handguns. If they ban handguns then they have to ban all racial groups in that state or city from owning handguns.\n\n \n So, despite my thrice printed and linked Preamble to the BOR, you continue to pretend that those first ten amendments are granted government powers when in fact it is retained rights by the PEOPLE and a bar against government intervention which no branch of government can abridge nor infringe upon. The Court(s) are but one of three branches of government. The FF in the preamble said \"NO\" to all government branches.\n \n Your catty and ignorant remark about \"lteeing the Supreme Court decide that is rediculous.

You lost yours and it must chaff a lot to be a subject of the British empire emoticon_xhoho \n \n We fought a revolution and sent them packing and formed a Republic with the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land that trumps any branch of government including the Supreme Court.
