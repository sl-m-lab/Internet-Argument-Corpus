   "Here are some quotations from the Quran:\n \n \"Fight against those who believe not in Allah....\" (Sura 9:29)\n \n \"Muhammad is the Messenger of All, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves....\" (Sura 48:29)\n \n \"O you who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are close to you, and let them find harshness in you, and know that Allah is with those who are the Al-Muttaq (the pious - see V.2:2).\"\n (Sura 9:123)\n \n \"Jihad (holy fighting in Allah's Cause) is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know.\" (Sura 2:216)\n \n \"O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends, etc.) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse...\" (Sura 3:118)\n \n http://www.unn.ac.uk/societies/islamic/quran/naeindex.htm",
