   "Lying one one's resume is definite grounds for termination.\n \n Think of it this way.\n \n You have several people lined up for a job but you can only hire a few if only one. That one person you hire has not only cheated your company but cheated all the other applicants applying for the job who may be more qualified than he or she.\n Second that person you hire lied about previous experience he or she had at one time or another. Imagine how costly it would be if for example you hired the individual as a product salesperson believing they had previous experience in the field, but instead they knew nothing about selling. It hurts your company's reputation and finances. The average person tells 5-10 people about a bad experience with a company.\n Lastly would you even want a person who lied to the job to work for you? What does it say about their moral character and integrity that they lied and cheated your system. The person is obviously not a person you would want working for you.\n In summary it is definite grounds for termination",
