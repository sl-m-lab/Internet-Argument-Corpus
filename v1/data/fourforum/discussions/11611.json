   "...and just how did Obama rise so fast on the Democratic scene?\n \n http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0803/S00452.htm\n \n Tony Rezko started the snowball rolling.\n \n This article is the first in a series that will give the details of Obama's rise to fame. \n \n As for the most recognized allegation against Obama, that helped slumlords operate in Chicago, while accepting their campaign contributions, its true. Obama was a member of the political machine that helped a whole gang of slumlords funnel local, state and federal tax dollars, over the backs of poor people in need of affordable housing, to line their own pockets and fund the campaigns of politicians in positions to recommend and award contracts. \n \n The Davis Miner Barnhill & Galland law firm, where Obama worked for nearly a decade, served as a hub for a slew of slumlord deals, many that benefited the firm's founder, Allison Davis, and Obama's claims that he knew nothing about the inner workings of this small firm, represent an insult to the intelligence of the American public. \n \n Tony Rezko was Obama political Godfather. Obama received his first contributions of $2,000, to launch his political career as a state senator on July 31, 1995, from Rezko. Obama started out saying that Rezko only raised $50,000 or $60,000 for his political career but after a year of lying his way through the primaries, the latest total he gave to the Sun-Times and Tribune during interviews on March 14, 2008, adds up to $250,000. \n \n For a year, he also minimized his relationship with Rezko by telling the media that he only had dinner or lunch with Rezko one or twice a year. But when confronted by Sun-Times reporters during the March 14 interview, with the allegation that an FBI mole saw him coming and going to Rezko's office often and that three sources said he talked to Rezko on the phone daily, Obama changed his tune. \n \n Now the story is that he may have talked to Rezko daily at times during campaigns but sometimes he went for a whole month without talking to him. \"I have to say we're talking over the course of 10 years,\" Obama said, \"there might have been spurts where I talked to him daily.\" \n \n But then he added: \"There might have been stretches over a month where I wouldn't have talked to him at all.\" \n \n This story is a far cry from the picture Obama gave to the public of him and Rezko meeting once or twice a year, and he never did respond to the allegation by the Times reporter that an FBI mole \"saw you coming and going from Rezko's office a lot.\" \n \n Without Rezko's fundraising, Obama would not have been elected to the Illinois senate, or the US Senate, and he would not have sold the books he wrote about himself because like the Wizard of Oz, Obama is nobody special. \n \n Even with Rezko's massive fund raising, Obama could not beat former Black Panther, Bobby Rush, in his 2000 bid for a seat in Congress. And the only reason he won the US Senate race was because his viable opponents had to drop out due to the public airing of personal scandals. Beating Alan Keyes is hardly a victory to brag about. \n \n The media needs to quit grouping all the Obama backers under the name Antoin \"Tony\" Resko because the list of contributors to his political campaigns includes the names of many individuals and entities with their own agendas. \n \n The trail of corruption involving the people raising money for Obama's political career stretches from the city of Chicago to the Illinois tollway to the O'Hare airport all the way over to Iraq. And testimony in Rezko's corruption trial reveals that an equal number of Democrat and Republican crooks benefited from all the moneymaking schemes. \n \n Rezko is not a Democrat; he's an equal opportunity profiteer. He supported President George Bush and attended a Christmas party at the White House in December 2003, at the same time that he was a top fundraiser for Obama's US Senate campaign. \n \n Rezko co-hosted a $3.8 million Chicago fundraiser for Bush in 2003, and on December 9, 2003, he donated $4,000 to Bush, as a \"self-employed businessman,\" and gave another $2,000 on December 19, 2003, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. \n \n Prior to backing Rod Blagojevich for governor of Illinois, Rezko threw his money behind Republican candidates for governor, including George Ryan, who was convicted of doling out leases and contracts to cronies and sentenced to prison for more than 6 years. \n \n Rezko then switched horses and chose Blagojevich in 2002 and Obama has supported Blagojevich, even when his administration was embroiled in corruption investigations. \n Recent testimony in the Rezko trial by his co-conspirator, Chicago businessman, Stuart Levine, explained that Rezko had plans for Blagojevich to be Presidential, not Obama. However, anybody following the trial knows that Blagojevich is more likely to be headed to the \"Big House\" rather than occupying the White House. \n \n Obama's entering into real estate deals with Rezko, while it was public knowledge that he was under investigation for funneling illegal contributions to Illinois politicians, was not a \"boneheaded\" move, it was motivated by pure greed. While knowing that he would get caught up in a major scandal, Obama went ahead with the deal because he and his wife wanted that mansion, with four fireplaces, six bathrooms, and a wine cellar, period. \n \n On March 16, 2008, the Boston Globe added an interesting twist to the story when reporting that Donna Schwan, of MetroPro Realty, which listed the mansion and lot next door for the owners, \"said it is her recollection that the Obamas may not have made the highest bid, and that other bidders may have matched Rezko's bid,\" but the willingness of both buyers to close in June 2005, \"was decisive.\" \n \n Which logically means had Rezko not been willing to buy the lot in June, the deal was off. \n \n According to an article by Edward McClelland in the February 1, 2008 Salon Magazine, when asked who approached her about the house, Donna Schwan told Salon, \"I honestly don't remember. Tony Rezko lived across the street, so he'd been interested in the lot.\" \n \n Any claim that Obama was unaware of the investigations into the corrupt dealings of Rezko with Illinois politicians in June 2005 is ridiculous. On February 15, 2005, the Chicago Tribune reported: \n \n \n \"Gov. Rod Blagojevich long has vowed to purge the Illinois tollway of cronyism, yet two of his closest friends and political advisers have links to food vendors awarded lucrative contracts to operate inside the toll road's sleek new oases, government records show.\" \n \"The Subway sandwich shops and Panda Express Asian restaurants now being installed in the tollway's seven revamped rest stops are controlled by firms with strong ties to the food-service empire of Antoin \"Tony\" Rezko, a Blagojevich confidant who has seeded the governor's cabinet with former business underlings.\"\n \n Christopher Kelly, Blagojevich's chief fundraiser, \"who also recommended the tollway's executive director for his job, is an investor in at least one Rezko-controlled food firm,\" the Tribune wrote. On March 16, 2005, the Tribune reported that: \n \n \n \"City officials alleged Tuesday that a minority contractor at O'Hare International Airport acted as a front for a firm run by Antoin \"Tony\" Rezko, a top adviser and fundraiser for Gov. Rod Blagojevich.... \n \"Rezko, a member of Blagojevich's kitchen cabinet of advisers, has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks following questions about his links to operators of new tollway oasis franchises. The revamp of the oases is a showcase project for the Blagojevich administration.\" \n \n On May 15, 2005, the Sun-Times reported that the accusations by his father-in-law that Blagojevich doled out jobs for campaign contributions had \"resulted in dozens of grand jury subpoenas being sent to the governor's office, his unpaid advisers, agency directors and his top fund-raisers\". \n Among those subpoenaed for documents, sources told the Times, were \"Blagojevich's biggest money men, Christopher Kelly and Antoin \"Tony\" Rezko.\" \n \n On May 20, 2005, less than a month before Obama bought the mansion, the Tribune reported that Resko, \"has had a business relationship with First Lady Patti Blagojevich for eight years, the governor's office acknowledged Thursday.\" \n Six month before Obama bought the strip of land from Rezko's \"wife\" to enlarge his yard, on August 28, 2005, Natasha Korecki reported in the Sun-Times that, \"there's so much corruption to investigate in the Chicago area, the FBI is adding manpower.\" \n \n Robert Grant, FBI Special Agent in Charge, told the Times that he had reorganized the bureau to add a third public corruption squad, giving Chicago the largest corruption unit in the country, even bigger than those in New York and Los Angeles. \n \n \"It is the second time in two years the FBI in Chicago has expanded its public corruption force,\" Korecki noted. \n \n On November 6, 2006, the Times asked Obama why he did not reveal the land deal with Rezko before it was reported by the Tribune stating: \"Why did you not publicly disclose the transaction after Rezko got indicted?\" \n \n \"At the time, it didn't strike me as relevant,\" Obama answered. It seems like a lot of events were not relevant a couple months before he announced his candidacy for president.",

   "Now for some truthful and balanced perspective to your lies. THE FACTS REGARDING THE $20 MILLION DOLLAR DEBT!\n\n \n From Archie's source\n \"Wasilla voters agreed in 2002 to a half-percent increase in the city sales tax to pay off a $14.7 million bond to build the multi-use facility.\"\n \n \"The operating cost and revenue picture is less rosy. The complex saw a loss of just over $145,000 in fiscal year 2004, according to a 2005 financial report from the Wasilla finance department. Preliminary numbers show a loss of just over $212,000 in fiscal year 2005\"\n \n From Wikipedia\n \"The cost went over budget due to an eminent domain lawsuit brought by the prior property owner, Gary Lundgren.\"\n \n From The WSJ\n \"Litigation resulting from the dispute over Ms. Palin's sports-complex project is still in the courts, with the land's former owner seeking hundreds of thousands of additional dollars from the city.\"\n \n \"Last year, the arbitrator ordered the city to pay $836,378 for the 80-acre parcel, far more than the $126,000 Wasilla originally thought it would pay for a piece of land 65 acres larger. The arbitrator also determined that the city owed Mr. Lundgren $336,000 in interest. Wasilla's legal bill since the eminent domain action has come to roughly $250,000 so far, according to Mr. Klinkner, the city attorney.\"\n \n So no one here is lying Archie, except your source.",
