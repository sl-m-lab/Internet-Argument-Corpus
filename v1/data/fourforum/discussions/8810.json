   "Though I can understand that the \"If X will happen anyway, its better to make it legal\" arguement cannot be applied in all cases, there are cases where it is a valid arguement. If a society imposes a very unfair law that violates rights that people believe are natural rights, then large numbers of people might disobey such laws and, where human rights are concerned, they might have a strong case supporting such dissent. \n \n As an extreme example to illustrate this point, imagine if, in the USA, a law was passed allowing sex only for the purposes of childbearing, and limiting those acts to people under, say, 40 since those are the best childbearing years. (This assumes that the extreme minority who hold such opinions were able to put this into law). Then, I think nearly all would agree that violating such a law, though illegal, would still be morally justified since the law would violate what people hold as certain natural rights. Of course, as with the example of people justifying theft, the great majority of laws do not impose on the strongest held views of natural rights, so very few would argue to abolish those laws. \n \n The trouble comes where there is a very commonly held view of a natural right that is not shared by all. in this case, I am talking about the natural right to control over ones own body. A very large number of Americans (and others throughout the world) hold this so strongly as a natural right that they would be willing to take illegal actions under certain circumstances in order to protect it. Unfortunately for women with unwanted pregnancies, at some point humans do also acquire the natural right to life. A lot of the discussions we have had in this forum concentrate on when such a right comes into being. I will leave that for another thread. My bottom line is that we, as a society, need to finally come to some consensus about which natural rights are critical, whether the right to ones body is one of those, and how the rights should be balanced.",

But what I find interesting is that people tend to selectively call it either a \"baby\" or a \"fetus\" depending on what makes them feel best at the time, or what fits their politics. People call it a \"baby\" when they want it to be a baby. (\"Doctor, is my baby inside going to be ok\"?) But then when people want to avoid thinking of the baby in a personal way, they use clinical terms like fetus, or pregnancy. That, IMO, devalues the baby. If a human life can, at times, have enough value to be called a baby, then it should always have that sort of value.\n \n I was looking at a family planning website recently where they avoided calling it a baby by using the term \"pregnancy\" even using it as a noun FOR the baby. It said something to the effect of 'this procedure will stop the growth of the pregnancy inside you' or something to that effect. What it really meant is that it will stop the growth of the baby/fetus inside by killing it. I just find it interesting the way that terminology is often watered down or at least changed to fit however someone wants to think about it. It seems to me that if a human life can be valued in ANY context, it should always be treated as such.",

Killing a well developed fetus likely is. That's why I draw the window of opportunity (to abort) as the first tri-mester.

This would make no sense anyway and would be the first time every that something becoming legal sparked a decrease in that activity (as opposed to consequences of that activity). Not to mention abortion wasn't even illegal in all states.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. I didn't say there was a decrease in the number of abortions, I'm saying that abortion becoming legal didn't spark a great deal of increase just because it was now legal. This is evidenced by the birth rate between before Roe and after Roe. The legality affected other things that could have lead to an increase, but the legality itself didn't increase the number of abortions done. Logically, were abortion to suddenly become illegal, those who desire abortions would still desire them and would likely be able to acquire them, as evidenced by the fact that abortions were done despite the law before, and techniques are even easier to employ now. The numbers would likely decrease, but I doubt very far.\n \n \nYou could easily stop doctors from doing it. Doctors are caught providing drugs (illegally) all the time...this would be no different.

Not terribly many, from what I've seen. Combine this with the ability to perform a self-abortion and the information to do so is freely disseminated and you have a law that is very difficult to enforce, practically speaking.\n \n \nStill irrelevant to the argument presented by the orginal poster. If you wish to discuss this point (whether a law should be created if hard to enforce) than start another topic.\n\n \n We are assuming that point here, Steve, and was part of my original post that you replied to. The entire point of whether the law would be practical to enforce assumes that an unenforcable law (without draconian measures, at least) should not exist.\n \n \nAppeal to fear...some will even have a fallacy of \"dooms day\".\n\n \n It would be so if I said: Given the demand, unregulated illegal supply would skyrocket and police would be completely unable to stop women from performing abortions upon themselves with ascorbic acid or merely throwing themselves upon chairs, thereforce abortion needs to be kept legal\n \n I did not.

   "I think you're dead wrong here. What if you don't think that \"X\" is a bad or should be considered a crime? Consider prohibition, people still drank...crime skyrocketed etc. Only when it became legal again could it be regulated and handled more efficiently. \n \n Nobody said that just because abortion will happen anyway if made illegal that that argument could be made for everything else. Steve was the one that brought this whole X thing up (which doesn't surprise me). You can't just assume that you can look at an issue blindly, you have to consider each circumstance and situation.\n\n \n The logic makes no sense...you don't have to consider circumstance. Just look at the argument and break it down.\n \n \"If abortion is made illegal people will still have abortions but they will be unsafe and thus abortion should be legal and safe\".\n \n In this argument you have a premise that 1) abortions will still happen if illegal and 2) unsafe abortions are a bad thing (implied). What you are trying to do is throw in other arguments such as \"abortion being illegal is a bad thing\" and \"unsafe abortions are worse than unsafe theft...etc\". Both of these are not implied nor are they part of the argument. The argument rests soley on the fact that someone will still happen if made illegal. Now lets use this logic again.... \"if insider trading is made illegal(which it is) people will still do insider trading and thus insider trading should be legal\". If you want to include both premises you would use the theft example shown earlier. Now do they both meet the standards set from the orginal premise? Yes. Theft (or insider trading) will still happen if illegal. Unsafe theft is a bad thing (no one wants the C-store man to be dead). Without any other qualifiers the same logic test applies and the conclusion must be same. This is pretty basic logic if you decide to take a philosophy course at a college.\n \n Now if you say in your argument that there is nothing worse (or not many things worse) than an unsafe abortion then the theft example can't be used and the point actually makes sense to people. You simply implied this part instead of actually looking at what was written. Saying \"it will happen anyway\" is not enough to make a convincing argument.\n \n \nWhat if you don't think that \"X\" is a bad or should be considered a crime\n NOT PART OF THE ARGUMENT. Come on now... your point here is not that \"it will happen anyway\" but that the law is unjust.",

   "What exactly am I not understanding?\n \n \nNo matter what emotional issues you tie to \"X\" in the invalid logic train, the logic remains invalid.\n\n \n We disagree. There is a difference between allowing rape to be legal because men are going to do it anyway and allowing abortion to be legal because women are going to do it anyway. How can you not see that? Even if you think that the logic of allowing something to be legal because people are going to do it anyway is invalid it doesn't make it any less real. \n \n I don't see why some people on this board keep insisting that just because ONE aspect of keeping abortion legal is that \"it will happen anyway\" that that small argument can be applied to anything?

You weigh all the factors (pros and cons) then you vote on the proposed restricting laws.\n\n \n One of the cons of prohibition of abortion is that people are going to have them anyway and that will lead to unsafe abortion practices.

You cannot just ignore a huge part of the issue just because you don't agree with the logic! \n \n I think that this logic should be applied to any issue where illegalization makes that practice unsafe for people, such as abortion.

They both do this because they are both parasites, living off the blood of the host organism. In the case of the fetus, the host is a human female. In the case of the fleas, the host is a mangy yard dog.\n \n Now I suppose you will make the mistake of saying I'm equating expectant mothers to mangy yard dogs.
