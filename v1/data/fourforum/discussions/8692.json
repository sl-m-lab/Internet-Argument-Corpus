I'm not so much out to \"convert\" the other person/people to my way of thinking but rather to get them to teach me something.\n \n I know that seems somehow backwards but it can be a useful tool when you want to learn more about the otherside. \n \n Mark",

I've found that when debating once in a while attempting to prove myself right, I realize that all the evidence seems to point the other way. It teaches you to think, support opinions, and you learn a lot as well. All in all it's fun. I see you're new, welcome. emoticon_xhoho",

   "The secret to a good debate is to tell them a story that doesn't lead anywhere... like the time I went to Boston: I woke up early that morning to go to Boston, but then I remembered I was in Las Vegas, \"How'd I get here?\" I asked myself. Turns out I really wasn't in Las Vegas but in Pittsburgh. So as I walked around the Steel City, I noticed not everything was made of steel, so I complained to the mayor that my hair dryer didn't work. After a six-minute coffee break, I went back to the President's house and thought about Starbucks the rest of the day. Afterwords, I went to meet President Bush (when he bailed me out of jail), he said he had no more money to bail people out with, so I gave him a nickel. back in those days nickels were made of wood and had pictures of bumblebees on them. \"Give me five bees for a quarter,\" youl'd say...\n \n Sorry, I got off track a bit...\n \n Another tactic for fighting the war is to use... for a debate is to use all facts, but no opinions, so people don't know if you are for it or against it. FOr example: \"What is your opinion of nuclear fusion?\" You respond, \"Nuclear fusion is when two hydrogen atoms come together to form a helium atom.\" You are not wrong, but you avoided the question, so there is two pluses! At the end of debate, say the people can form their own opinions with the facts you gave them, then make a big long speech on how not to rock the boat, against the lyrics to a song.\n \n Or you can talk about some completly diffrent, like instead of talking about nuclear fusion, talk about global warming, then when the question-asker asks you why you did not answer the question in proper context, tell them that topic is boring.\n \n Now if you are in a serious debate, do not listen to a word I just... typed. Instead, listen to this advice given to me by a great professor, Dr. Hitrockbottom: \"When giving a debate, be sure not to answer truthfully, as the people do not want to hear truth, they want to hear opinions that match theirs. So, find the shared opinions of the crowd, and just repeat what they belive in, do not enforce them or break them, just repeat their ideas.\" Great teacher, great person, too bad he doesn't exist...",

   "you have the right attitude. debating is usually more about testing your own opinion than shooting down your opponent's. but there are ways to do it that make your debate more effective regardless of your intent. the best method is asking questions. questions do a lot of wonderful things in a debate. they are open-ended and invite the discussion to continue. they force the other contributors to think along the topic of the question, rather than repeating the pre-memorized scripts they were already armed with. and they make you put more thought into your own contributions by initiating critical thought\n \n another thing you'll notice is that on this forum you'll find a lot of debates, but more often you'll find a lot of discussions. and the difference is important. a discussion is where ideas meet and bounce off the participants and everybody benefits, while in a debate you usually start off with two people with fixed opinions in their heads, and end up with a \"winner\" and a \"loser\", each with the same fixed opinions in their heads\n \n welcome to 4forums!",
