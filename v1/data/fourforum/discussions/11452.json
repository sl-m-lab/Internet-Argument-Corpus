   "Mission in Afghanistan is upgraded ... in Central Asia?\n \n Americans' fight on terrorism in Afghanistan brings no sizable results! Daily skirmishes with Tallibs make Pentagon happy and the allies too. \n In connection with deplorable situation Pentagon tries to increase military contingent in nearby Central Asia which comes really costly to taxpayers here. It looks that one military base Manas in Kyrgyzstan is not enough and we need to spend more money to have our military units in Uzbekistan as well! With this end in mind our military brass have been in secret talks with the local dictator President Karimov! This is definitely a blow to our reputation. \n I strongly doubt such an effort may bring any victory in Afghanistan. Pentagon should rather sort it out with the Brits first. They are said to be playing footsie with the Talibs behind our back in Afghanistan....",
