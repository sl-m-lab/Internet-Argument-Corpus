   "England: main topic of the day\n \n Hello, let me once more nibble at a subject of England's failure to qualify for Euro2008. Why did we fail then? Like many other footy fans, I believed until very recently that it's all Steve McClaren's fault as it was owing to his disastrous handling of the team's goalkeepers. It's true that McClaren had kept faith with error-prone Robinson, only to axe him when it came to that sensational game against Croatia. \n Now, why did McClaren switched keepers all of a sudden? It came to me that it all had a connection to certain schemes and intrigues by keeper Robinson. Two days before the game with Croatia, he clenched an illegal bargain through an intermediary at a betting shop worth of &#1032;1.5 mn for England losing at full-time. That was a sure thing. However, at the very last moment McClaren got wind of Robinson's betting and decided at once to replace him with inexperienced Scott Carson when Robinson was to be sitting on the bench. It was in McClaren's plans to disclose a little secret of Robinson right after the game against Croatia, but then Robinson offered McClaren to halve the winnings providing that McClaren bosoms his shame and they chapped hands. \n Now you see that England is no exception and there is sport corruption in English footy as well like everywhere else in the world. I dare say that corruption is thriving not only in English sports but also in government, politics, banking and many other spheres! It is also exceedingly lamentable that Gordon Brown does almost nothing to suppress corruption. Honestly, that's perhaps the main thing that I am dissatisfied with him. Football is like a marker that indicates that things are worsening in England. Now we trench upon the game that is our national pride and what's next? I think that in a global sense, all that is going on in England is a fault of PM Brown. Perhaps, a pre-term election of prime minister is a sound thing that would clearly show sentiments of the public.",

Nor do I think it's good policy to liquidate productive assets merely to provide a government with cash.

I can see the reasons for inheritance or estate taxes -- it's society's way of raking back a bit of a lifetime's profit earned from other members of society, in order to provide more equal opportunities for a new generation.\n \n To dismiss it as mere \"envy\" is to miss the point. One shouldn't confuse what may be personal feelings and motivations for some with the beneficial social results of the policy. Admittedly, one can argue constructively about how punitive an inheritance tax should be, and whom it should hit, but I don't think it's a totally illegitimate way of redistributing income after a wealthy person has died.\n \n And what is wrong with envy, anyway? It's a good, solid, capitalist motivation for work!\n\n \n what about taxing the royals?\n \n all you have to do avoid inheritance tax is to set up a family trust fund.",

If you can work half the amount of time to achieve the same standard of living, wouldn't you choose to do that?

   "Gordon Brown and his rotten Labour govt have been plotting against their own people!! At least they treat Brits as low-branded mob. I was just bursting with indignation when reading about the Labour plan to bar Brits from voting and debating the new basic EU agreement destined to substitute the European Constitution. Fancy the thing! They want this vital document regulating our lives to be ratified quietly in the parliament. Aren't they in the know that 87% of the interviewed Brits are supportive of the nation-wide debates?! \n Well, I see this scornful attitude of the Labour govt as a very bad sign. If we all swallow this they'll soon introduce some form of the authoritarian governance here. I'd rather kick them out!",
