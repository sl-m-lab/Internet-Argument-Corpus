   "Epaphras,\n \nWhat does Paul say in 1cor? Where specifically? I have read maccabees and do use it often as a historical text although I don't really consider it scripture. (another debate). Why is purgatory necessary given the satisfaction of father in the sacrifice of christ?\n\n \n Here's my take on Purgatory from another debate I had with someone:\n \n If you can understand that we can take action to cooperate or to deny God then it is easier to understand Purgatory. We can also take action to intercede for others. Realize that Purgatory has little to do with salvation. All of the souls of Purgatory will get to heaven. They are all saved (1 John 5:17, not all sin is mortal that will cause the person to go to hell, yet they can't go to heaven with lesser sins due to the necessity of perfection and purity before entering heaven). In Purgatory, although souls are already saved, they must be purified because Jesus says in Mark 9:49  that \"everyone will be salted with fire.\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 3 is a good illustration of purgatory. Paul wrote, \"...I laid a foundation, and another man is building upon it. Let each man take care how he builds upon it.\" Then he speaks of the fact that \"any man's\" work will be put to the test. But there are numerous other indications in scripture of an intermediate state prior to heaven (1 Peter 3:19  shows that an intermediate state (though not Purgatory in this passage) is not only a possibility but also a reality). The doctrine of Purgatory rests on the fact that nothing unclean can enter heaven. But, wait a minute, is God asking of us something that we cannot give him? The catholic would say, no.\"The Book of Revelation in Chapter 21 states that God does not want the filth of sin in heaven for it says, \"But nothing unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination or falsehood...\" So can one enter heaven unclean in a cloak of righteousness? It seems that the uncleanness is still there but it is covered up and hidden. God does not hide things. He brings them to the light. God's goodness is pure and undefiled through and through. So too, if we are to go to heaven we must be pure and undefiled. We will be pure and good if we reach heaven as we see in Revelation. Hebrews 12:14  also speaks of this, \"Strive for  peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.\" Hebrews 12:23  tells us that the \"just men will be made perfect.\" The Gospels tell us to be perfect, as our Father is perfect.\n \n Many say that there is one mediator between God and man and that is Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5). However, if you look at the first line of chapter 2 of 1 Timothy-a few lines above the mediator quote, you read, \"First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men...This is good, and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour...\" Why does Paul ask that we pray and make supplication for others if Jesus' work is finished? Jesus' work is once and for all but also perpetual and on going since the time of the crucifixion. It is outside of the boundary of time and is eternal. But what good will our prayers do if Jesus' mediation excludes our intercession and action? Jesus is the primary mediator but others can intercede (Colossians 1:24, 1 Corinthians 3:9). This is the basis for Catholics praying for the intercession of Mary and the Saints. This is the basis for Catholics praying for the souls in purgatory. We pray for others to intercede and pray for us through Jesus. And it is readily evident that the prayers of the saints and of righteous men have power (Romans 15:30, Ephesians 6:18-19, James 5:16, Revelation 5:8, Revelation 8:3-4) Pay close attention to the quotes from Revelation 5 and 8 if you think praying to saints is lacking understanding of the mediator!\n \n Consider also that Paul prays for his dead friend Onesiphorus in 2 Timothy 1:16-18. Why does Paul pray for a dead man if he is already in heaven? No prayers can help him if he is in hell because it is eternal. The Old Testament scripture that foreshadows the New Testament Purgatory is evident. It has been deleted from your protestant Bibles by Martin Luther because it did not gel with his theories though. If you can view a Catholic bible there should be one on-line somewhere (possibly at www.newadvent.org) then look up 2 Maccabees 12: 44-46  to see that the sins of the dead can be atoned. Jesus himself alludes to this in Matthew 12:32  when he speaks of forgiveness in this age or the next. And he again alludes to this in Matthew 5:26 and 12:36.\n \n Do not get caught up in the fact that the word Purgatory is not in scripture. This is just a name given to the intermediate state by the Church. When you consider this, remember also that the word Trinity and Incarnation cannot be found in scripture. Yet many Christians have no trouble in believing in either of these doctrines.",
