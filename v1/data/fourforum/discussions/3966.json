He spoke the incarnation. God lived among people, spoke to us completely in His person and character. His final word was \"Jesus\" he needed no other one. I speak somewhat eupemistically here, but, it is the reason why God no longer communicates through his prophets. he gave us his son, He also gave us his bible, He also gave us His spirit. A prophet is no longer needed. \"The spirit bears witness for us...\" The truth is that now man has DIRECT access to God. Sin used to keep man at bay, becasue the time was not ripe for the full penalty to be paid. Man could not directly approach God as his sin was too great. God placed Moses in the cleft of the rock as His glory passed by to keep Moses from being consumed by it. The book of Hebrews says \"we can come BOLDLY before the throne of grace.\" (emphasis mine). God speaks to the individual through his indwelling spirit. But he speaks to me about me. He does not deal with me about you. He deals with you directly. It is one of the reasons Christians should be the last to say anything about anothers sin. I have my own share to deal with. I truly haven't time to deal with yours (\"remove the log from your own eye first, then you can see clearly to deal with your brothers\")",

Not only does incest cover a whole range of things, some of which has always been immoral, but it also covers immoral relationships. But is there anything morally wrong about a man marrying a woman, provided that it is one man for one woman in the context of marriage? The answer is no! It is just like a man and a woman getting married today. Brothers marrying sisters was allowed up to the time of Moses. God then said that it was wrong to do so, there may have been a number of reasons for it, mainly because of the lack of genetic variation and the higher chance of mutations in the off spring (as you said).\n \n However, in the beginning, God created everything perfect - there were no mutations. When man sinned, God's creation started to fall apart and we started to fall apart. Mutations then started to happen. So after the Fall [of man] there would be relatively few mutations and so the chance of having a deformed child is very low, essentially zero. Also, keep in mind that mankind had been suffering the effects of the curse (that God placed on all creation after man sinned) for about two thousand years at the time of Moses which would have had far more mutations than just after the curse. \n \n Adam and Eve had many, many children too. We are all \"one blood\". Interestingly enough, scientists working on the human genome project have also come to this conclusion that we are all one blood, i.e. one race - the human race (or Adam's race).
