   "@ Daewoo,\n \n You've stated that Bin Laden doesn't care what U.S. citizens think. That he approves of the way Bush is playing into his hands.\n \n I think I can make the case that Bin Laden cares deeply about the attitude of the American public. When a \"leader\" (I use that term loosely in his case) opposes a leader of a populace of people, one of his greatest assets is to create doubt, or even a slight alliance with himself, in the opposing population. Because the best way to remove an opposing leader is to have his OWN PEOPLE remove him. The mindset of the Iraqi people is important to Bush.\n \n Do you accept?

He speaks often of Bush, and he speaks of American elections. In another tape, (Dec. 04) he condemned the upcomming elections in Iraq. If he was worried about what the people's vote would say in Iraq, wouldn't he care much more about the people's vote in the U.S.? It was they who elected Bush. \n \n Despite the claims that the decline of the U.S. economy is his goal, it's probably safe to say that an even more important goal of his is to keep from getting captured or killed. His ally in Iraq (al Zarqawi) very nearly got caught this past February. He doesn't like the war on terror very much - he led a more enjoyable life before it started. And he knows that many Americans don't like it either, for different reasons. He doesn't care what the reasons are - if they vote against a Bush policy, or influence other Americans in ever so slight ways to weaken American resolve in the war on terror, it's a victory for him.\n \n Here's another quote from Bin Laden (speaking of Bush); \"and he moved the tyranny and supression of freedom to his own country, and they called it the Patriot Act, under the disguise of fighting terrorism.\" So Bin Laden is against the Patriot Act? So are many Americans, for other reasons. Even if their reasons are simply because they are afraid of losing their \"right\" to watch porn, they are useful to Bin Laden, and he knows it. \n \n What would he think of this statement from rock star Chrissie Hynde? - \"....let's get rid of all the economic [expletive] this country represents! Bring it on, I hope the Muslims win!\" Or Ted Kennedy ....the war in Iraq \"is a fraud\". Or Al Sharpton comparing Bush to a \"gang leader\". Or Dick Gephardt saying \"this president is a miserable failure\". All these, and many others like them, speak to CROWDS. It's very important to Bin Laden. I'm not saying these people would completely sell their country out to benefit terrorists, but they are willing to take a LOT of chances with it, to get their power back. Bin Laden knows it.\n \n Just tonight, on ABC World News Tonight, there was a report on how much more difficult it is to find military recruits in the U.S. One of the main reasons? - more and more young people's parents won't let them join up. They've been demoralized, possibly by watching too much ABC news. Bin Laden knows about that too.\n \n When it comes to conflicts, history shows us that some pretty strange partnerships can develop to defeat a common enemy. It failed, but the south sought foreign aid to help against the north in the civil war. The U.S. and Russia weren't exactly buddies, but worked together against Germany in WW2. Germany and Japan probably weren't too concerned about looking to the future about how their relationship would blossom in later years. Too much of the far left in today's U.S. isn't near as worried about Bin Laden as they are focusing on their hatred of Bush. Bin Laden notices. Chances are good that his next planned attack on the U.S. will be another surprise attack on the INSIDE, where the people are. What they think about today's political matters will largely determine how successful he will be. \n \n Terrorism IS demoralization, not only the acts of terror, but terrorists words and threats.

I would not be opposed to ignoring it this time, since marc likely did not realise this)\n \n On 11/01/o4, a speech from bin laden was aired by Al Jazeera (full transcript) In this speech, Bin laden laid out his strategy and goals in dealing with the United states. Specifically, he stated:\n \n \nAll that we have mentioned has made it easy for us to provoke and bait this administration. All that we have to do is to send two Mujahideen to the furthest point East to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al-Qaida, in order to make the generals race there to cause America to suffer human, economic, and political losses without their achieving for it anything of note other than some benefits for their private companies. \n \n This is in addition to our having experience in using guerrilla warfare and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers, as we, alongside the Mujahideen, bled Russia for ten years, until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat.\n \n All Praise is due to Allah.\n \n So we are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy. Allah willing, and nothing is too great for Allah. \n \n \n This indicates to me that Bin Laden largely views this as an economic war, and with good reason. Regardless of anybodies personal feelings regarding the man, he has not shown himself to be a fool. He has a history in finance. He is the son of a billionaire, is estimated to have at least $250 million himself, though we are not certain because he is proficient enough in the realm of finances to be able to effectively hide his personal money from even the closest scrutiny. He had a privileged childhood. He attended the best schools, and was considered by those around him to be exceptionally bright. The point is, he is no fool.\n \n He holds no delusions that his ragtag, cell based structure can beat America militarily, nor has he ever suggested that they could to my knowledge. He has instead focused his attention on hastening our economic demise by encouraging us to spend billions batting at a phantom enemy. \n \n Bin Laden and his associates have experience in fighting, and defeating, a superpower. They understand that their only real hope is to make the war so expensive that the enemy nation cannot afford to fight it, and to push the enemy nation to take ever more draconian measures, which assists the group in gaining support and membership.\n \n If the people of America were truly to become demoralized (To undermine the confidence or morale of; dishearten: www.dictionary.com) his stated goal of economic destruction of the United States could not come to pass. Was the United States to adopt a defeatist attitude, we would be less inclined to spend the billions of dollars per year in anti-terrorism related non value added transactions that we currently are. Lacking a strong morale in the United States, and a \"go get em\" attitude, there would be no Iraqi civilian casualties for him to use as a recruiting tool. He would not have Abu Ghraib to wave in front ff the worlds people as a testament to Americas cruelty, another recruiting tool.\n \n He wants us out there, being proactive, not sitting at home thinking \"we cannot win\" and being reactive. Proactive is expensive. \n \n Later in the above cited speech, he actually gloats about the success of his economic war with the United States:\n \n \nAnd it was to these sorts of notions and their like that the British diplomat and others were referring in their lectures at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. (When they pointed out that) for example, al-Qaida spent $500 000 on the event, while America, in the incident and its aftermath, lost - according to the lowest estimate - more than 500 billion dollars. \n \n Meaning that every dollar of al-Qaida defeated a million dollars by the permission of Allah, besides the loss of a huge number of jobs.\n \n As for the size of the economic deficit, it has reached record astronomical numbers estimated to total more than a trillion dollars. \n \n And even more dangerous and bitter for America is that the Mujahideen recently forced Bush to resort to emergency funds to continue the fight in Afghanistan and Iraq, which is evidence of the success of the bleed -until-bankruptcy plan - with Allah's permission. \n \n \n Clearly he views the first phase of his war a victory for Al Qaeda, and one made possible by an arrogant and agressive attitude fostered by the American people. \n \n \nDespite the claims that the decline of the U.S. economy is his goal, it's probably safe to say that an even more important goal of his is to keep from getting captured or killed. His ally in Iraq (al Zarqawi) very nearly got caught this past February. He doesn't like the war on terror very much - he led a more enjoyable life before it started. And he knows that many Americans don't like it either, for different reasons. He doesn't care what the reasons are - if they vote against a Bush policy, or influence other Americans in ever so slight ways to weaken American resolve in the war on terror, it's a victory for him.\n\n \n Another logical fallacy:\n \n \nHe doesn't like the war on terror very much - he led a more enjoyable life before it started.\n\n \n You are begging the question here. In order to believe that the premises are true we must already agree that the conclusion is true. In order to believe that Bin Laden does not like the war on terror very much, we must assume he led a more enjoyable life before it started. Additionally, we would have to assume knowledge of what BL finds enjoyable. \n \n We have no idea where Bin Laden is, or what kind of life he is leading, or what kind of life he finds enjoyable. He may be living in a hole somewhere. He could also be living in a palace, or in a penthouse apartment in New York city for all we know. There has not been a verfiable Bin Laden sighting for over 14 months. \n \n Additionally, since Bin Laden walked away from a life of privilege in Saudi Arabia in order to fight the Russians in Afghanistan, it seems unlikely that you, I or anybody here is able to draw a conclusion regarding what kind of life he prefers. \n \n \nHere's another quote from Bin Laden (speaking of Bush); \"and he moved the tyranny and supression of freedom to his own country, and they called it the Patriot Act, under the disguise of fighting terrorism.\" So Bin Laden is against the Patriot Act? So are many Americans, for other reasons. Even if their reasons are simply because they are afraid of losing their \"right\" to watch porn, they are useful to Bin Laden, and he knows it. \n \n \n Useful how? \n \n \n \nWhat would he think of this statement from rock star Chrissie Hynde? - \"....let's get rid of all the economic [expletive] this country represents! Bring it on, I hope the Muslims win!\" Or Ted Kennedy ....the war in Iraq \"is a fraud\". Or Al Sharpton comparing Bush to a \"gang leader\". Or Dick Gephardt saying \"this president is a miserable failure\". All these, and many others like them, speak to CROWDS. It's very important to Bin Laden. I'm not saying these people would completely sell their country out to benefit terrorists, but they are willing to take a LOT of chances with it, to get their power back. Bin Laden knows it.\n\n \n I am failing to see the relevance of this. \n \n \nJust tonight, on ABC World News Tonight, there was a report on how much more difficult it is to find military recruits in the U.S. One of the main reasons? - more and more young people's parents won't let them join up. They've been demoralized, possibly by watching too much ABC news. Bin Laden knows about that too.\n\n \n Demoralized? As a parent myslef, I would suggest that they are not necessarily demoralized, they just don't want their children killed. Enlistment has always dropped during times of active engagement. During peace times, the military tries very hard to push the push the positive aspects of enlistment (technical training, education, etc) while minimizing the negative aspects (possibility of death during war time). When we are actually at war, it becomes more difficult for them to cover up the nasty side of the job. \n \n Bin Laden, havign defeated a superpower before and having studied at good schools, is likely aware of this, as well as being aware of the fact that the US governemtn will raise enlistment incentives in order to gain more recruits, thus helping him along his goal of bankrupting the country. If we can not raise enough troops to continue on by raising incentives, we will draft men to fight. \n \n Again, you are begging the question, this time the entire issue of the debate. In order for your conclusion to be accepted as correct (since you imply that Bin laden likes this, though you do not specifically state it), we have to assume that bin laden wants a demoralized American poublic. \n \n \nWhen it comes to conflicts, history shows us that some pretty strange partnerships can develop to defeat a common enemy. It failed, but the south sought foreign aid to help against the north in the civil war. The U.S. and Russia weren't exactly buddies, but worked together against Germany in WW2. Germany and Japan probably weren't too concerned about looking to the future about how their relationship would blossom in later years.

Chances are good that his next planned attack on the U.S. will be another surprise attack on the INSIDE, where the people are. What they think about today's political matters will largely determine how successful he will be. \n \n \n I fail to see the relevance of this at all (red herring warning).\n \n While the issue of a demoralize dAmerican public is interesting on its owm, it is nto the issue of the debate. The issue of the debate is what bin ladens goals are regarding the morale of the American public. While I would certainly agree that in defeat he wants the American public to feel ashamed and demoralized, that is the ultimate vicotry, not the governing strategy of the campaign.",

If logical fallacies are in fact not allowed, please remember it will be the judges, not you, that determines when they occur.\n \n \nOn 11/01/o4, a speech from bin laden was aired by Al Jazeera (full transcript) In this speech, Bin laden laid out his strategy and goals in dealing with the United states. Specifically, he stated:\n \n \n \n This indicates to me that Bin Laden largely views this as an economic war, and with good reason. Regardless of anybodies personal feelings regarding the man, he has not shown himself to be a fool. He has a history in finance. He is the son of a billionaire, is estimated to have at least $250 million himself, though we are not certain because he is proficient enough in the realm of finances to be able to effectively hide his personal money from even the closest scrutiny. He had a privileged childhood. He attended the best schools, and was considered by those around him to be exceptionally bright. The point is, he is no fool. \n\n \n I agree that Bin Laden \"largely\", or more accurately -somewhat- views this as an economic war. But more than that, he wants the U.S. and it's allies OUT of the middle east. Everything he says and does, directly or indirectly, whether it's truth or lies, reeks of it.\n \n Money, especially being born with it, it not a very good indicator of intelligence. History books are full of examples of rich people doing stupid things, and poor people doing extrordinary things. \n \n \nHe holds no delusions that his ragtag, cell based structure can beat America militarily, nor has he ever suggested that they could to my knowledge. He has instead focused his attention on hastening our economic demise by encouraging us to spend billions batting at a phantom enemy. \n\n \n It wasn't a phantom enemy that struck us on 9/11, and at the time we weren't in Afganistan or Iraq. I'm sure there are many different numbers on how much the total cost of 9/11 was to our economy, one says it was $639 billion. What's it costing us per month in Iraq - $6 billion? That means it would take 8.8 years of fighting in Iraq to equal the cost of a few hours on 9/11. It doesn't even take a genius like Bin Laden to figure out that terror attacks inside the U.S. will bankrupt the country much quicker than our troops being in Iraq. \n \n \nBin Laden and his associates have experience in fighting, and defeating, a superpower. They understand that their only real hope is to make the war so expensive that the enemy nation cannot afford to fight it, and to push the enemy nation to take ever more draconian measures, which assists the group in gaining support and membership. \n\n \n It would take a lot of support & membership to make up for just a few of his top aides who have been captured recently. al Libbi was caught completely by surprise, and was unsuccessful in his attempt to destroy a notebook full of information that could be valuable to the U.S. Would you consider the recent Iraqi elections, and the ongoing infrastructure rebuilding to be \"draconian\"?\n \n \nIf the people of America were truly to become demoralized (To undermine the confidence or morale of; dishearten: www.dictionary.com) his stated goal of economic destruction of the United States could not come to pass. Was the United States to adopt a defeatist attitude, we would be less inclined to spend the billions of dollars per year in anti-terrorism related non value added transactions that we currently are. \n\n \n So if America were demoralized and defeated, our economy would pick up? If we pulled out of the middle east, abandoned Israel, abandoned our other Arab friends like Kuwait and Qatar, our economy would further pick up? Demoralized people spur economies? \n \n \n Lacking a strong morale in the United States, and a \"go get em\" attitude, there would be no Iraqi civilian casualties for him to use as a recruiting tool. He would not have Abu Ghraib to wave in front ff the worlds people as a testament to Americas cruelty, another recruiting tool. \n\n \n It's going to take a lot more than \"recruiting\" bodies for him to succeed at bankrupting America.\n \n \nHe wants us out there, being proactive, not sitting at home thinking \"we cannot win\" and being reactive. Proactive is expensive. \n\n \n Not as expensive as being \"reactive\" to events like 9/11.\n \n \nLater in the above cited speech, he actually gloats about the success of his economic war with the United States:\n \n \n \n Clearly he views the first phase of his war a victory for Al Qaeda, and one made possible by an arrogant and agressive attitude fostered by the American people. \n\n \n And you take everything he says as absolute truth, that there's no chance he could try to mislead anyone? \n \n \n \n \nAnother logical fallacy:\n\n \n I'm not going to play the fallacy game here. You can go on and on about strawmen, begging questions, red herrings, and all the other two and three word terms from someone else's long, confusing list all you want. I don't need someone else's laundry list of fallacies to make my points. I'll use my own words. \n \n \n \n \nYou are begging the question here. In order to believe that the premises are true we must already agree that the conclusion is true. In order to believe that Bin Laden does not like the war on terror very much, we must assume he led a more enjoyable life before it started. Additionally, we would have to assume knowledge of what BL finds enjoyable. \n\n \n Basic common sense allows us to draw conclusions about what he finds enjoyable.\n \n \nWe have no idea where Bin Laden is, or what kind of life he is leading, or what kind of life he finds enjoyable. He may be living in a hole somewhere. He could also be living in a palace, or in a penthouse apartment in New York city for all we know. There has not been a verfiable Bin Laden sighting for over 14 months. \n\n \n Because he's been HIDING. No rational human being would enjoy being on the run from someone who has bigger guns than he has, as opposed to the past when he was not on the run. We have no idea where he is? If it ain't on the news, it ain't happening?\n \n \n \n Additionally, since Bin Laden walked away from a life of privilege in Saudi Arabia in order to fight the Russians in Afghanistan, it seems unlikely that you, I or anybody here is able to draw a conclusion regarding what kind of life he prefers. \n\n \n Some people may like to fight more than they like to sit and do nothing. I can't imagine someone preferring to run like a scared rabbit as opposed to sitting and doing nothing. \n \n \n \n \nUseful how? \n\n \n Useful in that they can help get rid of the Patriot Act, and many other domestic decisions, that will make it easier to carry out what is truly devestating to the U.S. - terrorist acts. \n \n \n \n \n \nI am failing to see the relevance of this. \n\n \n See above. Domestic decisions that make it easier for him to carry out terrorist acts are made by people in America.\n \n \n \n \nDemoralized? As a parent myslef, I would suggest that they are not necessarily demoralized, they just don't want their children killed. Enlistment has always dropped during times of active engagement. During peace times, the military tries very hard to push the push the positive aspects of enlistment (technical training, education, etc) while minimizing the negative aspects (possibility of death during war time). When we are actually at war, it becomes more difficult for them to cover up the nasty side of the job. \n \n Bin Laden, havign defeated a superpower before and having studied at good schools, is likely aware of this, as well as being aware of the fact that the US governemtn will raise enlistment incentives in order to gain more recruits, thus helping him along his goal of bankrupting the country. If we can not raise enough troops to continue on by raising incentives, we will draft men to fight. \n \n Again, you are begging the question, this time the entire issue of the debate. In order for your conclusion to be accepted as correct (since you imply that Bin laden likes this, though you do not specifically state it), we have to assume that bin laden wants a demoralized American poublic. \n\n \n Assuming isn't a good word, analyzing and drawing conclusions may be better. \n \n \n \n \nI fail to see the relevance of this at all (red herring warning).\n\n \n The relevence is this; Bin Laden sees an ally in the gloom and doom left in this country. \n \n \nWhile the issue of a demoralize dAmerican public is interesting on its owm, it is nto the issue of the debate.\n\n \n \nThe issue of the debate is what bin ladens goals are regarding the morale of the American public. \n\n \n Is there a difference between these two sentences? Your word games are amazing.\n \n \n \n \n While I would certainly agree that in defeat he wants the American public to feel ashamed and demoralized, that is the ultimate vicotry, not the governing strategy of the campaign.\n\n \n In defeat he wants us completely out of the middle east, with as many of us dead as possible. Getting co-operation from U.S Bush haters is very much the governing strategy of his campaign - then turning around and killing them when he's finished with them.",

   "If you don't think he wants us demoralized, and I think he does, the argument is already a broad one. You and I can go down many different paths to make our points. My use of his words in that link didn't broaden the argument in the slightest. Not responding to it is your choice of course.\n\n \n You attempted to unreasonably broaden the argument. Specifically, you said:\n \n \nThe best way I know to show how much Bin Laden cares about what the American people think  is to examine exactly what he says to them, in the many tapes he has provided to aljazeera for them to translate into English, and post for all to see. \n \n http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exe...1B47627FECD.htm\n \n This is dated 10/18/03. There are several others more current, but I don't think the content is different enough to make it worth linking them all. I'll quote from different ones as I go along. \n \n This \"message to the American people\" doesn't seem like it comes from someone who doesn't care what they think. He speaks often of Bush, and he speaks of American elections. In another tape, (Dec. 04) he condemned the upcoming elections in Iraq. If he was worried about what the people's vote would say in Iraq, wouldn't he care much more about the people's vote in the U.S.? It was they who elected Bush. \n \n \n You attempted to move the debate beyond merely whether or not he wished us demoralized and into whether he cares what we think at all. It is a strawman argument, a logical fallacy.\n \n \n \n\"Logical fallacies\" are not allowed? I cannot find a reference to this in the 'rules for debate' thread above. What is your source for this? Also, I cannot find your name in the 'records/rankings' list above either. Is this also your first formal debate? Is it also \"not allowed\" to plead with the judges in the middle of a debate? If logical fallacies are in fact not allowed, please remember it will be the judges, not you, that determines when they occur.\n\n \n Sorry, \"not allowed\" was a poor choice of words. Logical fallacies can be valuable tools in a formal debate, if you can actually get your opponent to bite. They can force your opponent to waste valuable time and resources debating worthless garbage. A logical fallacy can sometimes fool human reasoning, but it is not logically valid. Since it is illogical, it is not going to get you any points anyway.\n \n Generally in debate tournaments, exposing a logical fallacy gains points for the person who does it, and looses point for the person who advanced the fallacy. If you cannot rationalize why the fallacy should be included, it should be ejected form the debate. \n \n I have never been in a formal debate here. The last time I was in a judged debate, I was a freshman in high school. I did judge debate for 2 years though since I was in forensics, and at our school, the forensics program provided the student judges for debate and vice versa. \n \n Here is a brief summary of how debates are generally judged, including a short (and very simplistic) judging form. It should help you get the idea. \n \n Generally when called on presenting a logical fallacy, standard practice is to atempt to defend the fallacy as pertinent to the argument at hand, or show that it is in fact NOT a logical fallacy.\n \n \nI agree that Bin Laden \"largely\", or more accurately -somewhat- views this as an economic war. But more than that, he wants the U.S. and it's allies OUT of the middle east. Everything he says and does, directly or indirectly, whether it's truth or lies, reeks of it.\n\n \n While I would agree that getting the US out of the Middle East is one of his prime considerations, most of his speeches also seem to carry an angry undertone, which suggests to me that there is another motive at work as well. He very much wants revenge. Take for example these excerpts (full text) from one of his speeches:\n \n \nI say to you, Allah knows that it had never occurred to us to strike the towers. But after it became unbearable and we witnessed the oppression and tyranny of the American/Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine and Lebanon, it came to my mind. \n \n The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth Fleet helped them in that. This bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorised and displaced. \n \n I couldn't forget those moving scenes, blood and severed limbs, women and children sprawled everywhere. Houses destroyed along with their occupants and high rises demolished over their residents, rockets raining down on our home without mercy. \n \n The situation was like a crocodile meeting a helpless child, powerless except for his screams. Does the crocodile understand a conversation that doesn't include a weapon? And the whole world saw and heard but it didn't respond. \n \n In those difficult moments many hard-to-describe ideas bubbled in my soul, but in the end they produced an intense feeling of rejection of tyranny, and gave birth to a strong resolve to punish the oppressors.\n \n \n \n \n He is not just talking about getting the US out of the ME here, he is talking about punishment and revenge. This is not merely about forcing the US to revise foreign policy. He is talking about punishing us for past transgressions as well. \n \n \nMoney, especially being born with it, it not a very good indicator of intelligence. History books are full of examples of rich people doing stupid things, and poor people doing extrordinary things. \n \n \n Lets revisit that:\n \n \nThis indicates to me that Bin Laden largely views this as an economic war, and with good reason. Regardless of anybodies personal feelings regarding the man, he has not shown himself to be a fool. He has a history in finance. He is the son of a billionaire, is estimated to have at least $250 million himself, though we are not certain because he is proficient enough in the realm of finances to be able to effectively hide his personal money from even the closest scrutiny. He had a privileged childhood. He attended the best schools, and was considered by those around him to be exceptionally bright.  The point is, he is no fool. \n\n \n Since this appears to be an attempt at a rebuttal, you may wish to actually refute or argue points that I made, not points that I did not. This is another strawman argument. I am not going to waste time trying to argue about whether wealthy people are smarter than poor people. \n \n \n \nIt wasn't a phantom enemy that struck us on 9/11, and at the time we weren't in Afganistan or Iraq. I'm sure there are many different numbers on how much the total cost of 9/11 was to our economy, one says it was $639 billion. What's it costing us per month in Iraq - $6 billion? That means it would take 8.8 years of fighting in Iraq to equal the cost of a few hours on 9/11. It doesn't even take a genius like Bin Laden to figure out that terror attacks inside the U.S. will bankrupt the country much quicker than our troops being in Iraq. \n\n \n It is not merely a question of our troops being in Iraq, though your $6 billion per month figure is woefully lacking. There seems to be a real problem with establishing a real $ number for Iraq, since the only portions of Iraqi spending open to inspection are supplemental spending requests to congress. Everything else has been classified by the Bush Administration. We obviously spent base funds beyond the supplemental spending requests.\n \n Bin Ladens estimated costs for 9/11 were under a half million dollars. Our global escapades and homeland security costs are estimated at over 1 trillion dollars. While the $639 billion that 9/11 cost us is certainly a lot of money, it also cost $$$, as well as taking planning and costing Bin Laden several men. \n \n Currently, all he has to do in order to be successful is keep dropping speeches and occasionally pulling off a small attack, and we will continue to expend precious resources and money in the name of fighting terrorism. You seem to want to separate 9/11 direct costs from 9/11 extended costs. Why? All these hundreds of billion in military and security expenditures are all 9/11 related expanses. \n \n \nIt would take a lot of support & membership to make up for just a few of his top aides who have been captured recently. al Libbi was caught completely by surprise, and was unsuccessful in his attempt to destroy a notebook full of information that could be valuable to the U.S. Would you consider the recent Iraqi elections, and the ongoing infrastructure rebuilding to be \"draconian\"?\n\n \n Red herring\n \n \n \n \nSo if America were demoralized and defeated, our economy would pick up? If we pulled out of the middle east, abandoned Israel, abandoned our other Arab friends like Kuwait and Qatar, our economy would further pick up? Demoralized people spur economies? \n\n \n Yes, it would. Not spending hundreds of billions per year on non value added expenditures would certainly spurt the economy. Not shipping billion per year to Israel without return would spur the economy. Whether we are demoralized and defeated or not makes no difference. Removing those expenditures would be a certain boom to the US economy, as well as slowing the growth of our trade gap, and our deficit, which would bolster the dollar on the forex.\n \n \n \nIt's going to take a lot more than \"recruiting\" bodies for him to succeed at bankrupting America.\n\n \n Certainly, and as he has stated, I am sure we will see another wave of attacks once our spending slows down.\n \n \n \n \nNot as expensive as being \"reactive\" to events like 9/11.\n\n \n But 9/11 type attacks are difficult to carry out. You can only hit so many skyscrapers with aircraft. Playing cat and mouse and forcing us to outspend him $50 million to $1 is much more effective.\n \n \n \nAnd you take everything he says as absolute truth, that there's no chance he could try to mislead anyone? \n\n \n Certainly, and if you would like to present evidence of that, I am more than happy to refute it.\n \n \n \n \nI'm not going to play the fallacy game here. You can go on and on about strawmen, begging questions, red herrings, and all the other two and three word terms from someone else's long, confusing list all you want. I don't need someone else's laundry list of fallacies to make my points. I'll use my own words. \n\n \n Then maybe you should not have challenged somebody to a formal debate. Logical fallacies are illogical and therefore extemporaneous to the debate. Every time I point out a logical fallacy, and you fail to defend it, you have conceded a point.\n \n \n \nBasic common sense allows us to draw conclusions about what he finds enjoyable.\n\n \n So what does basic common sense tell you about the fact that he walked away from a privlaged life in Saudi Arabia in order to fight the Russians in Afghanistan? That was a choice he made. This would imply that he enjoys the life he lives, since he specifically CHOSE it over a life of leisure. He has more than enough money to do whatever he wants, live however he wants, and this is what he CHOSE.\n \n This is in no way relevant to the debate, though. \n \n \n \nBecause he's been HIDING. No rational human being would enjoy being on the run from someone who has bigger guns than he has, as opposed to the past when he was not on the run. We have no idea where he is? If it ain't on the news, it ain't happening?\n\n \n Again, irrelevant to the debate.\n \n \n \n \n \nSome people may like to fight more than they like to sit and do nothing. I can't imagine someone preferring to run like a scared rabbit as opposed to sitting and doing nothing. \n\n \n Again, irrelevant to the debate, though it shows a lack of knowledge of history. The Afghanis fought the Russians as a guerilla force. They spent the entire campaign running and hiding, then carrying out attacks when they could, just like he is against the United States. He IS fighting. \n \n \n \n [quote]Useful in that they can help get rid of the Patriot Act, and many other domestic decisions, that will make it easier to carry out what is truly devestating to the U.S. - terrorist acts. [/quote\n \n irrelevant to the debate&#8230;red herring. Unless you wish to argue that these folks oppose the patriot act because they are demoralized.\n \n \n \nSee above. Domestic decisions that make it easier for him to carry out terrorist acts are made by people in America.\n\n \n Again, red herring. The scope of the debate is narrowly defined. Unless you wish to argued that these decisions are being made because the people in question are demoralized, this is yet another logical fallacy.\n \n \n \nAssuming isn't a good word, analyzing and drawing conclusions may be better.\n\n \n Regardless, your statement is a logical fallacy. Unless you have previously proven that BL wants us demoralized, this entire line of argument is invalid.\n \n \n \nThe relevence is this; Bin Laden sees an ally in the gloom and doom left in this country. \n\n \n Lets revisit your prior statement:\n \n \nWhen it comes to conflicts, history shows us that some pretty strange partnerships can develop to defeat a common enemy. It failed, but the south sought foreign aid to help against the north in the civil war. The U.S. and Russia weren't exactly buddies, but worked together against Germany in WW2. Germany and Japan probably weren't too concerned about looking to the future about how their relationship would blossom in later years.\n\n \n This entire section is a red herring argument. It is completely unrelated to the question of a demoralized US populous. \n \n \n \nToo much of the far left in today's U.S. isn't near as worried about Bin Laden as they are focusing on their hatred of Bush. Bin Laden notices. Chances are good that his next planned attack on the U.S. will be another surprise attack on the INSIDE, where the people are. What they think about today's political matters will largely determine how successful he will be.\n\n \n Unless you care to try to prove that hatred of Bush is the same as being demoralized by Bin Laden, and that this is what he wants, this is irrelevant to the argument at hand as well. \n \n \n \nIs there a difference between these two sentences? Your word games are amazing.\n\n \n Yes, there is a GREAT difference between those two sentences. One is about the morale of the American public in general, which has little or nothing to do with this debate. The other is about Bin Ladens goals regarding the morale of the American public, which is the sole pupose fo the debate.\n \n \nIn defeat he wants us completely out of the Middle East, with as many of us dead as possible. Getting co-operation from U.S Bush haters is very much the governing strategy of his campaign - then turning around and killing them when he's finished with them.\n\n \n Again, red herring. The topic of this debate is whther or not Bin Laden wants the american public demoralized or not. Whether he finds aid and comfort in those who support bush or do not support bush has nothign to do with it at all, unless you would like to advance the argument that people sole purpose for disliking Bush is that they are demoralized.",

It is a strawman argument, a logical fallacy. \n\n \n Merely? Where did you get that word from? You should re-read the first post of this thread. It was me who proposed this debate, and you who accepted. It was me who started the debate, in post #18. You should also re-read that one.\n \n \n \n \nIf you don't think he wants us demoralized, and I think he does, the argument is already a broad one. You and I can go down many different paths to make our points. \n\n \n That statement was made in good faith - it was not intended to give myself an advantage in any way. It was intended to make this an interesting, spirited, thoughtful debate, with somewhat less insulting and clowning that often go on in other forums. I thought you and I could handle it. I see now I was wrong about you.\n \n \n \n \nWhile I would agree that getting the US out of the Middle East is one of his prime considerations, most of his speeches also seem to carry an angry undertone, which suggests to me that there is another motive at work as well.

This is not merely about forcing the US to revise foreign policy. He is talking about punishing us for past transgressions as well. \n\n \n There's no question he wants revenge. For past events under the Reagan Administration, and current events under the Bush Administration. But why is he telling us about it, why doesn't he just quietly plan, and do it? Could it be because he's trying to demoralize us about decisions of leaders made by ONE political party? \n \n Here's another excerpt from that same speech;\n \n \n...............as well as my interviews with Robert Fisk. \n \n The latter is one of your compatriots and co-religionists and I consider him to be neutral. So are the pretenders of freedom at the White House and the channels controlled by them able to run an interview with him? So that he may relay to the American people what he has understood from us to be the reasons for our fight against you? \n\n \n I googled Robert Fisk (the Independents Middle East Correspondent), Bin Laden \"considers him neutral\". When I read his writings, I see someone who is in PERFECT LOCKSTEP with the U.S. anti war left. Do you suppose Bin Laden considers all of the U.S. anti war left to be \"neutral\", or maybe a better word would be, \"recruitable\"?\n \n \nIf you were to avoid these reasons, you will have taken the correct path that will lead America to the security that it was in before September 11th. This concerned the causes of the war. \n\n \n \"Avoiding these reasons\" means opposing the Bush Administration, and siding with the anti war left. Feeling guilty about decisions made by the Bush (and Reagan) Administrations. Being demoralized.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is not merely a question of our troops being in Iraq, though your $6 billion per month figure is woefully lacking. There seems to be a real problem with establishing a real $ number for Iraq, since the only portions of Iraqi spending open to inspection are supplemental spending requests to congress. Everything else has been classified by the Bush Administration. We obviously spent base funds beyond the supplemental spending requests.\n \n Bin Ladens estimated costs for 9/11 were under a half million dollars. Our global escapades and homeland security costs are estimated at over 1 trillion dollars. While the $639 billion that 9/11 cost us is certainly a lot of money, it also cost $$$, as well as taking planning and costing Bin Laden several men. \n \n Currently, all he has to do in order to be successful is keep dropping speeches and occasionally pulling off a small attack, and we will continue to expend precious resources and money in the name of fighting terrorism. You seem to want to separate 9/11 direct costs from 9/11 extended costs. Why? All these hundreds of billion in military and security expenditures are all 9/11 related expanses. \n\n \n Why, you ask? For starters I wouldn't classify them as \"direct\" and \"extended\" costs. I'd call them 9/11 domestic costs, and military costs, because that would probably be how Bin Laden would seperate them in his quest to bankrupt America. We have rough figures on 9/11 costs - costs to the U.S. and costs to Al Queda. $1/2 million for Al Queda, and $639 billion (or $500 billion - whatever) for the U.S. A good ratio, a smashing success for Al Queda. You are more familiar with Middle East news sources than I am - how long does it take for Al Queda to go through $1/2 million opposing the U.S. military? And how long will it take for the U.S. military to go through $639 billion? I'd be willing to bet that the ratio is much worse for Al Queda. If you can't prove otherwise, then it's a good bet Bin Laden would prefer we call off this war, and make it as easy as possible for him to carry out another terrorist attack. \n \n Here's another excerpt from his speech;\n \n \nBut because it seemed to him that occupying himself by talking to the little girl about the goat and its butting was more important than occupying himself with the planes and their butting of the skyscrapers, we were given three times the period required to execute the operations - all praise is due to Allah. \n\n \n Where do you think he got his information about Bush reading about the goat, except from the U.S. news media? He even threw in a little middle east humor. Probably because most references in the U.S. about this incident included some anti Bush humor. He gets his TALKING POINTS from the anti war, anti Bush American left. \n \n Another example, the very next paragraph;\n \n \nAnd it's no secret to you that the thinkers and perceptive ones from among the Americans warned Bush before the war and told him: \"All that you want for securing America and removing the weapons of mass destruction - assuming they exist - is available to you, and the nations of the world are with you in the inspections, and it is in the interest of America that it not be thrust into an unjustified war with an unknown outcome.\" \n\n \n He calls anti war Americans \"thinkers and perceptive ones\". If he can demoralize those who agree with Bush, and get them to support Bush's political enemies, he'll have still more people to get his talking points from.\n \n \n \n \n \nYes, it would. Not spending hundreds of billions per year on non value added expenditures would certainly spurt the economy. Not shipping billion per year to Israel without return would spur the economy. Whether we are demoralized and defeated or not makes no difference. Removing those expenditures would be a certain boom to the US economy, as well as slowing the growth of our trade gap, and our deficit, which would bolster the dollar on the forex. \n\n \n One small problem with your predictions - WE WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH OIL!! To pull out of the middle east like that would leave us hopelessly short on oil. The extreme left always downplays the significance of oil, but the simple fact is, America runs on the stuff. \n \n \n \n \n \nBut 9/11 type attacks are difficult to carry out. You can only hit so many skyscrapers with aircraft. Playing cat and mouse and forcing us to outspend him $50 million to $1 is much more effective. \n\n \n The next terrorist attacks could be more costly to the U.S. than 9/11, and could have absolutely nothing to do with buildings or aircraft. There's no way to pinpoint it. Are we currently outspending them $50 million to $1, or are you confusing 9/11 costs with current military costs?\n \n That's all I can find of any substance in your post. The rest is gibberish as a result of your lack of understanding of this debate. Have you read post #1, and post #18 yet?? emoticon_idea",

   "I would like to requst a 1 week delaty from the judges for my next reply. We recived over 5 inches of rain in 12 hours here on thursday nithg, and another 3.5 inchs on friday and friday night. Rivers were 7 ft above flood stage. huge areas flooded. I have an obligation to assist in recovery efforts. I have been running full steam, without sleep, since friday morning trying to get a handle on the situation. It will likely be a week before things are at a point where I am not putting 20 hours per deay into the effort. Peoples wells are all fouled, leavign them without clean water. Many folks had their houses washed though (luckily we did not loose any houses, but they got plenty wet).\n \n \n If this is acceptable, please let me know. Otherwise I will post what reply I can, but it is not likely to be very good.\n \n thanks",

   "I was surprised at how our off-the-cuff method of selecting judges fell into place so well in this case. Thanks to you three guys for agreeing to do it. Though you didn't really get a chance to do your stuff, I think your mere presence here weeded out a lot of BS.\n \n I'd like to encourage others to take the debate tournament plunge - the next best thing to playing and winning is playing and losing. I'm nothing but an average, run-of-the-mill truck driver. Ain't America great? :)",
