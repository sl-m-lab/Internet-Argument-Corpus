   "In the news recently there has been a lot about honour killings. Muslim belief about arranged marriage etc? Is this a right that should be allowed despite which country they live in? Shouldn't the female be allowed to marry who they want. How can a father/brother etc decide when to kill their own family? How much honour do people lose when their family loves another? This is not a subject I know much about but I feel (not living under a religion or faith or whatever it would be called) that this is wrong. Is it the muslim 'god' that made these rules? Is it in the bible? I know nothing about religion in the depth that this probably needs to be explained. Also Jehovah witnesses - how can they allow their children to die rather than have a blood transfusion? I do not understand this at all. I would like if at all possible to see the different views on this. It would be an education for me. Perhaps I would become more understanding. Christian beliefs that only male and female may get married - no sex before marriage? Catholic views on abortion even after rape? why is religion forced down to younger generations? I hope that this makes sense...",

I hope that this makes sense...\n\n \n That's a huge range of cultural and belief system variances. I can offer one example of 'honor' killings from US History, the duel. Well into the last century we Americans felt personal honor was worth risking death for under any circumstance. Many of our early statesmen engaged in duels, with some notable deaths. We 'progressed' from defending honor in a personal manner to the utilization of lawyers, often more destructive than grapeshot in a dueling pistol. Personal honor has been mostly displaced in our quest to become more of a homogenized society, with mental inbreeding and the inevitable apathy now poising more of a threat than physical death. \n \n In our effort to discredit other cultures made foreign and distasteful to us by political motivation, we often conveniently forget our own past and the fact that our world is composed of that huge range of cultural and belief system differences. Tolerance of others is not the strong suit of our nation, nor is it currently in favor as a basis for raising our children.",

I can't imagine Jesus standing there and commanding you to not get a blood transfusion and die. That isn't the Jesus in MY Bible.\n \n \n \n But I think arranged marriages are definently wrong. The Bible says honor and obey your parents, but there is a line there, and I think this crosses it.\n \n \n As to honor killings....I would think having to murder members of your own family because their so sinful would be more of a disgrace than anything else. :p But I'm a Christian not a muslim, so I can't say it from their point of view.",
