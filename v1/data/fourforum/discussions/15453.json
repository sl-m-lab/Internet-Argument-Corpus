   "Assault rifle left unattended on Seattle Police car - Local News - Seattle, WA - msnbc.com\n \n \nSEATTLE -- The Seattle Police Department says they are \"very embarrassed\" after an assault rifle was left unattended on the back of a patrol car Monday night.\n \n First published by The Stranger, Nick Gonzales snapped a picture of the menacing-looking rifle on the trunk of a Seattle Police car. It was around 9:00 p.m. and the car was parked outside the Roosevelt Hotel, near Pine and 7th Avenue, with no police officers in sight, said Gonzales.\n \n In addition, after an officer got back into the patrol car, it was driven away with the rifle still on the trunk.\n \n A woman also saw the rifle and followed the car to try to get the officer's attention.\n \n Gonzales said he flagged down two other SPD officers on bicycles to tell them what he saw. As he described, they were \"shocked as hell.\"\n \n Two more witnesses also alerted police to the situation.\n \n Police aren't saying how the incident unfolded, but sources told KING 5 News what likely happened: one officer, identified as Officer William Collins, was loading or unloading the car in the secured area of the West Precinct and placed the rifle on the trunk of a squad car next to it before walking away. Then, a second officer, identified as Lt. Deanna Nolette, got in that car and drove to the Roosevelt Hotel. She parked the car, still unaware of the rifle on top of the trunk. Witnesses saw her at a nearby Starbucks.\n \n In response, the director of the SPD Office of Professional Accountability said in a statement, \"It is unacceptable that a rifle was left unattended on a patrol car and people should expect more from their police department.\"\n \n The commander of the West Precinct has begun an investigation, said the SPD.\n \n Seattle Police said some sort of discipline or change in policy is likely to come from the incident.\n\n \n The police don't deserve to have access to guns if this is there regular behavior.",

Anybody who actually has to pay $1,200 out of their own pocket for a gun like that is going to be far more responsible than some public servant who was trusted with it free of charge.\n \n I haven't heard many cases of regular people just absently leaving a gun on the top of their car and just driving around like that. They're far more competent than the police can be expected to be.\n \n These guys are supposed to be held to higher standards than anybody else, supposed to be trusted with a level of respect and responsibility that we're supposed to believe is beyond anything a regular citizen could possibly reach. They're not allowed to make mistakes like this. This officer should be fired for gross negligence and endangering the public.\n \n Afterall what's the average hit percentage for police when it comes to shooting? Only a disappointing 38%. Which raises the question of where the other 62% of bullets they fired actually went and who they hit.",
