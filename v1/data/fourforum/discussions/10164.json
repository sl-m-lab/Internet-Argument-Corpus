   "An interesting show from NPR radio's Speaking of Faith. dealing with how Latino migrations to the US helped to bring back Pentecostalism to the South, erroding Catholicism's dominance.\n \n \n\n Mr. V\u00e1squez: In Los Angeles, and you already had Latinos there. Many Mexican-Americans involved in that revival, and they themselves begin to take the message back home to Latin America. They take it within two, three years to Mexico, to Puerto Rico, Brazil, and right away they start to create their churches. The Assemblies of God have been established in Latin America. They have a long trajectory. But as they do that, they begin to indigenize. They begin to take in some of the aspects of the local culture, not only the language, but also some of the cultural patterns. You know, if they need to speak to indigenous populations, they need to translate the Bible to Quechua. But they also need to deal with the cosmology of the Quechua in order to make sense of what the Quechua are experiencing. \n \n So the figure of the devil, as the Quechua understand it, becomes incorporated into the Pentecostal narrative in that region. And then, as these churches are indigenized and as they grow very fast in relation to Catholicism, then they begin to be exported back to the United States. They begin to come into the United States with immigration. And so now we have Pentecostal churches that have very clear Latin American flavor but are appealing to larger segments of the population, not only Latinos but also African-Americans and even your Americans. \n \n Ms. Tippett: Well, let me just, you know, I think it's also worth pointing out that the theology and the sensibility of Pentecostalism, it says so much about the individual's direct relationship with God. \n \n Mr. V\u00e1squez: Exactly. \n \n Ms. Tippett: And also, I think, Pentecostalism coming into another culture in contrast to, say, Catholicism. Roman Catholicism coming into another culture did not bring with it, and still today would not bring with it, its vast hierarchy and this long tradition that, in some sense, need to be imposed. So there's something organic about what you're describing. \n \n Mr. V\u00e1squez: Yes. I think, you know, some people have argued that Pentecostalism is not concerned particularly with theology, that Pentecostalism is more of an embodied kind of experience... \n \n Ms. Tippett: Yeah. \n \n Mr. V\u00e1squez: ...that has to do with the experience of the Holy Spirit and the transformative power that it has in the life of the individual. And so in that sense, Pentecostals, although they have a theology, they're not interested in dogma; they're not interested in the rational analysis of the effervescence that is behind their religion. That's why it's very adaptable... \n \n Ms. Tippett: Yeah. \n \n Mr. V\u00e1squez: ...because it can really focus on the pragmatic needs, on the practical needs, the everyday needs of a particular population, especially populations which are at the margins of society - poor people, indigenous people, people who have been devalued. All of a sudden, they feel themselves empowered by the Holy Spirit and they speak a language that justifies and legitimates their position in the world. \n \n Now Catholicism, it's true, it brings a hierarchical setup in a very complex theology. However, there are forms of popular Catholicism that are also very much embodied and very much all about the senses... \n \n Ms. Tippett: Yes. \n \n Mr. V\u00e1squez: ...particularly the cult of the saints or Marian devotions, the devotions to Mary. They're all about the senses, they're all about the incense, they're about the music, the colors, the processions, the feel of the personal relationship with your patron saint. And these traditions are traditions that are still thriving despite the fact that Pentecostalism and evangelical Christianity is growing very fast in the region.\n\n \n Some food for thought.\n But, more importantly, I think it's interesting that some Evangelical types bemoan migration (predominantly illegal types) but over look how such migrations also can help spread their own religions.",
