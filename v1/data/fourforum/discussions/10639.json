   "I read a very interesting situation in the latest issue of Time magazine. It stated:\n \n \"Its wartime, and you're hiding in a basement with your baby and a group of other people. Enemy soldiers are outside and will be drawn to any sound. If you're found, you will all be killed immediately. Your baby starts to cry loudly and cannot be stopped. Smothering him to death is the only way to silence him and save the lives of everyone else in the room. Could you do so? Assume the baby is not yours, the parents are unknown and there will be no penalty for killing him. Could you be the one who smothers the baby if no one else would?\"\n \n Then under that, there is a box that looks like this:\n \n Your baby: Someone else's baby:\n ------------------------------\n [] yes []yes\n []no [] no\n \n \n \n What would you do?\n \n Note: I'm not sure if this is the right forum for this, but this has to do with morality, which is a topic often discussed here.",

The game rule says that X or Y are your only options. For whatever reason (doesn't matter), it is impossible to silence the child without lethal means, and it is impossible for you to draw the pursuers away by any means within your power.\n \n The reason the rules of the game are drawn so tightly is to force you into making a moral choice which has inevitable consequences, in order to explore how people actually handle morality. You either kill the baby, or by doing nothing, you enable (as opposed to cause) the deaths of several other innocents. By definition, there is no other choice here. The question is: is it better for one to die so that many can live? And under what circumstances would you be prepared to take an innocent life in order to save others?\n \n True, in real life, the choices MIGHT not be as stark, but this is a thought experiment designed to reveal how we think morally, by stripping away all extraneous considerations. It's not an issue of what action is right or wrong in absolute terms, but what anyone feels is right or wrong in that context.\n \n I'd risk offing the child by muffling its cries to the point they could not be heard, and if that inevitably meant it couldn't breathe, well, too bad. The situation is presumably not the fault of any of those hiding, and if everyone is caught, the child dies along with everyone else, anyway. Still, lots of people will baulk at actually performing such an act, even though they might, under slightly different circumstances, choose to allow the child to die, so long as they weren't the agent of death.",

Grateful for their own lives being saved but, unwilling to share the reprecussions. Cognative disonance.\n \n I'm also reminded of cannabalism too.

Where participants are asked to pick those to survive (and continue the human race) from a list given. Choosing traits they find advantageous.\n \n I'm also reminded of conversations on this subject that have come up.\n As someone mentioned, the 'horrors of war' stories that surface (exagerated or not) show that humans are capable (or incapable) of doing nearly anything. \n \n Or even about how jewish prisoners helped with the gas chambers.\n \n Or even the Melgrim studies that pretty much say people will do what they're told to do by authority figures, including kill.\n \n \n In the end, what is the point of the test?\n No one really knows just exactly what they'll do in such circumstances.\n \n Me, I'd rather die than kill my own flesh and blood.
