   "Of couse this isn't the end of it. Their will be an immediate appeal and a march towards a constitutional admendment to ban gay marriage. \n \n But a victory nonetheless. \n \n http://www.ketv.com/news/14015416/detail.html?rss=oma&psp=news\n \n \nDES MOINES, Iowa -- A Polk County judge has struck down Iowa's law that bans gay marriage.\n \n Six gay and lesbian couples went to court for the right to legally marry in Iowa. The couples had tried to apply for marriage licenses, but were refused because of the state law.\n \n Lamda Legal filed a lawsuit in 2005 on behalf of the couples in Iowa saying they deserve equal protection under the law. \n \n \n The couples include David Twombley and Larry Hoch of Urbandale. The men are retired teachers who said in 2005 that they are in love and want to be married like other couples.\n \n Judge Robert B. Hanson ruled that couples cannot be denied licenses to marry or marriage certificates or \"in any other way be prevented from entering into civil marriage pursuant to Iowa Code Chapter 595 by reason of the fact that both persons comprising such as a couple are of the same sex.\"\n \n He ordered the Polk County recorder's office to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.\n \n The county is expected to appeal the ruling to the Iowa Supreme Court.\n \n \"Today's civil-rights ruling by Judge Robert Hanson is another step in what is expected to be a lengthy legal process. The prudent approach would be for the Legislature to await an expected appeal and subsequent ruling by the Iowa Supreme Court before taking any steps in reaction to this decision,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal in a statement.\n",

As to whether it is bound by its meaning contemporary to the time it was written, I don't think such vague and timeless words would have been used had that been the intent.\nI don't think they are vague terms but I'd agree they are broad. Even so, I don't know how that translates into \"therefore are defined by the court\". Like Lesz said they can and should be defined by that group of people and this is easily done by passing laws. For example assume two laws 1) you can eat cheese and 2) you can't cut down trees. If you have an amendment that now says \"all men and women have liberty\" then liberty is defined by the things you have liberty to do which in this case is eat cheese (keep in mind I am assuming those are the only two things one could possibly do). Luckily we have ways to change what liberty includes. You could remove the tree law thus making it so tree cutting is a liberty or you could remove one by passing a law saying you can't eat cheese. \n \n I admit that I am under the assumption that amendment comes from the 14th amendment of the US constitution which should work the same way I described above. In other words you can't be denied something without due process. The danger of saying a judge gets to define liberty (which makes no logical sense or legal sense) is that the judge can define it any way he or she chooses. In other words you make it so the judge is really a king who sits back and picks what laws he or she thinks are good and which ones are not and this is due to no real standard for the judge to define liberty.",

And for that matter why do you think that their idea of GOD (OT) should be yours if you are Christian (NT). As to sin- well how do you know its a sin other than by your definition of things that are sins? As to the state of Koelns ideas how do you knoe that they are from the pit of carnal moral reletavism. Indeed how do you know such a pit exists?\n \n And I have to add as an edit. I DO have access to the One True Book since I am pope of the Round Church and there is no reference within that August Work which says anything which would rule out gay sex in any way shape or form. Now you have to remember that the One True Book is exactly what it says on the cover it is the One True Book and it cannot be questioned by any mere mortal. It was inscribed directly by GOD on titanium sheets and is very very very durable. My papal office is hereditary and the first pope in my family recieved the book sometime around 1500 BC.

   "Originally Posted by Easyrider: \n If that were the case then two adulterers should be able to marry without first divorcing their current spouses. And where does it end? Then you have three people who think they should be safe and happy; then four wanting to marry; then a 55 year old man and a ten year old girl (\"We deserve to be happy!\"). Then three guys, two gold diggers and a milk cow.\n \n I don't think God approves of gay marriage. You can't find any gay sex relationship in the Bible where it says God approves of it. Gay sex is a sin. Gay marriage is nothing more than politically-correct, instutionalized sin.\n \n \n \n Spew some more of that venon and nastiness, Koeln..... LOL! \n \n At least the Word of God backs me up that gay sex is a sin, Koeln. Yours is from the politically-correct pit of carnal moral relativism.\n\n \n You choose to believe in the \"Sheepherders Guide to the Universe.\" I see it as a crock full of misconceptions and lies. But you can follow it if you think it makes you a better person and closer to enlightenment. From my little bit of contact with you here, I sincerely doubt that to be the case. You one twisted xxxx.\n \n I don't spread nastiness. All one has to do is read one of your hate-filled, self-righteous posts to determine what kind of demented soul you are. Keep up the good work though. You are convertin' us heathn's more 'n more every day!

   "Eventually, even the courts will realise that on gay rights, strict scrutiny is appropriate.\n\n This statement proves that you either do not know very much about how our Constitutional government has been set up, or that you simply do not value that structure as it has been set up. Neither of these is a redeeming virtue.\n \n A constitution does not magically change. Judges may not subject classifications to strict scrutiny analysis that the people did not ratify in the 14th Amendment. The people have never classified sexual orientation as a special classification deserving of strict scrutiny analysis. Therefore, in order for judges to act within their legitimate authority, they may not subject classifications based on orientation to strict scrutiny analysis.\n \n Of course we all know that marriage statutes do not draw a classification around sexual orientation. The government does not prevent someone from getting married merely because they are gay. A gay person can get married. The law applies equally to everyone similarly situated, and that is the reason that marriage laws do not violate equal protection guarantees.\n \n \nI think judges are much less independent of public opinion than you seem to think, and they are, finally, getting it right.\n\n What, exactly, are they getting right? What do you mean by \"right?\" And, should not judge be independent of public opinion?\n \n \nThey are, after all, products of their culture as much as any of us, and they tend to go with the flow on social issues such as this, though they are most often behind it rather than ahead, as they were in Loving v. Virginia.\n\n If you are suggesting that judges posses the same values and understandings of the culture at large, then that is quite laughable. Consider the Supreme Court, for example. Every member of the Court is a product of ivy league law schools. Such schools themselves, nor the professionals they produce, represent the common culture at large.\n \n And, it is likewise laughable to suggest that the common culture was ahead of the Supreme Court on issues of racial prejudice.\n \n \nAs society finds gay people increasingly acceptable and deserving of equal consideration under the law, including marriage law, judicial opinions will eventually follow.\n\n Judges' opinions ought to be rooted in only one thing: the law. If society's views have changed on a legal issue, then they can change the law. Until they do so, the judge is bound by the law no matter how badly he might sympathize with the rhetoric espoused by very talented lawyers.\n \n \nWhat the Constitution does is provide a framework for legal recognition of rights; it does not determine what they are, apart from specific examples such as the right to vote.\n\n You might be surprised to find that I disagree with you. The Constitution was not primarily about rights; it was primarily about structure. And I have yet to find anywhere in the Constitution that provides a \"right to vote,\" which is presumably why states may restrict the franchise in certain circumstances (age, for example).\n \n \nThe law exists to serve the people, Phyllis, not the other way around.\n\n True it is that the law exists to serve the people. It is also true the judges are servants of the law. They must do what the law says, or they usurp their delegated authority.",

Other courts interpreting similar constitutional provisions have denied that marriage restrictions should be subject to strict scrutiny analysis.\n \n In fact, even this judge himself knows he is out of line. He went on to evaluate the law under rational basis standard because he knows his \"fundamental right to marriage\" constitutional argument holds no water. I will go ahead and predict that the judge's insistence that the law deserves strict scrutiny analysis will not only be reversed by the Iowa Supreme Court, but it will also receive a hefty rebuke from the Iowa Supreme Court.\n \n And we all also know that Iowa will amend their Constitution, so this celebrated semi-legal victory will itself be the spark that ensures the status-quo in Iowa is strengthened even further.",

Anything else can be scrutinized, but not anything having to do with gays. emoticon_rolleyes That's his standard.\n \n Well you got me on this one... :(\n \n \nCorrect, because, like it or not, it doesn't fly for just any group of people to get together and demand a certain special protection by calling themselves a 'minority'. of course, gay rights proponents like that sort of language because it evokes images of the civil rights struggle. But they have to accept that they really are trying to change marriage, not just get included in marriage as it is (which is usually they way they like to phrase it). They're trying to marry a different and whole new way. Personally I think they'd get farther by just being honest about what it is and go through proper due process (the legislature) rather than attempts by judicial fiat, which tends to tick people off and just make it harder on them in the long run.\nit evokes rage and doesn't allow for a society to accept change while the law changes. In a sense it forces the society to change which can lead to more hatred and possibly things that are worse.",

You were attempting to twist my argument and demanding that I find a legal example of something I had not said.\n \n I argued that a homosexual could not legally marry the 'love of his/her life' (discrimination). You wanted me to find something that said it was legally required that those to be married were in love.\n \n Then there's the next argument that this would lead to fathers and daughters wanting to get married (why you didn't go straight for father and son, I don't know). Is it discrimination to stop blood relatives getting married or is it just a sensible precaution to stop recessive genes taking over? This cleary could not be an argument against homosexual marriage.\n \n And as for the argument that a man shouldn't marry more than one wife (or the other way round). Why not? It's happened in the past (in the bible too). Marriage has not always been one man/one woman, despite what some people might say. If a man can financially support more than one wife (or a woman more than one husband) and all parties are agreeable to the arrangement, why not?\n \n Smiley",

   "You seem to have no standard for when this applies and when it doesn't apply. Surely the majority doesn't always lose but by what standard? The courts are only supposed to apply the law and in the federal government they are supposed to be the weakest branch. Oddly enough the people are supposed to be the strongest but when you start having every law filtered through what some supreme ruler to find if he/she finds the law fair then you made the court the highest power and rendered the constitution useless.\n \n The minority only gets protection from legislation passed by a majority. To do so otherwise would make this government a monarchy.\n\n \n First of all its up to the courts and the legislators {in the state at issue} to establish those standards. As to which branch is \"weakest\" at the federal level thats not clear from the constitution at all. Indeed the three branches have quite differing powers and I don't think you can compare their \"strengths\" easily. A badly drafted law (and many are - trust me) will always generate conflicts which will come before the courts. Their job is to decide ambiguous cases to which its not precisely clear as to how the law applies or should apply. Legislators have a responsibility to avoid so far as they can ambibuous or constitutionally vague laws and to constrain the provisions of those laws within the bounds of their constitution be it state or federal. Legislation and adjudication of conflict are very different processes. \n \n Let me give you an example outside the context of abortion in which the law MAY be void for vagueness {some courts have held it to be, others have not}\n There is a law regarding what are called drug analogs. This law was passed in about 1986 and was intended to stop laboratories from skirting the law by making hundreds of new variants of fentanyl, making them much faster than they could be made illegal! The process of adding such drugs to the schedule I list at DEA was so slow that dozens of addictive and dangerous drugs were perfectly legal till the system caught up by which time another analog would be on the streets - also legal. Now lets look at what the legislators came up with. In its essense the law says the following.\n \n A substance is a drug analog and will be treated the same as the drug for which it is an analog. In other words if a person posses a substance which is an analog to fentanyl its as if he/she was in possesing of fentanyl itself. There are a limited set of exceptions.\n \n The criteria for determining if a substance is a drug analog are three and three alone. And this is vital to the courts so I will quote the statute directly.\n \n \n\"(32)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term `controlled substance analogue' means a substance ---\n \n \"(i) the chemical structure of which is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or II;\n \"(ii) which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulent, [sic] depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II; or\n \"(iii) with respect to a particular person, which such person represents or intends to have a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II.\n \n \n \n \"(B) Such term does not include ---\n \n \"(i) a controlled substance;\n \"(ii) any substance for which there is an approved new drug application;\n \"(iii) with respect to a particular person any substance, if an exemption is in effect for investigational use, for that person, under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) to the extent conduct with respect to such substance is pursuant to such exemption; or\n \"(iv) any substance to the extent not intended for human consumption before such an exemption takes effect with respect to that substance.\".\n \n \n\n \n Now look at the three definitional criteria. Lets ask if criteria 1 is adeqaute on it own or not? Can you tell from the list or not? As the law is punctuated the courts intrepretation is that criteria 1 and (2 or 3) is the logical structure. Its not entirely clear though and some prosecutors have argued that the criteria should be 1 or 2 or 3 ! Some have argued that 1 and 2 AND 3 must be met. There is case law which argues at length about that semicolon following criterion 2 prior to the OR before criterion 3. People have in fact been charged with possessing crack cocaine because they were selling a mixture of flour, and other substances totally not related to cocaine {Well at least the courts tossed that one OUT}\n \n So much for the layout of the law - most courts have finally chosen to read the law as meaning 1 and (2 or 3) as the definition. Now lets look at 1. If a substance does not meet criteria 1 then its not an analog. To repeat test 1:\n \n \n(i) the chemical structure of which is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or II;\n \n\n \n There are within the law absolutely NO standards as to how to evaluate the similarity of chemical structures, nor are there any standards regarding how similar the structures must be before meeting the substantially similar requirement! In some instances a mixture whose only stimulant was caffine {like you know a cup of coffee} was thought by the prosecutors to be similar enough to another stimulant on Schedule I to file charges of cocaine possession. And that prosecutor produced an expert to back his claim. Well MOST chemists would NOT see much similarity - but since no means of determining similarity are addressed in the law its pretty much a matter of unconstrained \"opinon\" and prosecutors know where to go for the opinion they want. In that case the defense experts were able to defuse the prosecutions \"expert\" testimony - than goodness , and the charge was reduced to selling counterfit illegal drugs - a much lesser charge.\n \n OK I will now go into my personal experience working with the defense on a case involving butane diol {a material made by the thousands of tons yearly and used broadly in all kinds of products}. It just so happens that ingestion of butane diol leads to the formation of the date rape drug GHB. Butane diol is not active itself but its metaoblite is. COnversion requires two oxidative steps in the liver and is similar to what one does with alcohol. As a result one of the alcohol groups on BD is oxidized to an acid. A net change of only an oxygen atom. Now John Ashcroft {the guy who Gonzales make look good?} rounded up something like 100 suspects who were alleged to be sellin butanediol on the internet and they were charged with selling a drug analogy {under the legal definition} of GHB. I have to disclose that I worked as a defense expert in the first trial in the sequence for that case and I may be biased. But at trial the prosecution expert {a chemist from NIH} testified that BD and GHB had substantially similar chemical structures and that BD was biologically active in the same way as GHB because its metabolized. When asked on cross how he had reached the conclusion of substantial structural similarity he said that there was no way to measure chemical similarity and that he relied on and I quote here his \"gut feeling\" . When asked if the same issue was posed to other chemists he said {under oath mind you} that if one asked 3 chemists the same question one would get 6 opinions on the matter. My own testimony was that the National Library of Medicine had a free and public resource which allowed structural similarity measurements between molecules {Its called Chem ID plus and you can access it for yourself} and that when one compared BD and GHB the similarity was less than 50%. I also concluded that a 50% similarity did not seem to me to meet the requirement of \"substantially similar\" based on the fact that the compounds for which the law was orginally written {fentanyl analogs} averaged well over 80% similarity when examined by the same means.\n \n So how did it come out? Well the prosecution carried the day and the defendants went to jail for nearly 20 years. Technically it was an incorrect finding by the judge (IMHO but I am biased since I try to work on something other than \"gut feelings\"). On the other hand all in all I think the court and judge served the cause of justice in the end - albeit by an end run using a very vague law.\n \n Technically the defendants were not (IMHO) guilty of violating the analog law which does not touch at all on metabolic transformation and does REQUIRE \"substantial similarity\" although thats not defined. Logically though the defendants had been selling a substance intended to be used as a recreational drug and one which can be and sometimes is deadly.\n \n The issue is who did the right thing? The legislators who drafted a vague and unspecfic law (as is their habit) or the courts which sentenced a defendant under that law when technically it did not apply (IMHO of course)? \n \n Flip a coin and take your choice! The defendants lost on appeal. The same argument in other courtrooms resulted in a large sentence reduction. So far its been about 2 getting reduced charges for every conviction after I made my technical analysis public and free to whoever wished to use it. One court also held the law void for vagueness. My own track record is 50:50 so who is right? Beats me I am just a chemist.",

It makes no sense.\n \n \nThey ARE applying the law: equal protections.\nAs far as I understand the original meaning of \"equal protection\" would not apply to this case. The only way to get there would be to change the meaning of that phrase. Is this what you support? Can you explain why the original understanding of equal protection should not apply to this case?\n \n \nUnfortunately, you seem to object to a court that actually did offer \"protection from legislation passed by a majority\".\nI see it as a few judges manipulating what the majority passed to deny them other laws they have passed.\n \n \nI guess if it offers protections you approve of, the court is right; if it offers protections you disapprove of, it's wrong. Steve, you are offering double standards here, one for gays and another for straights. you have failed to argue why a double standard is appropriate.\nhaha, classic strawman. Thanks :)",

   "Are you seriously arguing that no-one should be able to appeal to the courts when they feel their constitutional rights have been violated, that all such disputes should be settled solely by legislatures that passed the tyrannical legislation in the first place? If so, what is the point of having a Constitution at all? Legislatures would have the latitude to interpret it any way they pleased. Tyrannies of the majority are applied by legislatures, and we do deserve some protection from them. Courts are a perfectly legitimate protection, because one doesn't want to elevate legislatures to the status of monarch, either.\n\n Gay marriage is not a right in the Constitution. As such, the only way to legitimately make it one is to amend the Constitution to include it as a right. Fortunately, a constitutional amendment is not necessary. All you need do is have the statute changed, which is something much easier than obtaining a constitutional amendment.\n \n It is popular in these forums to refer to the tyranny of the majority. Well, the majority can certainly tyrannize a minority, but it only does so when it illegitimately imposes its will on a minority. That is not going on here. The majority on this issue has operated appropriately under its Constitutional obligations. It is not enough for a group to simply claim, \"We're a minority; therefore, we are being tyrannized.\" If that were all that was necessary, then any minority classification could say it is being tyrannized. Serial murderers are certainly a minority. Does it follow from that fact that laws aimed at their behavior is tyranny? No, it does not.\n \n As it relates to the issue of gay marriage, there is no tyranny going on. Just because a majority opposes you does not mean they are tyrannizing you. If the fact that a minority loses legislatively means that said minority is being tyrannized, then you actually reduce the meaning and force of the word tyranny. You reduce its meaning into something of no significance.\n \n \nIt is true that gay marriage has not been regarded as a fundamental right throughout all of history. That does not prevent us from regarding it as such now. We are not hamstrung by precedent. You seem obsessed by legalisms and precedent, while I am concerned with simple justice.\n\n It is true that I am hampered by what the Constitution says no matter what I think is right, moral, and just. The Constitution is not immune from change. But judges may not legitimately change it.\n \n \nOh? And who is to do so? The legislature that passed the discriminatory legislation? Fat chance. Sorry, but this is a legitimate function of the judiciary, according to the way the American Constitution has evolved.\n\n No it is not. This is obvious by the fact that every court decision (save the recent Iowa district ruling) has found that sexual orientation is not a classification that is to be subjected to strict scrutiny. This view comes from courts spanning the ideological spectrum. From the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to the United States Supreme Court, we find that the 14th Amendment does not mean that classifications dealing with sexual orientation are to be subjected to strict scrutiny. Judges have certainly evolved the meaning of the Constitution. I would argue that in many cases they have done so illegitimately. But that is not the point. The point is that even as they have evolved it they have refused to subject these relevant classifications to strict scrutiny. Your understanding of American Constitutional Law is simply not correct.\n \n \nYou are free to support constitutional amendments stripping the courts of rights to adjudicate constitutional matters, but then, you might as well just lobby to abolish the Constitution, because that would be relegating it to a role as someone's toilet paper.\n\n I have nowhere even implied such a ridiculous notion, and you know it. This is disingenuous.\n \n \nPhyllis, I've read a fair number of decisions along these lines. One more or less is hardly going to change my views on a pretty obvious matter of simple justice. Get off your high horse and try to see the wood despite the trees.\n\n What I have said is that no one has ever read a decision along the lines of the Iowa District Court ruling for the simple reason that it is the first court to ever hold the marriage statutes to strict and intermediate judicial scrutiny. Not to mention the fact that every state has their own constitution, which essentially means that each state's decision must be evaluated on its own merits. I'm not on a high horse. I think it is a reasonable thing to expect people who either praise or denounce a specific judicial decision to have at least looked at that decision. Instead what we tend to get here is a bunch of people praising or denouncing a particular decision simply because they like or detest the policy that results from it. Much as that may be appropriate grounds for praising or denouncing legislation, it is not appropriate grounds for praising or denouncing a judicial opinion.",

   "Oh, and Phyllis, I should point out that a fair number of states apparently came to the conclusion that their constitutions as written could not be interpreted as legitimising the exclusion of gay married couples from equal protections under the law, hence they passed constitutional amendments to build prejudice against gays into their constitutions. There have been regular attempts to do the same to the federal Constitution.\n\n You have the wrong cause. It is clear that these state constitutional amendments are being passed to reverse (or guard against) judicial decisions. The people supporting these amendments are saying that their constitution does not establish gay marriage as a right. They are saying, \"The judges got it wrong.\" The people are the ultimate and final interpreters of their constitution. It truly is a disheartening thing that these constitutional amendments need to be passed in order to explicitly and clearly state what was already there.\n \n \nSeems a lot of people don't agree with your opinions about state and federal constitutions, and they aren't all on my side of the fence. The folk advocating these pernicious amendments seem to think that their constitutions do, in fact, protect equal rights for gays, which is why they are desperate to change them.\n\n No. These people seem to think (quite reasonably) that judges might sit in their chambers and dictate to them what they ought to have said in their constitutions/statutes rather than declaring what they actually did say. It takes particularly creative and sophisticated arguments to twist a constitutional phrase here and there in order to show that every constittuion ever written protects gay marriage. Similar creativity and sophistry could produce a constitutional right to prostitution, for example. But that does not mean that such rights really are in the constitution.",

   "I'm not sure I can go that far. I think part of the reason gay rights proponents are taking the judicial fiat strategy so much is that they know the constitution IS vague enough to find loopholes. For instance, many times I've heard the argument that because the 14th amendment (and yes, I realise this too is an amendment, albeit one that's been there a long time) states everyone has equal access to due process, as well as \"life\" and \"liberty\" that gay marriage should be included in that. To me, that's an enormous stretch. With such reasoning ANYTHING could be justified under it. It makes the 14th amendment an amendment-to-end-all-amendments; a sort of constitution in itself! But it's just vague enough that some judges might go along with it. It's the \"it-doesn't-say-I-can't\" reason for arguing that one CAN. But of course, that's bad reasoning; there are infinite possibilities of things the constitution \"doesn't say I can't\" that we would never allow.\n\n You are one of the more sensible folks regarding this issue. Because of that I can have the hope of possibly persuading you to agree with me emoticon_smile. The particular issue you raise here regarding the 14th Amendment is the issue of substantive due process, a rather novel concept that only a select group of creative lawyers could possibly have contrived (since it is a contradiction in terms). Perhaps we will broach this subject in more depth sometime.\n \n \nThe constitution is vague when it comes to such issues as marriage. The framers could never have imagined the idea of gay marriages--it's so far out in left field that it would have been so way beyond their moral sensibilities to even consider such a thing. They never imagined they would even need to write in protections on the standards of marriage. For that matter, I'm not even sure if there was any law at the time that gave federal-level benefits for marriage.\n\n My argument, of course, is that the constitution is not vague when properly understood. Does that mean there won't be cases that are tough? No, there will be tough cases. But the goal in every case is the same: what does the law say. Many judges have shifted this role to asking, \"what ought the law to say.\" Judging from your previous posts, you accept the former and reject that latter. And that would be correct.\n \n \nWhether gay marriage is given or not, amendments to the U.S. constitution are the proper way to go. (as well as state-level ones in such cases.) If anything, it follows precedent. There are several amendments guaranteeing rights that were not given before, and I can't see any reason why gay marriage should be any exception to this precedent.\n\n It's called \"following the constitution.\" That is what I support. So, apparently, do you.",

   "The biggest observation I can see with J-s and P-s arguments is that it's a form of constitutional fundamentalism influenced by their fundamentalist religious beliefs. Might as well call it for what it is.... These people don't want us to have equal rights. They are just looking for interpretations of the constitution to justify their hate and bigotry towards us. They forget that eveb though they can take a literalist view of their \"Sheepherder's Guide to the Universe\", they can't take a literalist view of the constitution because it is always evolving. They're not use to evolution... remember? It's not in their chosen christer code. But they waste so much energy and are so hysterically obvious. sigh.... can't wait for that day when the laws change and they finally are silenced with a big pie on their face.\n\n Could you define \"constitutional fundamentalism\" so that I know what you have said? You people like to throw the bigotry charge around. I've given my thoughts on that garbage before. I'm starting to see the strategy. When you can't meet someone's arguments, go ahead and call them a bigot. But consider this example before you do that.\n \n Suppose you and I enter into a contract whereby you will purchase my car for the low cost of $1,000. Let's say that my car is a brand new Bugatti Veyron (which apparently retails at $1,700,000. Now, suppose that I decide I would like more than the $1,000 we agreed to. So, I trek down to my local court and ask the judge to change the meaning of the contract. Observe my crafty argument to the judge.\n \n Judge, I had a contract with JSDKoeln in which he would buy my car for $1,000. My car is worth substantially more than that. Would you change the meaning of the concept \"$1,000\" in my contract to mean \"$2 million?\"\n \n \"Phyllis,\" says the judge, \"I\\'ve listened to your argument and I am persuaded that it would violate every principle of justice and due process for you to only receive $1,000 for you lovely car. Therefore, I order the concept \"$1,000\" to be interpreted to mean \"$1 million.\" JSDKoeln is ordered to pay within 180 days of this decision.\"\n \n Now, when you got wind of this what is likely to be your reaction? You will likely be outraged. You will be outraged because you did not agree to pay $2 million dollars; you agreed to pay $1,000. You will be outraged that the judge did not interpret your contract according to the original meaning of the terms when the contract was established. And no one will go around calling you a thief because you insist on only paying $1,000. No one will say that you are only interested in ripping me off--that you are only interested in teaching me a lesson. No one will go around calling you a bigot. No one will say to you, \"Yeah, we sympathize with your argument. You never agreed to pay $2 million dollars when you signed the contract. But words change, you know. Society\\'s view of justice evolves. The judge was only giving effect to the most recent evolution of the people\\'s view of the law, which he surmised through his keen, mystical intuitive sense. So, you\\'re going to have to pay up.\"\n \n Constitutions are contracts. The question is whether the contract includes the right to gay marriage. In order to answer that question, the words of the constitution must be evaluated according to the meaning they carried when the provisions were adopted. That is not an argument rooted in bigotry. It is common sense. You, in fact, expect the readers of this forum to interpret your words according to the original meaning you had for them. And no one will call you a bigot for that.\n \n One final thing. No one who agrees with me would ever wish for you to be silenced with a big pie on your face. That\\'s childish.\n \n Because of the aforementioned, it is easy to see why you have such a long way to go before American culture will accept your position. All you do is support your position with name calling. You offer no argument. And I think it is because you have no argument.",

The literalists would argue that the government has therefore the right to censor anything else it pleases that the writers wouldn't have conceived of or didn't refer to specifically, such as art, photographs, moving pictures and the Internet and other electronic media. Yet the courts do not entertain such a stupidly narrow-minded definition of the First Amendment, and consider it protects all forms of communication fairly broadly.\n \n Now, it is argued by those evidently opposed to actual equal rights for gays under the Constitution, that the writers did not envisage or mention gay marriage, and that therefore there is no right to gay marriage. This, they seem to feel, is a clinching argument from which there is no appeal.\n \n However, just because the founders didn't anticipate that homosexuals existed objectively, or that they could be considered as a group that has been historically discriminated against, that doesn't mean we are forever bound to think of gay Americans the way the writers did -- if indeed, they thought of them at all.

   "Hell no! It's a clear example of inequality between individuals, because one is of age and another is not. Can you tell the difference between adults and children, or do you need a constitutional definition before you can?\n\n I see no real difference in someone who is 17 and 18. I likewise see no real difference in someone who is 21 and someone who is 18. So perhaps the drinking age will prevent you from using the tired argument, \"can't you tell the difference between adults and children?\"\n \n But I must tell you that I am surprised that you would deny equal protections to someone simply because of their age. How could you support so gross a miscarriage of justice?\n \n \nBut what is obvious to all but deniers of equal rights is that gays and straight are not being treated the same or equally in the US.

You shock me!\n\n Here we go again! Are you prepared to tell me that you would be happy to deny equal protections to a father and daughter who wish to marry? How could you support such a gross miscarriage of justice?\n \n Since we are on the subject of recognizing differences, however, while I may not be able to tell the difference between a 17 and 18 year old without them telling me, I certainly can tell the difference between opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples. The difference is more obvious in the latter case than it is in the former.\n \n \nNow that is disingenuous blather. The only reason those amendments are being passed is to circumvent equal protections. It's nothing to do with judges, it's bigotry against gays. But then, no-one who opposed gay rights would care to admit that, and characteristically, you can't.\n\n Here it is again. Resorting to the (apparently default) bigotry argument. The strategy is when you can't meet the arguments, then label your opponent a bigot. I know the historical meaning attached to the Constitution did not establish gay marriage as a constitutional right. So when a judge decides to go ahead and circumvent that fact by making a constitution require the recognition of gay marriage, surely the people will respond to that. It's far less likely that the reason they would do so was out of mere bigotry than it is out of their belief that judges should not be the ones to change such a fundamental institution.\n \n \nHow disingenuous can you get? Who, do you think, Phyllis, am i likely to want to marry? A woman or a guy? And why, unlike you, am I to be denied my choice of marriage partner, because the state recognises homophobic bigotry?\n\n I don't know who you're likely to marry, nor do I care. I am addressing the faulty equal protection argument. It is a clear fact that the law is being applied equally to everyone, and that happens to be what equal protection means. There's a lot of things that you and I are denied the choice to do simply because the law restricts that choice. For example, everyone is denied the choice to marry two persons at the same time.\n \n \nOf course the state denies my right to marry. If it hadn't, i would have married, Phyllis. But it's equality you guys object to.\n\n No, the state has not denied your right to marry. It has stopped you from marrying someone of the same-sex, which is not encompassed in the right to marry. That is something it does for both male and female, heterosexual and homosexual. You will not be asked anything about your sexual orientation when applying for a marriage license. You will not be denied marriage if you make explicitly known that you are gay. Neither will you necessarily be denied marriage if you make explicitly known that both you and the person you are marrying are gay. You will, however, be denied marriage if you make it known that the person you desire to marry is of the same gender.",

How could you support so gross a miscarriage of justice?\n\n \n You really are being very disingenuous here, Phyllis. Children are simply not emotionally capable of making the same decisions an adult is. It's a question of maturity, you see. Or maybe you don't.\n \n \n \nNo, they are not held to two separate and unequal standards.\n\n \n Sorry, but gays and straights in the US are being held to two separate and unequal standards, as the laws prohibiting marriage between gays show.\n \n \n \nHere we go again! Are you prepared to tell me that you would be happy to deny equal protections to a father and daughter who wish to marry? How could you support such a gross miscarriage of justice?\n\n \n A specious argument. Why would a father and daughter want to establish legal ties by marriage? They already have legal ties by kinship.\n \n \nSince we are on the subject of recognizing differences, however, while I may not be able to tell the difference between a 17 and 18 year old without them telling me, I certainly can tell the difference between opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples. The difference is more obvious in the latter case than it is in the former.\n\n \n I see you are a penis and vagina counter... for you, if there isn't exactly one penis and one vagina in a marriage, it isn't a marriage. u fortunately, we do not all subscribe to this straitjacket of thinking. There isn't much difference between gay and straight married couples, except your obsession with genitals.\n \n \n \nHere it is again. Resorting to the (apparently default) bigotry argument. The strategy is when you can't meet the arguments, then label your opponent a bigot.\n\n \n Actually, they label themselves by being wholly unable to furnish any rational reason for prejudice against gay couples. \n \n \nI know the historical meaning attached to the Constitution did not establish gay marriage as a constitutional right.\n\n \n Unerringly, you deliberately miss the point yet again. Marriage isn't mentioned in the Constitution, but that doesn't mean, as the 9th Amendment makes clear, that it isn't a basic human right. It has been recognised as one by legislatures, courts and even the UN charter for human rights. The right under discussion, as you so predictably ignore, is equal treatment under law. \n \n \nSo when a judge decides to go ahead and circumvent that fact by making a constitution require the recognition of gay marriage, surely the people will respond to that. It's far less likely that the reason they would do so was out of mere bigotry than it is out of their belief that judges should not be the ones to change such a fundamental institution.\n\n \n Sorry, but if the state sees fit to bestow rights and benefits on straight married couples, it is required by its own constitution to bestow them of gay married couples, since there is no essential difference -- barring your obsession with the \"correct\" genitalia. However, i have to point out to you that the \"incorrect\" genitalia among gays is no obstacle to their forming the same sort of relationships straight couples do.\n \n \n \nI don't know who you're likely to marry, nor do I care.\n\n \n Be assured, you would never be on my wedding invitation list. The issue, however, is not your personal prejudices, but the right of the government to deny gay people equal protections.\n \n \nI am addressing the faulty equal protection argument.\n\n \n Unfortunately, you have failed to point out any flaw. It's a good argument, which is why you folk are desperate to dismiss it.\n \n \nIt is a clear fact that the law is being applied equally to everyone, and that happens to be what equal protection means. There's a lot of things that you and I are denied the choice to do simply because the law restricts that choice. For example, everyone is denied the choice to marry two persons at the same time.\n\n \n It's a clear fact that the law is not being applied to gay people the way it is applied to straights. but of course that's the way you like it.\n \n \n \nNo, the state has not denied your right to marry. It has stopped you from marrying someone of the same-sex, which is not encompassed in the right to marry. That is something it does for both male and female, heterosexual and homosexual. You will not be asked anything about your sexual orientation when applying for a marriage license. You will not be denied marriage if you make explicitly known that you are gay. Neither will you necessarily be denied marriage if you make explicitly known that both you and the person you are marrying are gay. You will, however, be denied marriage if you make it known that the person you desire to marry is of the same gender.\n\n \n Yes, the state has denied my right to marry, because it is unreasonable to expect me as a gay person to want to marry someone of the opposite sex. that is an unreasonable burden on my right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n \n I suggest, Phyllis, that you folk would be better occupied and more honest trying to pass a constitutional amendment that specifically excludes gays from equal protections. that is, after all, your intent.",

   "Sorry you can't tell the difference between children and adults, and the fact that they are functionally unequal. As for the law distinguishing between 17- and 18-year olds, that's the inevitable result of the law being forced to draw absolute lines in biological continua. The result is never perfect, but since lines have to be drawn, they are. The line is an imperfect approximation of the difference between a child and an adult.\n\n There is no difference between a 17-year-old and an 18-year-old save for the fact that one is slightly (in some cases, only hours) older than the other. If \"equal protection of the laws\" means that everyone must receive the same substantive rights, then certainly this distinction in the law, no matter the reasoning supposedly justifying such distinction, would be unconstitutional.\n \n Similar is the distinction between 20-year-olds and 21-year-olds, both of whom are adults, but only the latter can legally consume alcohol. If equal protection of the laws means that everyone must receive the same substantive rights, then this certainly could not fly.\n \n Similar is the distinction between two non-related parties wishing to marry and two related parties wishing to do the same. In order to ensure you cannot resort to a cop-out that results in dodging the issue, let's modify the example to a brother and sister who desire to marry. This will be prohibited under current marriage statutes. If \"equal protection of the laws\" means that everyone must receive the same substantive rights, then prohibiting a brother and sister from marrying could not fly.\n \n The reason all of these things do fly is because \"equal protection of the laws\" does not mean that everyone must receive the same substantive rights.\n \n \nYou really are being very disingenuous here, Phyllis. Children are simply not emotionally capable of making the same decisions an adult is. It's a question of maturity, you see. Or maybe you don't.\n\n This does not explain whether you think prohibiting a 20-year-old (who is an adult, if you were not aware) from consuming alcohol when allowing a 21-year-old to do the same is a violation of equal protection.\n \n The fact is that you do support drawing distinctions in the law, and you also support treating some people differently than others. You just happen to not support the distinction drawn between opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples. But your disapproval of that distinction hardly rises to the level of a denial of a Constitutional right.\n \n \nSorry, but gays and straights in the US are being held to two separate and unequal standards, as the laws prohibiting marriage between gays show.\n\n As we have been over before, gays are not prohibited from marrying. Nor does the law prohibit marriage between gays as I have convincingly shown. Observe this closely: a gay man and a gay woman may enter into civil marriage. Now a gay man may not wish to marry a gay woman (or vice versa) but the government does not inherently prohibit marriage between gay persons. And as it relates to the standard established for marriage, everyone is being held to the same standard. The law applies equally to all people regardless of their sexual orientation.\n \n \nA specious argument. Why would a father and daughter want to establish legal ties by marriage? They already have legal ties by kinship.\n\n Nice dodge. What would you say about the state's denial of marriage to a brother and sister who wish to marry?\n \n \nActually, they label themselves by being wholly unable to furnish any rational reason for prejudice against gay couples.\n\n Just because you don't agree with their argument does not mean that it is therefore not rational. I suppose most people to be rational. And it currently appears that most people subscribe to the traditional understanding of marriage.\n \n \nUnerringly, you deliberately miss the point yet again. Marriage isn't mentioned in the Constitution, but that doesn't mean, as the 9th Amendment makes clear, that it isn't a basic human right. It has been recognised as one by legislatures, courts and even the UN charter for human rights. The right under discussion, as you so predictably ignore, is equal treatment under law.\n\n I realize that marriage is not mentioned in the constitution. And ironically, the meaning of the 9th Amendment simply confirms that the states have the right to define marriage however they wish. And the UN charter has no standing in United States Constitutional law. And there is no right to equal treatment under law. There is, however, a guarantee of equal protection under law. These concepts are far from being the same.\n \n \nSorry, but if the state sees fit to bestow rights and benefits on straight married couples, it is required by its own constitution to bestow them of gay married couples, since there is no essential difference -- barring your obsession with the \"correct\" genitalia. However, i have to point out to you that the \"incorrect\" genitalia among gays is no obstacle to their forming the same sort of relationships straight couples do.\n\n There certainly is nothing barring a man and two women from forming the same sort of relationships that straight couples do. But denying polygamous marriage is not a denial of equal protection.\n \n \nBe assured, you would never be on my wedding invitation list. The issue, however, is not your personal prejudices, but the right of the government to deny gay people equal protections.\n\n I would not care if you sent me an invitation or not. And the government is not denying gay people equal protection.\n \n \nIt's a clear fact that the law is not being applied to gay people the way it is applied to straights. but of course that's the way you like it.\n\n The exact opposite is true. Especially with respect to marriage, everyone must follow the same rules, and the law is applied the same way for everyone.\n \n \nI suggest, Phyllis, that you folk would be better occupied and more honest trying to pass a constitutional amendment that specifically excludes gays from equal protections. that is, after all, your intent.\n\n I'm starting to believe that I would better occupy my time by not wasting it in discussion with people who are not interested in preserving Constitutional meaning and who are willing to substitute constitutional government and democratic process for government by a select number of elite just so that they can achieve a policy of which they were unable to convince the people to enact.",

They clearly favor straights over gays, what are you talking about?\n \n \n\n If you are prepared to say that equal protection demands that gays be allowed to marry, but it does not do the same with respect to a brother who wishes to marry his sister, then I think some explanation is necessary. Or we can dismiss all of that nonsense, and simply acknowledge that \"equal protection\" does not mean that everyone must receive the same substantive rights.\n \n\n I can definately provide an exaplanation. That's one of the reasons I'm so sure of my position. It's a known fact that children produced by incest have a much higher likelyhood of suffering birth defects.

I already covered this. The pressing reason behind the drinking age is to prevent people who are too immature to handle it from drinking. As I already said, 20 vs 21 is in fact arbitrary, and I concede imperfect. There is not a perfect correlation between age and maturity. But until someone invents a reliable maturity test it's the best we can do; draw a line somewhere and go with it. So, your point is refuted. There is a pressing reason for the drinking age; I still await your pressing reason for preventing gays from getting married.\n \n \n\n Sure I care about injustice. But I also care about honesty. And I cannot honestly say that the constitution requires the recognition of gay marriage. I feel it would be lying to say otherwise, and lying is a moral evil just like injustice is.\n \n\n No offence, but I had to check.

   "I have no idea what you're refering to. They clearly favor straights over gays, what are you talking about?\n\n For example, marriage statutes favor couples over any other configuration by number. They favor non-related couples over related couples. They favor certain ages over others. The point I was trying to articulate that marriage statutes favor heterosexual couples over and above any other configuration of people. \n \n \nI can definately provide an exaplanation.

As I already said, 20 vs 21 is in fact arbitrary, and I concede imperfect. There is not a perfect correlation between age and maturity. But until someone invents a reliable maturity test it's the best we can do; draw a line somewhere and go with it. So, your point is refuted. There is a pressing reason for the drinking age; I still await your pressing reason for preventing gays from getting married.\n\n I think I did answer this. I said that the Constitution does not require the state to offer a pressing reason for its decision. If that's the standard, I'm not sure there really is a pressing reason for distinguishing between 18 and 21-year-olds. But lets put that aside for now. I am saying the government need not have a pressing reason.\n \n What I contend the government needs is a reason that is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. Incidentally, that is not a standard I just made up. That is how both the due process clause and equal protection clause has been applied specifically to gay marriage. That's the Constitutional standard that must be met. Now, I suppose the reason I stated above satisfies the rational basis test as it has historically been applied. \n \n \nNo offence, but I had to check. You did explicitly say that you did not in fact care about justice, I wanted to see if you mispoke.\n\n Ah, yes. I went back and looked myself. I did not misspeak in the post in question. What I was doing was speaking in a different context. What that statement meant was that in matters of evaluating the constitutionality of a statute, whether it is just or unjust ought not enter the picture. Of course, as a personal matter I care very much about justice.\n \n \nHaving determined that you do care about justice, do you acknowledge that the laws preventing gays from getting married are injust?\n\n Personally speaking, I do not believe they are. If the laws were drawn in such a way as to disallow gays from participating in the democratic process, then I certainly would think so. But I don't see that happening at all. In a democracy there are winners and losers. The fact that someone is losing does not in and of itself establish that injustice is occurring.\n \n \nWhile not everyone must be treated the same, numerous court rulings have said that if the government is going to treat someone differently they must show a pressing reason. You can lock someone up if they commit a crime. You can keep someone out of the army if they are paralyzed. Real reasons. The government can't just arbitrarily alienate some class of people, they must have a real reason to do so.\n\n I'm afraid I must say that I'm a little unclear by what you mean by a \"pressing\" reason. I have tried to explain the constitutional standard, and you may mean the same thing. But some explanation would help me here. Specifically, do you mean to equivocate a \"pressing reason\" with a \"rational reason?\"\n \n \nThat didn't follow in the least. Tyranny is a subset of injustice. How can you say that a society may be unjust without excepting that they may be acting tyrannical?\n\n Injustice and tyranny sometimes coincide, but it is not necessary that they do.

For example, human experience could present a rational basis for a conclusion to keep marriage the way it is. \n\n We're not talking about the democratic process, this isn't about who to elect. This is about law, right? And in the law hearsay, or \"human experience\" as you put it, doesn't count for squat. The government has to show a legitimate issue, they can't just say \"Oh, my barber said...\" and base laws on that.

   "And he is not above misusing scientific research either\n \n \n \n\n \n Dobson wrote:\n \n The unique value of fathers has been explained by Dr. Kyle Pruett of Yale Medical School in his book Fatherneed: Why Father Care Is as Essential as Mother Care for Your Child. Pruett says dads are critically important simply because \"fathers do not mother.\" Psychology Today explained in 1996 that \"fatherhood turns out to be a complex and unique phenomenon with huge consequences for the emotional and intellectual growth of children.\" A father, as a male parent, makes unique contributions to the task of parenting that a mother cannot emulate, and vice versa.\n \n Pruett replied (emphasis added)\n \n Dr. Dobson,\n I was startled and disappointed to see my work referenced in the current Time Magazine piece in which you opined that social science, such as mine, supports your convictions opposing lesbian and gay parenthood. I write now to insist that you not quote from my research in your media campaigns, personal or corporate, without previously securing my permission. You cherry-picked a phrase to shore up highly (in my view) discriminatory purposes. This practice is condemned in real science, common though it may be in pseudo-science circles. There is nothing in my longitudinal research or any of my writings to support such conclusions. On page 134 of the book you cite in your piece, I wrote, \"What we do know is that there is no reason for concern about the development or psychological competence of children living with gay fathers. It is love that binds relationships, not sex.\"\n \n Kyle Pruett, M.D.\n Yale School of Medicine\n \n\n \n \n More\n \n \nJames Dobson wrote,\n \n According to educational psychologist Carol Gilligan, mothers tend to stress sympathy, grace and care to their children, while fathers accent justice, fairness and duty. Moms give a child a sense of hopefulness; dads provide a sense of right and wrong and its consequences. Other researchers have determined that boys are not born with an understanding of \"maleness.\" They have to learn it, ideally from their fathers.\n \n Gilligan responded,\n \n Dear Dr. Dobson:\n \n I am writing to ask that you cease and desist from quoting my research in the future. I was mortified to learn that you had distorted my work this week in a guest column you wrote in Time Magazine. Not only did you take my research out of context, you did so without my knowledge to support discriminatory goals that I do not agree with. What you wrote was not truthful and I ask that you refrain from ever quoting me again and that you apologize for twisting my work.\n \n From what I understand, this is not the first time you have manipulated research in pursuit of your goals. This practice is not in the best interest of scientific inquiry, nor does bearing false witness serve your purpose of furthering morality and strengthening the family.\n \n Finally, there is nothing in my research that would lead you to draw the stated conclusions you did in the Time article. My work in no way suggests same-gender families are harmful to children or can't raise these children to be as healthy and well adjusted as those brought up in traditional households.\n \n I trust that this will be the last time my work is cited by Focus on the Family.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n Carol Gilligan, PhD\n New York University, Professor\n",

Is he talking about the one man-one woman tradition, which is a relatively recent tradition (more like 2000 years rather than 5000)? Is he saying that the likes of Jacob (major biblical character) with his 2 wives was not in a traditional marriage? Abraham had 3 wives. Esau had 3 wives. Moses had 2 wives. David also had 2 wives, and concubines too. Solomon is said to have had 700 wives and 300 concubines.\n \n Then we can venture into the traditional families of native americans where a homosexual or transgender (known as two-spirit) was a blessing rather than a stigma.\n \n There are many more examples of traditions in the world of marriage that don't fit today's perceived norm.\n \n One of the biggest problems in ancient times was that of morbidity.
