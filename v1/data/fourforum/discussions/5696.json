As I recall a good deal of Nigerian oil facilities were located offshore in an effort to avoid ongoing civil strife. The common pursuit of most Nigerian leadership has been concentrated on amassing as much personal wealth (in Swiss banks) as possible in their limited terms of office, so as long as they keep doing it in USD in conjunction with US oil companies, not much should change. And any US military intervention in Nigeria would, considering the state of the rest of Africa, be pretty stupid. But with a lame duck administration trying to keep consumer economic confidence high enough to drive a riddled GDP, who knows what might happen. Maybe, since there are Muslims there, they'll (Africa) be considered ripe for a crusader spreading democracy.",

I would say I'm in favor of a covert operation and replacement of the current leadership, but the next leader would likely be just as much a thief as the current one. There was a time that we helped Saddam Hussien and look what he turned out to be.\n \n Bombing is not an acceptable tactic to me anyway. I think all bombs should be outlawed except when used in the course of a DECLARED war against a nation. With the technology we have today, I'm only in favor of smart bombs being used on selected targets...no carpet bombing, no nukes.\n \n As far as completely securing any foriegn country locked in turmoil goes, I don't think we can do that with any country, including our own, regardless of the number of troops available.
