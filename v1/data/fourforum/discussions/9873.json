It's rather more complicated than that. As a soldier, I am not rendered into a quivering mass of uncontrollable urging at the sight of a female. I am rendered into a quivering mass by the extra weight I must carry in the ruck when said female cannot carry the requisite 100-120 lb load. I am also not enchanted by the prospect of being wounded on the field and having my battle buddy, a 120 lb female responsible for carrying me to safety. \n \n I do not believe anyone considers females unfit for military service. I do believe that those combat arms specialties should absolutely be male-only enterprises. The military is not a finishing school. Its purpose is to kill the enemy, take his territory, and advance our nation's interests. I am sorry if this does not completely mesh with your theories of social engineering.",

   "IMO there are some situations where women could prove valuable in certain combat units. Certain special forces units that conduct deep infiltration missions could at times benifit from the presence of females.\n \n My biggest problem with women in most combat roles is that they have created a different set of physical requirements for women..lighter requirements than the men have. The physical requirements for men were formulted to meet a goal. If women do not have to abide by those same requirements, that goal is not likely to be met. \n \n Muntz provides a good example when it comes to loadouts. A combat soldier is required to carry certain gear. The physical requirements for soldiers are based on the weight of that gear. If they have lighter requirements for women, and they can not carry their full load out, what gets left behind? Do they not carry their share of ammo for the squad support weapon? Do they not carry their medical kit? Soldiers carry only what they need. If a woman can not carry her share of the gear, the unit will be lacing something important. This is unacceptable and puts lives at risk. \n \n The other major problem I have with women in combat is pregnancy. When you train and operate with a military unit you become a team. If one member of that team is unable to perform their duties becuase they have a bun in the oven, the entire team is less effective. That puts lives at ris. Mandatory birth control, with pregnancy being a court martial offense, would solve this problem.\n \n I can see that there could be additional problems related to social dogma and sexual tension, but I think that in many roles these could be overcome.",

For example, if soldiers have to go out into the field fairly far from base, then they have to be able to carry on a prolongued fight based only on what they carry - which can add up to a lot. However, if they are fighting from a well-armed base or in a situation where they can be easily resupplied, then perhaps the weight requirement is not as important. Also, where pregnancy is concerned, I would agree that pregnant women should not fight and, while they are on a particular tour of duty, they should have mandatory birth control. I don't think that mandatory birth control would have to be required during peacetime while they are simply repeating training operations.",

I'm sure there are exceptions, but one cannot generalize to all women the trends of the majority. There are many exceptional women who I am sure could handle the psychological stresses and many, if not most, of the physical stresses. I would think that one of the main questions is whether there are any combat roles that sufficient numbers of women are capable of filling to make it worthwhile. For example, roles where the soldier has to carry a 150lb pack may have extremely few women capable of meeting the requirements. Roles where soldiers have to only carry a 50lb pack would have many more women meeting the requirements - perhaps enough to make it worth the effort to recruit them.",

I know a lot girls who would gladly prove me wrong, but have we as a soicety forgot that woman should have the door opened for them, be treated like ladies, show the kind of love that say our grandparents have for one another, why would we allow woman to face hostile situations such as combat\n and why would any woman want to prove she can die in battle( just to be like men. Prove she can take a bullet. Whats the point) woman are the life line in our world they bear the greatest gift of all time. the gift of life. In a administrative role or medical heck even intellegiance role woman would be able to stay on par or above it with any man but in Combat and that is what the military does is deal in combat I would hope that woman and men would have enough respect for each other and let the men do the dying and killing on the filed of battle.\n Peace.
