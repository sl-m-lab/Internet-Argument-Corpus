   "You see men as devils and find all manner of beings having no worth or value in spirit or in life. You follow the wills and judgments of men and justify all manner of evil as righteous and fruitful. You have given your soul to others and never once have you heard the cry of your own spirit\n \n You have found fruit in death and placed nations before the love of man. Surely it is proper to say, you can not kill man without harming the son of man. You're blood lust drives your righteous indignation and your spirits die by your own hand.\n \n What you judge you must see; in seeing you must know; in knowing you will live with that that you find such distain in. Your judgments of lesser men has doomed only you in spirit. You will reap the harvest of your own words. You will live out your live and death seeing the fruits that you have found. \n \n You could not find the joy of life and gift it has bestowed on you. In the fear of your self preservation you gave away your birth right to the Pharisees of our age. In seeking your life you have doomed it.\n \n You look for an Anti-Christ and seek out a beast and dragon that is to be the slayer of worlds. You seek to crush the revelations of a kindred spirit and in so doing.\n \n YOU HAVE BECOME WHAT YOU HAVE SOUGHT\n \n You walk with the beast and crush men under foot. You marry the slaughter of man and sing at the revelations of victory at all cost. You scream into the heavens before the very face of God and say; \" Who is like the beast? and who is able to go to war with him?\"\n \n No land is a God and no stone is a foundation to your spirit. Let the saints not be turned from the light of love, and be always in question.",
