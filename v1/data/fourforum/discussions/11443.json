   "I like this concept. It seems to do a good job of explaining how microbes adapt so quickly to antibiotics, for example.\n\n Not so much as you might think.\n \n Fifty-odd years ago a statistical test was devised to ascertain whether antibacterial resistance preceded or succeeded exposure, and the results were conclusive: resistance arose prior to exposure to the antibiotic. It therefore could not have been a response to it, intelligent or otherwise.\n \n Now, that on its own does not disprove EAM, but it does demonstrate the validity of RV/NS as an evolutionary mechanism. I say 'RV' rather than 'RM' because any inheritable variability, genetic or otherwise, may be significant to survival and reproduction.\n \nOur blood cells multiply fairly quickly, but the genetic makeup does not change from one lymphocyte \"generation\" to the next. Yet we know that over our lifetimes they \"learn\" to produce new types of defenses against diseases. These adaptations are clearly not genetic, but they are a form of micro-evolution.\n\n Yes - and in doing so they reaffirm the efficacy of RV/NS in a microcosm.\n \n Your immune system constantly hoses out randomly-shaped 'recognisers'. We know they're random because they include recognisers that attack your own cells. Your lymph system has to filter those out by checking them against all known 'self' configurations (when this process fails you get autoimmune problems).\n \n When a recogniser latches on to something 'not self' it triggers a cascade resulting in the production of millions of similar recognisers, which then bind to and destroy the infection. If I recall correctly there's also a mechanism which maintains low-level production of that same recogniser going forward, the better and quicker to respond to the same infection again.\n \n To reiterate: this doesn't disprove EAM, but it does demonstrate that random variation and selection works. And contrary to what bertvan and wascallywabbit blithely reiterate, RM/NS is not the be all and end all of evolutionary theory, either.\n \n The trouble with EAM, then, is that it's a kind of nail soup. It claims to explain everything, but when you look closely you find that it's really nothing more than a philosophical statement that whatever we see happening is happening on purpose. \n \n For instance, I tackled wascallywabbit about the fluctuation test, pointing out that it showed antibiotic resistance preceded exposure and that it was statistically congruent with random mutation within a growing bacterial colony. His response was that it was a purposeful tactic on the part of the colony to produce these mutants. \n \n He further insisted that these mutations did not in themselves constitute the development of resistence; they were not a 'reinvention of the wheel'. He claimed that the real, intelligent, epigenetic EAM response to that antibiotic, where the bacteria 'figured out' how to beat it, must have occurred at some point in the past, and that a memory of that response remained latent within the bacterium (or possibly the colony) ready to be unlocked by the genetic key of that particular mutation. \n \n To counter that assertion I introduced the case of the 'nylon bug'. I managed to elicit agreement from wascallywabbit that the mutation in question could happen as a result of random mutation, and moreover that the statistical likelihood (based on the sheer volume of bacteria in the world historically) is that it would have happened many, many times in the past, long before nylon existed and therefore long before the bacteria could have devised and encoded a response to it within that particular variant gene.\n \n The argument thus boiled down to this: when the mutation arose at random, prior to any bacteria ever encountering nylon, what would have happened? Wascallywabbit's assertion was that nothing would happen: because the bacteria hadn't invented a meaning for that variant gene yet, it was inherently meaningless and would do nothing. My counter-claim was that in decoding the gene the bacterium would produce exactly the same nylon-digesting enzyme, regardless of whether nylon was present or indeed even existed yet.\n \n I justified this claim by pointing out that the system of encoding proteins in the DNA of those bacteria has been invariant for millions if not billions of years: these nucleotides translate to this amino acid, and so forth. I offered to go through the nylonase enzyme acid by acid with wascallywabbit, so that he could point out where the randomly-created gene would have failed to result in the production of nylonase. He declined. After a bit of to-and-fro in which he tried to play down his earlier admission that the original mutation could have been random, he conceded that although he wasn't convinced, my arguments were plausible, promptly got into a tiff with the admin and was banned.\n \n I'm not opposed to the notion of endogenously directed evolution by any means. I'm aware of several ways in which it occurs. However, I'm equally able to see how variation - even if it's involuntary, such as RM - together with empirical filtering can produce evolution. I therefore don't see the point in trying to impose upon reality a philosophical belief that things should be otherwise. My view is that evolution, historically, has enjoyed gradually more and more endogenous direction, but that this is layered atop the earlier, cruder mechanisms that made direction possible.",

   "so do you evos not think that the common ancestor between apes and monkeys was probably monkey-like? \n\n The common ancestor of apes and monkeys (not 'between') is thought to have been similar to these little chaps. And the gap between lower and higher primates was recently bridged too.\n \nGenerally the way evo-world works is that the smaller the animal is the older it is. See evolutionists' minds are like the minds of children -- they associate smallness with lesser complexity...it's a juvenile assumption contradicted by the reality that many animals much smaller than humans -- and much \"older\" -- such as worms have as large or larger genomes than we do. Heck, now that I think about it, I think chimps have like 25,000 genes, while we only have 21,000.....how could that be?\n\n If you're hoping that insults will make me stop explaining things you don't like, it isn't going to work :)\n \n Size and complexity sometimes go together and sometimes do not. A brick wall is a more complex structure than a single brick, but less complex than a microchip. On the other hand complexity of instructions and complexity of finished product don't always correlate either: the Mandlebrot Set is infinitely complex yet is produced by a very simple iterative equation, far simpler than the instructions needed to make a brick wall or a microchip. \n \n That said, once you factor out junk DNA (and yes, there is such a thing, distinct from the non-coding but highly conserved DNA thought to perform regulatory roles) there's a much better correlation between genetic and phenotypic complexity. A lot of the remaining disparity in creatures like worms (frogs are another good example) is explained by contingency. Unlike a human foetus which develops in a comfy, thermostatically-controlled womb, a developing tadpole or frog needs to be able grow in highly variable environmental conditions, so there are a whole bunch of genes producing proteins that perform more or less the same job at different temperatures.\n \n Also, these 'older' organisms - have you really thought that through? Common descent, remember, implies that all living organisms are products of the same evolutionary time period since first life emerged. They've just taken different branching routes along the way. A modern worm, large genome and all, is not the same as the first worms that evolved.\n \n Look up 'Tagmosis', by the way: really cool stuff.",
