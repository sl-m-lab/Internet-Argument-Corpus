   "\n Senate health-care bill diverges from House on key provisions \n PACKAGE COSTS $848 BILLION\n Reid hopes to bring it to floor by next week\n \n By Shailagh Murray and Lori Montgomery\n Washington Post Staff Writer \n Thursday, November 19, 2009 \n Like the House bill, Reid's proposal would be financed through billions of dollars in Medicare cuts, as well as new taxes. But while the House would impose a 5.4 percent surtax on income over $500,000 for individuals and $1 million for families, the Senate would rely primarily on a new tax on high-cost insurance policies that has been hugely unpopular among House members. \n \n To blunt opposition, Reid would impose the 40 percent tax on fewer policies, raising the threshold to $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for family coverage. That change required him to come up with about $60 billion in additional revenue, most of which would come from raising the Medicare payroll tax from 1.45 percent to 1.95 percent on individual income over $200,000 and household income over $250,000. Reid is also proposing a new 5 percent tax on elective cosmetic surgery. \n \n washingtonpost.com \n\n \n From each, according to his means; to each according to his needs. \n These may have been Karl Marx's words, but they are the key to the funding of THIS Democratic Party's socialized medicine scheme.\n Marx would be so proud of his proteges. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Talk about, and it's demagoguery, and spewing liberal talking points, have you any facts to support that what the leftists are promising is even possible to deliver? Because I have evidence which says it isn't possible and their promises are nothing more than very expensive lip service. Expensive for we the tax payers that is. Not one post you have offered had one iota of objective evidence that anything you want to believe is true is in fact possible to be delivered by these criminals on the left. Here's just an excerpt of the article...\n \n By 2019, Taxpayers Will Pay $196 Billion A Year for Obamacare, But 24 Million People Will Remain UninsuredUnder the health care bill introduced by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Wednesday, by 2019 taxpayers will be paying $196 billion per year to subsidize other people&#8217;s health insurance coverage, but there still will be 24 million uninsured people in America, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n \n Reid&#8217;s proposal mandates that all individuals legally resident in the United States purchase health insurance and offers subsidies to people making up to 400 percent of the poverty level ($88,200 for a family of four) to purchase insurance as long as they buy a federally regulated and approved plan sold in a federally regulated insurance exchange. \n \n According to an analysis published Wednesday by the CBO and JCT, this subsidy will cost taxpayers $196 billion per year by 2019 but will still leave 24 million people uninsured in America, about 8 million of whom will be illegal aliens. The estimate assumes that there would otherwise be about 55 million uninsured people in the United States.\n \n \"The gross cost of the coverage expansions, consisting of exchange subsidies, the net costs of expanded eligibility for Medicaid, and tax credits for employers: Those provisions have an estimated cost of $196 billion in 2019, and that cost is growing at about 8 percent per year toward the end of the 10-year budget window. As a rough approximation, CBO assumes continued growth at about that rate during the following decade,\" says the joint CBO and JCT analysis.\n \n &#8220;By 2019, CBO and JCT estimate, the number of nonelderly people who are uninsured would be reduced by about 31 million, leaving about 24 million nonelderly residents uninsured (about one-third of whom would be unauthorized immigrants),&#8221; says the CBO and JCT analysis.\n \n Table 3 in the report indicates that when the health-insurance mandate and subsidy program becomes fully operational in 2014 there will be 35 million uninsured in the United States and this number will drop to 23 million by 2018 before rising back to 24 million in 2019. The report does not indicate how many uninsured people will remain after 2019, or whether the upward trend between 2018 and 2019 will continue.CNSNews.com - CBO: By 2019, Taxpayers Will Pay $196 Billion A Year for Obamacare, But 24 Million People Will Remain Uninsured\n \n And have you asked yourself why this bill which is so badly needed isn't kicking in until 2014? Does that make sense to you? Or does it show that the coward Yobama wants the government takeover but he doesn't want to pay for its faille politically so he wont institute it until after the 012 election cycle. Hows that for playing politics with america's health. Real big of him huh?\n\n \n \nIf you want lower taxes you should work for waste elimination instead of calling it \"rationing.\"\n\n \n What kind of an insane response is this? Did you even read my response or the CBO's report above? Here's a crazy idea for these leftist democrats, how about actually lowering the cost of healthcare while improving the quality of it, and insuring the 45 million people this whole leftist exercise in futility is claiming to, and promising to accomplish!!! Hows about that for a goal for once modulus? You know, the liberal dems actually delivering on what they are promising rather than costing us billions of dollars per year while improving nothing at all? How's that for a new idea? \n \n How can you support and defend these liars when even their own administrations \"Congressional Budget Office\" is telling you straight out that everything they are promising is a blatant LIE!?!?!? What sick delusions control your mind that not only allows you to believe them in the face of that evidence, but to continue to defend them?

The liberals want to regulate everything, from the Healthcare system to the internet. They even want to regulate C02! You breath it out! The Federal Government has proven to us that they cannot take care of all of these, they should be working on fixing other problems which in turn would help our economy.

This is a big country, with a large healthcare system, and an even larger economy. We have had big problems before, and we got out of them. We can do it without these big government plans.

What you can measure is equipment available, survival rates for diseases (somewhat), available doctors, mistakes by doctors (etc), and things of that nature. The US is on par or better than almost all nations in these areas and for our dollar we should be. \n \n In any event, just listen to yourself. Are you really trying to say that if we pay for healthcare a different way that the care will get better for those who already have health insurance? The answer to this is no and, in fact, it could get worse. For the people who don't have insurance, who by the way actually are happy with this according to one survey...70% maybe??? I'll have to check, probably need to be helped out some way but there are better ways to do it than single payer or public option. The Swiss found an ok way to do it and we can modify that a little to suit a big country. We'll need a lot more doctors though and that causes costs to rise in the short term or long lines or both.",
