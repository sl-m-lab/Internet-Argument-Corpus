Their opinions shouldn't count any more than anyone else's. I think celebrities simply know they have a more 'national' audience, so they use that as political soapbox opportunity.

It's necessary that some mind or other should exercise authority, so that the people without opinions can start having opinions. These days, the \"celebrity\" is acceptable as an authority on all manner of political and moral questions. \n \n On Jane Fonda : I don't think the United States Congress ever declared war on a formal basis in Vietnam - otherwise I don't see how she escaped being charged with treason following her behaviour in Hanoi.\n \n James.",
