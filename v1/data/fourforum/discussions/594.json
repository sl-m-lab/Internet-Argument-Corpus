If I can prove that I can own, manage, and maintain a nuclear bomb with the same safety and responsibility as the government. Then why should I have one too. If I can be more responsible and more safer than the government, then the government has no right to deny me the owernship of a nuclear bomb if I can find a seller. If I am safer and more responsible than the government, then what are you afraid of.",
