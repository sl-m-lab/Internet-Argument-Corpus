   "This thread addresses the intellectually bankrupt campaign of disinformation about Old Testament abominations Vs. dietary rules (kosher food).\n \n The words in the original biblical Hebrew, both loosely translated by some as &#8220;abomination,&#8221; are completely different: toeivah for homosexual behavior (Leviticus 18:22) and sheketz for shrimp/shellfish and kosher food (Leviticus 11:10). \n \n &#8220;Detesting&#8221; or &#8220;loathing&#8221; might be better translations of sheketz; while &#8220;abomination&#8221; with a moral connotation seems to be a more appropriate translation of toeivah. Since these words are completely different in derivation, there is no linguistic basis for direct comparison, much less religious equivalence. This alone reduces the claim of equivalence to nonsense, but in fact there are other enlightening differences between shrimp and homosexuality.\n \n Abomination to who? With shrimp (Leviticus 11:10), the full phrase is sheketz hame lachem, &#8220;they shall be a detestable thing to you.&#8221; Lachem means &#8220;to you&#8221; in the plural. The description of homosexual behavior as toeivah, an &#8220;abomination,&#8221; excludes any reference &#8220;to you.&#8221; For shrimp, this might be interpreted as &#8220;detestable to the Jewish people,&#8221; but for homosexual activity, there is an implied &#8220;abomination to God,&#8221; not &#8220;to you&#8221; - a major difference.\n \n Discuss the comparison of shrimp and homosexuality (in the OT) and the internet debate tactics of secular fundamentalists seeking to ridicule religion and demonize religious people. (&#8220;argument by ridicule&#8221;)\n \n Source: God, Shrimp and Homosexuality - Click Here",
