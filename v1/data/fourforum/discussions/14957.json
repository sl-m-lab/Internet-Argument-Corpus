You make me utterly sick Jyoshu.

Because of her religious ignorance and because of her blind faith she pushed her son away into such a deep dark place only us that have been there know what it is like.\n\n \n Does it take a fair-minded approach and point out that there are far more cases of religious parents who disagree with gay sex out there who wouldn't kick their kids out? If not, it's just playing the exceptions up as if they are the rule. if it does take such a fair approach, I might be willing to watch it. But I suspect it doesn't.\n \n \nOh please... oversimplification? What so because it is of a subject you shrug off it is nothing more than mere emotion that you claim is simplified?\n \n \n I'm not 'shrugging it off', whatever that means. Clearly, anyone who treats their child badly to the point of driving them to suicide is doing something bad, no matter WHAT the issue. I doubt you'll find here anyone who would disagree with that. But the reason it's an oversimplification is that these cases are rarely ever such an all-or-nothing issue. One doesn't have to become a gay activist and embrace gay rights all the way as an alternative to driving their children out of the home. If this woman wanted to become a gay activist, that's her choice, but not everyone is going to come to that far-flung conclusion, or decide they should turn their back on their religious beliefs about gay marriage. What about all those parents who don't treat their children in such a way but still don't approve of gay sex? You have to remember, gay activism is not the mainstream position. It may be politically correct, but it's a very controversial issue in society. It's a controversial issue and the gay pride movement doesn't own it. Hear me again: mistreating children by kicking them out of the home is ALWAYS wrong. That goes REGARDLESS of one's position on homosexual-related issues. It sounds like this woman's real problem was that she may have not been such a good parent.\n \n \nHow arrogant and empathetic! How typical. You bury your head in the sand and refuse to acknowledge the truth and the reality of what these young people face and their families.\n\n \n Again, no child should be kicked out for ANY issue. Good parenting and loving one's children is independent of one's take on controversial social issues.\n \n \nPropaganda.... You make me utterly sick Jyoshu. \n\n \n What else is it then? Why else would the film-maker have released it if not to try and take a position on a gay-pride-related social issue? I don't see how it can be described as anything other than propaganda. It's analogous to a pro-choice person making a film about a teenager who suffers because their parents refused them the chance to get an abortion--yet the film doesn't fairly portray the pro-life position and ONLY gives impression it's a pro-life problem. It's a form of disingenuous over-simplification. How can you possibly not understand that? Is it not intended to pull at a person's 'heart-strings'? To appeal to emotion? \n Seriously Jason, no offense, but I think you are being naive about the gay pride movement. This is a movement that will not hesitate to lie and misrepresent the truth if it serves their political ends. It's a POLITICAL special interest movement. Remember, no one but a nutcase is going to be in favor of parents driving their children to suicide for ANY reason. Of COURSE I agree with you on that and likely anyone else here does too. Don't be irrational.",

There has not to my knowledge been sadly any conclusive study on the matter. However I can give you some facts on the current situation of young gay people to hopefully enlighten your ignorance on the matter if you'll only take the time to listen.\n \n PFLAG Phoenix:X Today's Gay Youth:X The Ugly, Frightening Statistics\n \n SUICIDE & DEPRESSION\n {Note: Numbers appearing in parentheses \"( )\" at the end of each statement denote the source of that information. All sources are listed at the bottom of this page.]\n \n * Suicide is the leading cause of death among gay and lesbian youth. (1)\n * Gay and lesbian youth are 2 to 6 times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth. (1)\n * Over 30% of all reported teen suicides each year are committed by gay and lesbian youth. (1)\n \n REJECTION\n \n * 50% of all gay and lesbian youth report that their parents reject them due to their sexual orientation. (2)\n * 26% of gay and lesbian youth are forced to leave home because of conflicts over their sexual orientation. (1)\n * In a study of 194 gay and lesbian youth, 25% were verbally abused by parents, and nearly 10% dealt with threatened or actual violence. (12)\n \n HOMELESSNESS\n \n * Approximately 40% of homeless youth are identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual. (3)\n * Service providers estimate that gay, lesbian and bisexual youth make up 20-40% of homeless youth in urban areas. (18)\n * In a study of male teenagers self-described as gay or bisexual, 27% moved away from home because of conflict with family members over sexual orientation. Almost half had run away from home at least once. (2)\n \n SUBSTANCE ABUSE\n \n * Gays and lesbians are at much higher risk than the heterosexual population for alcohol and drug abuse. (1)\n * Approximately 30% of both the lesbian and gay male populations have problems with alcohol. (1)\n * Substantially higher proportions of homosexual people use alcohol, marijuana or cocaine than is the case in the general population. (6)\n * 55% of gay men have had a substance abuse problem sometime in their life. (10)\n \n HIGH DROP OUT RATES\n \n * Approximately 28% of gay and lesbian youth drop out of high school because of discomfort (due to verbal and physical abuse) in the school environment. (2)\n * Gay and lesbian youth's discomfort stems from fear of name calling and physical harm. (4)\n * Gay and lesbian youth are at greater risk for school failure than heterosexual children. Academic failure, lack of student involvement and low commitment to school are profound for gay and lesbian youth because schools are neither safe, healthy nor productive places for them to learn. (1)\n \n VERBAL & PHYSICAL ASSAULTS\n \n * Teenage students (gay AND straight) say the worst harassment in school is being called 'gay'. (11)\n * In a national survey, youth (gay AND straight) described being called \"lesbian\" or \"gay\" as the most deeply upsetting form of sexual harassment they experienced. (14)\n * Gay students hear anti-gay slurs as often as 26 times each day; faculty intervention occurs in only about 3% of those cases. (9)\n * In Seattle, 34% of students who described themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual reported being the target of anti-gay harassment or violence at school or on the way to or from school, compared to 6% of heterosexual students. (16)\n * Gay and lesbian youth live, work and attempt to learn in constant fear of physical harm at school. (4)\n * 27% of gay and lesbian youth have been physically hurt by another student. (12)\n * In 53 schools in Washington State, 77 incidents of anti-gay harassment and violence have been reported in the past 3 years, with 34 of these incidents (44%) serious enough to warrant possible criminal allegations. (15)\n \n LACK OF SUPPORT\n \n * Few administrators discipline students for name-calling and harassment of gay and lesbian students. (5)\n * Teachers may wish to stop harassment and anti-gay comments, but few have had any specific training which would teach them to intervene effectively and many fear reprisals without the explicit support and backing of their administration. (5)\n * In Michigan, 28% of school personnel surveyed determined their school environment to be emotionally unsafe for gay and lesbian youth. (17)\n * Over 50% of national youth servicing organizations report that they do not have services or resources in place to educate youth on sexual orientation or to support gay and lesbian youth. (13)\n \n LACK OF ROLE MODELS\n \n * There are very few openly gay staff members or teachers in schools. (5)\n * The presence of openly gay and/or lesbian staff members is a crucial component of any school program seeking to reduce bigotry and provide support for gay and lesbian students. (5)\n \n VICTIMS OF CRIME\n \n * Gays and lesbians are the most frequent victims of hate crimes. (7)\n * Gays and lesbians are at least 7 times more likely to be crime victims than heterosexual people. (7)\n * At least 75% of crimes against gays and lesbians are not reported to anyone. (8)\n * In a study of 5 metropolitan areas (including Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York City, and San Francisco), there were 1,833 [reported) incidents of anti-gay and anti-lesbian crimes, which was a 31% increase over the previous year. (8)\n \n WHY SHOULD THIS ISSUE BE TALKED ABOUT IN SCHOOLS?\n \n * In a typical class of 30 students, 8 students (27% of the class) will be directly affected by homosexuality of self, one or more siblings, or one or both parents.

And if you would actually watch the movie or read the story she didn't kick her son Bobby out of the home. \n \n \n if it does take such a fair approach, I might be willing to watch it. \n Jyoshu your already having a predetermined judgment and drawing false conclusions on a matter you stubbornly refuse to see as reality.\n \n \nBut I suspect it doesn't.\n\n \n Again. False stigma and assumption. Must all you religious people be so rigid when it comes to your deeply rooted prejudices? \n \n \n \n \nI'm not 'shrugging it off', whatever that means.\n\n \n You certainly are. \n \n \n Clearly, anyone who treats their child badly to the point of driving them to suicide is doing something bad, no matter WHAT the issue. \n\n \n How can you say this then claim this film is propaganda? The film shows the viewer the consequences and the ultimate sad bitter triumph Bobby's mother overcame to accepting and understanding her son. THAT is the message here Jyoshu.\n \n \n I doubt you'll find here anyone who would disagree with that. \n\n \n No but you paint the issue in black and white attempting to drive a wedge of ignorance of what you assume the pride movement is compared to the outreach many organizations do toward the community and the general populace as well.\n \n \n But the reason it's an oversimplification is that these cases are rarely ever such an all-or-nothing issue. \n\n \n Jyoshu again black and white. There is no such concrete division as the type you portray. You fail to understand the root of the issue. The root of the issue is the very reason you attempt to discredit this film and the positive work the gay rights movement is doing for young people like Bobby. Ignorance, stereotype, and false assumption. \n \n \n One doesn't have to become a gay activist and embrace gay rights all the way as an alternative to driving their children out of the home. \n\n \n No, but it is a half love then is it not? A perfect example is my own mother. It took her over two years to finally say she was proud of me for who i was and reveal to my extended family who I truly was. Not that it was a big shock to anyone, my mother confided in my Aunt after a scene at Christmas where me sexuality set my father off in front of the whole family.\n \n \nIf this woman wanted to become a gay activist, that's her choice, but not everyone is going to come to that far-flung conclusion, or decide they should turn their back on their religious beliefs about gay marriage. \n\n \n Jyoshu your bridging a social issue where I am not! This has nothing to do with gays marrying not at all! It is dealing with the underlying prejudices in our society that breaks families and drives bright, young people to death. \n \n \n What about all those parents who don't treat their children in such a way but still don't approve of gay sex? \n\n \n Jyoshu your thinking in the literal yet again. Certainly I can mostly assume straight people cannot fathom the benefit of sexual intercourse with the same sex simply because well your straight. But once again your narrowing it down to the very deep centered prejudices you carry against gays in general.\n \n \n You have to remember, gay activism is not the mainstream position. \n\n \n Jyoshu sadly your wrong. poll after poll shows society slowly accepting gay people more and more. Look at the polls on DADT alone! Nearly 70% of Americans saying gays should be allowed to serve openly. That is a WIDE majority.\n \n The more people realize whom we are as people and just how beneficial and crucial we are to society the more hearts and minds change.\n \n \n It may be politically correct, but it's a very controversial issue in society. \n\n \n Jyoshu your again attempting to put political spin on something that actually should have none in this context. Please stop doing it.\n \n \nIt's a controversial issue and the gay pride movement doesn't own it. \n\n \n own what? What exactly in the gay rights movement do you despise? Clearly there is an underlying bitterness you feel. I personally do not see it. yes there are cliches and niches in the community some as a negative, yet I feel overall we are still unified as people in the common interests of all peoples not just gays.\n \n \nHear me again: mistreating children by kicking them out of the home is ALWAYS wrong. \n\n \n And yet you criticize the very organizations and movement that gives these young people a fighting chance!\n \n \nThat goes REGARDLESS of one's position on homosexual-related issues. \n\n \n Sadly Jyoshu the position of that said person does in effect play out how they will react if their a parent with a gay child. My Father is a perfect example of this.\n \n \n It sounds like this woman's real problem was that she may have not been such a good parent.\n\n \n On the contrary her sons well being became an obsession. In the film you see she see's homosexuality as a disease something to be cured by god. And she goes through extraordinary lengths to try to \"help\" her son in the way she can while failing to see that she was actually killing her sons spirit.\n \n \n \n \nAgain, no child should be kicked out for ANY issue. Good parenting and loving one's children is independent of one's take on controversial social issues.\n\n \n Sadly Jyoshu in my experience this is simply not the case.\n \n \n \n \nWhat else is it then?\n\n \n Perhaps if you actually watch the film instead of going off assumption you'd find out or draw an educated conclusion.\n \n \n Why else would the film-maker have released it if not to try and take a position on a gay-pride-related social issue? \n\n \n Sigh.... Jyoshu if all you think this is is nothing more than a sympathy card for gay rights your sadly mistaken. You fail to see the true underlying purpose of the film.\n \n \n I don't see how it can be described as anything other than propaganda. \n\n \n Of course you can't. Your predetermined ignorance on the issue coupled with your manifested prejudices on gays has blinded why you truly cannot grasp the true concept here. The real message.\n \n \n It's analogous to a pro-choice person making a film about a teenager who suffers because their parents refused them the chance to get an abortion--yet the film doesn't fairly portray the pro-life position and ONLY gives impression it's a pro-life problem. \n\n \n Jyoshu do not compare the suffering of a gay teenager to that of Abortion. Your beginning to sound like Easy drawing Fundamentalist hot button issues to somehow bridge some gap to make this a negative. Do not even bring Abortion into the fray here.\n \n \n It's a form of disingenuous over-simplification. \n\n \n In your lack of understanding it is. Sadly that is not the case.\n \n \nHow can you possibly not understand that? Is it not intended to pull at a person's 'heart-strings'? To appeal to emotion? \n\n \n Actually no. Emotion is simply a reaction from the truth within the film. We connect because we draw upon our past experiences and similarities with those of the film. \n \n The underlying message is rather that of awareness and care more than anything.\n \n \n \nSeriously Jason, no offense, but I think you are being naive about the gay pride movement. \n \n \n If you are calling me naive on gay rights and the gay movement when you yourself cannot even draw educated conclusions without basing them on ignorance I feel you have no claim to even make such a statement.\n \n \nThis is a movement that will not hesitate to lie and misrepresent the truth if it serves their political ends. \n\n \n I am truly sorry you are so utterly blind...\n \n \n It's a POLITICAL special interest movement. \n\n \n The lives of people, their hearts, and their well being is not in the mere interest of political power. You fail to see this simply because all you can see is the democratic method we are engaging in as free people of this country to ensure we have equal rights and protections just as well as anyone else.\n \n \nRemember, no one but a nutcase is going to be in favor of parents driving their children to suicide for ANY reason. \n\n \n Possibly. However you fail to see the cause and effect of such tragedy. And that is where your views falter on the matter.\n \n \n Of COURSE I agree with you on that and likely anyone else here does too. \n\n \n I could point out a couple people who probably would think otherwise if anything just to invoke an emotional response.\n \n \n Don't be irrational.\n\n \n Don't be ignorant.",

However I can give you some facts on the current situation of young gay people to hopefully enlighten your ignorance on the matter if you'll only take the time to listen.\n \n PFLAG Phoenix:X Today's Gay Youth:X The Ugly, Frightening Statistics\n\n \n Yes, there are sad statistics.\n Here's the thing though ... I see two extremes popping up trying to point fingers for this. a.) religion pointing a finger saying \"see? This is what results when you have gay relationships!\" and b.) the gay pride movement saying \"See, this is what results when you have homophobes!\"--there's little regard for anything in between. You can't just blithely chalk it up to parents or culture as if that's the only factor. \n What about the personal responsibility of the teenager? Or the gay pride movement for influencing culture to try and normalize gay relationships when its not? Where's the blame there? There inherent message of such a film is the usual religion/homophobia-is-bad-and-culture-needs-to-be-more-accepting. That's all well and good, but it's only one side of the issue.\n \n If you really care about this beyond filtered gay-pride propaganda, here are some actual testimonials you can read that buck the dogma trend your movement demands. It just goes to show it's not so simple as gay pride would have everyone think.\n \n PFOX - Personal Stories\n \n \nThere are no exceptions Jyoshu. And if you would actually watch the movie or read the story she didn't kick her son Bobby out of the home. \n \n Jyoshu your already having a predetermined judgment and drawing false conclusions on a matter you stubbornly refuse to see as reality.\n\n \n I'm just asking you if it took a fair approach, that's all. Its a simple enough question--no need for you to get defensive.\n \n \nHow can you say this then claim this film is propaganda? The film shows the viewer the consequences and the ultimate sad bitter triumph Bobby's mother overcame to accepting and understanding her son. THAT is the message here Jyoshu.\n\n \n But again, did it fairly show all the religious people that love their child just as much but DON'T become a gay activist?\n \n \nNo, but it is a half love then is it not?\n\n \n Good question, but I think the real problem is your presupposition that it's only \"half-love\" just because someone doesn't buy the gay pride line lock stock and barrel. I see no reason why a parent cannot fully love their child and yet hold to the view that gay relationships are wrong. If anything it shows a parent loves their kids because they want the best for their kid, rather than some life of abnormality and vice. Would you want a parent giving full consent to other things society considers wrong? Remember, sexuality is not the be-all and end-all of life. There are better things out there to live for than that, and that's why I think some of the responsibility for the suicide goes to the teenager himself. He has put his mother through a life of self-agonizing and pain because of his decision to commit suicide.\n \n \nJyoshu sadly your wrong. poll after poll shows society slowly accepting gay people more and more. Look at the polls on DADT alone! Nearly 70% of Americans saying gays should be allowed to serve openly. That is a WIDE majority.\n\n \n They poll that way because of political correctness, Jason. The more telling indicator is that state after state has been voting to ban gay marriage the last few years.\n \n \nJyoshu do not compare the suffering of a gay teenager to that of Abortion. \n\n \n Why not? They are both controversial issues in society. Women suffer due to the issues and unborn babies suffer and die due to the issues. It seems plenty analogous to me.",

(Luke 16:22-28)\n \n In Matthew 13:42, Jesus says: \"And shall cast them into a FURNACE OF FIRE: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\"\n \n In Matthew 25:41, Jesus says: \"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting FIRE,. . .\"\n \n WHAT JESUS CHRIST SAYS ABOUT HELL! \"fire\" Matt 7:19, 13:40, 25:41 \"everlasting fire\" Matt 18:8, 25:41 \"eternal damnation\" Mark 3:29 \"hell fire\" Matt 5:22, 18:9, Mark 9:47 \"damnation\" Matt 23:14, Mark 12:40, Luke 20:47 \"damnation of hell\" Matt 23:33 \"resurrection of damnation\" John 5:29 \"furnace of fire\" Matt 13:42, 50 \"the fire that never shall be quenched\" Mark 9:43, 45 \"the fire is not quenched\" Mark 9:44, 46, 48 \"Where their worm dieth not\" Mark 9:44, 46, 48 \"wailing and gnashing of teeth\" Matt 13:42, 50 \"weeping and gnashing of teeth\" Matt 8:12, 22:13, 25:30 \"torments\" Luke 16:23 \"tormented in this flame\" Luke 16:24 \"place of torment\" Luke 16:28 \"outer darkness\" Matt 8:12, 22:13 \"everlasting punishment\" Matt 25:46\n \n The Truth About Hell\n \n That's your eternal future, Bennedict, unless you repent and receive Christ.",

   "Yes, there are sad statistics.\n\n \n Yet you fail to see the alarming trends here. You look past the root of the cause of these issues, these statistics. You refuse to acknowledge the root problems with why these young people do these things.\n \n \n\n Here's the thing though ... I see two extremes popping up trying to point fingers for this. a.) religion pointing a finger saying \"see? This is what results when you have gay relationships!\" and b.) the gay pride movement saying \"See, this is what results when you have homophobes!\"--there's little regard for anything in between. \n\n \n False. Each situation, each personal story is different. The parent doesn't have to be religious to be homophobic by any means. Just look at the society we are in today or around the world. The bitter stigmas and deep rooted prejudices that scar our country and drive wedges between us as fellow people.\n \n \n \n \nYou can't just blithely chalk it up to parents or culture as if that's the only factor. \n\n \n Then what is the other factors then Jyoshu? Environment? Certainly that is an area of concern. Young kids being bullied in their schools where the teachers feel powerless to stop it, or where there is little done to protect not only gay kids from being bullied but others as well.\n \n \n \n \n\n What about the personal responsibility of the teenager? Or the gay pride movement for influencing culture to try and normalize gay relationships when its not? \n\n \n See the bolded? Already you interject your own deep prejudice into the conversation. You claim gay relationships are not normal when in fact they are. Monogamous Gay couples in studies are shown to be as just as good as straight parents probably because they realize the tensions with their own families growing up.\n \n \n Where's the blame there? There inherent message of such a film is the usual religion/homophobia-is-bad-and-culture-needs-to-be-more-accepting. \n\n \n And how is that the \"usual?\" You seem to somehow be very bitter toward the films message here. You seem so bitter to the point to where your almost angry that the film actually dares to show people changing and overcoming tragedy with purpose.... Why is this Jyoshu?\n \n \n \n That's all well and good, but it's only one side of the issue.\n\n \n And what is the other side Jyoshu? Tell me this other side.\n \n \nIf you really care about this beyond filtered gay-pride propaganda, here are some actual testimonials you can read that buck the dogma trend your movement demands. It just goes to show it's not so simple as gay pride would have everyone think.\n \n PFOX - Personal Stories\n\n \n Sigh.... Jyoshu once again it's not propaganda and furthermore if anything the things you just linked are! They have a religious overtone for one, where these people seek \"help\" for something that is not needed.\n \n They buy into the stereotypes and the prejudices that their wrong, or sick, or need to be fixed... The AMA and the APA has both stated that homosexuality is not a mental disorder and actually states that attempting to change ones sexuality is damning to that person...\n \n Dare you counter otherwise when the blatant evidence is the countless headstones of those who tried and failed?\n \n \n \n \nI'm just asking you if it took a fair approach, that's all. Its a simple enough question--no need for you to get defensive.\n\n \n Jyoshu I wouldn't be on the defensive if you weren't so quick to interject your own personal stereotypes into your posts..\n \n \n \n \nBut again, did it fairly show all the religious people that love their child just as much but DON'T become a gay activist?\n\n \n Jyoshu yes. You didn't see the religious people who attended the gay friendly church marching in the pride parade did you? If you watched the film no they didn't, In fact it was rather the opposite.\n \n Only those in PFLAG decided to march with Bobby's mother in the front filling compelled to take a stand in her son's memory.\n \n \n \n \nGood question, but I think the real problem is your presupposition that it's only \"half-love\" just because someone doesn't buy the gay pride line lock stock and barrel. \n\n \n Not at all Jyoshu. When my mother kicked me out of the house when I brought one of my ex's over after being in the house less than a minute, and seeing her wipe the doorknob he touched, that to me is half love....\n \n \n \n I see no reason why a parent cannot fully love their child and yet hold to the view that gay relationships are wrong. \n \n \n Try it. If one of your children turn out to be gay I sincerely hope you can not judge them for who they really are.\n \n \nIf anything it shows a parent loves their kids because they want the best for their kid, rather than some life of abnormality and vice. \n\n \n Oh Jyoshu.... Such blindness. Such utter ignorance... You've bought so much into the very stigma that you shout it like it is fact! I wish you could see gay people for who they really are.\n \n Not what your mind attempts to rationalize...\n \n \nWould you want a parent giving full consent to other things society considers wrong? \n\n \n Again Jyoshu.... Again with the stereotype. Do you see now why it is so very difficult to engage in a conversation with you? You must let go of your prejudice if you are to understand...\n \n \n Remember, sexuality is not the be-all and end-all of life. \n\n \n Neither is religion. Neither is being straight. Life is what you make of it Jyoshu. Sexuality is but a small part of my life. But what a pivotal part of my life has it become.... \n \n \n There are better things out there to live for than that, and that's why I think some of the responsibility for the suicide goes to the teenager himself. \n\n \n I cannot even comment on this Jyoshu... You cannot fathom the pain of being in that place Bobby was like I used to be... \n \n \n He has put his mother through a life of self-agonizing and pain because of his decision to commit suicide.\n\n \n And his mother and her lack of understanding just like you, drove Bobby to take his own life...\n \n \n \n \nThey poll that way because of political correctness, Jason. \n\n \n Oh man.... Come on Jyoshu give me a break here...\n \n \n \nThe more telling indicator is that state after state has been voting to ban gay marriage the last few years.\n\n \n In actuality one state, New Hampshire looks to pass marriage equality. Hawaii looks to pass Civil Unions as well as Montana hopefully.\n \n And the fact that Don't Ask Don't Tell was voted and struck down is an all telling sign of societies shift on gays in this country.\n \n \n \n \nWhy not? They are both controversial issues in society. Women suffer due to the issues and unborn babies suffer and die due to the issues. It seems plenty analogous to me.\n\n \n Sigh.... Whatever Jyoshu. Abortion to me is a totally separate issue here. And has no credible value when debating this particular subject.",

   "Typical Jazy exercise to try to drum up sympathy for his ungodly lifestyle.\n\n \n I require no sympathy nor is my love for my Partner a \"lifestyle\" so you can cram that notion right now. \n \n How typical. You attempt to demonize gays for wanting to love those whom we care so deeply for when in fact your own personal track record of a \"godly\" relationship is sadly less than admirable to say the least.\n \n \nAnd let me tell you one thing more - unless these sinners repent before they buy the farm then it's off to the Pit for them. Now that's something to be sad about.\n\n \n What is sad is that you refuse to respond to my other post in the CDC Findings thread putting you in your place. What is sad is that you snipe and try to kill the spirits of those who's futures and hearts and minds are so much brighter, full of promise, and talented than you could ever be as a person.\n \n Your utter lack of accomplishment and your utter failures in your own personal relationships spur you to cling onto whatever comfort you can and using it as a means to belittle others to only shore up your fragile and fragmented personality and self image.",
