The under-18 rate was 17.8\n compared with 18.2 in 2003\n \n &#56256;&#56442; 82% of abortions were funded by the NHS; of\n these, just over half (51%) took place in the\n independent sector under NHS contract\n \n &#56256;&#56442; 88% of abortions were carried out at under 13\n weeks gestation; 60% were at under 10 weeks\n \n &#56256;&#56442; medical abortions accounted for 19% of the total\n compared with 17% in 2003\n \n &#56256;&#56442; 1,900 abortions (1%) were under ground E, risk\n that the child would be born handicapped\n \n Read the full thing here - a very in depth picture as to the nature of abortion in a western society (pdf. requires Adobe Acrobat viewer).\n \n In legal terms, the current clause describes the grounds for elective abortions (95%) of the total number:\n \n \nC the pregnancy has not exceeded its\n twenty-fourth week and that the\n continuance of the pregnancy\n would involve risk, greater than if\n the pregnancy were terminated, of\n injury to the physical or mental\n health of the pregnant woman\n (section 1(1)(a))\n\n \n Also read table 9 (page 17) which outlines the complications that were encountered in the course of abortions over the year (a rate of 2 per 1000 abortions performed.\n \n The Department of Health has said it is working hard to improve awareness and access to contraception as a method for cutting the demand for abortions.\n \n Comments?",
