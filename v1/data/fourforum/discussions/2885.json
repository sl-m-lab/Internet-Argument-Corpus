In our little town of 23,000 military recruiters are regular visitors to the local high school, complete with formal presentations to junior and senior class members. \n The recruiters headquarter from a block of stores, one store for each of the four military branches, complete with red, white and blue front decoration and remodeled, glorious military poster and video laden interiors. \n \n This is an area with few opportunities for young people and considered fertile recruiting ground. Here's an excerpt from Pittsburgh, PA about Marine recruiting there:\n \n ~a good month yields 55 or 60 recruits. At full capacity, he has 40 Marines recruiting in 230 high schools from Pittsburgh to Bloomsburg, Columbia County, about 240 miles away in the northeastern section of the state.\n \n Rivera considers Oliver, a city high school with few students of privilege, to be friendly territory. Teachers and counselors allow Marine recruiters to move about freely and seek out prospects.\n \n In contrast, he and his Marines cannot get in the door at Shady Side Academy, a private school in his recruiting area. At Hampton High, an upper middle-class public school, Marine recruiters must sit behind a table and wait for students to approach them.~\n \n 40 recruiters, plus supervision and logistics, for 55-60 recruits a month? No private company could ever dream of affording such an undertaking. Sounds like cost-effective $500 government hammers.",

The people in power over those who choose to serve in the military, or more accurately voluntarily choose to be enslaved, are either power hungry or corrupted by power. In my view that is the norm, but it is not an absolute however. Consider this, you have free reign over young impressionable people, people who aren't certain of the extent of your authority, and when they become aware of the awesome scope of your authority, have no resources at their immediate disposal to emancipate themselves. Thats an awful lot of authority for the groups of people that run things in the military, what makes them immune to the corruption of power? Nothing, the military in its current state is riddled with corruption, just like the political system it serves.\n \n I think it interesting what someone said earlier in the post about veterans trying to hamper the recruiting effort, and how effective it truly was.

It is that kind of action that may actually hurt the beauracracy of the military enough for it to make the necessary reforms to try and make itself uncorrupted.\n\n \n That was me, and it was VERY effective. \n \n Your points about military corruption are right on target to a degree, but in all practicality, very little is ever goign to change in that regard. The biggest corruption we see in the military is on the procurement side, and is generally officers, not enlisted men. We waste billions on military procurement contracts each year, and when the officers that are administering or overseeing these wasted billions retire at 55, the companies that have been the benificiaries fo these waste programs hire those same officers as consultants at multi million dollar salaires. \n \n If you want a peek at military procurement and weapon system design from an insiders standpoint, there was a movie made several years ago about the adoption of the Bradley fighting vehicle, and exactly how we ended up with that POS in our arsenal. My father has a cousin who was at the pentagon during the time that the events in the movie transpired, and according to him they are pretty accurate.\n \n At the end of the day, I think recruiters should be kept out of our schools becuase they are con men. They are selling money for college that has so many strings attached that the odds of you ever actually getting it are abysmal. They sell technical training that is absolutly worthless once you leave the military, and they make promises that they know will not be kept regarding deployment.\n \n Of course, if you don't want recruiters in your local schools, I would suggest that you do what they did here and form a group to counter them. You will have NO PROBLEM finding people formerly in the service who are more than happy to explain to the local kids what a bunch of liars the recruiters are and the reality behind all the money and technical training they promise you. \n \n Personally, I know a lot of folks who were once in the military and then jumped ship at the first chance they got, and I have yet to find any that would recommend the US military to anybody that they like, though I do know one guy who served in the rangers with a bunch from the French Foreign Legion for a time in an undisclosed location in Africa, and he DOES recommend the Legion.",

For the 3 months that the little war was being waged, the local recruiting office did not manage to sign up a single recruit.\n\n \n You brought this up later, the problem is that if we were to attempt something like this we would need permission from the school to set up in the school during school hours, or else they could be arrested for tresspassing. I'm thinking they would not allow anti-recruitment stuff if we asked for permission to distribute it. We would need their permission to distribute anything on school grounds.",

   "I would like to point out something about people going to college and people going to the military.

Cannon fodder has traditionally been provided by lower and lower-middle class families because there's usually enlisted rank military service and little advanced education within those extended families, creating sub-conscious acceptance levels before recruiters even enter the picture. The military spends countless millions of dollars targeting those groups for recruitment purposes, as you're experiencing in your school. By offering often vague educational opportunities not based on proven scholastic ability and touting the superiority of pay and benefits over available private industry entry level jobs, it doesn't take all that much to convince individuals that they're stepping up in the world with very little effort, the same mindset that limited their scholastic futures.",

   "\n \n With a solid economic advantage over private industry, the 'volunteer' military becomes a thinly disguised mercenary program complete with professional recruitment methods. Raise the economic advantage high enough and politicians are assured of a volunteer force to do their bidding without the political death stroke of conscription. Same techniques employed throughout history for recruitment purposes, whether the economic rewards were pillage as used by the Khans and Crusaders, or Rome where the military was the only government job with an established retirement benefit.\n\n \n What a lot of people forget when they talk about the military, is that it's full time. You don't really have time for a job, so in order for service members to get by, they kind of have to be paid.\n This is no 'volunteer' military. There's a lot more to it then them giving you a weapon and telling you where to go and what to do. Volunteer military is a whole different ballgame.\n With the technological advances, a lot more training is required (more time where a job on the side to make money is out of the question...)\n I'm in the Marines, and I do consider it a job. On the other hand, we follow a whole different set rules, so it doesn't fall into any regular workforce catagory. We can discriminate who we allow in like most employers can't. But we have to. And I really mean NO disrespect to anyone who's offended by a comment like this, but would I really want someone who can't speak, or hear, or who's in a wheelchair, guarding my back in a firefight? That's a risk to someone's life. So once again. Not following today's common employment rules.\n That's what makes this a grey area, so either side can be right.\n I would have to say it's becoming more of a job though.\n And with all the people out there who think driling respect into service members are wrong (mostly worried moms and bored college students who need something to protest), these rules that make us distinctly military are grudually fading or changing. So in my opinion, it's not yet a regular job, but it's on it's way to becoming one.",

   "Now getting back to the regular topic of debate...\n I have no porblem with recruiters in school. I'm thankful they allow them.\n People usually choose 1 of 4 things when they leave highschool. Unemployment, college, military, or a job.\n You're not required to meet with these recruiters. (though I admit, they're a little forward when they're trying to get your attention.) There's usually a career's class offered in school. There's your job briefs, discussions, lectures, etc.. Then you have your saturday night parties. And some even have Monday night parties. Or just a week/month long thing. There's the start to \"I don't give a ****\" - unemployment. Colleges come and visit, or you're given days off to visit them. so there's college. So the military doesn't really have a place because most career teachers/profs don't mention it. Mine sure didn't. \n So if you're patriotic (which a lot of people aren't now, thanks to liberalism - isn't that ironic?) you'll go off and find the military on you're own. \n But if you're looking into the military for schooling, a chance to see the world, and do something, accomplish something, or anything like that... And people are trying to run recruiters out of the schools, some towns even..\n Lol, it's almost as bad as conflicting religions... k back on track.\n Point being, recruiters find thier best cream of the crop sitting in the guidance office already because they need something to do with their life. And heaven forbid you walk into an intimidating recruiter's office on your own. :D\n I think if we let colleges in, people who support the GLBT or whatever it is, DARE *gag*, Reps from various places in careers class, the military should be just as welcomed, in my opinion more welcomed.",

   "Any school that is receiving federal funding better damn well better let recruiters on their grounds........\n\n \n \n Well that means not many schools. Most public schools are funded by the county, at least where I live. I don't mind having recruiters set up tables and waiting for kids to come to them, but they shouldn't be able to walk up to people eating lunch and talk to them about it. Also, if they are allowed to do it I don't see why other businesses shouldn't be allowed to set up booths. Why doesn't McDonald's get to set up a booth in the hall and talk about the perks of getting into the business early and maybe becoming a manager later and making over minimum wage without even going to college?

   "what's this I hear about a VOLUNTEER MILITARY again? where are you getting this. That's like saying I voluntarily work at McDonalds. You're not getting it. MOST (though maybe not all) in the military consider it a career. Once again, it doesn't employ like most, and if it did, I'd say throw it in with the others and let everyone advertise at schools. But it's not. It has it's own catagory, and that's that.\n \n And I don't know about the Good sawmill jobs you speak of either... I'd to military over that any day.\n Those jobs are disappearing because we're advancing. Whether or not that's good can be dabated in another forum.\n Now it's about competition.
