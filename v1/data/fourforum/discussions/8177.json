   "American missile umbrella over Europe is rubbish! Iranian missile threat is as well! They have no such missiles available at the moment. According to experts they'll not have them in dozens of years ahead. And how can 10 outdated American Safeguard missiles to be deployed in Poland and Czechia defend Europe from a missile strike? Americans are just kidding us! \n As I see it Americans are after having their military bases with their so called 'antimissile defense system' in Poland, Czechia, Bulgaria. So that is the major problem we should debate. Sure thing Bush wants 'Young Europe' stay fully dependent on USA militarily especially. There's nothing new in that longstanding line of USA to make 'Old Europe' bow to Washington orders via newly born satellites in Europe. \n So this missile belt in post-Communist states seems to be meant as kind of deterrence not so much for Iran but rather for Russia and Old Europe IMHO.",
