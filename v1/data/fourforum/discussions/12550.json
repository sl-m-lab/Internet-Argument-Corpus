But there is a big difference between a biological connection such as an umbilical cord and a sociological one such as a 'duty'.\n\n \n If society decides that a biological connection should impose special parental duties, that will be a social rule that lots of mothers will follow.\n \n \nHow about a round Earth and life begins with conciousness?\n\n \n Consciousness does not emerge suddenly. That argument has not a strong basis.\n \n \nAbsolutely. A comatose patient may return to an aware state - a foetus has never been in that state to begin with. If allowed, a sperm and egg will eventually have a 'conscious state' - the idea of potential should be irrelevant to the discussion.\n\n \n In my opinion, a fetal person should have the same right that a comatose person to reach an aware state. Sperm and egg are not persons, but fetuses and comatous are: they have a body with its own organs, and an impaired brain.\n \n \nAbortions are normally performed before mental existence occurs - in the second trimester.\n\n \n Would you accept to establish a Civil Fetal Registration in the 13th week?",

   "But the problem remains here: what if a surrogate mother wants to kill your 3, 4 or even 6 month fetus? What if your wife, its biological mother, loves that fetus?\nGenerally a surrogate mother is chosen who would not arbitrarily 'kill' the foetus.
