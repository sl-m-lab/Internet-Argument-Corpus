   "There's a song from the 60's I believe by Jan and Dean (or one of those non-Beach Boys groups that sounded like The Beach Boys) called \"Surf City\" which starts out \"2 Girls For Every Boy.\"\n Basic idea with quoting this is that in this male dominated society, the more women (that you can openly be involved with at one time if you're a guy) the merrier. Now it's possible, but I don't know so don't quote me on this unless you can tell if I'm correct or not, that if it were a female dominated society, the concept may be reversed.\n If any one has telecable, look up the description of some of the late night Cinemax shows. A lot of times, it's just pure entertainment for guys to see two girls getting it going on while cringing with two guys getting it on. Of course, if you get aroused by either, you may have a touch of voyerism.",

I know a few girls that have that same idea about guys though. One has a shirt that says |Y|A|O|I| is my Anti-Drug.
