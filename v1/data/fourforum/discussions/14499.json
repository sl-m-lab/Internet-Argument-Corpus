   "good question, sandy.\n \n first of all, im just making guesses, i have limited knowledge of the cosmos.\n take the first image on this page (from a satellite or space station) for example:\n HowStuffWorks \"How Space Stations Work\"\n \n the chemical composition in the sky makes light reflect blue to us (whether we are on the planet or in space looking at it). and since the sea is very dark (almost black) due to shadows and because it's so deep, it reflects mostly blue from the sky above, and from outer space we see the blue sky as well as the reflected blue from the ocean. that also explains why the blues in the picture look deeper than your typical blue sky - because they are partially reflected by the blackness of the sea.\n \n thats a picture of florida, which is mainly brown (human colours, desert, sand, etc), green (trees, grass) and gross human colours. it's pretty detailed, you can even see some high ways. in respects to the greens you can see, it may be due to the fact that there is a ton of green on the land in places like south america. shots of america that ive seen are part green part brown, which makes sense - russia is green, africa is a mixture, australia is brown, britain is green...\n \n however, some images are clearly altered (literally). take this site for instance:\n Amazing interactive satellite pic of Earth.\n \n no clouds is a tell-tale sign of unnatualness. as interesting as it is, its not what you would be looking at if you were in space.\n \n in terms of pollution, i doubt that it would make a big change, it might change the colours slightly. it would be interesting to see photos from the same satellite taken once a year compiled together.",

   "freedom may be right, you can look at a bottle of water and it may look clear, but put 300 bottles of water together, look through all of them and there may be a faint blueish tint. ocean water is probably more blue than bottled water because of all the random junk that's in it, and because theres a lot more than 300 bottles of water, so the amount of blue being reflected back would be much greater. -edit, the bottle will provide some blue also, but removing the bottles all together, im pretty sure the water by itself will be slightly blue.\n \n however, all of this is irrelevant when youre looking at the earth from space - or even from an aeroplane - because the ocean is sooooooo deep and there are so many shadows that its almost black. the blue ocean that you see from an aeroplane is about 99% reflection from the sky.\n \n in response to whether that florida picture is touched up, its hard to say. you have to keep in mind that most photographs on the internet are touched up, even a little bit, but it seems to me that if the florida picture were touched up they would have done a lot more to make it more vibrant - especially the areas of land. do i think that photo has been touched up? no.\n \n edit - also, the type of camera will make a huge difference. if youve ever taken a photograph and compared it to what you actually see, its never the same. thats why most photographers (professional ones at least) will touch up the colours to make them more realistic. so in the process of doing that with a picture from space, the picture might even look more like the real thing than if it wasnt retouched at all.",

   "Um, I'm pretty sure that you got that wrong here.\n \n The light we get on the surface is white - it's direct white light coming through the atmosphere.\n \n Near the surface, it illuminates everything in white - if you look at an object under an inch or water, the colour won't change from what you see holding it in the air.\n \n However, as you go down, the initially white light (IE, all wavelengths) starts to get absorbed by the water (which absorbs much more light than the air). All light gets absorbed, but the red end of the spectrum is hit first/harder. What remains is the blues, and so the deeper one goes, the less light there is to see by and the more blue it all seems.\n \n I would especially point to the \"underwater_3\" picture above - the effect is clearly seen once you realize part of the picture is actually illuminated by a flashlight. The tray or boat that the diver is holding is of one colour, but the parts closer to the photographer are illuminated and in the natural colour, while the parts further back already show the bluish tinting since the flash didn't reach that far.\n \n As a matter of fact, light CANNOT penetrate deeper than a certain depth, I think it's 200 metres. It's dark below there and photosynthesis becomes impossible, so there's much less life below that threshold.\n \n I don't know why the sky is blue or why the ocean seen from above is blue.
