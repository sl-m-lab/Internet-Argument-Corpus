Your explanation leads to the conundrum that randomness depends on the observer.\n \n Now, despite these problems, I believe that I can provide an example of randomness that even fits your definition: quantum mechanics.\n \n For instance, say you have ten atoms of uranium-235.

   "You are obviously are more experienced in the physics field than I. After a bit of researching I've found a few things to argue back at you with. \n \n website cited- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-235\n \n It's showing a half-life of 700 million years. Assuming we could in fact observe the decay and repeat the experiment with the exact same conditions and variables we would assume we would see a pattern of with atom would decay first. After a pattern was expose we would assume from that we could figure out why that particular atom would decay faster than the others in doing so be able to predict the outcome. This would leave the randomness to only those who were not involved in our experiments. However as I stated above physics is not my area feel free to correct me or show me how I am wrong on how performing millions of experiments would not in fact be able to predict the outcome. \n \n \n \n As for the card on top at the start of the game. Your right the card has the same odds of any other card being draw however it cannot be random because there is no way to put the cards in perfectly random order because if it is done by hand the dealer is deciding where to split the deck and how he shuffles it decides which card will be on top, the other way if a machine is shuffling them, if you conduct many experiments by knowing the order of the cards before placing them into the machine and then analyzing the out come of the stack you would find a pattern.

   "for the poker scenario. Basically let's say someone has tossed the cards up in the air, the wind has blown them around the room, and someone else walks up (they all landed face down) and picks a card. To him, that card is perfectally random. But let's say the card is the ace of spades. In reality, there was a 100% chance of that card being the ace of spades, but since the person didn't know that (it was face down) it is random from his point of view.",

[snip]\n\n This is a perfectly valid observation. However, according to the definition that you gave in your original proposal, there was no definite plan, order, or purpose for that card to be on top. This qualifies as random.\n This is also precisely why I very much wanted to clarify your use of the word \"random.\" Your defense of the \"No such thing as random\" idea is disingenuous to the definition of random.

All ten atoms will appear identical until one decays. If we ran two side-by-side experiments, each with the ten atoms arranged linearly, we cannot \"assume\" (or rather, predict) that if atom #3 decays first in experiment A, that atom #3 in experiment B will decay before its peers.\n The probability that atom #n of both experiments A and B will decay first has a probability of 10%. That is, we can indeed conclude odds, but we cannot predict outcome.\n Predicting the elapsed times at which any of these atoms decay is another beast altogether.\n \n Let us simplify this scenario further. Imagine you have a single atom of U-235. (Or pick a radioactive species with a shorter half-life; the concept is identical.) You may make as many observations as you wish. However, at some point, you must be able to repeatably predict when any certain atom will decay.\n \n Based on my understanding of radioactive decay, I predict that you won't be able to do it.",

You are saying because odds of an event happening can be calculated that said event ceases to be random? Let's take the simplest example of probability: flipping a coin. I know that when I flip a coin, the odds of landing on heads or tails is equal. However, it would be impossible to predict accurately the outcome of every flip every time. In fact, it is impossible to predict the outcome any time, it just so happens that roughly 50% of the time you will guess correctly because of probability.
