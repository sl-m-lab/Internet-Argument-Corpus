   "AFP: US Treasury to sell $142 bn of mortgage assets\n \n \nWASHINGTON - The US Treasury Department on Monday said it would start selling-off mortgage-backed securities worth an estimated $142 billion, in an effort to close another chapter of the financial crisis.\n \n The department said each month it will offload up to $10 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS), assets which bundle together large numbers of mortgages.\n \n \"We will exit this investment at a gradual and orderly pace to maximize the recovery of taxpayer dollars and help protect the process of repair of the housing finance market,\" said Treasury official Mary Miller.\n \n The products, secured by state-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were bought as part of the 2008-2009 financial sector bailout.\n \n As the housing bubble began to burst the Treasury and Federal Reserve bought up swathes of so-called \"toxic assets,\" when losses appeared to be endangering individual banks and the financial system at large.\n\n \n I cant help but wonder if the timing on this is related to our approaching the debt ceiling. Housing numbers that came out today were terrible. This would seem like a relatively poor time to start selling MBS paper if your goal is to help \"stabilize\" the housing market (code for keeping prices higher than fundamentals indicate they should be). \n \n Also, no word on when (or if) the fed will start moving its $1.5 trillion in MBS paper back to private markets. IMO that is a pretty good indicator of their confidence in the \"strength\" of the housing market.",

Looks like they got rid of less than 1% \n \n FRB: H.4.1 Release-- Factors Affecting Reserve Balances -- March 17, 2011\n\n \n \n I dont think they sold them. From the NY feds FAQ page:\n \n FAQs: MBS Purchase Program - Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n \n \nWhat will be the Federal Reserve's investment strategy for agency MBS going forward? \n \n On August 10, 2010, the FOMC directed the Desk to keep constant the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities at their current level by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS in longer-term Treasury securities. As a result, agency MBS holdings will decline over time. Any future decisions about the investment strategy to be employed will be made by the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n \n Two things about that...first, the majority of mortgage payments in the US are now being immediately rolled over into US treasuries. Second, the reduction in hteir holdings just about has to be the result of either securities maturing (very few) or markdowns/write offs (probably the majority). Keep in mind that these were junk MBS paper....paper so toxic that it was driving the banks that were holding them under...and the fed paid FACE VALUE for them. \n \n This was the nastiest of the nasty...the stuff that Citibank generated and sold as AAA and then immediately turned around and bet was going to fail. When we see reductions in those holdings, I think that it is a safe bet to assume that a large portion of that is write offs. It also explains why the FED and their supporters in congress are so dead set against an audit of the fed. Considering current climate when it comes to valuing MBS paper, the balance sheets being released by the fed are likely a pipe dream. I would just about bet you that they are accounting for all that junk paper at face value.\n \n What the treasury bought was all freddie and fannie paper...relatively safe....now that we have bailed both out. \n \n I am just having trouble reconciling the timing of this with recently released economic news. Home prices (nationally) fell 5.2% last month, and the rate of sales fell 9.6%. And the treasury is dumping MBS paper? I can envision an argument for the sale based on the idea that since so few new mortgages are being generated demand is high relative to supply, so the sale will not move the market all that much. \n \n At the same time, if I was the treasury secretary watching what congress has been going through to get a budget passed, and knowing that I was going to have to talk those guys into passing a deficit ceiling increase in the not too distant future, I would certainly be tempted to look around and go \"hmmm...is there anything here I can sell....\"",

The ONE time I was interested enough to look at a banks financial statements and I had to scroll back up to the top because I thought I clicked Enron by mistake. Really, what's the difference?

I'm not really familiar with the averages for banks but that seems a bit high. Maybe in your business 20% of people don't pay.\n\n \n From what I can find, it has to be mark downs and write offs. While that does seem high, this was toxic mortgages. I cant say for sure because I am not sure how the fed would account for such things, but I would imaging that principal reductions and mortgage restructuring has also taken its toll on the book value of those securities. \n \n \nCorrect, this is why I was complaining about Citi for so long.

The guy in charge of compliance I know wants to.\n\n \n Yes...and we get back to why it is a bad idea to let your lobbyists write your legislation :xbanghead\n \n I honestly dont know how anybody could have any faith at all in the US financial system at this point. For all the talk of reform, we did not really do anything to fix the loopholes that lehman and citi and all the others used to hide their bad assets. There has been no resolution on the bad mortgage paper problem...the fed buying them all does not really change the fact that they are out there and causing problems in the economy...the problem just moves from bank pain to public pain. \n \n What really blows me away is that these guys crashed the entire financial system and nobody went to jail we have exactly the same people doing the same things post crash as we had pre crash. The big \"reform\" had to do with bonuses and frankly those guys DESERVED thsoe bonuses. They just talked the government into covering all their losses...that is not easy to do. \n \n \n \n\"Strengthening\" the dollar to gear up for QE3 maybe? Cutting the money supply without anyone noticing to ward of inflation? Political calculation to say \"look, we can reduce the debt!\".\n \n\n \n I am starting to wonder if they have given up on keeping the bubble inflated and are moving on, letting the bubble collapse, and trying to put us in a position that post burst will make us stronger economically. \n \n From a purely economic standpoint, housing is essentially overhead in your economy. Cheap housing actually does a lot more economic good than expensive housing because it gives your consumers more spending money because less money is tied up in a pile of concrete, wood, and cardboard. It is not so different from, say, a mining company that has to build a company town out in the middle of nowhere to house their workers. They are not out there trying to figure out how to make their houses as expensive as possible. It is overhead...they shoot for cheap every time. Obviously that is an oversimplification, but at a basic level what holds true for the mining company holds true for the national economy....there is pretty much no economic benefit to making it expensive to house your workers. \n \n This is why the logic behind the creation of Fannie and Freddie was so flawed. They wanted to increase housing affordability so they focused on making it easy to finance housing and ignored what their plan would do to the actual price of houses. We have the same problem with health care...they have essentially focused on the cost of insurance policies as opposed to looking at the price of health care. \n \n In addition, my analytical mind insists that we acknowledge the fact that the economic costs of \"affordable\" housing goes far beyond the cost of a house. By putting so many people in houses we essentially encouraged everybody to move to the least efficient housing possible. You dont have to be some kind of environmental wacko to recognize that apartments, condos, duplexes, and 4 plexes are more efficient than a single family home in the suburbs. I dont think there is any question that continued urban sprawl has increased demand for commodities like oil, metals, etc... \n \n HAH! Who am I kidding here. Nobody is making economic decisions that look past the next election, and you dont get people to vote for you my crashing the value of their home...even if it is better for the economy...and them...in the long term. Long term in this country is defined as the next election cycle, and the politicians will fight tooth and nail to convince Americans that things are \"business as usual\" to get through the next round of voter stupidity. \n \n We live in a country where people honestly believe that a $1.5 trillion deficit can be cured with big tax cuts and cutting NPR. Nobody is interested in hearing about the economic utility of housing.",
