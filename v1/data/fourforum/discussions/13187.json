Here a most current example. http://www.4forums.com/political/366645-post37.html This is a precise example of one quoting themself.\n\n \n Actually that was to prove a point, particularly one regarding one's sanity and a post you deliberately ignored. Also, I quote myself to bring up historical evidence that you were refuted on a topic, choose to ignore how you were refuted and are repeating the same refuted garbage again. I did it recently to disprove your crackpot flood claim namely in that your argument requires almost a billion cubic miles of sediment. You ran from that last time and you'll run like a worthless coward this time. \n \n \nOn the other hand, what I tend to do is repost a previous post which expresses my opinion perfectly since it was usually ignored the first time I wrote it. But thanks for pointing out what the child is so famous for, I agree with your assessment completely. emoticon_xagree\n\n \n Incorrect. You spam the same refuted XXXX garbage over and over again without any attempt to address the argument's failings which have been pointed out over and over again. Furthermore, you spam which is a violations of the forum rules the verbatim posts without any new material nor any arguments as to why who you are replying is wrong. At no time in your posting history did you cite yourself to prove a point that was not refuted. You work under a delusion that repeating the same refuted XXXX will somehow make a bad argument good. That chanting 5 + 6 = 132543 over and over again makes it true. \n \n Instead of Viagra ads, it's you just screaming why everyone is mean to you and thus why you win an argument,.",
