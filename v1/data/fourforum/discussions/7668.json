   "http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/02/27/quebec-priests060227.html\n \n \nA group of 19 Roman Catholic priests from Quebec has published an open letter criticizing the church's stand on homosexuality. \n \n The 980-word letter, published Sunday in the Montreal Gazette, is in response to the position against same-sex marriage taken by the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Vatican. \n \n Does the church \"have the last word on the mysteries of political, social, family and sexual life?\" asks the letter. \n \n \"In these matters, the official teaching of the church has shown itself more than once to be wrong.\" \n \n In its first major policy announcement since Pope Benedict's election, the Vatican in November barred men with \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies\" from entering the priesthood. \n \n The Quebec priests who signed the letter dispute the Vatican's position that homosexual acts are \"immoral and contrary to the natural law,\" writing that throughout human history, mankind has evolved and redefined what is natural to them. \n \n One of the letter's authors, Rev. Raymond Gravel, said some priests who oppose the Vatican's position didn't sign the letter, fearing it would cause problems with their superiors.\n",
