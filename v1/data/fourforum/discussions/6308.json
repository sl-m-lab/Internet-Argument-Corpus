   "THe infamous \"House of Blues\" is hosting a concert by the artist known as Sizzla. Sizzla advocates the killing of gays and lesbians in his music. Please take the time to read this article and contact the House of Blues and tell them they should cancel the show!!!! If this artist was advocating the killing of any other group of people, no one would think of hosting his shows, but since it is gays and lesbains. They seem to think it is ok.....I think we should tell them it is not ok....\n \n \n \n \n http://store.hob.com/support/emailform.aspx?path=/support/help/index.asp\n \n \n \n \n the story.....\n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/08/083005reggae.htm",

A google search for Sizzla lyrics gay yielded none of his lyrics, only articles about them.\n\n \n \n They offensive lyrics are in most of the articles. The issue is that his lyrics are in slang, so unless you understand that, you won't find anything offensive....\n \n Here are some samples from the articles,\n \n In 2002, Sizzla told an audience at a concert in Chicago, in Jamaican slang, \"Mi nuh go tek back mi chat . . . mi kill sodomite and batty man dem bring AIDS and disease pon people . . . shot a kill dem,\" which translates as, \"I won't take back what I said . . . I kill sodomites and gay men that bring AIDS and disease to people . . . shoot and kill them.\"\n \n Lyrics from Sizzla's songs include: \"Shot batty bwoy, my big gun boom\" (Shoot XXXXXX, my big gun goes boom); \"Boom boom! Batty boy them fi dead\" (Boom boom, XXXXXX must be killed); and \"Mi a go shot batty bwai dem widdie weapon ya\" (I go and shoot XXXXXX with a weapon).\n \n \n but since you asked...here are the lyrics I could find\n \n http://raddy73.tripod.com/lyrics/sizzla.html",

However, from his songs, it is my impression that Eminem is presenting the hatred against homosexuals as a bad thing. It is my guess that he opposes hatred against gay people.\n \n But I don't claim to know the answer for certain.",
