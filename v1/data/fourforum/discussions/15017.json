   "Nobody is excluded from marriage, provided you choose a partner that qualifies. There is nothing unconstitutional about having requirements to gain a benefit, provided those requirements apply equally between homosexuals and heterosexuals.\n\n \n An interpretation of the U.S. Constitution on same-sex marriage\n \n An interesting article, pretty much blows holes in your argument.\n \n \n\n The legality of same-sex marriage has come under scrutiny. It is good to examine seemingly new philosophies and perspectives; how else can we determine the rightness of something? But what hasn't been considered is the legality of denying same-sex marriage.\n \n Article Four of the Federal Constitution states:\n \n \"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.\n \n Clause 1: The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\"\n \n In other words, no State has the right to ignore civil agreements reached in other States. So if a same-sex couple in Massachusetts gets married after 2004-May 16th, no State has the right to ignore that marriage. In fact, all States are required to recognize that marriage, because it is a Civil matter. What this essentially means is that State Defense of Marriage Acts (DOMAs) are unconstitutional, plain and simple.\n \n What about the Federal DOMA? Sorry, that, too, will be struck down soon, as it also is unconstitutional by virtue of the Tenth Amendment, which states:\n \n \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\"\n \n Because the Constitution does not explicitly give the Federal Government jurisdiction over marriage, the right to regulate marriage is, by default, given solely to the States to decide. Therefore, Congress had neither right nor power to pass DOMA in the first place.\n \n The solution, some may argue, is to amend the Federal Constitution, which is what George W. Bush endorses. There is one problem with that: Article Six reads:\n \n \"This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\n \n Boiled down, this means that the Constitution is barred from contradicting itself. Thus, a Federal Marriage Amendment that would deprive a singled-out populace of any rights runs in clear contradiction to Article Four and Amendment Nine of the Constitution. Amendment Nine states:\n \n \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\n \n The Constitution says in Amendment Fourteen:\n \n \"Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n \n What this basically means is that the States do not have a right to pick and choose the people to whom it will grant rights and privileges. If one group of people is allowed to marry, all groups are allowed to marry. If same-sex couples are barred from marriage, it is an abridgment of the privileges they are entitled to as citizens of the United States; it would be a deprivation of liberty and prosperity, and would strip same-sex couples of equal protection of the laws. Plainly, it is discriminatory, and the Fourteenth Article clearly states that selective granting of privileges is not allowed in the United States.\n \n Some may say, \"Gays have the right to marry just as everyone else-a right to marry someone of the opposite gender.\" Similar arguments were made in the days of miscegenation in the 1950's and 1960's: \"Blacks have the right to marry just as whites do-the right to marry someone of their own race.\" Such a stance is clearly a form of hypocrisy and oppression, and has no place in the America our forebears envisioned, and contradicts the very basis of the repeal of the miscegenation laws. Albeit slowly, Americans have striven over the years since Brown vs. the Board of Education to uphold that ruling socially; separate but equal is not equal. In our societal efforts to make this ruling a social and legal reality, we have made tremendous strides to end all forms of discrimination, finally recognizing our fellow man and woman's rights as unalienable regardless of creed, religion, race, gender, and even sexual orientation.\n \n Regardless how one attempts to argue in favor of banning same-sex marriage, our Constitution is clear that doing so is illegal, even to the point of disallowing our own Congress to revise the Constitution so that it might contradict itself.\n",

   "The rest of the article appears to regale us with tales of how Congress cannot ban homosexual marriage. Since this thread here is about State laws, the rest of the article does not appear relevant. Please point out the portion I missed if I am incorrect.\n\n \n Ok let me explain a bit further, since you didn't bother really reading the full article.\n \n Article Four of the Federal Constitution states:\n \n \"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.\n \n Clause 1: The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\"\n \n This means that no State has the right to ignore Civil Agreements reached in other states. , Marriage is a Civil matter And according to the constutuion of the United States ALL states are required to recognize Civil unions from other states, including Gay Unions.\n \n The tenth amentment states...\n \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\"\n \n Because the Contituition does not give the Federal Government Jurisdiction over Civil Matters it is up to each state to regulate Marriage , meaning Congress had neither the right or the Power to pass DOMA to begin with. It's unconstitutional. \n \n Article Six states..\n \n \"This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\n \n Boiled down, this means that the Constitution is barred from contradicting itself. Thus, a Federal Marriage Amendment that would deprive a singled-out populace of any rights runs in clear contradiction to Article Four and Amendment Nine of the Constitution.\n \n \n Amendment Nine states:\n \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n \n Amendment Fourteen:\n \n \"Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n \n \n States do not have a right to pick and choose the people to whom it will grant rights and privileges.\n \n If same-sex couples are barred from marriage, it is an abridgement of the privileges they are entitled to as citizens of the United States; it would be a deprivation of liberty and prosperity, and would strip same-sex couples of equal protection of the laws. Plainly, it is discriminatory, and the Fourteenth Article clearly states that selective granting of privileges is not allowed in the United States.\n \n Basically all this means is that The Federal Government does not have the Legal Authority to Define Marriage. DOMA is uncontitutional and will eventually be overturned once the Supreme Court hears the case.\n \n States do not have the Right to Ignore Same sex Marriages from other states, nor do they have the right to supercede the Constitution in order to Define Marriage that will deny One particular group of the same Privilages awarded to others. It's unconstitutional.\n \n So either way you look at this it is unconstitutional , not to mention just plain ignorant, to deny Gay people their rights to the same Life, Liberty, and happiness that other American Citizens are Awarded.",

Your statement that it \"doesn't matter\" is quite correct, though, because the people of the various States have the power to enact the restriction regardless of their knowledge or motive.\n \n \nEh, I don't like the thought of allowing two relatives to knowingly shoot out a bunch of babies with birth defects when with different partners they could have healthy kids. Maybe if they were infertile or old or something they could get a marriage license. Doesn't matter anyway, the point is that there is a decent reason against incestuous marriage.\n\n \n A very similar reason against homosexual marriage, when you get right down to it. Incestous relationships are evolutionarily selected against not only because of an increased risk of so-called \"deadly\" gene combinations (which are not all that common) but also because there is no increase in perpetuation of the genes of the people in question when paired with a close copy of itself. Homosexual relationships would obviously be selected against since there is zero perpetuation of the genes of the people in question. This would lead to both type of relationships inspiring similar reaction which would lead to avoidance of participating in those relationships: namely, disgust.\n \n \nYep. You can kill it and eat it, but you can't torture it or otherwise be inhumane. I mean, I guess if you didn't rape the animal it wouldn't be any different than just having a pet, but the fact remains that the animal would have no way of consenting to marriage, and that is required... Otherwise I would've gotten married to Jessica Alba years ago.\n\n \n Marriage is torturing or being inhumane? Or do you mean the sex, because that wouldn't be torturing or being inhumane either. While certainly animals cannot articulate, they are just as able to enjoy sex as a human can. Inhumane? Cutting off their balls, or simply depriving them of sexual contact is probably more so... at least imo. While there certainly can be concerns about torture, whether sexual or not, there certainly doesn't need to be the expectation that any contact must necessarily be unwanted and painful.\n \n \nNot if those laws are discriminating against a group of people. And I've changed my mind from earlier, as I do now think this issue is unconstitutional (if not for gays, then for men and women not having the same choices in marriage). If it is found to be unconstitutional by a judge, then it gets changed immediately regardless of how the people might feel. The Bill of Rights is there to protect the minority and isn't up for a vote.\n\n \n It isn't actually enough that there be inequality, tbh, in the abstract. There has to be demonstrabable harm (not abstract harm), otherwise the suit is dismissed without the question of constitutionality being heard. To have standing for a gender question rather than a sexual orientation question, the person named could very well need to be heterosexual. Heterosexual people are not suffering under it, and I don't think it can be used as an end-run around the question of homosexual relationships. Besides, differences between men and woman have generally been accepted to exist and in some Court cases such as Michael M. v. Superior ct it has been held that inequalities between men and women are not necessarily suspect: \n \n Because the Equal Protection Clause does not \"demand that a statute necessarily apply equally to all persons\" or require \"things which are different in fact . . . to be treated in law as though they were the same,\" Rinaldi v. Yeager, a statute will be upheld where the gender classification is not invidious, but rather realistically reflects the fact that the sexes are not similarly situated in certain circumstances\n \n You may not get the answer you'd like, even if inequality were accepted to exist.\n \n \nAlso, all that matters is that we want the restrictions? You don't care about the reasoning? You could've said the same thing about literally any bad law ever... You seem to concede that there aren't really any good reasons that gays can't get married, but yet you keep making excuses for it despite it obviously causing a lot of couples across the country unnecessary grief?\n\n \n Yes, you can say the same thing about any bad law ever. If enough people want a bad law, then a bad law will be put into place. If enough people want to get rid of a bad law, then the bad law goes away. A bad law isn't automatically unconstitutional.\n \n The only thing I'm arguing is that there are no inequalities between homosexuals and heterosexuals. I'm not arguing whether the restrictions are \"good\" or \"bad\" because those are value judgements.",

However, each and every one of the texts Boswell called \"same-sex unions\" stress a union where the participants are \"not bound together by nature, but in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\" or \"joined together not by the bond of nature but by faith and in the mode of the spirit (4)\".

   "There was NO homosexual equivalent to hetero marriage in Rome or Greece.\n In fact there was no gay marriage at all.\n\n \n Evidence exists that same-sex marriages were tolerated in parts of Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. Artifacts from Egypt, for example, show that same-sex relationships not only existed, but the discovery of a pharaonic tomb for such a couple shows their union was recognized by the kingdom. Meanwhile, accounts of the Israelites' departure for Canaan include their condemnation of Egyptian acceptance of same-sex practice. In actuality, same-sex marital practices and rituals are less known in Egypt compared to Mesopotamia, where documents exist for a variety of marital practices, including male lovers of kings and polyandry. None of the recorded laws of Mesopotamia, including the Code of Hammurabi, contain restrictions against same-sex unions despite the fact that marriages are otherwise well regulated\n \n http://www.randomhistory.com/history-of-gay-marriage.html\n \n And also according to you there was NO gay Marriage in ancient Rome and Greece.. \n \n Same-sex marriage was outlawed on December 16, 342 AD by the Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans. This law specifically outlaws marriages between men and reads as follows:When a man marries and is about to offer himself to men in womanly fashion [quum vir nubit in feminam viris porrecturam], what does he wish, when sex has lost all its significance; when the crime is one which it is not profitable to know; when Venus is changed to another form; when love is sought and not found? We order the statutes to arise, the laws to be armed with an avenging sword, that those infamous persons who are now, or who hereafter may be, guilty may be subjected to exquisite punishment. (Theodosian Code 9.7.3)\n \n If Gay Marriage was as \"Uncommon\" as you say it was there would have been NO NEED to pass a Law Barring it in the first place. There are historically recorded Gay Marriages in many parts of the world. Ancient Rome and Greece among them.

The States were REQUIRED under our CONSTITUTION to honor other states records, including Gay Marriage.. DOMA put a stop to that.\n \n\n Defense of Marriage Act is the short title of a federal law of the United States passed on September 21, 1996 as Public Law No. 104-199, 110 Stat. 2419. Its provisions are codified at 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 7 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738C. Under the law, also known as DOMA, no state (or other political subdivision within the United States) needs to treat as a marriage a same-sex relationship considered a marriage in another state (DOMA, Section 2); the federal government defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman (DOMA, Section 3).\n \n The following excerpts are the main provisions of the Act:\n \n Section 2. Powers reserved to the states:\n \n No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship.\n \n Section 3. Definition of 'marriage' and 'spouse':\n \n In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word 'marriage' means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word 'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.[6]\n \n one effect of DOMA is that states do not have to enforce judicial custody, alimony or other orders made in other states that involve recognition of same-sex marriages. In his opinion states already had the right to refuse recognition of marriages to local residents who traveled to and married in other states for the purpose of evading local laws. Less clear, however, are cases in which marriage was contracted by residents of a state and they moved to a new state or in which physically present non-residents asserted rights in a local court. It is unclear whether DOMA was intended to address these two cases, whether states already had the power to refuse recognition in these cases even without DOMA, and whether the U.S. Constitution permits any modification of such state powers by Congress.[7]\n \n \n DOMA's two effective sections raise separate constitutional issues.\n \n Section 2 of DOMA explicitly addresses the constitutional requirement expressed in the Full Faith and Credit Clause in Article IV Section 1 of the United States Constitution, quoting its language directly. That clause establishes that the states have certain reciprocal obligations to one another, specifically to recognize each other's \"public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings.\" That same section of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to legislate on the question of those obligations. Section 2 of DOMA excludes same-sex marriages from the state \"acts\" that any other state needs to recognize. Whether DOMA is an appropriate exercise of Congress's power is disputed.[citation needed]\n \n Section 3 of DOMA defining \"marriage\" and \"spouse\" for federal purposes raises a more extensive variety of constitutional issues. First, the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution reserves to the states any power not delegated to the federal government. Debate turns on whether or not the states retain the sole authority to define marriage, as a power not granted by the Constitution to the federal government. Some opponents of same-sex marriage who argue that the definition of marriage is a power reserved to the states do so in anticipation of a time when the federal government might substitute language that would recognize same-sex unions for DOMA's definitions.[citation needed] Similarly, proponents of same-sex marriage, particularly those in states that recognize same-sex unions, argue that the federal government has no authority to define marriage, but must defer to each state's definition.[citation needed] Libertarians also take this view, consistent with their general philosophy of limiting the role of the federal government and favoring local decision-making.[citation needed]\n \n Second, the two sides debate whether or not the right to marriage can be restricted to a traditional definition-the right to participate in the historically accepted institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman-and whether the right to marriage can be denied to those who choose same-sex partners. All agree that the Supreme Court has recognized a fundamental right to marriage in Loving v. Virginia, Zablocki v. Redhail, and Turner v. Safley. Critics of DOMA Section 3 contend that denial of the right to participate in marriage with the partner of one's choice, irrespective of gender, violates both the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. With respect to the Equal Protection Clause, critics contend that DOMA unfairly discriminates against one class of citizens, homosexuals, who have suffered from a history of discrimination.[citation needed]\n \n Proponents of DOMA argue that Congress is under no obligation to recognize marriages solemnized by the states that do not fulfill a federal rational basis. Though, historically, Congress has recognized states' marriages despite their differences (i.e. different marriageable age laws), proponents argue that the fundamental understanding of marriage remained intact - a heterosexual, monogamous union.[citation needed] Proponents reject Equal Protection and Due Process claims against DOMA given the lack of criminal sanctions (i.e. anti-miscegenation laws which were struck under Loving) on same-sex marriages performed by states that opt to recognize them.\n\n \n \n Defense of Marriage Act - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

To a time before DOMA was passed...\n \n Before DOMA, the Government of the United States Did not have the Authority to define or Regulate Marriage. The Constitution Gave the states that Authority.

Clause 1: The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\"\n \n Meaning that if you get Married in One state, any other state must recognize that Marriage according to the Constitution of the U.S. the states can decide their Own marriage Laws, but they cannot ignore the marriage Laws of other states. In doing so they are trampling on the constitutional rights of a certain group of Citizens, which would be Gay people.\n \n Now, Move forward to DOMA. DOMA is unconstitutional on several issues. First would be that the Federal Government Does not have the Authority under the Constitution to Define Marriage. They did so with the passage of DOMA. Secondly the passage Of DOMA explicitly allowed States to ignore Article 4 clause 1 of the Constitution and gave them the authority to NOT recognize Gay Marriages from other states. \n \n The Supreme Court has not ruled on DOMA, they have so far refused to hear the Case. Obama made Repeal of DOMA part of his campaign, but I think we all know he has forgotten that. Either way it goes, Barring Gay people the same rights and Privileges awarded to others is Unconstitutional on both a Federal and a State by State Level, assuming that State has a Constitution.",

   "Evidence exists that same-sex marriages were tolerated in parts of Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. Artifacts from Egypt, for example, show that same-sex relationships not only existed, but the discovery of a pharaonic tomb for such a couple shows their union was recognized by the kingdom. Meanwhile, accounts of the Israelites' departure for Canaan include their condemnation of Egyptian acceptance of same-sex practice. In actuality, same-sex marital practices and rituals are less known in Egypt compared to Mesopotamia, where documents exist for a variety of marital practices, including male lovers of kings and polyandry. None of the recorded laws of Mesopotamia, including the Code of Hammurabi, contain restrictions against same-sex unions despite the fact that marriages are otherwise well regulated\n \n Same-Sex Unions throughout Time: A History of Gay Marriage\n \n And also according to you there was NO gay Marriage in ancient Rome and Greece.. \n \n Same-sex marriage was outlawed on December 16, 342 AD by the Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans. This law specifically outlaws marriages between men and reads as follows:When a man marries and is about to offer himself to men in womanly fashion [quum vir nubit in feminam viris porrecturam], what does he wish, when sex has lost all its significance; when the crime is one which it is not profitable to know; when Venus is changed to another form; when love is sought and not found? We order the statutes to arise, the laws to be armed with an avenging sword, that those infamous persons who are now, or who hereafter may be, guilty may be subjected to exquisite punishment. (Theodosian Code 9.7.3)\n \n If Gay Marriage was as \"Uncommon\" as you say it was there would have been NO NEED to pass a Law Barring it in the first place. There are historically recorded Gay Marriages in many parts of the world. Ancient Rome and Greece among them. It doesn't matter if they were \" Socially Accepted\" or not, they were not against the Law until religion made it so.\n\n \n If these ancient gay 'marriages' were the lifelong exclusive union of two homosexuals without either of them having sex outside of the marriage then I would agree that there were true gay marriages in ancient time..but they were not were they?\n You still seem to confuse gay unions or relationships with marriage.",

You've simply ignored direct statements from multiple sources saying that States have nearly full and complete authority over marriage definitions for their own citizens.\n\n \n It is not MY interpretation of the Law, it is what the LAW SAYS...\n \n Once again...\n \n \nThe Full Faith and Credit Clause-Article IV, Section 1, of the U.S. Constitution-provides that the various states must recognize legislative acts, public records, and judicial decisions of the other states within the United States. It states that \"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.\" The statute that implements the clause, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1738, further specifies that \"a state's preclusion rules should control matters originally litigated in that state.\" The Full Faith and Credit Clause ensures that judicial decisions rendered by the courts in one state are recognized and honored in every other state. It also prevents parties from moving to another state to escape enforcement of a judgment or to re-litigate a controversy already decided elsewhere, a practice known as forum shopping.\n\n \n Notice the Clause reads :provides that the various states must recognize legislative acts, public records, and judicial decisions of the other states within the United States.\n \n Marriage is a matter of PUBLIC RECORD.. and under the Constitution Public records from one state MUST BE RECOGNIZED in other states . Virginia can Pass a Law Banning Gay Marriage in THEIR state. That Law would only apply to Citizens of the State of Virginia. In Massachusetts Gay Marriage is not banned so a Couple who is Married in Massachusetts Can go to Virginia and Virginia MUST RECOGNIZE that Marriage as Legally Binding...\n \n Now that was BEFORE DOMA.. \n \n The Full Faith and Credit Clause has also been invoked to recognize the validity of a marriage. Traditionally, every state honored a marriage legally contracted in any other state. \n \n However, in 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court held that Hawaii's statute restricting legal marriage to parties of the opposite sex establishes a sex-based classification, which is subject to Strict Scrutiny if challenged on Equal Protection grounds (Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44, 74 Haw. 530). Although the court did not recognize a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, it raised the possibility that a successful equal protection challenge to the state's marriage laws could eventually lead to state-sanctioned same-sex marriages.\n \n Basically in 1993 the Hawaii Supreme Court held that barring a same sex Marriage Established a Sex Based Classification.. And thus denying this group the right to marry would go against the Equal Protection Laws of the State Constitution.\n \n  In response to the Baehr case, Congress in 1996 passed the Defense of Marriage Act (110 Stat. \u00a7 2419), which defines marriage as a union of a man and a woman for federal purposes and expressly grants states the right to refuse to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state.\n \n In response.. This means in layman terms that the religious zealots got scared that the Hawaii Court Decision might eventually lead to gay marriage in every state so Congress took it upon themselves without proper constitutional power and passed DOMA.. which in effect removed the States from the Obligation to Follow The Full Faith and Credit Clause.\n \n \nFurther reading...\n Hamilton, Heather. 1998. \"The Defense of Marriage Act: A Critical Analysis of Its Constitutionality Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\" DePaul Law Review \n Hasegawa, Kaleen S. 1999. \"Re-Evaluating the Limits of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\" University of Hawaii Law Review\n Shuki-Kunze, Jennie R. 1998. \"The 'Defenseless' Marriage Act: The Constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act as an Extension of Congressional Power Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\n\n \n And just to clear things up here's another source for the Definition of the Full Faith and Credit Clause..\n \n Full faith and Credit Clause Law & Legal Definition\n \n \nArticle IV, Section 1 of the US Constitution contains what is known as the Full Faith and Credit Clause. This clause requires all States in the US to recognize and give effect to the legislation, public records and judicial decisions of other Sates in the US. It states that each State should grant full faith and credit to the laws, public records and judicial decisions of every other state in the US. The clause ensures that the judicial decisions of other States are recognized by a State. This also ensures that individuals do not migrate to other states in order to escape a court judgment in another State. \n\n \n Conclusion.. Banning Gay Marriage is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\n \n \n\n no federal judge has ruled on homosexual marriage\n\n \n On October 10, 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court overturned the state's civil-unions statute (2005), as unconstitutionally discriminating against same-sex couples, and required the state to recognize same-sex marriages.\n \n In July 2010, a federal court held key provisions of DOMA unconstitutional\n \n On May 15, 2008, the California Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples should have the right to marry.\n \n In October 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that a ban against same-sex marriage was in violation of the equal protection clause in the state constitution.\n \n In April 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that the state's ban against same-sex marriage was unconstitutional.\n \n In Nov. 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that barring same-sex couples from civil marriage was unconstitutional.\n \n In August 2010, a federal district judge in California ruled that the Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriages (passed in 2008) violated the equal protection provisions of the U.S. Constitution.\n \n Yes, Several Federal Judges have ruled on the subject of Gay Marriage. In most every case they find banning Gay Marriage is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\n \n And for Your Information The Supreme Court HAS NO RULING, they have so far simply refused to hear the Case.",

The history of the regulation of marital status determinations therefore suggests that this area of concern is an attribute of state sovereignty, which is \"truly local\" in character.\"\n \n They all agree that State control has existed since the Constitution was adopted and has continued mostly unbroken to present day. That last quotation specifically says that prior to doma the various States had different marriage definitions and the Constitution does not give the Federal gov't the power to regulate marriage... and that necessarily includes the Full Faith and Credit clause. At least, that's how it has always been applied.\n\n \n No, sorry but you are simply misguided in your interpretation of the Law. Marriage is a CIVIL union. Prior to DOMA states had to recognize these Civil Unions from other states, it's in the Constitution. I'm not going to post the Evidence again because you continuously ignore the facts in front of you. \n \n I know the states have the power concerning Marriage, I NEVER SAID THEY DIDN'T. that's why DOMA is unconstitutional. The Federal Government Overstepped it's Boundaries. DOMA also released the States from recognizing same sex marriages performed in other states. That is Also unconstitutional. \n \n Article 4 section 2 of the Constitution States..\n The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. \n \n This means that States MUST recognize the Privileges awarded to a Citizen in their HOME state. This is the Clause that DOMA tramples on therefore making it unconstitutional.",

   "When you say States have to recognize other State's marriage definition, you are saying that States lack the power to define marriage within their own borders. You are contradicting yourself.\n\n Ok, Let me try this again. I NEVER said the states do not have the Authority To Define Marriage in their own state. They have ALWAYS had that Authority, The Federal Government did not. \n Now, Before DOMA there is a clause in the 4th Amendment of the Constitution Called the Full Faith and Credit Clause. \n \n Here it is AGAIN...\n \n The Full Faith and Credit Clause-Article IV, Section 1, of the U.S. Constitution-provides that the various states must recognize legislative acts, public records, and judicial decisions of the other states within the United States. It states that \"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.\" The statute that implements the clause, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1738, further specifies that \"a state's preclusion rules should control matters originally litigated in that state.\" The Full Faith and Credit Clause ensures that judicial decisions rendered by the courts in one state are recognized and honored in every other state. It also prevents parties from moving to another state to escape enforcement of a judgment or to re-litigate a controversy already decided elsewhere, a practice known as forum shopping.\n \n Check the Bold text. Now this simply means that a State has to recognize Judicial Acts from other states. So if a state Like Vermont Passes a LAW allowing Gay Marriage.. Then Every other State In the Union is bound by the Constitution to recognize the Vermont Decision. It also means if a Gay couple is Married in Vermont, then All the other States have to Recognize that marriage as being Legal and Binding. This in no way over rides the States ability to Define Marriage IN THEIR OWN STATE. \n \n Now..\n \n The Full Faith and Credit Clause has also been invoked to recognize the validity of a marriage. Traditionally, every state honored a marriage legally contracted in any other state. However, in 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court held that Hawaii's statute restricting legal marriage to parties of the opposite sex establishes a sex-based classification, which is subject to STRICT SCRUTINY if challenged on EQUAL PROTECTION grounds (Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44, 74 Haw. 530). Although the court did not recognize a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, it raised the possibility that a successful equal protection challenge to the state's marriage laws could eventually lead to state-sanctioned same-sex marriages. In response to the Baehr case, Congress in 1996 passed the Defense of Marriage Act (110 Stat. \u00a7 2419), which defines marriage as a union of a man and a woman for federal purposes and expressly grants states the right to refuse to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state.\n \n States ( in the Past ) have traditionally honored Marriages performed in other states. When The Federal Government passed DOMA in 96 it put an end to that. DOMA protects States from honoring Gay Marriages performed in other states. \n \n DOMA was passed by the Federal Government, who did not have the Authority to define Marriage. DOMA is unconstitutional. When/If Doma is repealed then the States will once again fall under the Full Faith and Credit Clause and they will be forced to honor out of State marriage.",

Ben Franklin? \n Was Abe Lincoln a Christian?\n They separated Church and State which makes dem Christians frown,\n And on that day I'm glad to say they smaked dem Christians down!\n \n We gotta smak dem Christians down,\n Smack dem Christians down,\n On that day I'm glad to say they\n Smaked dem Christians smaked dem Christians\n Smaked dem Christians down.\n \n My daddy hails from Alabam' so the South is in my soul\n I know firsthand about Dixieland and one Christian judge's role. He said\n \"God made different races and gave them homes in separate places....\" \n So Black folk can't marry white folk, no! Black folk can't marry white folk!\n Colored can't marry white folk, no! Colored can't marry white folk!\n Nigras can't marry white folk, no! Nigras can't marry white folk! No!

The entire clause is meant to allow judgements across State lines. This was to distinguish State to State relationships from nation to nation relationships (no extradition treaties needed, etc).

The State Constitutions were Modeled AFTER , and in fact there are some states today that still don't have Constitutions.. You're graspi9ng at straws now..\n\n \n Uh... only if you ignore the Continental Congress and the Articles of Confederation. Individual States had their own governments before the Constitution. The States needed to ratify the new document, after all ... the entire Federalist/Antifederalist debate was whether to continue having a confederation of States or to form a national government.\n \n From here:\n \n Virginia was the first state to ratify on December 16, 1777, while other states ratified in 1778. When congress reconvened in June of 1778, the delegates learned that Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey refused to ratify the Articles. The Articles required unanimous approval from the states. These smaller states wanted other states to relinquish their western land claims before they would ratify the Articles, New Jersey and Delaware eventually agreed to the conditions of the Articles, with New Jersey ratifying them on Nov 20, 1778 and Delaware on Feb 1, 1779. This left Maryland as the last remaining holdout\n \n The Articles were a precursor to the Constitution.\n \n \nWow, you finally are listening.

   "They did explain it when they said there was no Federal question regarding homosexual marriage. They were saying the Federal government is not involved. This was before doma, too, iirc.\n Yes, marriages are recognized from State to State, but you have not and, I daresay, cannot show anywhere a State being forced to. You have not shown that it is done for any reason other than convention and tradition.\n\n \n Well I have, you just refuse to believe the evidence. You're so against Gay Marriage that you will never be convinced you are WRONG, but Just for kicks I will explain it again....\n \n DOMA Section 2, relieves states of a constitutional obligation to enforce judicial custody, alimony or other orders made in other states that involve recognition of same-sex marriages.\n \n Before DOMA the STATES did not have the Authority to disallow Marriages from other states, Period. Many States did pass Laws Defining Marriage in their State beginning in 1973 when Gay marriage first became an Issue. Prior to that No State had any Statue Defining Marriage as between a man and a Woman. They only did so because two men filed for a license and scared the bejebus out of all the religious zealots. \n \n \n \n\n The Constitution doesn't give States power. States (and the people) have every power and authority that isn't specifically given to the Federal government. The Tenth Amendment explicitly states that powers not granted to the Federal government nor prohibited to the states by the Constitution are reserved to the States or the people.\n\n \n Wrong again, the Constitution does Give the States certain Powers. Powers not granted to The Feds are defaulted to the States, including marriage Laws. But The States , Until DOMA , were required by LAW to recognize marriages from other states. It didn't become an issue until the 70's and that's when the States began drafting various bills to Define Marriage.\n \n \n\n Defining marriage is not a power the Federal government was granted, therefore that power belongs to the States.\n\n \n Yes I know, The Federal Government under the Constitution Does NOT have the Power to Define Marriage, yet they DID when they passed DOMA, which has already been Ruled Unconstitutional.\n \n \n\n Public records for the purposes of judgements. The entire clause is meant to allow judgements across State lines. This was to distinguish State to State relationships from nation to nation relationships (no extradition treaties needed, etc). I can show you the reasoning of one of the early jurists, Joseph Story, who talked about that clause. He said much the same as I'm saying now.\n\n \n Wrong yet again.. The Full Faith and Credit Clause applied to Public records as well.. Until the passage of DOMA.. Section 2 of DOMA specifically states...\n Section 2. Powers reserved to the states\n No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship.\n \n DOMA removed the States from the Full Faith and Credit Clause for the specific purpose to deny Gay Marriage. UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\n \n \n\n Yes, I can! Look at polygamy! It used to exist in some States, but other States were not forced to recognize them! Proof right there.\n\n \n We're not talking about Polygamy we're talking about Gay marriage, stop trying to change the subject . Polygamy was banned by the FEDERAL government, but I'm sure if we have a Polygamy Movement then they too can claim their rights are being violated.\n \n \n\n Uh... only if you ignore the Continental Congress and the Articles of Confederation. Individual States had their own governments before the Constitution. The States needed to ratify the new document, after all ... the entire Federalist/Antifederalist debate was whether to continue having a confederation of States or to form a national government.\n\n \n Until 1973, there was no definition of marriage in any statute in any US state. That means NO STATE . Marriage was Defined by State Governments starting in 1973 specifically to deny Gay marriage, before that no one cared.\n \n \n\n Virginia was the first state to ratify on December 16, 1777, while other states ratified in 1778. When congress reconvened in June of 1778, the delegates learned that Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey refused to ratify the Articles. The Articles required unanimous approval from the states. These smaller states wanted other states to relinquish their western land claims before they would ratify the Articles, New Jersey and Delaware eventually agreed to the conditions of the Articles, with New Jersey ratifying them on Nov 20, 1778 and Delaware on Feb 1, 1779. This left Maryland as the last remaining holdout\n\n \n You're talking about before the Union even existed. Each state had specific Laws, but they DID not have Constitutions. Once the U.S. constitution was ratified by all the states and became the Law of the Land the States had to Model their Own Laws to Fit into the Constitution, it wasn't the other way around like you think...\n \n \n\n Doma doesn't let the Federal government define marriage. Doma says, essentially, \"each State can decide for itself\". Since the Federal government didn't have the power to define marriage in the first place this automatically means that power was left to the States. So, logically, doma didn't change a damn thing.\n\n \n Wrong yet again.. I point you to DOMA section 3\n Section 3. Definition of marriage\n In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word 'marriage' means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word 'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife. \n \n DOMA is Unconstitutional, therefore section 2 which relieves the states from the Full Faith and Credit Clause is Unconstitutional as well. If the Federal Government repeals DOMA the States will once again be forced to recognize Marriages from Other states, Whether they want to or not. They may have a Constitution in Texas that bans Gay Marriage, but a gay couple Married in Vermont doesn't have to get married under Texas Law.",

Polygamy was banned by the FEDERAL government, but I'm sure if we have a Polygamy Movement then they too can claim their rights are being violated.\n\n \n You mean like this?\n \n They are not alone. The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah told the paper that it plans to back the group's challenge to Utah's bigamy law.\n \n \"Living arrangements are really the most intimate kinds of decisions people make,\" said ACLU of Utah Legal Director Stephen Clark. \"Talking to Utah's polygamists is like talking to gays and lesbians who really want the right to live their lives, and not live in fear because of whom they love. So certainly that kind of privacy expectation is something the ACLU is committed to protecting.\"\n \n But say, if the Federal government banned plural marriage then why can they not ban homosexual marriage?\n \n \nUntil 1973, there was no definition of marriage in any statute in any US state. That means NO STATE . Marriage was Defined by State Governments starting in 1973 specifically to deny Gay marriage, before that no one cared.\n\n \n Well, yes, statutes existed to establish the metes and bounds of a marriage. Afterall, you can't exactly apply for a marriage license if there were no regulations that provided for it. And people cared very much, otherwise there wouldn't have been an issue with inter-racial marriage or polygamous marriages.\n \n Just perusing the wikipedia page would show you how marriage statutes were being revised in the 1800s.\n \n \nYou're talking about before the Union even existed.

Once the U.S. constitution was ratified by all the states and became the Law of the Land the States had to Model their Own Laws to Fit into the Constitution, it wasn't the other way around like you think\n\n \n Ok, ignoring the fact that the Articles of Confederation officially changed the disignation of the colonies to States, and ignoring that the new States renamed and reorganized their charters into constitutions during this time (prior to the signing and ratification of the Constitution), what in the world leads you to believe that States must model their constitutions after the US Constitution? \n \n The Bill of Rights didn't even apply to the States at the time of ratification.

That is a fact.\n\n \n They did, they were wrong, and I never disputed the fact that it set a precedence. Even if it was wrong it's still the Supreme Court and that is why it's such a hard case to get heard.\n \n \n\n If it is a fact then you should be able to show proof that the law has ever acted this way. Since you have provided no evidence of this, and I have showed you evidence that it does not work that way with specific court cases, my argument has more support than yours.\n The only 'evidence' I've seen you post is quoting the clause itself.\n\n \n No, the evidence is right in front of you. States have ALWAYS recognized Marriages, Licenses , and other Public Records from Other states. They have ALWAYS done so because the Constitution before DOMA made it a Requirement. In fact they still do today, when a Married couple moves from Arkansas to Texas they don't have to re-marry under Texas law, their Arkansas Marriage is Accepted as legal and binding. That all changed when DOMA was passed. Section 2 in DOMA, which I have Shown you, Specifically states it releases States from this Clause. If that isn't enough evidence then you simply don't want to believe it. I understand you don't agree with Gay Marriage, but you can't deny facts .",

   "Assumption or not, it was NOT written into the Law. They didn't define Marriage until they had a NEED to define marriage. And the truth is you are assuming that they were assuming that in the first place. You weren't there so you can't possibly make that claim .\n\n \n You're right it wasn't written in, we're just discussing the reason for that :P\n \n I don't think it's rational to dispute that they assumed that heterosexual couples would be the only couples those statutes would apply to ;)\n \n \nIt was a court case from a Lower court which had been appealed to the Supreme Court.. They DID NOT HEAR THE CASE. They found no Federal Justification to HEAR the case so they summarily Dismissed it. By Dismissing the case in such a way they set a precedence which in turn kept Lower courts from hearing such cases. But they NEVER HEARD THE CASE and they never made a ruling. they simply refused to hear it and dismissed with Prejudice.\n\n \n Rofl, I won't argue with you since at least you agree with the reasoning and effect. \n \n Yes, when they said there was no Federal question (before doma, mind you), it meant that the Federal gov't (and the Constitution) had no authority in the matter. Meaning the States had the authority to define marriage.\n \n \nNo, the evidence is right in front of you. States have ALWAYS recognized Marriages, Licenses , and other Public Records from Other states. They have ALWAYS done so because the Constitution before DOMA made it a Requirement.\n\n \n Then why did the SCOTUS say there was no Federal question? The only evidence that is right in front of me disagrees with your speculation. Give me evidence besides your speculation on the meaning and we'll talk.",
