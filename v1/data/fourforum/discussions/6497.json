(yes, I've posted this before...)\n \n \nAh, but we have experience with radio transmitters. At least with extraterrestrial intelligences we can guess what might have happened. But we don't have any experience with unembodied designers, and that's clearly what we're dealing with when it comes to design in biology. Actually, if an unembodied designer is responsible for biological complexity, then we do have quite a bit of experience with such a designer through the designed objects (not least ourselves) that confront us all the time. On the other hand, it is true that we possess very little insight at this time into how such a designer acted to bring about the complex biological systems that have emerged over the course of natural history. \n \n ...\n \n It is no objection at all that we don't at this time know how an unembodied designer produced a biological system that exhibits specified complexity. We know that specified complexity is reliably correlated with the effects of intelligence. The only reason to insist on looking for non-telic explanations to explain the complex specified structures in biology is because of prior commitment to naturalism that perforce excludes unembodied designers.\n \n (emphasis added, Is Intelligent Design Testable?, William A. Dembski, 01.24.01 http://www.arn.org/docs/dembski/wd_isidtestable.htm) \n\n \n What else could an unembodied designer, which naturalism perforce excludes, be but a deity? \n \n So Dembski's ID has one or more unspecified deities - supernatural, unembodied designers - creating biological systems, at some unknown time, at some unknown place, by some unknown series of steps. What a great scientific theory! :-)",

   "Here is an excellent article about the trial. It is a bit longer than the others but well worth the effort to read. It is slanted towards recent evidence that supports evolution and why ID is not a scientific theory.\n \n New Analyses Bolster Central Tenets of Evolution Theory\n \n \nAsked to provide examples of non-obvious, testable predictions made by the theory of Intelligent Design, John West, an associate director of the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based ID think tank, offered one: In 1998, he said, an ID theorist, reckoning that an intelligent designer would not fill animals' genomes with DNA that had no use, predicted that much of the \"junk\" DNA in animals' genomes -- long seen as the detritus of evolutionary processes -- will someday be found to have a function.\n \n (In fact, some \"junk\" DNA has indeed been found to be functional in recent years, though more than 90 percent of human DNA still appears to be the flotsam of biological history.) In any case, West said, it is up to Darwinists to prove ID wrong.\n\n The problem is that the parts of the non-protein coding DNA that have been found to be functional were discovered by real scientists. They discovered those parts because they suspected that it was functional. There are still some parts that are assumed to have some important function, even though that function is unknown.\n \n And West is wrong. It is the XXXXXX who are making the extraordinary claims and it is up to them to support those claims with evidence. Saying, \"We can't explain how this could have evolved by natural means, therefore it must have been designed by Go....er... by some unknown, magical intelligent designer. But that's not religious.\"\n \n The CNN story posted by trebor mentions Brown University biology professor Kenneth Miller. It does not explain that he is the co-author of several high school and college text books on biology as well as an author and a devout Christian.\n \n Anyone who has any doubt about whether ID is religiously motivated should read THE WEDGE STRATEGY, an internal paper from the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute that was leaked to the press. Or, you might also read almost anything by Johnson, Behe, Wells, or Dembski. They openly admit that they are religiously motivated and then claim that ID is not religious. Can you say hypocrisy?

I don't think that's much of a surprise to anyone.\n \n I also don't think too many people will disagree with the idea that evolution should be taught, or that ID shouldn't be taught as definitive science. What disturbs me about this case is that the state is regulating the classroom to the level of the subject matter and the freedom of the teacher. To me, this issue is as much about over-regulation as anything.\n\n With an educational system so lacking in substance and direction, I for one am glad to see people get involved and take the wheel. America needs much more regulation in what is taught in the classroom. Most Americans blindly send their kids off to public schools, and blindly trust that the teachers are going to fill their heads with the neccessary information. In fact, teachers have a loose curriculum to follow, and as long as they meet a few goals, nobody cares how they get to them. How many times do you remember sitting in high school saying \"when am I ever going to use this?\". I know myself and most people I went to school with asked the question often, and in probably 50-60% of those cases, I am still waiting on the answer.",
