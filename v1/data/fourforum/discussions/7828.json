   "We've lost Georgia for we are having just classical exemplary of dictatorship regime headed by Saakashvili and his gang. People in power there claim they are leading combat on crime and corruption. These are words. They are acting just like criminals. At times you get the impression they have very poor knowledge if any of how laws should work in a civilized country. E.g. Georgian interior minister Merabishvili suggested that criminals (in fact criminal suspects) 'must be eliminated on the spot'! Fancy most Georgian pms praised this monstrous idea. No wonder Georgian parliament woman-speaker Burjanadze (you never know how to spell those Georgian surnames) called 'small blood' those dozens of prison inmates killed the other day in a Georgian prison riot, which was mercilessly suppressed by police. Friendly Georgian journalists assert there is also torture practice in those prisons and there are lots criminals with political background. They say Saakashvili scary of the revolution tends either to kill his opponents or to send them prison. His latest comment that 'the prison riot may lead to dangerous political destabilization of the country' only adds meat to this assertion. \n I think we lost Georgia and not only her when we let Americans in there to teach Georgians democracy. Then chain reaction followed. Now those Georgian cavemen inspired by Bush and Rice are trying to give 'lessons in democracy' to other former communist states e.g. Bulgaria or Byelorussia at the suburbs of Civilized Europe. Georgia is part of Europe and we must cultivate European democratic humane style there unless we want it to pose a challenge to European safety.",
