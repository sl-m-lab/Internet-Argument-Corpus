Most of the time the &#8220;dirty&#8221; deed has been done all that&#8217;s left are the spankings and/or some other discipline. I would like to say that I am not a spanker by nature, although I do resort to it most of the time, but usually not for the same offense.\n And very quiet and loving moments instantly follow those forms of discipline even if just sending them to their room with no TV for a night. Children will always want, want, want and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with it, it&#8217;s human nature, but learning why they get some and don&#8217;t get others is a hard pill to swallow for them, but necessary. It shows them the importance of give and take &#8211; a less harsh version of the real world. My world is the world those kids grow up in &#8211; and I must make sure that my world contains all the good and bad of the real one. No one argues with the good things of the real world and how to get their children headed in that direction, but it&#8217;s hard to accept that the bad has to be shown, too &#8211; even if it is a spanking.",
