   "by Robert L. Johnson\n \n A grandmother from St. Petersburg, Florida is fighting the Jehovah's Witnesses after her teenage grandson died due to the \"revealed\" religion's superstition that forbides members from receiving blood transfusions .\n \n I spoke to the grandmother, Olga Lindberg, yesterday. She told me that members of the Jehovah's Witnesses stayed with her grandson in his hospital room around the clock reciting Bible verses to encourage him not to take the blood transfusions. They did this until he died. Understandably, she is very upset with her daughter who is a JW, as well as with the entire organization of Jehovah's Witnesses.\n \n This very sad situation and unnecessary death of a teenager is important for Deists. Our actions of bringing this tragedy to the attention of people we speak to will help to make sure that Dennis did NOT die in vain! As Olga said, God gave us brains to discover and create medicines and medical procedures that allow us to heal and care for the sick and injured. God wants us to use those brains for the good of all of humanity. If God wanted us to follow the teachings of the Bible, He/She wouldn't have given us brains and reason!\n \n Please let everyone you talk to know about this preventable tragedy. And know that by spreading Deism you are lessening the deadly impact of the \"revealed\" religions!",

Why is it when the belief has a religious origin rather than a philosophical one, it comes in for criticism?\nI think you raise an interesting point, though I would quibble with your last sentence. One could object to stem-cell based therapy without it necessarily being for religious reasons but simply because one believes a fetus is a person. If one were a racist, one could object to a transplant from someone of a different color. (There was an episode of the TV show \"Oz\" that dealt with this issue.) Again, not religious.\n \n To address specifically your vegetarian hypothesis, I have no idea whether the situation has ever happened, but I suspect even the most fanatical vegetarian is going to value the life of a human (especially his own) over a rat or even a monkey, disagreeable though the choice might be to him.\n \n Interesting question, though.",
