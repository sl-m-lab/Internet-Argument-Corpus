There are operational difficulties in putting your hands on him, for all sorts of reasons. But it is not true that they don't know where he is located,\" Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Moshe Ya'alon told Maariv.\n \n Ya'alon, a former head of IDF Intelligence, said, \"Ultimately, in order to get your hands on him you will need what we perfected and that is what we call 'targeted assassination.'\"\n \n http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1115867641034",
