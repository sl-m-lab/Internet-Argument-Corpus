   "The same point as gravity: it doesn't need one. Evolution happens, and provides its own purpose. Things that are better at surviving survive, and that's it, at the core. It is an observable natural phenomenon in the present. Traces in the material world also indicate that it has been going on for quite a while.\n \n As for why bother with it, mostly, because it's useful. Understanding the world around us gives us the ability to control it or adapt to it better, and that understanding also applies to the past history of the world and its inhabitants and to the processes and where they might lead in the future.\n \n Lastly, why bother if death is the end? Well, for one thing, there's this thing called life before it, and it sure matters. For another, one may recognize that even if they themselves die, they may leave a legacy, the same way that we have inherited, or rather, ARE, the legacy of our ancestors.\n \n As for religion, religions are applying restrictions on us. Whether it be a global thing like disallowing certain research and medical procedures I could benefit from or local, like my petty gripe with every village in the area deciding they just HAVE to buy a new set of church bells, out of sheer prestige, and me personally knowing that I HAD to contribute money to our own new set of bells or be ostracized - money that could well have, at the time, been spent on things like finally finishing the canalization that had been waiting for further funds.",

However, we have highly complex social orders. It is in the best interest of humans to be \"kind\" and \"love your neighboors\" because it cultivates a safe and comfortable social environment. However, there are individuals that would think to seek their own interest at the detriment of the group. You might call them sins, but really they are actions that cause legitimate threats to social order and harmony. So laws are put in place.

God's commandments are absolute and unchanging, unless God decides to change his mind, which God reserves the right to do at anytime without notice or explanation. Theistic morality is directly given by God (as long as you are totally convinced that God told you so), and always absolute, except when God tells you to do the opposite, which is also absolute. In the bible every one of\n the commandments, which are all absolute, had exceptions. God commanded his people to kill numerous times, encouraged the Israelites to steal just before they left Egypt, and never penalized Abraham or commiting adultery. And we don't even have to talk about keeping the sabbath. \n \n So you're right, there is a fundamental difference. In your example, Joe doesn't need to rationalize why he should kill Bob, he only needs to be convinced in his mind that God told him to kill Bob. And that's why theistic morality is far superior to atheistic morality, because obeying God's orders (that you tell yourself is God's orders) is much better than using your own reasoning. \n \n \nand those who truly believe this will act as animals.\n \n You say they will not and point to the fact that they do not but I say that is only because we yet have laws that recognize no exception except the slow process of democratic change.\n \n\n I don't say we won't act as animals. We do. We act as highly socialized animals instinctively motivated by survival and reproduction. And we pursue these motivations by very complex methods. Part of the method is the establishment of legal, judicial and government systems. And yes, its complcated, slow, and basically imperfect. \n \n Maybe you're not aware of this, but religion is also one of the systems established to attempt to control our natural behavior. It is an ancient version of our legal, judicial and government system, and in some places is still followed. Its simpler, quite inaccurate, and basically imperfect as well. \n \n If you think that your system of behavioral control is superior to mine, I'd like to know why.",

The concept of the bible as a metaphorical parable pile as opposed to a precise history is distinct.\n\n \n The Bible claims to be inerrant so it must either be truth or lies, not parables (except those that Jesus specifically used).\n \n \nare you prepared to call for instance the entire catholic church liars simply because they are more imaginative at dealing with contradictions to the bible than Josey wales preacher?\n\n \n Yes on multiple levels.

Rather than doing what socially beneficial because you fear unimaginable eternal suffering in hell,\n\n \n Actually, you just come to hate your own evil. It is not out of fear. I also hate the evil of others. Not the person, but only their sin.\n \n I think it has been Easyrider's mistake to promote the \"turn or die\" idea (though I do agree with it) in this way. To make an anecdote (or parable, if you will), it is like having the cure for cancer. Imagine you have the cure and you see someone dying that you could save. Now when you bring it to him, he smacks it out of your hand saying \"I don't have cancer\". Now Easy's approach has been \"YES YOU DO!\" while the correct way to go is to do your best to convince him of his sickness. (slightly off topic because of the \"fearing hell\" comment, but now you understand our position a bit more).\n \n \nSo tell me how does 'every man for himself' a anarchist individualist premise translate to collective uniformity of communism, socialism, and fascism?\n\n \n When you play a game that is free-for-all only one person wins, right? Now put it on a much grander scale. You now have far more losers with how few winners you have. Eventually the people who say, \"Well that's not fair!\" will come together and appoint someone to enforce \"equality\".\n \n \nGod's commandments are absolute and unchanging, unless God decides to change his mind, which God reserves the right to do at anytime without notice or explanation.\n \n \n Yet it never happened in the Bible.\n \n \nGod commanded his people to kill numerous times,\n \n \n The commandment says not to \"murder\" which is killing people in cold-blood.\n \n The Israelites were attacked by most of the people, and the rest were nations of people who worshipped idols that demanded warfare and child sacrifice (ex.

   "Thank you for illustrating the point I was going to make to counter what you said about absolute morality. God's commandments are absolute and unchanging, unless God decides to change his mind, which God reserves the right to do at anytime without notice or explanation. Theistic morality is directly given by God (as long as you are totally convinced that God told you so), and always absolute, except when God tells you to do the opposite, which is also absolute. In the bible every one of\n the commandments, which are all absolute, had exceptions. God commanded his people to kill numerous times, encouraged the Israelites to steal just before they left Egypt, and never penalized Abraham or commiting adultery. And we don't even have to talk about keeping the sabbath. \n \n So you're right, there is a fundamental difference. In your example, Joe doesn't need to rationalize why he should kill Bob, he only needs to be convinced in his mind that God told him to kill Bob. And that's why theistic morality is far superior to atheistic morality, because obeying God's orders (that you tell yourself is God's orders) is much better than using your own reasoning. \n\n That is true, but what it does leave out is the possibility of using ones own judgement to alter morality. God's judgement may alter reality itself and many convince themselves into thinking they know what God want but the vast majority of religious view God's laws as unchanging and absolute.\n \n 'atheistic' morality claims no such standard. It is right if the collective deems it.\n \n This is not superior to God as it is much easier to claim to speak for the collective than to claim to speak for God. (no miracles need to be faked and such).\n \n \nI don't say we won't act as animals. We do. We act as highly socialized animals instinctively motivated by survival and reproduction.\n\n and if I want to kill you would you call this an instinct or a detrimental mutation?\n \n \nIf you think that your system of behavioral control is superior to mine, I'd like to know why.\n\n Assuming your system means collectivism, mine is better because it reflects reality by appropriately assigning concrete terms to particulars as opposed to abstracts.\n \n \nThe only difference is that the theistic morality is CLAIMED to be absolute. Yet, there is so very little agreement about what that absolute is. There is so much variation among the people who claim morality is an absolute, the only conclusion is that the theist is projecting their own concepts on to God, rather than admitting it is relative to them.\n\n Again that is true, but as long as an individual is not consciously aware that morality is his own construct he will not take license to form it into whatever shape pleases him.\n \n You may find specific cases where apparent rules of theistic morality are ignored but the ideals never change.\n \n Suffering and self-sacrifice are virtues and even when a individual bias effects what they believe is absolute they will stay on the guidelines.\n \n \nConsidering the actions of the theistic promoters when it comes to Islam verses fundy, I would say those who deny it act more like \"animals\" than the atheist. \n\n Not quite, they act immorally (refering to objective morality here) but not by whim (which means insticnt). They behave as they do because they believe it is the absolute right not, that it is a benefit for the species.\n \n Fartingle's point (I think) was that if you allow each man to construct his own morality (implied construct from his desires and nothing else) it has no meaning, it may as well be 'what a person will do'.\n \n Well a mass murderers will mass murder, there is an argument for that if the only standard of good is Darwinian selection, and there is an argument for that if the only standard of good is what God says (the argument is that God says it).\n \n The difference lies in the fact that the former is purely a personal choice, where as the latter requires some sort of justification usually just from a religious collective.\n \n The big difference though is the perception and predictability. Pure relativistic morality is absolutely unpredictable and non-absolute. It is incompatible with humans living together and that is why you see a recurring theme of religion in human history as opposed to people noting that the species ends up better if they act nice.\n \n \nThe Bible does set an absolute set of morals. The only time it changes is when it says not to purposely offend other people because different people are offended by different things.\n\n Yes, and as I said the mere concept of absolute morals is sufficient to ward off this riot effect you speak of.\n \n Even the most ardent collectivist atheist believes in absolute morals if they believe that what is 'right' can ever diverge from what the local collective believes is right.\n \n A true collectivist, someone you understands and accepts every aspect of that philosophy is prepared to admit that the Nazi party was moral and just at the time.\n \n \nI said before not to throw all \"religions\" into a group. I would never consider Islam a standard for anything.\n\n Or catholics? or Hindus? or Buddhist? or Jews?\n \n \n \nThey are if you are a Christian.\n\n Yes\n \n \n \nThe Bible claims to be inerrant so it must either be truth or lies, not parables (except those that Jesus specifically used).\n\n No, particularly insane protestant activist claim the bible is inerrant.\n \n The bible has changed translations so many times it has been historically proven the meanings of some sentences have been changed.\n \n Is the king james bible the inerrant one or is the Greek version which was first translated to other languages the inerrant one?\n \n Is God a man of war? That's in the bible.\n \n Did a Jewish forefather wrestle with God? That's in the bible.\n \n Is God jealous of the Hindu gods? that's in the bible.\n \n Does god practice inheritable punishment? that's in the bible.\n \n \nYes on multiple levels. I would also call them liars for having a pope, teaching extra-Biblical ideas (infant baptism, confession to a priest, Mary worship, rosary beads, \"holy artifacts\", works based salvation, ...the pope), and all such things.\n\n ROFL!\n \n As I was raised catholic I am in a good position to speak about their practices.\n \n 1. They don't consider the bible the absolute source of truth, which somewhat explains why they setup a clergy to preserve 'the truth'.\n \n 2. It is quite expected that they would not treat the bible as the originator of christian religion as they originated the bible.\n \n The people who wrote the bible had a pope, had child baptism, had priests.\n \n Consider it then, why read the gospel according to john when john is giving the sermon?\n \n They chose what to put in the bible, how could they possibly be worried about using extra-biblical ideas?\n \n 3. Every major institution in the catholic church has a reason which inevitably is tracked back to Christ himself. They do not see themselves as making up anything new.\n \n 4. No catholic has ever worshipped marry.\n \n 5. works based salvation, to this day I can only laugh at that conflict.\n \n What are the 10 commandments for? Will God send you to hell if you disobey them?\n \n Then one is not saved merely by believing in Christ is he, he must follow his teachings too?\n \n 6. I think the catholic church has the most virtue of any christian sect for one reason, it's greatest philosophers had the courage to identify exactly what religion is.\n \n Thomas Aquinas knew what faith was and knew what reason was and he laid out exactly where reason ended and faith began.\n \n His works incited several heresies and he was criticized by his bishop. Yet he is still considered a doctor of the church.\n \n Protestants on the other hand don't really care. They reject all institutions in favor of an admittedly purer form of self-delusion.\n \n \nWhen you play a game that is free-for-all only one person wins, right? Now put it on a much grander scale. You now have far more losers with how few winners you have. Eventually the people who say, \"Well that's not fair!\" will come together and appoint someone to enforce \"equality\".\n\n Just as God will enforce equality on judgement day. All you mean is that without theistic communism people will reproduce a secular form.\n \n \nIt was common back then to have a wife and concubines to produce an heir. It was not adultery (his wife even gave him her servant).\n\n Thank you for illustrating the above point about making whatever you want equal Gods word.\n \n \nNo, we don't. The Sabbath was never about doing no work until the pharisees and saducees made it so.\n\n Yea, just like those corrupt first Christians made up all the institutions of the church.",

When moses sent the armies into war, he commanded the soldiers (well, he told them God said, of course) to kill everybody and everything. Not just defeat the soldiers on the battle field, but to the residences to kill the women, kids, animals and even crops and property (often they spared the virgins and kept them as captives, apparently they were the exceptions to the exceptions). The passage in exodus 32: 25-29 is particularly interesting. Moses tells the israelites to choose if they wanted to follow him or not. Some chose to follow, some chose not to.

   "Its like nobody gets it. There is absolutely NOTHING absolute about theistic morality. EVERYTHING that you can claim God tells you do can be changed to the exact opposite by you simply claiming that God told you the opposite. \"God moves in mysterious ways.\" There's no algorithm, no requiired precidence, no need for justification or explanation. To say that atheistic morality is whimsical is hysterical. Under a purely theistic system, if Joe murders Bob, rapes his wife, steals his money and torches his property, then claims that God told him to do so, he cannot be condemned, nor will he go to hell, because his obedience to the word of God overrides the judgement of mankind. In fact, he probably would be considered blessed to go to extreme lengths to exercise his faith, and be given more authority, so he can motivate others to have more faith in God like he does. In an atheistic system, no such garbage of an excuse is accepted, and you'd get fried for you antisocial behavior, and as an example to the rest of the community that while nobody can stop you from acting on your whimsical desires, the consequences will surely follow.

   "The verses I was talking about were in the context of offending other Christains (such as drinking around those who think it is wrong to drink (though it is really only wrong to get completely drunk (or hammered (lots of parenthetical comments :) ))))\n \n Jesus only called out their blatant evil (wrong teachings created by pharisees and the money changers cheating people in the temple).\n \n\n Therefore no rule was absolute, even for Jesus. \n \nOnly if there is ever a viable explanation besides it.\n \n\n Therefore even though the bible is supposed to be inerrant, when we find errors we call them parables or allegory, to continue the delusion that the bible is inerrant. \n \n \nThe sleeping man was also the general of an army that had killed thousands.\n \n\n Therefore killing in cold blood is ok if the person you're killing is really evil. \n \n \nIn the origional language it can mean up to 18-19 year olds, and they had thrown Elijah out of the town before pursuing him.\n \n\n Therefore its ok to kill people for chasing you and teasing you. \n \n \nI am not familliar with this. Please specify the passage.\n \n\n Our good friend Onan (gen 38) was killed\n because he practiced pulling out as birth control. Now Onan was the second son of Judah, and was given his brothers wife because his brother (Judah's first born) was killed for being wicked. After Onan was also killed, the wife was supposed to be saved for his 3rd son, who wasn't old enough yet. Now, if that wasn't enough drama, after Judah's wife died, Judah went to hang out with his buddies and picked up a hooker, got her pregnant, and later caught her and planned to have her killed for being a whore. The whore in question ended up being his very daughter-in-law (who he had promised for his son) in disguise. And the clever woman kept his personal belongings as a bargaining chip, just in case Judah tried to have her killed, which is exactly what he did, and it saved her life. \n \n So let's see.... Murder your kids, fornicate with your in-law, lie to your son, sleep with a whore. And none of this displeased God. Therefore, anything you do is ok, as long as you tell yourself God told you to do it. \n \n \nNearly nobody did either in the time it was written, and they were considered far worse offenses than in today's society.\n \n\n Therefore its ok to kill people for a made up reason if you estimate that hardly anybody (relatively, I suppose) is gonna do it. \n \n \nIf you read what happened when they spared people the reason becomes obvious. Whenever they spared people, no matter who, they would begin to corrupt the Israelites to the extent that they would begin to worship Ba'al and set up Ashera poles.\n \n\n Therefore its ok to kill people that worship a different God than yours. \n \n \nDo you really believe he wanted it? It happened because they were practicing pagan worship of idols that would have led the etire nation astray. I am sure they hated that they had to do what they did. The blessing was for having the strength to do what had to be done.\n \n\n Therefore its ok to kill people, even family members, if some guy says God said to do it\n \n \nWhere does it ever say \"borrow\"? It was more like a \"hurry up and get out of here because we would like to stop the plagues now\" present.\n \n\n Read exodus 12:35-36 again. They were instructed by moses to ask for gold and silver jewelry and clothes from the egyptians, and that was before the final plague. Moses knew fully that he was instructing them to ask for items they had no intention of returning. This was how they plundered egypt on their way out. So therefore its ok to steal if a guy tells you that God said to do it. \n \n \nLet me go back. This was about Moses being with his and his wife's servants, but it was never condoned anyway. He was punished with Ishmael whos decendants were always at war with Isaac's.\n \n\n You mean Abraham, and yes that's what happened. The act of adultery wasn't what God punished him for, but the lack of faith that his old wife would bear him a son. The adultery itself apparently God really didn't have a problem with. \n \n \nStill, there was no law against having multiple wives in their time. There is one now in America and the Bible says to follow the laws of your country as long as they do not contradict the Bible so you would not see it now.\n \n\n From what I know, adultery is being married and sleeping with somebody else.

What errors are you talking about?\n \n \nTherefore killing in cold blood is ok if the person you're killing is really evil.\n \n \n We have the death penalty in America which is for killing 2+ people. This man had killed thousands and was on the run from justice. \"Cold blood\" is not just about whether or not a person is attacking you.\n \n \nTherefore its ok to kill people for chasing you and teasing you.\n \n \n More like attacking.

There are not Christians in the Catholic church, there are Catholics; if there are Christians then it is in spite of their teachings.\n \n\n \n \nIf it leads to that particularly, I think I have made clear we would agree that the answer is \"no they do not\".\n\n \n Catholics fit the definition of christian, your rejection of that fact is likely do to the fact that catholics lend support to the idea that religion is a product of philosophical and political necessity.\n \n I do not wish to argue Catholicism vs protestantism not because I think you are right but because since all religion is based on faith in the end you will have to make a faith claim just as catholics do and that will then be outside of rational discourse.\n \n An analogy would be trying to show that one of two known errant theorems is superior or more proper than another. You could babble all you want but if you do that math correctly you will never prove an errant theory is correct and since correct(true) is a boolean value you will never be able to set one theorem against the other and claim it is 'more correct'.\n \n Translating this back to the subject material trying to prove that the bible is Christs inerrant word is impossible so it is also impossible to prove that the bible + church tradition is Christs inerrant will.\n \n You are unable to prove that the bible is the only source of Christianity, this is illustrated by the sad attempt to even show that it is inerrant with the passage that speaks of scriptures usefulness in teaching.\n \n You claim that Christ never explicitly established a pope, confession, or the myriad of other institutions that the church has assembled from implications in Christ's actions, so then these things are inherently unchristian.\n \n Well Christ never mentioned the currently non-existent bible or prophesied it's inerrancy, or it's status as the sole and only means of his word to endure.\n \n He never mentioned any scripture but the Jewish scripture that existed already.\n \n The construct of belief you have assembled about the bible is just as unconcrete as the construct of belief catholics have assembled around the same text AND direct descendants of practice.\n \n No one has ever said any of the gospels are perfect recounting of Jesus life and been able to back it up with something Jesus said, even if they did they only know what Jesus said through the gospels which is just another eddy of circular logic in a giant whirlpool of it.\n \n The catholics as you call them dealt with a non-absolute bible by a system of continuing revelation, study, and tradition.\n \n What they lack is Protestantisms more extreme faith, they as an organization had little choice because as I said they originated the bible and what you see as inviolate word of God from 2 millenia looks an awful lot like a journal or recounting a century after the fact when people who knew the apostles still lived and traveled around giving sermons.\n \n \nFair enough.

   "i was moving, so im a late comer but ill give my two cents anyways.\n \n we dont think of evolution or any science as something with a goal. there is no point to evolution or any other science other than telling the truth and furthering our understanding of the world. evolutionary biologists are not in the business of making people feel good about themselves, theyre in the business of finding answers to questions - all scientists are. to me, i feel much much better about being a part of this magnificient universe than i would if i were to believe that there is something beyond it. this is the only life i have, its a wonderful life and im going to take full advantage of what i have now instead of waiting for a skewed utopian afterlife that may or may not happen. to me, evolution, science, atheism are infinitely more uplifting than religious belief.\n \n in your original post, fart, you are confusing atheism with evolution. although one compliments the other, there are theistic evolution believers. most British bishops believe in evolution, one of my favorite lecturers on the internet is Ken Miller, a theistic evolutionary biology professor at Brown University. evolution and atheism do not come as a package, and evolution has nothing to do with believing or not believing in spirituality.\n \n why waste our keystrokes discussing evolution or learning about evolution? because we have the amazing ability to understand these things. why waste our knowledge not learning about the world we live in?",
