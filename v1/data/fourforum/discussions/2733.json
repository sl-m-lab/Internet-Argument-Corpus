   "This was the name of an article in the Miami Herald today. It gave me another good reason why gays shouldn't be allowed to adopt kids or get married. I hear gays complaining all the time about how they have the right to be married. For some reason, I do not agree with this at all. It stated in the article that \"a new generation of U.S. gay and bisexual men is engendering a sharp increase in the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases.\" They are one of the main reasons for the increase in HIV in this country. People being infected by using contaminated needles, etc are very minimal. Here is an alarming stat about gays and HIV:\n \n The number of gays diagnosed with HIV in the U.S. jumped over 17% from 1999-2002, compared with a 7% increase in men overall (which means heterosexual men have around a 1% increase, in turn meaning the number of gays diagnosed in that time period was 17 times higher than heterosexual men).\n \n \n Gays have a limited choice when it comes to intimate relations (anal). This is one of the easiest ways to get HIV. With the rate of HIV diagnosis steadily increasing among gays, why should we allow gays to get married? Also, I thought that technically \"anal sex\" was illegal in some states, so wouldn't gays be violating laws in the state in which they're trying to get married? I just think the whole issue is sick. The reason most people get married is to live a happy life and have a good family, which usually involves kids if at all possible. I don't recall a man getting pregnant, so that defeats the whole purpose of a traditional marriage. And if the government doesn't pass a federal law allowing gay marriage and leaves it up to the states, what happens if a gay couple marries in a state where it is legal and then moves to a state where it is illegal? If you really like someone and you're both gay, why do you need marriage? What does it prove? The piece of paper stating you are married shouldn't matter if you really love someone that much. Also, gays adopting children is absolutely wrong. The kid will probably be joked on by his peers his whole life. \"Hey look at the kid with 2 dads.\" It will be a tremendous mistake to allow that to happen. I know GW won't let it happen.",

   "\n Gays have a limited choice when it comes to intimate relations (anal). This is one of the easiest ways to get HIV. With the rate of HIV diagnosis steadily increasing among gays, why should we allow gays to get married?\n\n \n Equal rights, and just how is not allowing it gonna change the AIDS stat? Most people in the world screw outside of marriage.\n \n \nAlso, I thought that technically \"anal sex\" was illegal in some states, so wouldn't gays be violating laws in the state in which they're trying to get married?\n\n \n Nope. The Supreme Court made it official that the US government can get their noses out of the bedrooms of consenting adults about a year ago.\n \n \nI just think the whole issue is sick. The reason most people get married is to live a happy life and have a good family, which usually involves kids if at all possible.\n\n \n People get married for lots of reasons. What about straight couple with no kids? Infertile couples? Deny them marriage too?\n \n \nI don't recall a man getting pregnant, so that defeats the whole purpose of a traditional marriage.\n\n \n Are you saying no men can be parents then? And what about the married people without kids and the non married people with kids?\n \n \nAnd if the government doesn't pass a federal law allowing gay marriage and leaves it up to the states, what happens if a gay couple marries in a state where it is legal and then moves to a state where it is illegal?\n\n \n It's not recognized in that state. Lots of laws are different from state to state. It's OK.\n \n \nIf you really like someone and you're both gay, why do you need marriage? What does it prove? The piece of paper stating you are married shouldn't matter if you really love someone that much.\n\n \n Oh, in that case - let's just ban marriage all together. Why should straights need that piece of paper?\n \n \nAlso, gays adopting children is absolutely wrong. The kid will probably be joked on by his peers his whole life. \"Hey look at the kid with 2 dads.\" It will be a tremendous mistake to allow that to happen.\n\n \n Actually leaving kids with no loving home to satisify your dumb idea that gays shouldn't adopt is wrong.\n \n My son's mentor is gay and is the best man I have ever known - I can not imagine a better role model.

It has not been a problem.\n \n \nMaybe he is the best man you have ever know, but he is still gay. Letting gays adopt kids and get married will ruin this country.\n\n \n Why? How? Please demonstrate. Gays can adopt now. Some are even parents from previous relationships with people of the opposite sex. I have yet to see this ruining anything. \n \n \nWhat if the kid grows up and at age 13 he decides he hates gays and doesn't want to live with 2 dads?\n\n \n Nobody decides to suddenly hate anything. Hating gays, blacks, etc, is learned behavior - and I find it highly unlikely that gay parents will teach their kids to hate gay people.\n \n \nAre you just going to give him up again to another family, over and over until he gets adopted by a non-gay family?\n\n \n Um, no. A parent who adopts is a legal parent and can not lose their child unless they demonstrate that they are abusive/neglectful parents. The kid hating them just don't fly. Kids hate their parents all the time for lots of reasons, are we to start demanding that every child who does be removed from his or her home?\n \n \nLet the kid decide if he wants to live with 2 fags and get joked on by everyone at his school.\n\n \n He is probably gonna get teased anyway. Kids are like that. \n \n Not to mention refusing gays people the right to adopt just so small minded people can have the freedom to be cruel is a pretty sad set of priorities.\n \n \nAnd that he will never have a brother or sister because his dad is a homo.\n\n \n Actually, you know, gay people can adopt multiple children, or may have more than one child from a previous relationship - and not only that some kids with straight parents will never have siblings either! Like me, I have my tubes tied and only have one child. \n \n \nThey should set off a little island where all the gays can go and have their gay sex. Then we can confine most of the AIDs spread to that place.\n\n \n Well then - should the lesbians confine all us straights to an island since we spread AIDS and STDs more than them?\n \n Or maybe we should just work on encouraging safe sex?",
