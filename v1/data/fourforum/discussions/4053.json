I can sleep on a problem and eventually A solution will come to me. Sometimes I get that smack on the head \"aha\" moment and everything clears up.

Nah.\n \n \n But this now takes me to faith healing.\n \n \n This is basically prayer that is supposed to have immediate and profound effects on the recipient. Not only is there alot of squinting, but there is usually gibberish (tongues) and most definitely hand laying, as if the preacher's hands were mighty conduits of God's power.

   "What's wrong with 'it'?\n Surely it can't be a boy or a girl in any sense we know the terms, so 'it' seems to be more accurate.\n\n Logically I concede - but begrudgingly.\n \nI intend to learn. Learning (to me) and conforming are 2 different things.\n\n I see. So, no matter what I say you're not going to take it seriously for by doing so you place yourself into position to change. Right? God forbid, P.\n \nOk, but I can't imagine an almighty god who has an attention span the way a human might.\n\n Get off that kick, P. I said nothing about anyone but showoffs thinking they need to get His attention.\n \nSo God has \"talked back\" to you?\n When did this happen and how were you sure of it?\n\n Of course He has. I believe that if someone has not tried a belief system and utilized its instruction, then they should move on down the line to another that can.\n It happens each day. I know it's Him because He has given me discernment.\n \nThen why does it seem that to some people it does.\n They seem to think that holding both palms in the air helps.\n Some think that speaking in gibberish does the trick.\n If how one prays doesn't matter, then why all this then?\n If it's necessary at all, why not just think something?\n God should be able to know what your intentions are.\n\n I can't tell you why people pray and/or worship/praise God the way they do. It's a position they take when they are talking to God.\n And as far as \"thinking\"? It is necessary sometimes to pray in the spirit, which is a form of \"thinking\".\n \nThat's funny. An almighty god with esteem problems.\n Does he just have a lack of confidence?\n Maybe he should start praying.\n\n Very funny, P. Side gone.\n \nI don't mean to be offensive, but give me a break.\n If there is a god out there (in here?) then I seriously doubt it cares what I say about it.\n It could have designed me personally, but it hasn't given me any indication as to why I shouldn't speak of it jokingly. \n Hell, it may like that most of all.\n\n Again, I concede. I have no right telling you how to speak.\n \n I can say this: He does care and it matters to Him what you say to Him and about Him.\n \nApparently not, since it needs someone to boost its confidence.\n It really should look into Dianetics.\n\n I believe He needs to be confident that we love Him. How better to show that love than tell Him, and through our actions?\n \nYou're right. Like blowing on the dice while rubbing your rabbit's foot, it can't hurt.\n\n Prayer is not a form of superstition. It is merely a talk with God.\n \n I do think that blowing on dice helps boost moral, though. So, no, it can't hurt. But, just don't get involved with rituals such as that when conversing with God. There's enough of that going around - like a virus.\n \nWhat form did that advice take?\n\n Peace of mind. Help from places never imagined. Extraordinary events that help straighten out a crooked life. It depends on what that person prays for. Ultimately it depends on that person's relationship to God.\n \n Let me explain. God is always ready to pour out His blessings on us. It is the person that needs to get into position to receive that/those blessing(s).\n \nWhat about \"laying hands\"? That seems to be a popular posture, especially for faith healers.\n\n God still touches us physically. He still heals. He still gives us the ability to heal through Him, through prayer and the laying on of hands.\n \nI'd really like to know how much stock people really put in certain faith healing.\n\n Without faith it is impossible to do anything according to God's will, especially when fear and doubt capture our lives.\n \n My wife gets a monthly magazine that almost always talks about the healing power of prayer. She's a nurse, the mag is for nurses, about nurses and what they see. There is something to \"certain faith healing\".",

If I knew, I'd change now.\n\n I just took it that with all the carpet-peeing and such you considered Christians as clowns. If not, I apologize.\n And, we change when we don't see it fit, or even see it coming.\n I think change has its pathways, its conduits. But, change is not a living thing nor can it be good or evil - it just happens. Sometimes people get angry that something has either slowly crept into or has aggressively impacted their lives that they begin to point fingers without considering what that change may bring. Sometimes what one person says to another might just be that gradual slither or that exploding asteroid that forever changes their life.\n I don't know how old you are and I won't pry, but at one very long period in my life I would have rather been damned than change and rebelled with each blow of it.\n Really, P, I might just have to change due to something you say. Words are very powerful - good or bad. You're right. Who can tell?\n \nHmm, you know for sure that it's God because you know for sure that god gave you discernment. \n (which I take to mean the ability to tell that it's god)\n So you're sure that you have this trait to tell if god is talking to you,\n and you're sure that it's god that gave it to you.\n \n And you are sure that it's not the evil one toying with your mind.\n\n There is as much difference between God and the evil one as in night and day. But, there was once a time, when I first accepted the Truth, that I really couldn't tell. That was when I realized what He meant when He said that we needed discernment. And that sensitivity was meant to be applied spiritually. Evil spirits are not always mean and full of cruelty. They are sometimes like a clingy aggravation, but not enough to annoy you. You can get used to them and allow them to hang around for a while. It's those types that are the hardest to tell from good and evil. Like a burglar that sands his fingertips before cracking a safe, we must always keep our spirits keen to that.\n \nI'm not sure what you are talking about in the second sentence, but I've tried the Christian belief system (I think).

I know that doesn't mean that I actually believed, but I'm sure I tried, especially when I was younger.\n\n So did I and found it frustrating and a waste of time. But, I really never tried it; tested it. There are some things that are worth testing before accepting. Getting prepared for that test is often the hardest part.\n \nBut is it necessary to pray aloud at all?\n\n Yes, but only for our natural selves, which we cannot deny all the time. For groups who are of one mind. For encouragement.\n \nIf god is all-powerful he/she/it already knows how much we love him/her/it.\n I think prayer, if anything, is more of a reminder to the person.\n\n Yes, in some ways, you're right. Good point.\n \nI'll just have to take your word on that.\n\n Fair enough.\n \nThat's really what I'm talking about. It's not prayer so to speak, even though, to me it's a ritual itself, but the rituals that people associate with it.\n\n That's right. For example: Matthew 6 verse 1 -Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. and verse 5 - And when you pray, you are not to be as the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners, in order to be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.\n The \"prayer-for-show\" that some folks do is for nothing - even worse.\n \nI like to think that I'm always in position.\n I guess someone who prays likes to think the same.\n\n It's hard sometimes when we face what we believe to be insurmountable tasks daily. I know some do face them and some don't, but there's always some sort of wall that either we build or is placed there by someone or something else that we tend to want to go around instead of through. It's those times that we get out of place - the times we need to be steadfast most of all.\n \nPhysically? It must be a light touch because I've never felt it.\n\n Yes.\n I can say personally that I have felt it and one of my sons. It's not as simple as taking a dose of aspirin, but if it's hard, it's because of our lack of faith, not because God shook his head.\n \nSo you believe in faith healing?\n I can understand a belief in the healing power of faith or that God heals people, \n but laying hands on people is just theater.\n\n I believe what the Bible says and it says so. I not only believe in God, but I believe what He said.\n \n All \"laying on of hands\" is not for show. It seems that way when you see a preacher pick up a rattlesnake, chant, then slap a person on the forehead. Or in another church see someone jump up, scream something, run to the pulpit and get zonked by a raving madman. But, it has its place and it's not something one should play with or put on display like so many religions need in order to function.\n \nFear and doubt are separate things. \n One can doubt everything while fearing nothing.\n Faith and fear are also separate things.\n One can have total faith in God, but fear everything, even God.\n\n In this case they go hand-in-hand. That one frame of mind can devastate the soul so much that a person can lose all that he has gained in a split second. This type of fear is not that of reverence, it is of pure, unadulterated horror. This kind of doubt rips a person from the presence of God with disbelief and skepticism.\n Jesus tells us to \"be not afraid\" and to believe. Fear and doubt is one of the most powerful tools used today by the powers of darkness.\n \nI know, the 700 Club has at least one story per show about faith healing.\n It's a common theme in Christian media.\n There is usually some disease that everyone thought was incurable, but it went into remission. \n While I'd call that a miracle, that doesn't mean that prayer or faith had anything to do with it.\n No one knows how it happened at all, but they just say that they prayed and prayed and it went into remission.\n They never talk about the stories where people prayed and prayed and the patient still died.\n And they didn't mention the phase of the moon.\n\n That magazine was not Christian media.

Seems like it would be the other way around, huh? I'm a member of a huge truck forum where all you hear is what's wrong with a truck and very seldom what's right with it.\n But, dying we will die and living we will live. That one statement is so powerful yet so misunderstood. If we have the heart of the dying, yet we live, we die; if we have the heart of the living, yet we are at death's door, we live.\n Who are we to say that God don't know what's best? If we understand His ways we will know what to pray for - even though it looks like it ought to be the opposite of what we're asking/talking about.\n I was in a stupor after thinking that God would spare the life of my young sister and she died anyway. I had to fight off fear and doubt for awhile, myself. My mother, on the other hand, succumbed to it and has yet to get over it. She's now in a fight for her life. That's why a person should always stay very close to God in prayer each day, without ceasing.\n \n \n No comment on the moon or Star Trek thing. :)",

There are some things that are worth\n testing before accepting. Getting prepared for that test is often the hardest\n part.\n\n Well, when I say tried, I mean that I followed all the advice and I read all the\n stuff in the Bible that I thought I should, and when it came time for me to\n \"talk to the holy spirit\" or whatever, there were these guys trying to coach me\n into speaking in tongues.

Maybe some of these televangelists need to take that to heart.\n But, then, that's where the big bucks are.\n \nYes.\n I can say personally that I have felt it and one of my sons. It's not as simple\n as taking a dose of aspirin, but if it's hard, it's because of our lack of\n faith, not because God shook his head.\n\n The power of suggestion is great.\n And here we go with god's body parts again. ;)\n I really have a tough time believing that god would have a body, or at least a\n body he goes by, if you will. \"In our image\" to me means more like \"with\n thoughts and a will\" less than \"with feet and hair.\"\n \n \nAll \"laying on of hands\" is not for show. It seems that way when you see\n a preacher pick up a rattlesnake, chant, then slap a person on the forehead.

It was led by this kinda nutty guy. I never\n realized how nutty until the day we (6-7 kids and the him) performed an\n exorcism on this 17 yo guy. We all layed hands on him and said prayers aloud,\n but he still kicked around saying \"devil\" type things. The leader would read the\n bible and that would make him scream and then he would blow on him untill he\n stopped. At 12 I couldn't decide if I was convinced by this stuff or not. IT was\n still pretty freaky (maybe the guy was a really good actor) and so it kept me up\n a few nights. Looking back on it, I feel silly for ever letting it scare me.\n \n \n \nIn this case they go hand-in-hand. That one frame of mind can devastate\n the soul so much that a person can lose all that he has gained in a split\n second.

Fear and doubt is one of the\n most powerful tools used today by the powers of darkness.\n\n I'd say fear and doubt are first and second tools of the church.\n You must first be made afraid of hell, and then you must doubt your own worth\n and abilities as well as logic, and then you are ready to be one of the flock.\n Now, you don't trust yourself so much and you need the idea of god as a crutch.\n (by you I don't mean you)\n \n \nThat magazine was not Christian media. And some people do know how that\n miracle occurred.\n\n I forgot about what magazine it was anyway.\n \n \nI know what you mean about never talking about how many times a person prays for a sick or dying person to live and they die anyway.\n\n Yeah, but I'm talking more about those people that I prayed would die and they lived anyway.

I'm a member of a huge truck forum where all you hear is what's wrong with a truck and very seldom what's right with it.\n\n Well, if everything is going right, what's the sense in bitching about it?\n \n \nBut, dying we will die and living we will live. That one statement is so powerful yet so misunderstood. If we have the heart of the dying, yet we live, we die; if we have the heart of the living, yet we are at death's door, we live.\n\n I'm not sure what you mean by the heart of the living or dying, but I agree that you live if you are going to live and you die if you are going to die, prayer or not.\n \n\n Who are we to say that God don't know what's best? If we understand His ways we will know what to pray for - even though it looks like it ought to be the opposite of what we're asking/talking about.\n\n You got it. Who are we to say what god knows or what his will is (what's best). We can pray and pray, but that will not change his will.\n \n \nI was in a stupor after thinking that God would spare the life of my young sister and she died anyway. I had to fight off fear and doubt for awhile, myself. My mother, on the other hand, succumbed to it and has yet to get over it. She's now in a fight for her life. That's why a person should always stay very close to God in prayer each day, without ceasing\n.\n I'm very sorry for the loss of your sister.\n I'm sure that was a terrible experience.\n Events like that in our lives shouldn't be what shapes our beliefs.\n They are traumatic, yes, and we have to get through them.\n I sincerely hope your mother pulls through, also. \n I don't like the thought of anyone suffering.\n \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nYou missed the entire point. I don't simply pray to God. It is not one sided. It is a relationship. That is the nature of things. You want to say that because he is all knowing and all powerful (omniscient and omnipotent) that there is no need for a relationship. \n\n Sorry for doing like this. In reading through the thread again. I realized I didn't even address the first part here, Sorry.\n \n I never said that just because something is omnipotent that there is no need for a relationship with it. I personally have no clue if a relationship is necessary. But, because the being is omnipotent, I am saying that prayer is not necessary for a relationship.\n \n The omnipotence takes care of everything.",
