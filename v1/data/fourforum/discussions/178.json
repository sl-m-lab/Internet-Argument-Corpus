   "The amount of energy needed to split an atom into its components is called the nuclear binding energy. When a nuclear reaction takes place matter is converted into heat energy, therefore it is an exothermic reaction. Einstein's mass-energy equivalence relationship allows for the resulting energy of such a reaction to be calculated theoretically. This equation is written as: \n \n del(E) = del(m)*c^2 \n \n change in energy = energy of products - energy of reactants \n \n change in mass = mass of product - mass of reactants \n \n -a negative energy value means energy is given off to the surroundings \n -if the mass is negative then energy is released to the surroundings \n \n This calculation allows us to obtain a rating of the amount of energy stored in the nucleus of an atom. Since all atoms have a different atomic mass, they each have a unique value. It is common to use the units (J/nucleon) to represent this value. \n \n These theoretical values have been tested by experimentation, and have never been proven to be wrong, quite the contrary. This formula has held up remarkabley well according to the purpose it is used for, which I mentioned above. \n \n Science works in this respect. The theoretical scientist comes up with models that work well mathematically on paper. Then the experimentalist tests those theories in the lab. Sometimes the results are expected. Sometimes they are unexpected and old views must be revised in order to explain why or why not. \n \n Even if the speed of light is changing slowly over time, for now Einstein's model works well for its purposes, and their exists no reason to scrap it at this juncture. Of course, the scientist who has discovered the new revelation that light speed can vary wants to claim that he has disproved one of Einstein's theories. Every scientist would like to make that claim. But I think Einstein and many others have already predicted the result that light varies. All this new revelation does is confirm previous conceptions held by many physicists about the nature of the universe.",

   "You can find Einstein's mass-energy equivalence relationship in a variety of text books. It's considered to be common knowledge. Even people who don't know the meaning or significance behind this equation often quote it. I happen to know it because I know a little bit about chemistry. Because somebody actually knows what it means, you accuse them of copying it. This assumption not only demonstrates your ignorance, but it also makes you look spiteful of people who know more than you. I never claimed to be the first person to discover this relationship. I simply gave an explanation of what it entails. Years of education in chemistry, mathematics, thermodynamics, physics, and engineering should show some payoff. Excuse me if I happen to be getting the education that I am paying for.

   "Science is always debatable. Besides, when I first got here, the science forum was a little too baron for my taste. I moved many of my works from the communist website over to this one. This specific post was an answer to someone who claimed that the slowing of light speed refuted Einstein's famous E = mc^2 equation. I posted this thread to show that it had not been debunked, and to demonstrate its actual purpose, which is to predict the amount of energy given off in nuclear reactions. I am sorry if you were intimidated by my greatness. You are the first person who has complained, even out of all the commie bastards I use to debate. Generally, people like to learn new things or reinforce what they already know. Personally, I don't think you like me because I called you ignorant for claiming that black people cause school violence. I wouldn't have said anything, if you hadn't made such a erroneous statement. Are you over this now, or should we continue to fight over ad hominem attacks?\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Side note about Einstein:\n \n Did you know that the FBI kept an extensive file on Einstein? Did you know that he was barred from working on the Manhatten Project, which was the U.S. government's drive to obtain nuclear weaponry during WWII? The reasons for this scrutiny rested in the fact that the man was an avid socialist. That just goes to show you that extreme scientific intelligence does not always carry over into the realm of political science. I often hear communists try to use the fact that Einstein was a socialist to persuade people into believing it is the right ideology. There could be nothing further from the truth.",

   "Sara,\n \n E = m*c^2 \n \n 1)A relationship that pertains to the area of nuclear chemistry.\n \n What's Nuclear Chemistry?\n \n 2)Nuclear Chemistry is the area of chemistry having to do with interactions of an atom's nucleus.\n \n What's a nucleus?\n \n 3)It's the part of the atom that comprises most of the mass of an atom, holding both the positively charged protons and the neutrons of no charge. The negatively charged electrons can be considered to exist in proximity to the nucleus in probability clouds.\n \n 4)Forget about the Bohr model of an atom that you are used to seeing in cartoons like \"The Simpson's\". This is simplification of an atoms' behavior, and only really describes the Hydrogen atom, which usually has only one electron. In order to account for unexpected deviations from the Bohr model, a new field of chemistry and physics was developed to more accurately describe the actual behavior of an atom's electrons.\n \n 5)It was recognized that electrons exhibited both particle and wavelike behavior. The old view that atoms behaved much like our solar system was throw out. This view was replaced by a new mode of thinking. Electron behavior was to be thought of in terms of electron density. Now 3-d models can be plotted using mathematical utilities. Now the model is a messier bloblike figure.\n \n 6)There are a few things that determine the likelihood that electrons will exist in certain areas. Mass of the nucleus, orientation, angular momentum, and spin. The existence of other electrons also plays a role, but we can neglect that since are really only concerned with the nucleus.\n \n Even though we do not care about what is going on outside of the nucleus when discussing nuclear chemistry, these are good things to know. All classes teach the basics of covalent and ionic bonding before they get into nuclear chemistry. An understanding of this material is helpful.\n \n What's covalent bonding?\n \n 7)Covalent bonding has to do with molecular formation and chemical reactions in which atoms shared their outermost electrons.\n \n What's ionic bonding?\n \n 8)Ionic bonding occurs when atoms gain or loose a number of electrons giving them either a positive or negative charge. These bonds are held together purely by electrostatic charge. Imagine the North and South poles on bar magnets. The principle is much the same.\n \n Okay. Now that we have gone through the basics of chemical bonding, don't worry too much about that. It was meant more to give you a basic understanding of some of the ideas involved. When discussing nuclear chemistry, it is necessary to understand the difference between reactions concerning bonding, and reactions concerning the nucleus. They are very different indeed. \n \n Now let's get some ideas about the nature of nuclear chemistry.\n \n There are generally two types.\n \n 1)Fission, which is what we are more familiar with. Homer Simpson works in a fission plant. The splitting of the nucleus i.e., larger nucleus and heavy material has broken apart.\n \n 2)Fusion, which is still under considerable research, and is the fusing of smaller nuclei into larger nuclei. The temperature at which this is done exceeds the surface temperature of the sun. The plasma associated with this type of nuclear reaction is contained in a electromagnetic field (a force field).\n \n Both reaction types yield elements that are further down or up the periodic table, respectively. Elements differing from their reactants are generated.\n -----------------------------\n \n Back to Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.\n \n del(E) = del(m)*c^2 \n \n Here del is equal to delta meaning the change of a state, and it is usually denoted by little triangles. But I didn't have a way to post these characters. Usually the change of a state is given by:\n \n Output - Input = delta of whatever you are looking at\n \n if it is the mass then it becomes\n \n m_out-m_in \n \n \n You can use this equation to calculate the amount of energy stored in a nucleus. Each element has a unique nuclear binding energy. Therefore, when you bombard an atom with nuetrons, you can calculate the difference in the nuclear binding energy of the new products minus the nuclear binding energy of the reactant and calculate the energy associated with that reaction. Given the units:\n \n Joules (measure of energy)/nucleons (number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus)\n \n You can multiply it by the amount of starting material to obtain the energy released by the reaction\n \n Joules/nucleon x (#moles) x (avogadros#) = Joules \n \n Here avogadro's number is used to cancel units leaving the answer expressed only in the units of energy. For these types of reactions the number is rather large. Splitting one mole of uranium-235 yields roughly twice the order of magnitude that a ton of a normal combustible material would give. Hence, this is why nuclear energy is sought after by industrial nations.\n \n In summary,\n \n The nuclear binding energies of the starting and ending materials can be calculated using E = mc^2.\n \n E = nuclear binding energy\n m = mass of the nucleus (look up on periodic table of the elements)\n c = speed of light = 300,000,000 meters per second (this term is squared or multiplied by itself)\n \n From there, we can subtract the E_output - E_input\n \n And then multiply by the amount to get the heat energy produced.\n \n Thus, we can calculate energy contained in a nucleus, and also the energy given off by say a chain reaction. This equation is very useful in the field of nuclear chemistry, and in energy production.\n \n I hope this helps",

   "The energy released in a thermonclear reaction is the strong nuclear force. \n\n \n Energy is not a force. You need to act a force over a distance to get energy in the form of work.

   "Isac Assimov was a physicist and a science fiction writer. This is probably because he felt less bound in the world of fiction than in the stufy religious dogma of science. I can and will discuss the nature of science as a conceptual form that has completely escaped its subjective boundaries if you like. However as a scientist I am quite sure you would prefer me to at least try to stay with in the boundaries of your prediscribed beliefs.\n \n First I find it interesting to be lectured by a scientist or a scientific thinker on cosmology and quantam ect. As a scientist it is your duty to tell me the ignoramous that you have No universal laws. Every where such order and not one simple easy law applies to everything in the same said ordered universe. This is due to your programming. Science as a thought form has striped you of the power to think independently and now you conform your thoughts to that of the prediscribed herd. Most unfortunate. Not one law, with such order, most unfortunate.\n \n Matter is the center of a defineable field with in the space time continume. The curvature of space and dialation of time around matter with in the continume is infanite mathmaticaly speaking. Curvature and dialation occur at an inverse square proportional from the said matter. In verse square meaning the field becomes undetectable in reality yet mathmaticaly the effect is still there any where in the universe. Now as to which causes which is a very much chicken or egg thing and that is an entirely different discussion. I will say the chicken is the egg. Time space is not empty. It is what we understand to be a field. This field of course is energy. Now matter has order. It remembers what it is it follows universal laws. Of course temporal laws are acting always creating entropy. Yet matter in time only becomes more and more ordered. It as matter is gaining energy in the form of time and space. We notice this at our level as gravity. When your pen falls apon your desk, it is not some fanciful cenetic energy which is magicaly stored up in relationship to its point with in the said field. Quite simply when the pen falls on the desk the time and space between the two disapears. This is called curvature of space and dialation of time.\n \n When the nucleaus is split a force is released. This is the strong or weak nuclear force. I can not be bothered looking it up it has been 7 years since I studied physics so you can do it for me seeing as though your a scientist, Names definitons to me don't mean ****. Pure thought is my God. Any way one force enables the individual particals to exsist in the first place, the other binds protons and nutrons. It is this atractive force that is released in a crititical mass. Any way all of these fields all for of them are temporal manifestations of the very same force.\n \n In the words of Eienstien energy and matter are a condenstations of a unified field of energy. Unified Field Theory was proven correct in the philidelphia experiments in 1943. So you are free to believe what you are like. However it is incorect to hoist your Newtonian beliefs on others. These old scientific concepts which sound more like mytholigy to me. At least science fiction is the future or the present which has not been made known. Assimov was a very good physcisist. If he felt his greatest work could only be done outside of physics this should ring alarm bells.\n \n Master Lao Tzu was one of the greatest minds of all time. He created Taoism. Taoism was one of the greatest thought forms of all time. It degenerated through coruption into ritualisation and dogma. As a scientist this should sound very farmiliar. I am a labourer. I work with my hands. My mind is free and uncontaminated by your power structure. This is why I am smarter than you. Your conceptualization is not subject to reatlity. Mine is.\n \n Scientist, not the mylitary, scientists not politicians, scientist not the ignorant masses created weapons of mass distruction. You gave them to George Bush, oh dear. I am not suprised you occupy a fictional reality.",

   "The Tao gives birth to the singularity. The singularity creates positive and negative temporal reality. As a consious form we exsist in one half or reality this being positve temoral reality the land of entropy. Now these two lands are linked by singularites and the universal field. Singularities being the discharging of energy, and fields (EM Field, Light) being the condensation of energy back into this positve reality. This occurs through the laws of temporal mechanics. Pure energy (light-fields) opperate at zero time ergo negating temporal laws. Pure energy is free to flow between entropy and antientroy. It is the movement of energy in and out of positive temporal reality that creates the illusion of the real.\n \n The nuclear fields create the constitunt particles and bind them together. This energy becomes manifest as thermol energy (movement-vibration). Now of course this energy is not created, it comes from somewhere. We can witness the extraction of energy by matter from its environment through the defineable effects of the curvature of space and dilation of time. The Unified field is time space itself. Only when energy leaks through the central distortion of matter do we witness this thermol energy. We know this energy can not be created, this the first law of thermol dynamics. Yet matter produces all this energy, so it is bloody common sence. Scientists need a common labourer to explain the nature of reality because they have created a fictional reality for themselves not at all subject to reality.\n \n Locked in Fiction scientists create more and more complexity and loose themselves in the abstract of mathmatics the resultant of which is mental illness. The most notable manifestation of this mental illness being the creation of weapons of mass distruction. Inorder to create such weapons one must be defined as a sociopath.\n \n And so matter is energy. A field is energy. Time space is THE FIELD. And singularites are Energy. It is the relationship between these defineable forms of energy that constitutes reality. All energy caries a code. Infanite codes being infanite frequencies of vibration. These Vibrations being the relese of thermol energy as everything is interlinked.\n \n No I am not trying to discribe Unified Field Theory I am discribing it.\n \n The thrust of this theory was a string of sixteen incredibly complex quantities represented by an advanced type of mathmatical shorthand known as tensor equations, ten combinations of which represented gravitation and the remaining six electromagnetism.",
