   "Sure I did. I retired 30 yrs earlier than most people. I now have the majority of my life to do whatever I wish. I have bought all the free time in the world. \n \n Even the idea that you cannot extend your life due to wealth in incorrect. Your life expectancy increases with your income bracket. Look it up. Didn't you ever wonder how guys like Warren Buffet, Allan Greenspan, Dick Cheney, etc... manage to be out white water rafting, and hunting, and running huge companies well into their 70's and 80's (and sometimes even 90's)? They are getting better medical care than your HMO is willing to pop for. \n \n I still disagree..you didn't \"buy\" any more years on your life. You may think you can live longer by paying for medical care but who is to say you would have died prior to that? Your time here will end at a point....no matter what you do, that will be it. I guess you could say you try to extend the time you are here.\n \n \n\n This is a lie that poor people and the middle class tells themselves. The vast majority of wealthy people I have known who are unsatisfied are suffering from boredom. Right now I am bored and unsatsfied. I am thinking of taking up hovercraft racing. I have a design that I think will just dominate the field. \n \n Have fun, you will still be unsatisfied.\n \n \n\n You are missing the point. You work 80 hours per week until you have accumulated enough wealth, then you flip the corporate world the bird and wander off to do whatever the hell you want. By then you should have established enough wealth and expertise that you can simply put your holdings in autonomous investments and cash the checks every 6 months, or at least give them minimal attention.\n \n The other thing that you are missing is that nmost people who work 80+ hours per week do so because they love the game. \n \n Personally the only thing I miss about working is working. I LOVE the game. Nothing is more exciting. Your net worth is just a score card and insurance that your kids will have a chance to play. \n \n I used to have the \"neglecting the family\" argument with my idiot brother in law. He is a teacher and never has any money. He goes home form work and does things like cut the grass, paint the house, chore type things, then sits on his butt and watches football because by the time he gets done working and done with all the honeydo XXXX, he is tired. His kids play in the play room alone. \n \n Even when I would work long hours (often I had the kids at the office with me, but that is another argument), I would spend more time with my kids than he did. I would be at the office later, but then come home and watch dora or have tea parties or whatever becuause while I was at work, somebody else painted the house, mowed the lawn, did all the chores and honeydo's. \n \n While there are certainly those who neglect their families, theya re the minority and either do not like their fmailies all that much, or are playign out of their league.\n \n Face it. Life is better with money.\n haha, a sad way to live...\n Whatever man. The problems you see are only to be blamed on people like you.\n \n \nI'm not sure doing more stuff necessarily equates to happiness. I have very little money at the moment (full time student) but I'm pretty happy. When I'm stuck for paying the bills then I sometimes feel a bit down, but most of the things I enjoy don't cost me much. Sure there are things I would like to do that cost more money, but I wouldn't necessarily feel happier for having done those things rather than something else that was cheaper.\n yeah, if money drives you than not having it will surely make you sad. \n \n I don't understand why people value greed....which is what you are doing here. It should come as no surprise why things happen the way they do. \"Oh my! Bush is helping his greedy oil buddies\" ...blah, what do you care? You encourage it.",

He says in order to cut trade deficits to the level external debts/GDP ratio does not increase, Dlr might need to fall 30-40% according to an estimate, and introduces the fact Dlr lost 40% of its value in the 1980's when US c/a deficits/GDP ratio was smaller. He sees China can accept Yuan strength once it can prevent spec funds inflow, and stresses Jpn should not intervene to avoid US's conservatism. He says US econ would slowdown if savings rate rise and trade deficits stay unchanged. Note there have been rumors recently he would succeed Snow. \n\n \n Personally, I don't think it is likely that we will be able to revalue the dollar 30-40% without crashing it. Central banks have made it pretty clear that they are not going to sit idly by holding our dollars while we devalue their currency reserves by 40%. If we see a massive dollar sell off, which is not out of the question, a 40% revaluation would quickly become a 60-70% devaluation.\n \n Show of hands (or at least somethign for people to think about), how many here can continue their lifestyle making 30-40% less?",

You see a couple thousand acres of land flattened with no tree left for miles....you then see the homes being built in about 2-3 months with the only difference being the garage is on the opposite side for every other house...every now and then you will see one with a shiny copper top doorway roof. After the homes are built, it is time to put in the fake pond and have the neighbors come out for a cookout as they show off their 2005 mid-life crisis mobile. The best part is you are never alone! Miss you neighbor? Look out the side window...he can see him about 4 feet away changing in his house. \n \n So what is the downside to burying someone in a McMansion again?",

Take a look at http://www.nps.gov/tapr/VirtualTour/VTmansion.htm\n \n that is the tallgrass prairie preserve about 20 miles from here, and it is actually the old ranch house there that prompted me to go with limestone block.

My wife decided either last year or the year before that she wantes a korean garden (korean style anyway). We go that done, then she wated a wall around it, so I had a limestone wall put in around 8 acres. The wall actually joins the house and is about 8\" tall. The front part (the part you see looking at the house) is limestone block. Then we switched to an old english type (rough stone) wall because it is cheaper, if not as astehtically pleasing, as the block (IMO). \n \n The guesthouse is in the garden and is also old english style limestone construction. The wife wanted block, but I thought that block was too expensive for a guest house.\n \n This is the flint hills, and is pretty much where limestone comes from. There are quarries all over the place and I can actually get limestone block (FOB) cheaper than brick. Rough limestone is literally free, but you need a better mason to install it to keep it from cracking. The wall around the garden was actually cheaper to do in limestone than it would have been to do a wrought iron fence and I think it looks much better.",
