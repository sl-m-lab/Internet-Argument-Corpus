   "We also see evidences supporting evolution all over the place in embryology.\n \n Does the human heart develop into its normal four-chambered, looped form before it's functional in the embryo? No. In fact, it starts off as a small, single straight tube that pumps blood by peristalsis: like many lower organisms' hearts do in their adult form. But the human heart does not stop at this evolutionarily primitive state: it continues to develop into an S-shaped organ then loops, while the chambers expand and divide to form two atria and two ventricles: all of this complex reorganization occurs while the heart maintains function. One can easily visualize this as a simple heart of lower, ancestral forms being retained in the higher organism, but being modified to form a more complex system during development.\n \n And the earlier formation of the heart from the cardiac primorida is conserved across higher vertebrates. It's not like our initial heart tube forms by one method from one set of tissues, and a chick's initial heart forms differently, and the mouse's initial heart forms yet a third way. No, they all form is the same general manner from the same general tissues, and, much of these processes are controlled by the same genes.\n \n Also, humans form 6 pairs of aortic arches during development, just like fish do. However, in humans, nearly all of them just quickly degenerate, and are replaced by the 'correct' human arrangment. Further, the aortic-arch arrangment is not a physical or physiological requirement for the human embryo. So (as if the secret wasn't already given away), is there any good reason why human embryos would take this indirect and unnecessary path to forming this part of our circulatory system? Yes, because our embryonic aortic arches are a carry over from simpler organisms we evolved from.\n \n \n\"Six pairs of these aortic arches loop over the pharynx. In primitive fish, these arches persist and enable the gills to oxygenate the blood. In adult birds and mammals, in which lungs oxygenate the blood, such a system makes little sense - but all six pairs of aortic arches are formed in mammalian and avian embryos before the system eventually becomes simplified into a single aortic arch. Thus, even though our physiology does not require such a structure, our embryonic condition reflects our evolutionary history.\" (Developmental Biology: Seventh Edition, Scott F. Gilbert, Sinauer Associates Inc., 2003, p500) \n\n \n Another characteristic in this same general area that ties us back to fish is the development of our parathyroid glands - which are very similar to gill buds in fish - from a particular pharyngeal arch: the same one that in fish gives rise to the gill buds!\n \n Moving on to the kidneys for a minute. The human embryo forms not one, but 3 successive kidneys: the pronephric, mesonephric, and metanephric kidneys. Only that last one persists and only it is the kidney you and I and all of our fellow humans use. Why do human embryos go through two transient and simpler kidneys before getting it right? Here's a hint: the other two are carry overs from simpler organisms! The evolutionarily simplest vertebrates, such as hagfish and teleost fish, develop only the pronephric kidney: it is their adult functional kidney. Now move up an evolutionary notch to (other) fish and amphibians. In their embryos, the first kidney still develops, but soon begins to degenerate and is replaced by the mesonephric kidney, which is the functional adult kidney in these organisms. Now move up another evolutionary notch, to reptiles, birds, and mammals. Their embryos form the first kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the second kidney, which then degenerates and is replaced by the final, metanephric kidney: their adult functional kidney.\n \n The above is not anywhere near a complete list of embryological evidences for common descent/evolution.\n \n PS: Note the serial addition of developmental stages that occurs in kidneys as one moves up to higher evolutionary levels: \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\". Of course this \"law\" does not hold for all organs/organ systems in all organisms, but it does hold for a few cases. And that's enough to clearly indicate evolution of those organ systems by their being retained from ancestors and then modified during embryonic development.",

   "DamEtel wrote:\n We also see evidences supporting evolution all over the place in embryology.\n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n Your recap of evidence from vertebrate embryology was well written. It even gets more interesting when you combine this with evidence from other disciplines. My favorite example is the evolution of the mammalian jaw joint, where the two bones of the original reptilian jaw joint were exapted for use as middle ear bones. This is recapitulated in the embryonic development of some mammals, as well as being seen in the fossil record.\n \n Another example of congruity between different disciplines can be seen with human evolution. The fossil record is excellent for hominid evolution, going back some 4 million years to early Australopithecine species. This fits well with the estimates from DNA studies that put a common ancestor for humans & chimps at @ 6 million years ago. Other genetic evidence further confirms this, such as the occurance of identical ERVs (Endogenous Retro-Viruses) in the genomes of both humans & chimps along with evidence for one of our chromosomes being the result of two ape chromosomes united end-to-end. Add to this the studies done on primate behavior showing a remarkable similarity between us & chimps with respect to facial expressions and nonverbal gestures. Finally, the biogeographical evidence shows our ancestors coming only from Africa, where our closest relatives live (rather than the Americas or Asia).\n \n The strength of evolution as a comprehensive theory in biology comes from this fact. Every subdiscipline in biology fits into the same big picture - a situation that would hardly be expected to occur by chance. Creationists like to limit their challenge against evolution to arguments that deal with only one aspect of or discipline in biology at a time. They can't dismiss how it all fits together.",

   "My question is why a prototype species should evolve in two or more different directions while occupying the same geographical territory.\nCould be a number of reasons. To take advantage of a new food source, to escape predation are a couple that come immediately to mind. Perhaps, the two species actually arose in separate allopatric populations of a parent species and both later came to occupy the same range. This has been observed, but it might resemble sympatric speciation. For whatever reasons, it isn't unreasonable that sympatric speciation can occur by the development of genetic differences, anything that would tend to reproductively isolate the genetic differences. For example, the apple maggot fly is obviously descended from the hawthorn maggot fly, but they do not interbreed since their mating is timed to the reproductive cycle of the specific fruit. Since the fruits flower at different times, the specific pests mate ad different times, thus, they are reproductively isolated.\n \nI am making the assumption that a population that can breed together will breed together, with the result that the population gene pool will tend to evolve in the same general way in response to any external influence (more or less rainfall, warming or cooling), but that seems to me to be a reasonable assumption.\nGenerally true. Gene flow prevents barriers to interbreeding from arising. However, speciation in plants by polyploidy isn't all that rare. Generally, models of sympatric speciation postulate disruptive selection, where certain homozygous genotypes have high fitness on one or the other of two resources. That is the case of the maggot flies that I mentioned above. The preference for one or the other of the fruits erected a barrier to mating. Thus, hybrids wich prefer neither fruit are actually at a disadvantage. Other well known examples are also insects. For example, Enchenopa binotata (Treehopper) is actually 6 sibling species. Each is restricted to mating on a different host plant. Genetic studies of the maggot flies mentioned above reveal that there are recognized genetic differences between the species at several loci. Nevertheless, most speciation is allopatric.\n \nIf you have any arguments or examples to the contrary, I would certainly like to hear them.\nBecause we have observed otherwise? Not an argument, just an observation. You are coming to an overreaching conclusion that is not warranted by the facts. It might not happen often, but it does happen.\n \nAgreed with your argument that evolution does not explain why different species arise from any given population in a given territory.\nYou're being disengenuous. Evolution explains the mechanisms that cause evolution. The why are specific to the speciation event. Like I explained, adaptation to a new food source causing the eventual reproductive isolation of a subpopulation.\n \nI think you misread my posts. I have not reached a conclusion for the appearance of different species, and I remain agnostic on the issue. Your insults are misdirected.\nThen you aren't being clear because it seems that everyone misread your posts. You certainly seemed to be claiming that speciation was impossible.\n \n For example, earlier you asserted that Darwin's finches were actually all one species because two or three have been observed to interbreed. When explained to you, you said:\n \nOkay, but the usual definition of different species is that either they are mutually sterile, or else that their offspring are. How do YOU define species?\nThat's not the definition of species. Even though there are several, yours isn't one. The definition used in biology is the biological species concept - it's easy to find if you are motivated to educate yourself before speaking.\n \nA reproductively isolated population of of organisms that are capable of interbreeding in their natural habitat.\nThus, brown bears and polar bears are different species, as are lions and tigers, even though they can and will interbreed and produce fertile offspring if given the chance.",

It would help me if you clarified by stating you contention clearly (I think it has gotten blurred in the exchange) and giving the name of a scientist who has written in support of that contention.\nI repost the excerpt from the link. Please note the bolded second paragraph.\nSympatric speciation refers to the formation of two or more descendant species from a single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic location.\n \n Some evolutionary biologists don't believe that it ever occurs. They feel that interbreeding would soon eliminate any genetic differences that might appear.\n \n But there is some compelling (albeit indirect) evidence that sympatric speciation can occur.\nI am not making a contention regarding evolution. I am merely pointing out what appears to me to be a leap of faith in the assumptions of those who believe that evolution explains all of the diversity of life on this planet. DamEtel (in post #13) accepts \"Why not?\" as sufficient to prove the assumptions, but I do not.\n \n \nGenerally true. Gene flow prevents barriers to interbreeding from arising. However, speciation in plants by polyploidy isn't all that rare.

Each is restricted to mating on a different host plant. Genetic studies of the maggot flies mentioned above reveal that there are recognized genetic differences between the species at several loci. Nevertheless, most speciation is allopatric.\nI take your point, but...\n \n I don't have a problem with the idea of species mutating to adapt to their environment, and I think I've made it clear that I accept that a long period of geographical isolation could very well result in several new species being descended from a single proto-species. There are plants, like redwood trees, that can flourish over a wide area in one geological epoch and diminish to a very limited range in another epoch. Likewise, animal life that depends on a particular plant species will see its range expand and shrink with the plant in question. There are mountains in Nevada that are essentially islands of habitation in a sea of desert, and the small mammals that inhabit each mountain could perhaps eventually diverge into separate species.\n \n My problem is envisioning a scenario where the same patch of rainforest (Congo or Brazil) could become home to such a wide variety of monkeys, or a patch of grazing land (Serengeti or North American plains) could become home to such a wide variety of grazing animals - animals that can migrate vast distances.\n \n \nBecause we have observed otherwise? Not an argument, just an observation. You are coming to an overreaching conclusion that is not warranted by the facts. It might not happen often, but it does happen.\nI repeat, I am not coming to any conclusion at all. I merely question whether an unobserved occurrence qualifies as established science rather than a theory.\n \n \nYou're being disengenuous. Evolution explains the mechanisms that cause evolution. The why are specific to the speciation event. Like I explained, adaptation to a new food source causing the eventual reproductive isolation of a subpopulation.\nDisagreed that I'm being disingenuous. I'm merely asking for a scenario that would explain the multiplicity of monkeys and gazelles occupying the same habitat.\n \n \nThat's not the definition of species. Even though there are several, yours isn't one. The definition used in biology is the biological species concept - it's easy to find if you are motivated to educate yourself before speaking.\nYou're sidestepping my question. From this link:\n \nBefore commenting on cases of speciation (one species turning into another species) it is first essential to define what constitutes a species. In biology there is a strong definition and a weak definition.\n \n The strong definition (proposed by Dobzhansky) is, \"That stage of evolutionary progress at which the once actually or potentially interbreeding array of forms becomes segregated into two or more arrays which are physiologically incapable of interbreeding.\" \n \n The weak definition (proposed by Ernst Mayr) is, \"Groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.\"\n \n Notice that the strong definition is strong because it makes it unambiguously clear that one species cannot breed with another. The weak definition is weak because it does not spell out the meaning of \"reproductively isolated\". Does it mean \"the two groups might mate if they had the chance but unfortunately are on opposites sides of the lake without a rowing boat\"?\nIf you are using a different definition, I'd like to see a link to it.",

Others aren't even found in the same habitat with these two or with each other. And I don't know that Grant's gazelle and Thompson's gazelle speciated from a single parent species where they are located now. I suspect that they migrated to their present habitat as the environment changed. Perhaps you can tell me what information you have that leads you to believe that they speciated is a single location.\n \nIf you are using a different definition, I'd like to see a link to it.\nI gave you the biological species definition used by biologists. Why would some link on the web know any more than I do? Should I give you a link to my last post? Will that help?\n \n Futuyma, in the third edition of Evolutionary Biology gives the following:\n \nthe members of a group of populations that interbreed or potentially interbreed with other under natural conditions.\n Dr. Futuyma goes on to say that the concept is complex and that the fundamental taxomonic category may not always correspond the the biological species concept. The definition has been used by biologists since the 1930s.\n \n Of course, if you are discussing asexually reproducing organisms or the fossil record, you have to use other definitions of species. But that should be obvious. After all, the definition of species was invented for the convenience of humans, not the organisms being represented.\n \n But I wonder why it is that you can't find such common, widely understood information for yourself. Why is it that you require a link? You couldn't have Googled \"Biological Species Concept\"?",
