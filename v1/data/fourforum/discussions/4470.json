   "Most things that are really harmful don't taste very good. For example, the cyanogen compounds. Some occur naturally in things like almonds, apple seeds, peach pits, etc. In fact, bitter almonds are bitter because of the cyanogen. If you eat too many it is possible to kill yourself.\n \n You are thinking of things that are harmful in excess - too much animal fat, too much starch, too much sugar, and just plain too much. In fact, fat, starch, and sugar are necessary for us to live. The living great apes live on a diet high in fiber, with lots of fruit, and a much lower percentage of animal protein and fat. But they still eat fat, starch and sugar.",

We eat piles of potatoes, breads, and pasta, each of which is reduced to more sugar by our bodies. Cro-Magnons didn't bake cookies made with refined and bleached flour and refined granulated sugar. They ate fruit because it tasted good and benefited from the nutrients that have been removed from flour and sugar.\n \n By the way, it's not instinct.",
