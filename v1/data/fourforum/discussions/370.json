   "Just to put it into perspective:\n \n \"The total death toll of World War II for both Allied and Axis nations is estimated to exceed 55 million, more than half civilian.\"-From second source listed\n \n Deaths our atomic bombs caused account for roughly 1.26% of the total deaths resulting from WWII, and that is taking the upper estimates from 1950, and assuming that all Health Card carriers actually die from the fallout. As you can see our atomic bombs were only responsible for the loss of about 2.5% of the civilian casulties. When you weigh this number against the destruction that a continuation of a protracted war with the axis powers would have caused, it is easy to see what drove Truman's decision to use this kind of force. I am sure he did the cost benefit analysis, also factoring in the need to demonstrate our weapons superiority to the future Russian threat. I doubt Truman, Oppenheimer, the pilot who dropped the bomb, or anyone involved ever got another good nights rest, after this. However, I think they made the correct decision.\n \n Here are two different sources for the numbers I used to determine the above percentage.\n \n Hiroshima\n \n \"According to data submitted to the United Nations by Hiroshima City in 1976, the death count reached 140,000 (plus or minus 10,000) by the end of December, 1945.\"\n \n \"Persons qualifying for treatment under the A-bomb Victims Medical Care law of 1957 received Health Cards; holders as of March 31, 1990, numbered 352,550.\"\n \n Nagasaki\n \n \"The atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki exploded at 11:02 A.M. on August 9. Using plutonium with an explosive power of 20 kilotons of TNT-equivalent, it left an estimated 70,000 dead by the end of 1945, although both population and the deaths are uncertain.\"\n \n Source: http://orwell.ru/library/articles/ABomb/e/e_jap_1.htm\n \n \"Hiroshima: August 6, 1945, the uranium bomb, Little Boy, exploded at 8:16 a.m. Hiroshima time, 43 seconds after it left the B-29 Enola Gay, almost 2,000 feet above the ground.

   "I found an interesting article about this topic published in The Journal of Historical Review\n \n \"Months before the end of the war, Japan's leaders recognized that defeat was inevitable.... American officials, having long since broken Japan's secret codes, knew from intercepted messages that the country's leaders were seeking to end the war on terms as favorable as possible....the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (issued in 1946) stated in its official report: 'Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen as targets because of their concentration of activities and population.' If the atomic bomb was dropped to impress the Japanese leaders with the immense destructive power of a new weapon, this could have been accomplished by deploying it on an isolated military base. It was not necessary to destroy a large city. And whatever the justification for the Hiroshima blast, it is much more difficult to defend the second bombing of Nagasaki....'The Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing ... I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon,' [Dwight] Eisenhower said in 1963....Leo Szilard, a Hungarian-born scientist who played a major role in the development of the atomic bomb, argued against its use. 'Japan was essentially defeated,' he said, and 'it would be wrong to attack its cities with atomic bombs as if atomic bombs were simply another military weapon.' In a 1960 magazine article, Szilard wrote: 'If the Germans had dropped atomic bombs on cities instead of us, we would have defined the dropping of atomic bombs on cities as a war crime, and we would have sentenced the Germans who were guilty of this crime to death at Nuremberg and hanged them.' \"\n http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html",

How bad did it actually get there?\n \n I'm glad you brought up China as a threat because I kind of wanted your perspective on this relationship. I have been paranoid about China for some time and don't really trust them at all. I know China is strongly oppose to Australia working with the US to develop a missile defense system. They don't like the US-Australia link at all when it comes to military. I think that just wreaks of them wanting to keep their option of invading Australia open if they ever go to war with the US. But you probably know a lot more about this than I do. Do the people of Australia see China as a major threat and under what conditions do you think they would become a threat?\n \n I think there can be a WWIII without the US being divided and that is infact what I fear the most. However, only a China-Russia alliance could really stand up against the US-UN alliance and I think it is far less likely for China and Russia to become allies than it is for the US and UN to remain allies even if we are distant ones. The US is conflicted with the UN right now but this has happened in the past. The UN is a failing buracracy and it fully needs the support of the US to remain a power. Their need of the US and the US's need to be involved in every internationally affair is going to keep things between the two going smoothly.\n \n I don't think it is the goal of the UN to divide the US. The US is trying to divide the UN more than anything. We have help from a bunch of UN countries while the others in the UN sit on the sidelines. Russia is probably laughing it up as old and new Europe are basically split in two and with England siding with the US, it has to be all the more entertaining.

The Japanes attack on Pearl did hit mostly military targets but many many hopitals, schools, etc were also hit. The german U-boats targeted convoys of passenger ships between Britain and Canada. Eric Liddel (Chariots of Fire, the Olympian that wouldn't run on Sunday) was on one of those ships. His ship did not go down but five in the convoy with him did. The japanese interned many civilians in work camps in China. Eric Liddel was one of those. He died in that camp of a brain tumor. The Japanese did the internment before the US interned Japanese descent civilians. The Japanese attacked and enslaved many on many islands in the pacific Prior to the US move through that area.\n \n Civilians were a target of both sides. Your ideas of modern warfare appear to be shaped by today's technology. WWII was a ruthless and bloody battle. Absolutely, the US would have been tried for war crimes had we lost. We did not lose. War is not objective. At least it never used to be. War was never fair until the information age when war began to be televised. War is not the worst thing that could happen but it is close.",

   "You make an excellent point. And It is true. There probably aren't many things in life than war. But what people must realize is there is no such things as civilians in war. Vietnam was a prime example because the soldiers couldn't tell who was on who's side. I mean when you fight two groups who look exactly alike with the same language it's very hard to figure out who is who. The Korean war made it easier to determine the enemy as N. Korea was a more modern military so they had uniforms and such... unlike Vietnam where most fighting was done by guerrilla groups. Point being made is that basically in war, no matter what, civilians become soldiers no matter if they chose to fight or not. People are untrustworthy. We prove that everyday by the way we live our lives. That is why in war we attack not only military targets( in the case of Japan, the Japanese strategically planted their military bases near civilian cities because they figured the Americans would not attack civilians to get at the Military) but civilians also. Also in war civilian casualties occur. With the rise of the information age we see the civilians dieing that soldiers saw die in 4 different wars. At that time we just did not see these civilians. Some people don't even believe that the greatest attack on civilians happened yet they claim that we should not attack civilians in war (Holocaust). So before you start criticizing soldiers for the actions that were done heroically 60 years ago, please think about the strategy that went behind not only the Ally Attacks but the Axis Attack strategies.",

   "I have been reading Howard Zinn lately, and he touched on this issue. I thought I would share a part of his essay:\n \n \"The evidence today is overwhelming that an invasion of Japan was not necessary to bring the war to an end. Japan was defeated, in disarray, and ready to surrender. The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, which interviewed 700 Japanese military and political officials after the war, came to this conclusion:\n \n Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.\n \n ...\n \n Historian Gar Alperovitz, after going through the papers of the American officials closest to Truman and most influential in the final decision, concludes that the atomic bombs were dropped to impress the Soviet Union, as a first act in establishing American power in the postwar world. He points out that the Soviet Union had promised to enter the war against Japan on August 8. The bomb was dropped on August 6.\"\n \n -Howard Zinn, Passionate Declarations, pages 24-25 \n \n \n Zinn notes that even if an invasion was necessary, military estimates say that an invasion of the southernmost island of Japan would cause 30,000 American casualties. Compare this to the hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians that died from the bombs. Unless you are racist and value the lives of Americans more than Japanese, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a huge mistake.",

   "Dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki I view as one of the biggest mistakes America has made, if not the biggest (though the Vietnam war ranks up there as well). Not only because of the terrible inhumanity of it, but also because it allows other countries to drop nuclear bombs in warfare without being the first such country to have done such a terrible thing, thereby lessening the moral stigma of it. And it probably would be easier in the court of world public opinion to effectively argue against other countries gaining the bomb if we had earlier shown greater reluctance to use it. I suppose it was another example of politicians looking too much at the short term. A demonstration at the test site in New Mexico, or at some uninhabited place near Japan, would have been better.",

   "In my life I have been called many things, and agreed with many people, but on this issue I agree with people I never thought I would agree with...Americans. \n \n The Two bombings where horrible, evil and unjustifiable, when first veiwed. The Power Of Nuclear Weapons is not in the people they kill or the problems they inflict, but the fear they inspire. Truman knew he had the greatest weapon in human histroy, and what he did with it would forever effect our future as a species. He did the thing that now seems short-sighted, he gave the order for the maximum amount of damage that could be inflicted to be inflicted, regardless of causlties. We can call him evil, or a vile man, but the turth is, those blasts changed the face of the world. In one instant 70,000 lives were vaporized, and 100,000+ died in the following years of fall-out, all from two bombs, weighing slightly less then a common conventional ordance of the era. From that momment on we had a new part of our heart, in it we kept the fear of death for our speices, and without that fear, America and Russia would have gone into nuclear war and the world would have ended. \n \n At the time of the cold-war, both sides had no idea what would happen if all their missles were fired. The effect would have been the same as a meteor strike, effectivily ending humanity. But both sides didn't know this, they were just afraid of seeing there proud cities (Moscow and Washington) turned into rubble in the heat of nuclear war, and watching their populations be incenerated. \n \n The bombing of a coast wouldn't have put that fear into our hearts, won't have made us become so afriad of ever using nuclear weapons that the mere thought sends chills down our spine and inspires hollywood to this day. You remember the old spider-man quote? \n \n With Great power comes great responsiblity? \n \n That is the situation here. We need men like Truman, we need fear, cause a good fear keeps us alive better then any knowledge ever could.",

   "Japan was losing but not defeated. They may have wanted a negotiate peace but this would have been a very bad idea. A negotiate peace would have allowed them to regroup and maintain hostility psychologically and emotionally toward the west. Another war with Japan would have been likely later in the 20th century. Germany was offered a negotiated peace after ww1 and this bred much resentment that brought about ww2 (contributing, not sole reason). Both Nagasaki and Hiroshima were military targets as well. \n We think of them as nuclear bombed sites and react with horrors because they are \"nuclear attacks\". Yet the firebombing of Dresden, Hamburg, Tokyo and numerous other industrial sites caused substantially more deaths. When i hear people rail against these two attacks but not against the firebombings, i then think they are either ignorant of the damaged done elsewhere with \"conventional\" weapons historically, or don't care to mention them in the same breath of condemnation due to bias/agenda/or simple brainwashing by popular sentimentality. This then makes the argument against hiroshima and nagasaki not one about civilian deaths but one against \"the bomb\". I can only wonder as to their level of indepedent thoughts or empathy.\n Unconditional surrender occurred only after the second bomb was dropped. Countless lives were save far outnumbering the killed at the two sites. No one now laud these attacks, but they understand them in context of the larger picture, that of a World wide war that killed millions, not just half a million. \n \n Since then Japan has prospered and has become both a global leader and a close ally of the west.
