Didn't they know what was gooing to happen, thought someone told them on a mobile phone. You have to compare this to normal hijacking not suicide planes.\n \n There is a difference between relying on the good intentions of a criminal and antagonising them. In most normal cases they will not want to harm you and it would put them at a big disadvantage if they do (if they are going to a country with no extradition the last thing they want to do is commit a crime there), however just as you are willing to defend your life if threatened so are they- and if they do kill you, you have put the rest of the passengers at much greater risk.

A plane will eventually run out of fuel, and once it lands you will lose and be killed/arrested by the police/special forces of the country in question. Smart criminals quickly realised it was far too risky.\n \n As a result, the only people who attempt plane hijackings are usually a little desperate, a little unhinged, inexperienced folks with a lack of foresight. Once placed under the pressure of controlling a plane full of hostages and negotiating with the pilot and people on the ground, these types of people begin to crack and become unstable.
