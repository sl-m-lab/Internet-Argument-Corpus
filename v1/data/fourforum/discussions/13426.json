   "My family wants Congress to open up Medicare too. There were 7 more arrests in Chicago at CIGNA. This is from Kevin Gosztola with a video at opednews.com/articles/Chicago--Cigna-7-Arreste-by-Kevin-Gosztola-091009-518.html:\n \n \n It was the second action of its kind organized by Mobilization for Health Care for All. Previously, a very successful action occurred in New York. \n \n The campaign is mobilizing Americans in support of real health care reform --- single payer health care for all. \n \n Nearly 700 people have pledged to be arrested so that Americans can---to use the words of Keith Olbermann --- fight death. So that we can prolong all Americans' lives and give everyone an opportunity to live without worrying whether they will get the treatment or be able to afford the treatment each person deserves. \n \n Many more actions are planned for next week on October 15th. They will be happening in cities across the country. \n \n My dad may be arrested on Oct 15th if my mom doesn't have to work that night. I am very proud of him if he goes to jail for his beliefs. I also think everyone in America should have health care. Best wishes.",
