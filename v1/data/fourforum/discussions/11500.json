   "The trend in business relations has been towards an acceptance and welcoming of gay and lesbian clients and appreciation of them as customers. This may be because of the perception that product loyalty is particularly strong in gay consumers or because businesses generally believe that moralistic rants drive away not only gay customers but also those who love them.\n \n Which made it all the more surprising to find that Insure.com, an online insurance purveyor, has been hosting articles that make false and defamatory statements about gay men and women.\n \n Gay Mortality Claims\n Insure.com is a publicly traded company with an advisory board ranging from a former US Senator to executives with various companies, including AT&T.\n ....\n \n In addition to selling insurance, they provide information about the insurance industry. Joe White, an employee and company blog contributor, wrote two pieces in which he claimed that &#8220;being gay&#8221; was a health risk, and not just a minor one.\n \n In an article on the business website entitled Top five ways to kill yourself and get away with it, White lists the number one way to kill yourself:\n  1. Being gay. A gay lifestyle is by far the biggest risk to life expectancy that goes unrecognized by insurance companies. The question has been considered by multiple studies, and the gay lifestyle is universally acknowledged to decrease life expectancy. A conservative estimate is that a gay lifestyle takes away 8-20 years from the average lifespan.\n In other words, living a homosexual lifestyle has health risks at least as severe as smoking (by some estimates even more), but due to the sensitive nature of the issue, life insurance companies don&#8217;t charge different rates for gays. So gays save money on life insurance at the same rate they die young.\n \n White bases his Number One self-killer information on another insure.com article he authored, Gay men die 20 years younger.\n  It&#8217;s a loaded subject, but let&#8217;s get right down to it: gay men, on average, die significantly younger than the rest of the population.\n\n http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2008/07/11/2137#comment-13389\n \n 1) There are a few more examples of the repugnant propaganda put out at the web-site.\n Evidently these guys even put out an article based on the \"work\" of the infamous \"Paul Cameron\"\n \n http://www.exgaywatch.com/wp/2008/07/new-development-in-insurecom-anti-gay-propaganda-story/\n It's kind of amusing how a web-site which proclaims to put out information about \"insurance statistics\" can't even fact-check their information well enough to let an article by Paul Cameron get on...\n \n 2) \"Being gay\" is not a health risk.\n Having promiscuous, unsafe sex? Gay or Straight? Yes.\n Being gay? No.\n I am in a committed relationship, and my chances of contracting HIV are a lot lower than a heterosexual guy who runs around buying hookers.\n \n 3) \"Being gay\" is a health risk?\n How about we compare the heterosexual FEMALE HIV rate to the homosexual FEMALE HIV rate...\n By the way of thinking put forth in the original article, that must mean being a straight woman is a \"health risk\"... emoticon_frazzled\n \n 4) Would it seem intelligent to say that being male is a health risk?\n Or being black is a health risk?\n Obviously, No, and No.\n But if we employed the thinking blindly embraced by the people who produce the \"insure.com\" web-site, the answer would be \"yes\".\n http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~kastor/walking-steel-95/ws-black-health.html\n http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5127a1.htm",

   "I don't get it. It's either factually true or factually false that gay people live shorter or longer lives, and it is in the interests of the insurance industry to act in accordance with reality (that's why they pay actuaries so much to work for them).\n \n An insurance company that prices based on fiction will only shoot itself in the foot.\n \n It may well be true that gay men don't live as long though, in fact I would expect this to be true. Is it true? Surely someone has conducted credible studies on the life expectancy of gays vs straights? Cameron's \"work\" is extremely shoddy, but everything suggests to me the underlying premise, that gay men die earlier, is true.\n \n And yes, men also die younger. So do blacks, smokers, fat people, people with family histories of prostate cancer, poor people, and any number of other categories of people.",

The study seems very objective to me.\n \n Can you clarify what rings untrue or questionable to you rather than just labeling it shoddy just because you don't agree with it?
