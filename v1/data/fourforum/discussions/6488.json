No matter the source of the sounds, a work that exhibits pleasing rhythmic, melodious OR harmonizing sounds can fall under this definition, be it produced by wind, string, brass, percussion, computer, screech owls, whales, nailguns, foot stompers, spoons, a comb and paper, a stretched balloon neck, pots and pans, a scrub board and fingernails, drum beaters, tap shoes, etc ad infinitum<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<.\n \n If the composer of a completely computer generated sound has knowledge of music and produces sounds that are pleasing in rhythm, melody OR harmony, then he/she has produced music. While it is far beneath the true value of what has been traditionally labeled as music, it is nonetheless---music.\n \n Of all the various forms of sounds I've heard labeled as music, the main one that stands out as a farce is RAP! RAP is nothing more than jive-XXX poetry shouted over a rhythmic sound produced by someone who does actually know a little about music. The rapper himself is as close to a talentless waste as I can think of. That they have a following at all amazes me daily. That they have yet failed in killing each other off is disturbing.

   "Let me interject the thoughts of this lover of music.\n \n Music is defined in Webster's as:...\n \n musical: having the pleasing harmonious qualities of music\n \n Now...for a word from our poster:\n \n There are multitudes of forms of music as defined above. No matter the source of the sounds, a work that exhibits pleasing rhythmic, melodious OR harmonizing sounds can fall under this definition...\n\n What dose it mean by pleasing? Is that pleasing to the laws of musical nature or pleasing to the person hearing it? If it's pleasing to the person hearing it, then we can stop with this...\nMaster_Shake doesn't find Techno pleasing therefor it is not music around him.\n\n But in that case, all forms of music could be pick and choose. For example, I can't stand most Country (with some few exceptions) So could I get away with saying that Country isn't music?",

   "Jim needs to hear good hip hop and rap. It is out there. But not much is on the radio. Oh wait - Clear Channel doesn't play much of ANYTHING that is good. Some rappers are also very talented singers and incorporate both singing and rapping (Queen Latifah, the Foogies). Rap matches the city. I drive through it and see why it's hear and how it came a bout. Its history tells a story. \n \n There is plenty of music in the world I don't care for - and most pf it is the pre-packaged - stick it on a Pepsi bottle XXXX produced by the MTV Army. But I work danged hard to not stereotype - and I would never write off 20 years and countless musicians expresion as not being valid. The world says you are dead wrong, Jim. You may not like rap - but it is a valid musical style - despite your low opinion.\n \n Rap is a brilliant medium, that sadly gets abused by a lot of jerk-offs.",
