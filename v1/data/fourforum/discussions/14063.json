I think many sane people see the writing on the wall which shows this health care bill only gives you the costs of the current US system with the defects of a universal system. I'm not much for conspiracy theories but if I were I'd think the government was purposely driving health care off a cliff to get universal care in place. \n \n \nMy maybe vote therefore means I think the US system needs to be nationalised, it's much more efficient to do that.\nWell it's more efficient than the bill we just passed...I think we agree that much.",
