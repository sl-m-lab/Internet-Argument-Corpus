   "HOW COMMON IS SELF-DEFENSE GUNS USE?\n \n Much discussion about the protective benefits of guns has focused on the incidence of self-defense gun use. Proponents of such putative benefits often claim that 2.5 million Americans use guns in self-defense against criminal attackers each year (Kleck and Gertz 1995).\n \n This estimate is not plausible has been nominated as the \"most outrageous number mentioned in a policy discussion by an elected official\" (Cook, Ludwig, and Hemenway 1997, 463).\n \n The estimate comes from a national telephone survey in which respondents reported their own behavior. All attempts at external validation reveal it to be a huge overestimate (Hemenway 1997b).\n \n For example, in 34 percent of the cases in which respondents stated that they used guns for self-defense, they said they used guns to protect themselves during burglaries. If true, this would translate into guns being used in self-defense in approximately 845,000 burglaries each year.\n \n From sophisticated victimization surveys (the NCVS), however, we know that there were fewer than 6,000,000 burglaries in the year of the survey, and in only 1,300,000of those cases was someone certainly at home.\n \n Since only 41 percent of U.S. households owned firearms, and since the victims in two-thirds of the occupied dwellings remained asleep, the 2.5 million figure requires us to believe that burglar victims used their guns in self-defense more than 100 percent of the time.\n \n A more reasonable estimate of self-defense gun use during burglary comes from a retrospective analysis of Atlanta police department reports. Examining home invasion crimes during a four-month period, researchers identified 198 cases of unwanted entry into single-family dwellings when someone was at home (Kellermann et al. 1995). In only three cases (less than 2 percent) did a victim use a firearm in self-defense.\n \n If this figure were extrapolated nationally for the year the survey covers, it would suggest approximately twenty thousand gun uses against burglary.\n \n If it were true, the estimate of 2.5 million self-defense gun uses per year would lead to many other absurd conclusions. There just aren't enough serious crimes for victims to use guns so many times.\n \n For example, the number of respondents who claim to have used a gun against rape and robbery attempts suggests that victims of these attempted crimes are more likely to use a gun against the offender than the attackers are to use a gun against the victim -- even though the criminal chooses the time and place for the attack, most citizens do not own guns, and very few people carry guns.\n \n Similarly, the number of people who claim to use guns in self-defense and report the incident to police (64 percent in the Kleck survey) often exceeds the total number of such crimes reported to police, including all the crimes when the victim did not have a gun (Ludwig 2000).\n \n From \"Private Guns, Pubic Health\" by Professor David Hemenway.\n \n http://www.gunguys.com/?p=2746",
