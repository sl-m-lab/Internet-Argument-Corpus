What I mean is that if a failed mutation comes about by chance and dies, surely we should at some point see the same mutation at least once more?\n \n If your looking for a more physics based argument here's a little something for you (I am actually a physicst myself). There are so many things here that using chance as a reason is really not enough anymore. Here are but 25 factors which show that if things were but a little different life would not be possible (and the list goes on and on).\n \n 1. strong nuclear force constant \n if larger: no hydrogen; nuclei essential for life would be unstable. \n if smaller: no elements other than hydrogen\n \n 2. weak nuclear force constant \n if larger: too much hydrogen converted to helium in big bang, hence too much heavy element material made by star burning; no expulsion of heavy elements from stars. \n if smaller: too little helium produced from big bang, hence too little heavy element material made by star burning; no expulsion of heavy elements from stars\n \n 3. gravitational force constant \n if larger: stars would be too hot and would burn up too quickly and too unevenly. \n if smaller: stars would remain so cool that nuclear fusion would never ignite, hence no heavy element production.\n \n 4. electromagnetic force constant \n if larger: insufficient chemical bonding; elements more massive than boron would be too unstable for fission. \n if smaller: insufficient chemical bonding.\n \n 5. ratio of electromagnetic force constant to gravitational force constant \n if larger: no stars less than 1.4 solar masses, hence short stellar life spans and uneven stellar luminosities. \n if smaller: no stars more than 0.8 solar masses, hence no heavy element production.\n \n 6. ratio of electron to proton mass \n if larger: insufficient chemical bonding. \n if smaller: insufficient chemical bonding.\n \n 7. ratio of protons to electrons \n if larger: electromagnetism would dominate gravity, preventing galaxy, preventing galaxy, star, and planet formation. \n if smaller: electromagnetism would dominate gravity, preventing galaxy, preventing galaxy, star, and planet formation.\n \n 8. expansion rate of the universe \n if larger: no galaxy formation \n if smaller: universe would collapse prior to star formation.\n \n 9. entropy level of the universe \n if smaller: no proto-galaxy formation. \n if larger: no star condensation within the proto-galaxies.\n \n 10. mass density of the universe \n if larger: too much deuterium from big bang, hence stars burn too rapidly. \n if smaller: insufficient helium from big bang, hence too few heavy elements forming. \n \n 11. velocity of light \n if faster: stars would be too luminous \n if slower: stars would not be luminous enough. \n \n 12. age of the universe \n if older: no solar-type stars in a stable burning phase in the right part of the galaxy. \n if younger: solar-type stars in a stable burning phase would not yet be formed. \n \n 13. initial uniformity of radiation \n if smoother: stars, star clusters, and galaxies would not have formed. \n if coarser: universe by now would be mostly black holes and empty space. \n \n 14. fine structure constant \n (a number used to describe the fine structure splitting of spectral lines) \n if larger: no stars more than 0.7 solar masses. \n if smaller: no stars less than 1.8 masses. \n \n 15. average distance between stars \n if larger: heavy element density too thin for rocky planets to form. \n if smaller: planetary orbits would become destabilized. \n \n 16. decay rate of proton \n if greater: life would be exterminated by the release of radiation. \n if smaller: insufficient matter in the universe. \n \n 17. Carbon (12C) to Oxygen (16O) energy level ratio \n if larger: insufficient oxygen. \n if smaller: insufficient carbon. \n \n 18. ground state energy level for Helium (4He) \n if larger: insufficient carbon and oxygen. \n if smaller: insufficient carbon and oxygen. \n \n 19. decay rate of Beryllium (8Be) \n if slower: heavy element fusion would generate catastrophic explosions in all the stars. \n if faster: no element production beyond beryllium and, hence, no life chemistry possible. \n \n 20. mass excess of the neutron over the proton \n if greater: neutron decay would leave too few neutrons to form the heavy elements essential for life. \n if smaller: proton decay would cause all stars to collapse rapidly into neutron stars or black holes. \n \n 21. initial excess of nucleons over anti-nucleons \n if greater: too much radiation for planets to form. \n if smaller: not enough matter for galaxies or stars to form. \n \n 22. polarity of water molecule \n if greater: heat from fusion and vaporization would be too great for life to exist. \n if smaller: heat of fusion and vaporization would be too small for life's existence; liquid water would become too inferior a solvent for life chemistry to proceed; ice would not float, leading to a runaway freeze-up. \n \n 23. supernovae eruptions \n if too close: radiation would exterminate life on the planet. \n if too far: not enough heavy element ashes for the formation of rocky planets. \n if too frequent: life on the planet would be exterminated. \n if too infrequent: not enough heavy element ashes for the formation of rocky planets. \n if too late: life on the planet would be exterminated by radiation. \n if too soon: not enough heavy element ashes for the formation of rocky planets. \n \n 24. white dwarf binaries \n if too few: insufficient fluorine produced for life chemistry to proceed. \n if too many: disruption of planetary orbits from stellar density; life on planet would be exterminated. \n if too soon: not enough heavy elements made for efficient fluorine production. \n if too late: fluorine made too late for incorporation in proto-planet. \n \n 25. ratio of exotic to ordinary matter \n if smaller: galaxies would not form. \n if larger: universe would collapse before solar type stars could form.",

No. But I can't prove that my cat can't fly. I can certainly call upon all kinds of records and observations that indicate that a cat has never been observed to fly. But my cat can! Can you prove otherwise?\n \n I can also reference lots of evidence from which it can be concluded that dinosaurs (except for those we now call birds) went extinct about 65 mya. The geological record shows that most mammals at that time were small, nocternal, and mouse-like. Anything that might be considered \"people\" doesn't show up in the geological strata for another 60 million years. Modern humans only show up in the last 50,000 years or so.\n \n Do you have any evidence that it is otherwise? Since there is no evidence that \"people\" and dinosaurs ever lived at the same time, the obligation is yours to offer evidence that it is otherwise.\n \n In short, there is lots of evedence that dinosaurs once lived. There is lots of evidence that \"people\" have ancestors in the past. There is no evidence that dinosaurs and \"people\" ever existed at the same time.",

It deals with the mechanisms that cause that change. Evolution is not about how life arose but only about what happened after it did. Creationism is belief in mythology based on no evidence whatsoever.\n \nOrigins have to be taken on faith because nobody was there to see it happen.\n\n That isn't necessarily good reasoning. We can know about a lot of things without having actually seen it. We can build reasonable explanations based on the observation of evidence. And, of course, evolution really isn't about origins anyway. We can see that living things have changed through time. But in the case of creationism, there isn't any evidence either.\n \nBoth Evolution and Creation are religions.\n\n No. Evolution is a scientific study of the evidence of how life changes. Evolutionary theory offers falsifiable explanations of how that works. Creationism is religious in that it is based on no evidence. It is based on mythology.\n \nI know that none of you will ever admit that Evolution is a religion.\n\n True.\n \nWhen talking about the Big Bang and other supposed \"evidence\" for Evolution, you are using your bias.\n\n The big bang has nothing to do with evolution. It seems that you oppose something without even knowing what it is. The big bang is a theory of the science of cosmology. Scientists who study the origin of the universe are called cosmologists or astrophysicists. Scientists who study evolution are called biologists.\n \nWe are all 100 % biased. There is no such thing as neutrality.\n\n Nonsense. You just need it to be that way. It means that rejection of your mythology based faith is just bias rather than the choice of a reasonable explanation over superstition.\n \nBoth Evolutionists and Creationists have the same \"facts\" and \"evidence.\" Our bias determines who we interpret them.\n\n Well, in the case of a creationist, the bias determines what evidence will be discarded, what evidence will be twisted, what evidence will simply be ignored.\n \nWhat about human and dinosaur foot prints in rock?

It seems like at some point, either we had a fusion or they had a break. \n \n \n The evidence points to a fusion.\n \n From: Comparison of the Human and Great Ape Chromosomes as Evidence for Common Ancestry  \n \n The first prediction (evidence of a telomere at the fusion point) is shown to be true in reference 3 . Telomeres in humans have been shown to consist of head to tail repeats of the bases 5'TTAGGG running toward the end of the chromosome. Furthermore, there is a characteristic pattern of the base pairs in what is called the pre-telomeric region, the region just before the telomere. When the vicinity of chromosome 2 where the fusion is expected to occur (based on comparison to chimp chromosomes 2p and 2q) is examined, we see first sequences that are characteristic of the pre-telomeric region, then a section of telomeric sequences, and then another section of pre-telomeric sequences. Furthermore, in the telomeric section, it is observed that there is a point where instead of being arranged head to tail, the telomeric repeats suddenly reverse direction - becoming (CCCTAA)3' instead of 5'(TTAGGG), and the second pre-telomeric section is also the reverse of the first telomeric section. This pattern is precisely as predicted by a telomere to telomere fusion of the chimpanzee (ancestor) 2p and 2q chromosomes, and in precisely the expected location. Note that the CCCTAA sequence is the reversed complement of TTAGGG (C pairs with G, and T pairs with A).\n \n The second prediction - remnants of the 2p and 2q centromeres is documented in reference 4. The normal centromere found on human chromosome 2 lines up with the 2p chimp chromosome, and the remnants of the 2q chromosome is found at the expected location based upon the banding pattern. ",

But that of course again it can not be simple if we want to really perceive it mentally. \n \n \n However, math is an excellent tool for streching our imagination and understanding. Things that are completely non-intuitive and seemingly impossible turn out to be accurate models of the real world.\n \n \n \n The origin questions can not be answered by equations although\n math can be a helper there too. There is something what is sort of\n \"programmed\" into our brain which goes beyond the everyday \n \"practicalities. Endlessness includes the \"beginning and the end\" of the finite but the finite can not include infinity. This is a REAL\n problem. \n \n \n What is \"programmed into our brains\" can be wrong and harmful.",

   "I would be interested in the offer of debate, but to what end. I would not wavier in faith based on the inablity of my limited understanding. Rather it is easier to say God said it and that settles it for me.\n\n Then I wonder what the rest of your message is about. You admit that you have limited understanding and are unwilling to learn, so why bother going on? One problem is that your belief that your god said anything is based on a particular book of mythology. If you prefer that to reality, that is you choice.\n \nHowever, I do believe in creation basied on it's own merrit.\n\n What merit? Why are the creation myths of nomadic herdsmen any more believable than Norse mythology, or Greek mythology, or even native American mythology? I know. Don't tell me. Because you have faith, i.e., you believe based on no evidence what so ever.\n \nI do not have the faith to believe in some absurd thing as evoultion.\n\n Nor do I. But on the other hand I don't confuse my faith with science based on evidence. Evolution is not my faith and I take none of it by faith. And evolution isn't absurd to those who have at least made a little effort to learn about it. You oppose something that you know nothing about. How do you know you oppose it?\n \nWe must agree that both of these examples are mere therory science can not observe actual evoultion of life nor can we see creation as it is describe in genisis.\n \n No. We don't agree. For one thing your faith isn't a theory. Creation as described in Genesis is a myth, in fact, two myths. Furthermore, a scientific theory doesn't mean \"wild guess with no foundation\". That seems to be what you want the word to mean. In science a theory is an explanation for observed facts that has been tested. You see, a theory is predictive. I'll give you some examples of scientific theories. The germ theory of disease, the theory of gravitation, the heliocentric theory, tectonic theory, atomic theory.\n \n Moreover, you are wrong that science cannot observe actual evolution of life. It is done all the time. While it may be debatable that a virus is alive, the recent case of SARS making the jump from civets to humans after a mutation is evolution.\n \nYou mentioned in a post the lack of mecanics in creation. I understand this problem to be present in evolution.\n\n Absolutely not. Charles Darwin identified one of the major mechanisms of evolution, natural selection. Other mechanisms are mutation, gene flow, recombination, sexual selection, and genetic drift.\n \nTo say a fish became amphibian, and offer no transtional from is ridiculous.\n\n And to deny that there are no transitionals without having the integrity to at least making an effort to learn what you are talking about is ridiculous. There are lots of transitional fossils. Museums are full of them and more are being discovered on an almost daily basis. There are news stories that report them all over the place. Try reading At the Water's Edge: Fish with Fingers, Whales with Legs, and How Life Came Ashore but Then Went Back to Sea by Carl Zimmer. It will tell you about two transitional series. Also read Taking Wing: Archaeopteryx and the Evolution of Bird Flight by Pat Shipman for the story of what we can learn from even limited transitional specimens and why. Also read The Mistaken Extinction: Dinosaur Evolution and the Origin of Birds by Lowell Dingus and Timothy Rowe. I found the book excellent even though recent finds of feathered dinosaurs have made some of the material a bit dated. It will give you an idea of how the fossil record fits together. At least you might learn what a transitional is.\n \nI can come up with one of many expliantions for origin the truth is that which can be backed up with evidence.\n\n Then the version in Genesis isn't the truth since there is no evidence for it. On the other hand, there is lots of evidence that evolution is the process that is responsible for the changes in life over history. We are still learning and may not be correct in some details, but the theory has been well tested to the point that it isn't even debated among scientists.\n \nLogicall your next comment would be one of evidence of creation. I have an eye witness account by the only person who was there. Jesus Christ.\n\n Nonsense. Genesis was written by men. It is not an eyewitness account of anything. And Jesus Christ lived about 2000 years ago. You are confused. \n \nYou said in one post you are a ex-christian. If you new anything of Christianity you would know this is not possible. It is possible you had the title of Christian without the relationship which gives you this title. Christianity subscribes to the power of God to save you, not of any power of your own. If one could be come unsaved, he becomes more powerful than God (Impossible within Christianity).\n\n Well then. All of the ex-christians have it both ways don't they. Since they are saved they can lie, cheat, steal and have wild, illicit sex (following the example of several christian preachers).\n \nI am unable to come to this sight every day and find your next post or reply. Any who wish to comment Please email me tlappster@msn.com My schedule is such that I hope to contribute once a week.\n\n Then you can read the answers once a week.\n \n \nThe problem with the idea of transitional forms is that evolution it;s self also dicards them. If transtion takes place of a great deal of time with many mutations, then survival of the fittest says that this mutaion is worthless.\n\n Wouldn't it be nice if you had made an effort to learn the basics before you tell us your conclusions?\n \nTo have a fin and a finger will not allow for survival. This mutated animal will find itself unable to flee it's preditors.\n\n Really? So because you don't understand how evolution takes place it must not be true. Because you haven't invested enough effort to learn what you are talking about, it must not be true. \"POOF\" is a much better answer for you because you don't have to think. You have the answer to every question, your goddidit!\n \nSecondarily, creation does allow for microevolution. which is the answer for the diffrent breeds of specific types of animalss.\n\n Right. After it was pointed out the creationists how foolish it is to claim that there is not such thing as evolution because there are millions of species of animals and that makes Bible mythology impossible, creationists started admitting just enough evolution to cling to their miracles.\n \nHowever macroevolution is quite diffrent.\n\n No. It's not. Speciation has been observed. After two lines of organisms are separated for millions of years, they are no longer able to interbreed. Oh, I forgot. You think the earth is only a few thousand years old because your mythology that you believe by faith tells you that.\n \nShow me the fossil of a dog becoming a cat. Of a snake becoming a bird. You will not find such things. they do not exisit. Those who say the have found them are often forgeries.\n\n Horsepucky! Cats aren't descended from dogs and birds aren't descended from snakes. Where did you ever get such an ignorant idea. My bet is you won't be able to cite a single time that such a claim was ever made (except by a creationist). Now I can show you pictures of dinosaurs with feathers, and birds with teeth, long boney tails and claws on their wings. They are not forgeries and only fools still claim that they are.

   "Hey, lappster\n \n Let me offer a suggestion. Rather than talk from ignorance as you do, why don't you try to educate yourself? Here's a good first step: subscribe to Scientific American (or faithfully buy every issue). It is even available on-line. Read every word of every article, even if you don't understand. Understand that Scientific American is not a journal of science. It is a magazine meant for laymen, but many of the articles are written by leading scientists in the fields. There are no chemists (and no christian education ministers) discussing problems with biology as is typical of creationist sites. Chemists discuss chemistry, cosmologists discuss cosmology, paleontologists discuss paleontology, and molecular biologists discuss molecular biology. None of them ever discuss religion. But occasionally there are editorials that discuss the damage that young earth creationism is doing to our educational system.\n \n While our 4th graders rank at the top in science and math on standardized tests, our 12th graders rank at the bottom. And it is getting worse. We are a country of scientific illiterates who believe that theories are wild-a$$ guesses and that mythology is as valid as observations of reality. Already, a significant percentage of our scientific community is foreign born. There isn't anything wrong with that. Why not come to this country to fill the need for scientists and educators that we are not doing for ourselves? In this country it seems that we prefer bronze age science.\n \n So try to learn something, please! I don't ask that you believe in evolution. I certainly don't. I ask that you make an effort to step up from scientific illiteracy (not to mention, marginal english literacy). How can you profess to oppose something that you don't understand? Faith is one thing but intentional ignorance is quite another.",

   "Creation is not magic it is inteligent design.\n\n Right. Some unknown magical sky man \"designed\" it all and then some unknown creator POOFed into existance. No magic there.\n \nI see evoultion to be the magical side of this equation.\n\n But you don't actually have the slightes idea of what evolution is, so how would you know?\n \nThe odds just aren't in it. I will believe in evolution if an explostion in a printing press causes a dictionary to come into existence.\n\n What does that have to do with evolution? What are you talking about? Let me see. I'll believe in creation when I see a hummingbird XXXX bricks. Except my statement makes more sense than yours.\n \nMythology doen't include historcally correct and factual prophecy. The claims made in the Bible can all be see in secular history.\n\n Really? Let me see. Two creation myths and a global flood myth where 5 million \"kinds\" of animal were crammed into a big box that magically floats for a year - yeah, that's secular history.\n \nPossibly this is true, but did the virus become any more inteigent. No. The virus may be able to mutate to infect greater lifeforms, but it will never become more than a virus.\n\n Now what are you talking about? You don't seem to have any idea what evolution is.\n \nAnd before Darwins death he recanted his belief in evolution. His theory was by his words mans feeble attempt to disregaurd his God.\n\n Did you know that Jesus admited that he wasn't god just before he died? He admited that his pretense was a man's feeble attempt to be crowned king. My claim has as much basis in fact as yours.\n \n Karl has already pointed you to the AIG view of this bit of creationist flatulence. Let me quote.\n \n \"Many people use this story, originally from a Lady Hope. However, it is almost certainly not true, and there is no corroboration from those who were closest to him, even from Darwin's wife Emma, who never liked evolutionary ideas. Also, even if true, so what? If Ken Ham recanted Creation, would that disprove it? There is no value to this argument whatever.\" (my emphasis)\n \n Wouldn't you think that Darwin's wife and children might have noticed Lady Hope wandering around the house? But creationists like that story. They think it is meaningful for some reason. And since creationists are willing to believe almost anything that tells them what they want to hear and does not require critical thinking, it gets repeated again and again. And creationist dupes continue to believe it and to pass it along.\n \nI will research evolution to the degree you openmindedly research creation. I give site books and web sites with arguements for why I have come to believe my theories.\n\n No you won't. But for some strange reason creationists don't feel any obligation to be truthful. My bet is that I have already read more about creationism than you have. I have also read more about the various sciences of which you are so ignorant. And you don't have theories because you don't have evidence. You have a book of mythology that you insist is history.\n \nThe problem of learning evolution is that the foundation for it is already been eroded. It only stands on the cycle of its own manipultaion of science. If anything evolution has moved closer to creation over the generations rather than farther away.\n\n More demonstration of how little you know of the topic. Creationism was invented at the beginning of the 20th century. It gained popularity in the 1960's.\n \nJesus Christ is God. Genisis tells us he would come in the cool of the day and walk with Adam.\n\n Jesus Christ isn't mentioned in Genesis. Jesus Christ lived about 2000 years ago. Even your theology is childish.\n [snip of silly sermon]\n \nDo not take my words as those of all creationist. Creation admits to mutation in a form of habbitation.\n\n You don't even know what a mutation is, do you? How intelligent!\n \nThis is microevolution. Just because a animal adapts itself to its surroundings, doesn't mean it is a new creation.\n\n Now what are you babbling about? I never mentioned \"new creation\". What I did mention was that creationists used to deny all evolution until they realized that the millions of \"kinds\" of animals wouldn't fit on the ark. So now creationists admit just a little evolution in order to get millions of species from a few thousand \"kinds\". The problem is, what is required is evolution at rates greater than any evolutionary biologist would ever claim.\n \nYes i believ in a young Earth. However at the end of the creation week it was fully mature. I can easily see why men can say it looks old.\n\n But because your book of mythology tells you about a week of creation, you prefer that (because it requires less thought) to examining reality.\n \nAdam was formed into a man not a boy.\n\n Are we going to talk about the second creation story now?\n \nThe Earth was formed into a fully mature Earth.\n\n Oops. Back to the first creation story. You can't seem to make up your mind.\n \nWhat is the aproximate age of a full grown earth? Who really knows.\n\n Probably about 4.6 billion years. It has been dated by several methods and that's what the evidence indicates.\n \nAnd I would appreiciate your refraining from calling the Bible mythology.\n\n And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory.\n \nI could list as many articles or books, or sites as you to the reasons for my belief. There are some who teach creation without even opening the Bible.\n\n Name them. Actually, if you look into it you will find that all creationists are religiously motivated. Most of them are fundamentalist christians in the United States.\n \nIf you want my resources I will be glad to share. If you wish to open your mind just a little.\n\n Let me see. I examine the evidence and accept the best explanation and I should open my mind to learn your mythology. Been there - done that. I have read Gish, Morris, Brown, Ham, Sarfati. I have heard Carl Baugh and visited his museum. I have listened to Mr. Kent Hovind's entire seminar. I read articles on both the ICR and the AIG sites. I know more about creationism than you do because I have been studying that particular insanity for more than 20 years. So post your links. I've probably seen them. Now I'll bet you lack the courage to actually learn anything about evolutionary theory.",

I they would receive some simple but organized system of \"information\" they would be extremely happy to discover \"extraterrestrial intelligence\" right? Now we have here the mindgboggleingly fantastic programs of DNA in the cells of plants and animals. The same \"congregation\" says it is \"evolved\" by a series of \"accidents\" right? Where is their elementary LOGIC\n\n It is clear that you know very little about evolution. It is not a series of accidents. It is also clear that you aren't a very clear thinker. SETI has nothing to do with the theory of evolution. The \"congregation\" involved in SETI are not biologists. I guess you weren't aware that evolution is a theory of biology.\n \nLurch? Wake up friend and open your eyes.\n\n And instead place my faith in the mythology of nomadic herdsmen? It is much more logical to believe in some all knowing but unknowable magic being who poofed everything into existance and then created all of the evidence to make it appear as if he didn't.\n \nI've studied the \"theory of evolution\" quite thoroughly collecting info from different aspects of it. I reject it because it is a nonsense scienctifically and intellectually.\n\n It is quite clear that you haven't actually studied evolutionary theory. It is quite clear that you know very little about it. Anyone who would represent the site that you linked above as a refutation of evolutionary theory, knows little about the topic. You have allowed yourself to be duped. I question the integrity of someone who would fill his head with such XXXX and then claim knowledge.\n \nI even question the scienctific integrity of at least some of its promoters. Interestingly enough atheists \"skeptics\" gladly push the evo bandwagon. If one of the \"darlings\" of evolutionists would have studied logic instead writing the \"Blind Watchmaker\" he would not sweat out that baloney.\n\n My bet is that Dawkins knows quite a bit more than you about logic. You obviously know nothing as is apparent from your SETI argument above.",

   "\"Faith is the evidence of things hoped for...\"\n \n I hope in creation - you in evolution. Neither one of us is capable of returning to origin to record scientificly the event.\n\n \n Lappster, sometimes I read your posts and wonder if you're really serious or just playing a gag on all of us. Then I wonder if maybe you're not just masochistic at heart. In any case, the others can respond to this in their ways. As I seem to have the forum to myself here at 4:56 AM EST, I'll respond in my way.\n \n \"Faith is the evidence of things hoped for.\" I never really thought of that. As a matter of fact (and I'm not trying to be smart here) I'm not sure where you picked up that quote. Did you post that Lurch? I did an \"edit < find on this page\" search and didn't find it on Lurch's post. It only appeared on your last one, Lappster. I'm probably wrong, however, and it's not really important either way. It's the premise of your subsequent argument:\n \n \"I hope in creation - you in evolution.\"\n \n I'm going to really shred to pieces the idea of scientific theory here, and invite those more educated to correct me if I'm wrong, but I hope I will still make some valid point:\n \n I have never personally met you, Lappster. I don't know if you are a man or a woman (though a search of your profile or various posts could provide that evidence). I don't know your age or anything about your appearance (again, you may have revealed this on this forum and the evidence is merely waiting to be discovered). But all of that is of little importance to me. For the purposes of this discussion, I will be a Lappsterscribologist. It is a new science that I have just founded which dedicates itself to the study of Lappster and his general literacy, his ability to formulate at least semi-coherent thoughts, and his present activity level. I have just given myself a PHd in Lappsterscribology, so you may feel free to call me Dr. Quinn, pun intended.\n \n Our first order of business is devising some theory which we can attempt to test using visible or deducted evidence. That theory, iterated above, is that you are at least semi-literate, semi-coherent and alive within the last 24 hours and producing some form of writing.\n \n (Forum, help me with my terminology please because I know I'm gonna muff this up. Do the points I am about to make actually have names in our imaginary science? Are they called Deductions? I'll go with that but please advise.)\n \n Deduction #1: Your responses to actual posts on this forum indicate that you are able to read and write with some modicum of understanding, though I admit very little. We can therefore determine that you display some degree of literacy.\n \n Deduction #2: Though most of your ideas don't seem to follow any degree of reasonable logic, they are pieced together in ways that we as readers can at least understand enough to respond in kind. So you must be displaying at least the minimum amount of coherence to make this possible for us.\n \n Deduction #3: Your post wasn't here the last time I checked 24 hours ago. Unless someone has hijacked your account and learned to mimic your barely literate, barely coherent writing style, I can make a reasonable deduction that you have been alive within the last day or so, and were active and writing on this forum.\n \n Well now, there's an extremely long and drawn out method of making my point in response to your above statement: \"I hope in creation - you in evolution\".\n \n I'm sorry, but nobody hopes in evolution. In the same way, I don't bother to \"hope\" in the basic tenets of Lappsterscribology. I have accumulated (though subject to debate) enough convincing evidence to know --- so what is there to hope for? Lappster is literate, coherent and actively writing within the last 24 hours. Do you want a chance to categorically disprove my new science? Here's your chance. Go post someplace else where Lappsterscribologists can't ever find you, and never return to this forum. LOL. I'm just joshing ya, Lap. You're fun and I like you. And I like that you can laugh at yourself, just as I am going to have to laugh at myself when the wolves come sinking their teeth into my paltry ideas of what science (or in this case \"an argument\") really is.\n \n Sink away, fellahs. ;)\n \n MQ",

   "Thank you Lurch.\n \n Finally one of you stands up to admit Evolution is faith.\n\n As usual, fundamentalist christians don't seem to have a need to be honest. Misrepresentation and downright lies are par for the course.\n \n\"Faith is the evidence of things hoped for...\"\n\n Nonsense. Faith is the acceptance of something for which you have no evidence. Not only is faith NOT evidence, faith is without evidence. You may hope that you are right, but that only underlines how trivial creationism is.\n \nI hope in creation - you in evolution.\n\n I don't know about you, certainly you seem to believe in a simple minded magic. And of course, you must somehow please your invisible master, even if that means distortion and dishonesty. On the other hand, you have no idea of my hopes or my faith. Actually I don't hope that evolution is true and I don't have faith in evolution. I really don't care one way or the other if it is true. In my life enough of the theory of evolution has changed that I'm not all that attached to any particular part of the theory. But still, we've been gathering evidence about evolution for 150 years or so, and by this time only the ignorant deny it. About 95% of scientists of all kinds accept evolutionary theory as the best explaination for the observed data. Of biologists, the number is over 99%.\n \nNeither one of us is capable of returning to origin to record scientificly the event.\n\n Right. But that only means that you have faith that the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is historically and scientifically accurate. You have no evidence and you admit that you have no way to gather the evidence. On the other hand, I can observe how things are now, hypothesize how they may have been, predict something that must be true if my hypothesis is correct, and then test the prediction. If the prediction is confirmed, then probably my hypothesis is correct, and I continue with further testing. If the prediction is wrong, then I throw out the hypothesis.\n \n\"... The evidence of things unseen\"\n\n Except that there is no evidence for the creation mythology. There is evidence for evolution. By the way, evolution isn't concerned with \"origin\". I should have mentioned that above. There is a special field of science that studies the origin of life. It is more chemistry and biochemistry than biology. Evolution is the science of how living things change.\n \nCreation has been around a lot longer than your post implied. It was recorded in Genisis and passed down for many generations.\n\n Yes, the mythology has been around for a long time. Most cultures had their own. You have adopted the mythology of ancient Hebrews. You probably even somehow reconcile both stories of creation in your mind. But the technology and the techniques to use that technology didn't develop until about 400 years ago. Every since then we have used the idea that we can learn about our world by careful observation and experimentation. About 150 years ago, Darwin and Wallace recognized a mechanism for why living things change. About the same time, Mendel recognized how those changes were passed on to off spring. That the Biblical mythology of creation was false was actually demonstrated by men who believed in creation. They tried to reconcile their Bible with what was obviously true from the observations they made. But creationism has only been around since the early 20th century. It grew out of the anti-science movement of fundamentalism. It actually became popular in the 1960's.\n \nI would rather put my faith in this book than in any man's theory.\n\n What ever you please. I guess I'll put my faith in the creation myths of the Norse. That has as much basis as yours.\n \nGenisis includes many events and personel that have been proven to take place and lived. Why would a book be right about the lives and events recorded in it and wrong about origin.\n\n Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example.",

Maybe the Gospels are traditions about him.\n \nWould you write \"the 'Big Bang' supposed to have happened\"? I think you would not.\n\n Sure I would. It is supposed to have happened about 13 to 14 billion years ago. It is a logical result of consideration of an expanding universe. There is a great deal of evidence that points to it.\n \nThe former is a written record. The latter is a speculation \"supported\" by assumptions, (no factual proofs) about an event which might happened circa 15 thousand million years ago. You accept that as a fact.\n\n The former is written mythology. It was written by men and recorded the creation stories of their culture. It even records two of those creation stories, both of which are similiar to creation stories of cultures that the Hebrews came in contact with. The latter is based on observations of the universe. Science doesn't use proofs, factual or otherwise. But there is evidence for the way the universe happened, and it isn't in the mythology of the Hebrews, no matter how much you want to believe it. There is no evidence that anything in the Biblical creation myths ever happened.\n \nThat is your right. But it does not make the \"Bang\" true.\n\n And you have a right to cling to superstition and magic as true. But that doesn't make mythology true.\n \nTruth has amazing properties Lurch. It can not be decided by majority votes or \"scientific\" speculations.\n\n And it can't be detected by mindless clutching at mythology.\n \nIf you, again, think that the Bible does not carry the Truth (Christ) but just a product of \"cultures\" then of course it is your provided right to do so. But then we are in different domains so to further discuss it is futile. When you write \"god\" instead of God I see that you do not realise whom or what we are talking about.\n\n I fully realize what I am talking about. I am talking about your god, the petty, vengeful, cruel and capricious creature depicted in your Bible. What did you think I was talking about? And, of course, the point was that Christ isn't mentioned in the Old Testament.\n \n How utterly amazing to deny that the Bible is not a record of the cultures that produced it! Perhaps if you actually read it.\n \nYes I have. Not any of his complete books but part of them. That was plenty enough to see his way of \"logic\". I do not like to waste my time with gleaning nonsense to find sense here and there. No doubt he proves what the Bible says about an atheist.\n\n In other words, no you haven't actually read anything by Dawkins. You criticized me for not having read the Bible. Would you have thought that if I had read the first 10 verses of chapter 5 of Genesis that I could claim to have read the Bible? Same with you. You are ignorant and you demand to stay that way, secure in your knowledge that your god made the universe by magic. I'll bet that the parts of Dawkins that you have read were snippets on creationist web pages. Of course, given your limited ability to actually form concepts and understand ideas, I imagine that reading Dawkins would be a bit futile in your case. You could start with \"A River Out of Eden,\" That deals in basic ideas that you might be able to grasp. Obviously his other books are too much for you. You are still at a level where you cling to the mythology of the first 11 chapters of the Bible as history.",

Chances of convincing those who don't want to learn are pretty slim. I'm not trying to convince you.\n \nOne of the things he stated was that nearly 90% of scientists believe evolution to be true. That is correct, nearly 90% of scientist do believe evolution to be fact.\n\n As Crim pointed out, it is about 95% of scientists in general and about 99% of biologists that accept the evidence of evolution. There are other things that many scientists agree on too. For example, over 99% of all astronomers agree that the stars are not hung on the firmament. Over 99% of all meteorologists do not believe that rain falls through windows in the firmament.\n \nHowever, I believe this is because most people going in to a scientific field are trying to figure out how life got here. Since they do not believe in God, they must cling to the belief with the most credibility.\n\n What absolute XXXX. You demonstrate quite well the anti-science, anti-learning attitude of fundamentalist christianity in the U.S. The study of science isn't related to a belief in God. Many scientists are deists or theists. Few of them are as ignorant as YECs.\n \n Just so you understand I'll mak this as clear as I can. To be a scientist does not imply that one is an atheist. Nor does Christian equate to creationist. In fact, only a minority of fundamentalist christians in the U.S. are creationists. It seems to be a pecular aberation that has occurred in the U.S.\n \nJust because 90% in this field believe this does not mean it is true. I asked him, since 90% of scientist believe that should I? He said yes.\n\n If 99% of the scientists in a field accept something, it means that it has been well tested and the evidence quite convincing. There is much debate about some of the details around the fringes of the issues, but little debate about the central facts. For example, there is great debate about how long ago our ancestors migrated out of Africa, but they all agree that humans shared a common ancestor with chimpanzees about 5 to 7 million years ago.\n \nI then brought up something else. I read a book and recalled where it said that over 90% of Histortians belive that Jesus Christ lived. I asked him why, then, did he not belive in Jesus. He did not know.\n\n The stories may be based on a real person. But still, the evidence that such a person lived is the New Testament. And to believe that such a some person named Yeshua bar Joseph lived and to believe that he was the Messiah and a god are two different things.",

If you think the stone creates the gravity by itself\n then serious mythology is involved.\"\n \n I have no idea what the hell you're talking about here, you use sentance fragments and expect us to understand them. Seriously, is English your second language? But yes the stone does create it's own gravity. Put the stone into space far from any other matter and it has it's own field of gravity, so yes, the stone creates the gravity by itself. What else would create it???",

   "Karl,\n \n Thank you for your reply to Demon's answer,(and his question) you are a fair player.I appreciate your attitude. I still consider this forum to be a rather friendly reasoning together which may even be useful occasionally.\n \n Demon, \n \n your punch on my nose was deserved, regarding the senselessness of that sentence. I put (unintentionally) the little \"if\" there and the sentence lost its meaninig. Karl is right, my background is Hungarian and besides that fact I never was a languistic talent. I love English and do consider it to be one of the most powerful and beautiful languages. I wish I could handle it better. So be more forgiving on my \"glitches\" please.\n My point wanted to be, that \"forces\" are not the result of the objects upon which they exert their effects.\n \n Frankly, I long for the arrival of the glorious era when there is going to be one language in the whole earth (again).",

   "Sorry if I'm a bit confused, are you suggesting that the observable properties of matter in this universe are not or are not intrinsic?\n\n \n Karl, I think I agree with you in a sense that we can not detect \n the work of gravity - or any other governing principle - unless\n it is in \"operation\" on the subject we choose to investigate about.\n Now if we think that because we can not separate the law from the thing it rules over then the law is something what that thing\n itself \"creates\" that is the step of faith.\n \n As it can not be hard to realize mankind works on the very limits\n of capabilities provided for us. The \"Casimir effect\" you mentioned \n is another typical example of that problem. I do not know how they will apply it in practical sense. I do not truly get the\n idea of \"space-time distortion\" or \"warp\". I admit that there are\n brains with much greater capacity than mine, yet even in a simple\n way I know that human capabilities are limited. If we assume they\n are not, we have a problem, a serious one.\n \n If we can not \"observe\" something it is inevitable to draw conlusions without measuring because there are no \"physical\"\n (technological if you wish) ways to do it.\n \n Once the mind is coerced to exptrapolate and can not afterward\n \"prove\" the assumptions by actual, \"real\" \"empirical\" data, the result remains what it was: an idea.\n \n The problem is that ideas are realities in themselves though not\n material. Yet the thoughts somebody has in his/her mind have\n actual, material consequencies. That is factual, and here comes\n the problem of materialism/evolutionism etc.\n \n You and me decide for ourselves what is there beyond the \"unobservable\" and then we shape our action according to\n what we think.\n \n In the \"Order\" section of debate forum I suggested that the order\n we see in the world is the basis of our existence. The laws are the \"order makers and keepers\". Without them existence is impossible. Well I am convinced that the laws (order) are the ruler and the material things are the subordinates - and they definitely did not create their own order. \n \n Best regards : Gabor",
