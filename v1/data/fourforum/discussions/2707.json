   "I have to agree with you, only this school year did i give a speech to my history class about the stealing, destruction and utter contempt the Israelis had for Palestinians. Since 70 A.D. the jews have been without a homeland. Then miraculously after the second World War a plot of land, their original home has not been inhabited for all that time. The Arabs who took the land from the Byzantines in about 622 A.D. have lived there. Unless there are two Palestines that exist in the Middle East then I can't see how it is inhabited and not at the same time. All these claims to ancient land would be as an indian asking a family move to move because his people lived there before, hundreds of years later. The nerve of the Jews to presume that they can use utter land fraud and the pity of the \"Civilized\" world to gain land is disgusting. People must see the truth and look beyond a man with his bomb strapped to his chest to the homless peolple of Palestine not the Western backed tribes of Israel.",

   "that the true owners of the land are the Canaanites. But since there aren't any of them left, we must look and see what happened after Abraham led the Hebrews from Mesopotamia and began the conquest of Canaan. There's more to the Jewish history of the land now known as Israel and it's quite compelling. \n \n That being the case, it sounds like two states is the solution. I also believe that Arafat hurt more than helped.\n \n I agree with you in that the Pals will fail (at first) and blame it on the Jews of Israel.
