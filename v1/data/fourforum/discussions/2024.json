If you look at the history of God and the phenomenon he has been credited for (from sunrise, lightning, volcanic eruptions, etc) to today, God's attributes have been continuously adjusted. in the light of this can we really say that God is constant and always the same? or is the \"grandeur\" of God only reactive to how far mankind has socially and technologically changed?",

   "Excellent topic Plotter!\n \n This will likely be one of the only posts I make for this week so allow me to expound for a bit.\n \n I agree with Sandy in that God always was, is, will be. I also agree that God created man to love, because God is love, He could demonstrate his love in us. \n \n Simple logic says that for creation to exist something must be self existent. Many will argue that is the universe. The problem is that the universe exists within a framework called space-time. Therefore, it could not be self existent. God is the self existent one. For man to have created God in his image is ludricous because the true image of God is not at all the image of man. Man is by nature, bent, dented, distorted. Man by his own nature will lie, cheat, steal, murder, and self protect. God is the opposite. This is demonstrated in the person of Jesus. Jesus went before the authorities, wrongfully accused, and did nothing to defend himself. He placed himself into the hands of the Father. He died, wrongfully accused and took on the sins of the world, was condemned and rose again, defeating death.\n \n While this may seem like a fairy tale to the atheist, the atheist has no better explanation. God certainly, is not created in the image of man. At least not the christian god. If one looks at the \"other gods\" over time, you will see the image of man. This is particulary true of the greek and Roman gods. They showed petty jealousies, strife, disunity, cheting, deceptions, etc. Almost any other god in history is similar. Additionally, The christian God is the only one who says that you and I have no ability to deal with what separates man from God. God is the only one who has that ability and does it for us. He not only forgives us but himself pays the price. It is as if I come to your house and break your lamp. The lamp is broken. It was an expensive one of a kind lamp that is irreplaceable. I do not have the money to pay you for it. You choose to say I forgive you and we remain friends. That is good, but there is more. The lamp is broken and the price for replacement must still be paid. You choose to find the identical lamp and purchase it at an exhorbitant price. That is the kind of love that God demonstrates.\n \n It is so far from mankind that it is ridiculous. Another example. You have a close friend and someone comes up and attacks your friend. You might, because you are close, jump into the fray to help your friend, risking your life. You might even do that for a stranger. We see on the news all the time, people jumping into raging floods to help someone or some such. \n \n However, Jesus chose to die for us, to give his life, while we were enemies. He asked of His Father to \"Forgive them for they know not what they do.\" He asked this at the moment he was being crucified. I doubt you or I would likely risk our life for an enemy. This is why I say that God is not created in the image of man. At least not the christian God. \n \n There are other reasons. I will not likely be able to post again on this for a while. If you have questions for me go ahead and post them but be patient on my reply. \n \n Plotter, you and I have had many conversations on God. I don't know if you would be willing to read a part of the bible that I might suggest for your perusal. I would suggest the book of Romans chapters 5-8 and then the book of Ephesians and Philippians. The latter two are fairly short. I would be interested in your take on those items. If you don't want to though, that is fine. I thought it might be germain to the discussion. It is not an attempt to \"evangelize\". That really isn't my style.\n \n Best to all and thanks for letting me ramble.",

I was speaking of the attributes of a God, and you plunge in and say, \"well, that's assuming that God exists\". Of course it is. When you speak of God, you assume that if He were to exist, then He would do this or wouldn't do that. Furthermore, the premise I use does not assume that God exists, but rather that His existence is not impossible - that is, God is possible. <<G or <<~G are the most reasonable default modal states I can think of for any being who's existence is in question.\n \nIm sure you remember the ontological argument and its premises.\n\n I remember the Ontological argument, but truthfully, I saw no relevance to what followed. Your criticism is quite easily solved - God cannot do the logically impossible. Why? Because it is impossible. Can God microwave a burrito so hot that He Himself cannot eat it? The greatest possible being wouldn't be able to do anything (as you've defined omnipotence), or not have any \"bounds\" of his existence or power - that is analytically unsupportable. It would have the greatest possible power, which I should think is a much better definition for omnipotence.

   "the reason why they are not synonymous is because an \"all-powerful supreme being\" can literally do the imposible, while the \"greatest possible being\" cannot\n\n Who is to say that they can do the impossible? The Supreme Being, as defined, is the source of all power - the definition you are proposing already has the contradiction crammed in it. He cannot do the logically impossible, simply, because it cannot be done.\n \nfirst of all, remember when the same logic was applied with the premise 2. as <<~G (it is possible for God not to exist), instead of <<G (~[]~G) the conclusion was that God doesnt exist. if it is possible for God to exist, then we conclude that God exists. if it is possible for God to not exist, then we conclude that God does not exist.\n\n Nah, This point has been already covered in the past. Let's go through it. What you and a few others were saying, is that if we are to change axiom two, then we would come out with a quite different proof: of the non-existence of God.\n \n However, what is missed is that we now have a problem that did not exist in the original. Through disjunctive syllogism in inference (8), (9) becomes []~G. Now, however, we have violated the law of noncontradiction, which applies in S5. We have stated that God (the greatest possible being) cannot possibly exist, which is absurd.\n \n Using Reductio Ad Absurdum, we now have a logical reason to prefer the axiom ~[]~G to ~[]G. That axiom is the weakest part of the argument, but not for this reason. To see all the other popular criticisms and their rebuttals, go to that website I later provided. It covers them quite extensively. Or, you can just go here.\n \n Also, I think you meant to say \"logically valid\" instead of \"logically sound\". By saying that it is logically sound you are proposing that the inferences are valid, and that the premises are true. In an axiomatic deductive argument, the inferences logically follow from the premises, and the truth of the argument is necessitated by them. So, accepting the premises in a valid argument would lead to a true conclusion. In this case - G. Which, I don't think you accept just yet. ;)\n \nsecondly, the definition \"the greatest possible being\" limits God from doing what is impossible, at least in the logical sense. but what about the physical sense? is it possible for God to turn a stick of chalk into a mercedes benz car (with leather interior, preferably). if this is not possible, then God cannot do it. we end up with a God thats really not that awesome...\n\n That matter is really quite trivial. I'm defining omnipotence as it is commonly used by philosophers these days - a being that can do anything that is possible. Poweful to the greatest possible extent.

   "Unfortunately, (and I believe the definition is covered quite extensively on that website), it is not for you or I to change the definition of a word simply because it defines too well! A greater definition for God than Supreme Being cannot be dreamed of. Anyways, it is quite irrelevant whether one rejects the definition. If this proof shows that such a being exists, it proves it regardless of whether one likes the definition. Then, you will have to explain what would be a more suitable definition for God.\n\n I'm not changing the definition of the word. Supreme being is a good definition, and we'll leave it at that. however, supreme being simply means \"being better than all other beings\". say that being is able to run faster, swim further, lifter heavier objects, and cook more delicious meals than anybody else in that exists, then thats your supreme being. but it also holds that this being cannot do what is impossible, nor does he have to, in order to maintain supreme being status. therefore this being doesnt necessarily need the power to create a round square, or a car from a stick of chalk, or a planet from nothing, and it will still be a supreme being.

   "The discussion has gone well beyond me. Except for this.\n \n The reason the framework of space time makes it impossible for the universe to be self existent is because of the nature of space time. Hawking has said the universe is either bounded but infinite or finite without a boundary. This kind of anomaly necessarily requires some kind of beginning. If the former is true then it had a beginning and no end. If the latter is true then it had no beginning but must end. \n \n More to the point, the very nature of \"self existent\" requires some sort of was, is, will be kind of interpretation. This is not possible with time. Time by its nature defines beginnings and endings. The only self existent must exist outside of time. It must be so that all of time is seen simultaneously and interacted in simultneously.\n \n Christians hold that the events of the crucifixion saved in all times. Forward and Backward, and currently. This has been true before any such concept of space time was ever developed. \n \n God does not come from anywhere. I agree, again with Sandy. He simply is. I agree some may not accept Jesus as God but that is another debate. \n \n The other argument that God was made in man's image is still not sufficiently refuted as God's image is distinctly different from mans. One only has to look at human history to discover that. That history includes christians by the way, who have done some horribel things in the name of God. That does not mean that God was accurately represented in those things. It means the christians of the time were out for their own glory and not Gods. \n \n Humans do not have it in them to attain perfection. We were never made to do this. It is this striving for perfection without the concommitant ability that leads to all of the depression and hopelessness in the world.\n \n The christian God is one that is both transcendant and immenent. Meaning he may be all powerful but he is approachable. Why you may ask? This is where Jesus comes in. Because of what Jesus chose to do at the cross, the bible says that we can come \"boldly before the throne\" of God. That is in Hebrews if you are interested. \n \n I am not, by the way, trying to prove the existence of God or Jesus. I am simply answering the question put by plotter. Where did God come from. The information I am posting simply points to his self existence and the impossibility of anything else be self existent.\n \n Unker: You state that \"the evidence shows\" that there are multiple universes. This is only a high falootin' theory. There is no evidence to actually show that. There is evidence that is being interpreted as such. But to do that one has to deny the existence of God. Since his existence is largely acceptable as a faith statement, then it is improper to dismiss Him as there is no more evidence to his nonexistence than his existence. The assumption of other universes is based on a faulty premise. It is only a theory. \n \n There are no direct or indirect observable effects in this universe of another universe.

   "I must be writing in some type of cryptic language. ;)\n \nGod precedes logic? are you saying that God can defy logic? or is not bound by logic? in other words, is God illogical?\n\n Firstly, and this doesn't even matter, I already told you about category errors. Because something is not logical, it does not follow that it is illogical - sometimes, neither can be applied. Like saying, \"the tree is patient\". It's a human characteristic; while it may be applied for literary techniques such as personification - it has no place in logic.\n \n Let's get some ground points:\n (1) God precedes logic, but I believe that He created so that both we, and Him operate within Logic. \n (2) God cannot do the [logically] impossible because it is not possible.\n \nalso, I thought we had previously agreed that God is not all-powerful, and that he is still subject to logic.\n\n What?? We concluded exactly the opposite (of the first part). Don't you remember my recent explanation on omnipotence?\n \n I define it as being able to do all that is logically possible. I do not define it as being able to do the impossible for two reasons: (i) it has the contradiction crammed in it already, for, then a \"being could do what it cannot do\", and (ii) if a being could do the impossible, it would not be impossible. So, it's a nonsensical phrase. If you disagree with the definition, then you'll have to provide some reason for why you should think that it should be the contradictory latter.\n \n Did you not agree with this section as you previously stated?",

Maybe we can work from there.\n\n Hopefully I can show the difference between these 2 concepts...\n \n from the modal argument we conclude that such a being as the \"greatest being possible\" exists, and has necessary existence.\n \n you equate this \"greatest being possible\" with an omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, immortal God\n \n I say that for there to be a \"greatest possible being\" does not necessarily imply that such a being be omnipotent, omnipresent, immortal, etc.\n \n you say that the all existing things are contingent upon the existence of the \"greatest being possible\" \n \n I say that the \"greatest being possible\" only need be greater than all other existing beings, but that does not imply that it defines all other existence\n \n in my perception, the \"greatest possible being\" is simply a being that is superlative to all other beings in greatness\n \n to you, this greatest possible being can only be an omniscient, all-powerful, immortal God\n \n to me, even without immortality, omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence, etc, the being can still be greater than all other existing beings, and therefore still be the \"greatest possible being\"\n \n furthermore, in order for the \"greatest possible being\" to be omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, immortal, etc, we first have to assume that these attributes are possible. the modal argument makes no such assumption, neither does it imply in its conclusion that these attributes are possible. if the case is that these attributes are not possible, then the greatest possible being cannot possess/acheive them.\n \n the entire view point of the \"greatest possible being/supreme being\" possessing the qualities above hinges on whether such attributes are possible in reality. if these attributes are not possible, the modal argument still remains sound.\n \n I hope this will clear up the confusion, if any",

   "Sincere apologies for this late reply; I didn't receive an email to tell me there was one.\n \nyou equate this \"greatest being possible\" with an omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, immortal God\n\n Would you care to show me where I have mentioned this?\n \n As for the rest of your post, I think it tries to refer to the apparent difference between Supreme Being and greatest possible being. So, I'll address that quickly. The being that has necessary existence, by definition, can be contingent on nothing. There can be no greater existence than existence in all possible worlds; that follows from both the earlier provided Euclidean relationship, as well as general logic and common sense. So, now we are assured that the greatest possible being, the Supreme Being, exists in all possible worlds. It has necessary existence. Therefore, it is contingent on nothing and everything is contingent upon its existence. That is, if the being were to \"go\", then it would ALL go. Hence, it follows that the being defines the very reality.\n \n As you have rightly said, it is superlative to all other beings, but it also follows that all beings are contingent upon it. They are not mutually exclusive. I hope I've shed some light here; any problems, of course, just add in a reply. ;)",

   "Well, my God is the God of the Bible. Others may disagree with that, but that is who I believe in. The Bible clearly defines God as the uncreated (i.e. eternal) creator of the universe, and what applies within the universe need not apply to God. So God does not have a \"beginning\" in time and hence, He is eternal. As for where He came from, the Bible is very clear that He resides in Heaven, but as to where that is, I am unsure. It will however be revealed to us at the end of our lives (if the Bible is true, which I am convinced that it is).",

   "I agree with Sandycane.She is certain and believes.I am no great philosopher nor do I use bombastic words of experts.What I personally believe is that God is Omnipresent and he made each of us no matter race nor religion, for a certain purpose in our existance.All our lives have already been plotted out before we are a being in the material world. I believe that through our journey in life,there is a certain purpose we have to perform,and yet,there are forks and u-turns that He has given us as options.God has always and forever existed. I do NOT know where God comes from, but I know that there is a God.He is in the very least,deep within our souls.As it has been said,without God,there will be no meaning in life.It is sad that there are people that believe that we are born,then die and rot,the end. How very sad.There will be chaos if everybody believes that.Without God, people would not have a conscience of being responsible for the actions that they take.They would not think of the conseqwences of what they do.In times of ill-misfortune,there will not be any solace or comfort without God.Bad things happen because certain people choose to go to that path.Or maybe the is a reason for why we are fighting each other throughout the world.I have not all the answers and I am always searching with a deep conviction of my existance.I do not know what God has for me in my future, but as for now, I do no harm to my fellow human beings,travel the globe,make good friends,have the usual girly fun and when I narrowly escape some disaster, I thank God.This is what I know for this moment in my 22 years of life.I mean to be open minded to the pros and cons of the existance of God, and mull over it.Then I sort it out logically in my own noodle.I have still a lot to learn, and do not pretend to know a lot about God, but for the certainty of what I already believe in and am convinced of.All I am absolutely certain of is, God DOES exists.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWell, I was hoping someone else would go first...\n \n Let me introduce you to the God I believe in.\n God is: \n One \n Truth \n Light\n Love\n Infinite\n All Knowing\n Everywhere\n All powerful\n Unequaled\n Perfect\n A Most Pure Spirit\n Invisible\n Without limit\n Eternal\n Incomprehensible\n The Almighty One\n Most Wise\n Most Holy\n Most Free\n Most Absolute\n Most Loving\n Gracious\n Merciful\n Long-suffering\n Forgiving\n Just in all His judgements\n The Creator\n The Sheperd\n \n God does not have a human body\n God does not change\n \n God works according to His will\n God receives glory\n God abounds in goodness\n God rewards those who seek Him\n \n God hates sin\n (copied from www.carm.org)\n \n God has no begining or end. He always was.\n \n God created us so that He could love us.\n 1 Jonh 4.8, \"He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.\"\n \n Sandy\n\n emoticon_xagree emoticon_xagree",

   "Dear Sandycane,\n Thanks for your interest, and your birthday greeting.I suppose you want to know a little bit more about me. Well, to me all are equal in God?s eyes. I come from a hotchpotch of different races and religions.Yet,when it comes to re-union time, we are just one very huge family.Even if we have to communicate with gestures,we are happy,like God meant.\n I am an only child.I am 24,of Arab, French,Siamese,Kazakh and God knows what.But I get to travel the world with friends that I have known since birth.Right now,I do not work as per say.We do goof like all 24 year old girls.Being rich,and coming from a long line of rich descendents does have it?s up and downs.We do charity work.I personally have gone to Ethiopia, Suweto,and Liberia.I play with the children, tell them stories and try to teach them the alphabets in what little time I am allowed.These are the times that I need God most.It is discouraging to see children disfigured for the rest of their lives because of what path someone has chosen to take.The innocents get the brunt of all this decisions.I can?t describe how much I have cried alone,It makes me feel so GUILTY!Why are children and babies without limbs,what of their future?Why is this happening?What made those responsible,choose this path.I have taught child prostitutes in Thailand as young as 10 years old.Sometimes,I?m suicidal,but than I was put here on earth by God for a purpose.I have my part to play,but WHAT?I am no Mother Theresa,not event close.I know I cannot dedicate my life to them permanently Perhaps I am not emotionally strong enough,maybe I?m too spoilt and selfish.Shamefull to say.Sometimes I wish that I was back diving in the Great Barrier Reef or of the coast of San Diego.Skiing in Banff or surfing in Mauii.Then I feel as low as a worm?s belly.\n But when it is chill out time, it?s back to Cappuccinos in the sidewalk of gay Paris, shopping in Neimen Marcus,Rodeo Drive,Knightsbridge or Harvey NicholsThen I feel on top of the world again.Please don?t think too badly of me,honestly speaking I enjoy goofing around, surfing,skiing,sky diving or whatsoever.When you really care,it hurts when you turn up at the pick-up points of these missions and you hear people say?Oh!Look!Here comes the rich brats to redeem their wealthy lifestyle,to balance their conscience?.Because deep inside, maybe I think they are right.Then I think NO! I was put here by God for a purpose,and I have a part to play in His All Knowing Plan. But what part do I play, Sandycane? I really don?t know. I really cannot devote myself to those helpless people like Mother Theresa.I have to be brutally honest to say that I do enjoy the good life.Shamefull as it is.I truly do not know what God wants.Thus,I travel the globe, laughing, crying,enjoying myself to the fullest yet feeling like a heel.So I continue to seek,meet people, listen to their perspective in life and all the time, trying to figure out what I am REALLY supposed to do to serve God.I have not done nearly enough,I know,\n and am still attached materially.Some part of me is missing, and I?m trying to find it, I read books, do research and join forums like this.Next week I?m going to Irag,if permitted,to do what I can to help.Why must these people be bombed and shot at? The innocent who knows noting about politics, except from where their next meal will come from.Why must so many young, brave soldiers die in a foreign land only to be brought home in a box to a devastated, grieving family?What is God planning Sandycane?I am not all-knowing like Him.I haven?t a clue.But I have learned much from you and another person known as DarKnight.I am still,searching,with God?s Blessings,I really,really hope.Everywhere I go the first question that people asked me is ?What are you??because of my mixed heritage look,which I am very proud off.Although to some that equals a mongrel.That?s my mixed up life,Sandycanes, but it?s my life and life is too short to party away,nor to be suicidal.I pretty much take what I feel I should or should not do,but I have yet to find my purpose in life according to God?s plan. Where do I fit in,Sandycane,why am I here? Why am I rich? Why do I enjoy it yet sometimes I feel guilty.What about you Sandycane?I would love to hear from you if you haven?t already thought of me too badly. Life is too short?answers are not forthcoming.Feeling like this is because GOD EXISTS\n More Power To You\n \n Loads of love\n Angelface\n \n \nAngelface,\n Happy belated birthday! emoticon_hb \n \n There are three things I am certain of,\n 1) God exists as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n 2) Jesus is the Savior to all who believe in Him.\n 3) The bible is the inerrant Word of God.\n \n Pretty much everything else is debatable :) \n \n I read your profile and can't help but wonder what your life must be like.\n Alot different from mine, I can tell you that!\n I don't have a job right now, and am able to spend alot (all) of my time studying the bible.\n I have faith that God will supply all my needs, and He has.\n I wonder if I would be different if I had alot of money, for the better, or worse?\n \n This might be a good topic for debate!\n \n Anyway, nice to meet you!\n Sandy\n emoticon_emb emoticon_love emoticon_xgood",

   "Dear Sandycane,\n You truly are amazing! You have such a simple approach to the meaning of life and God's existance.Yet so complex in explaining the why and therefores.Truthfully, you are about the only person in this forum that makes any sense to me, with all due respect to my other debators.The thing is,I am the problem,not you guys or gals out there.Putting it simply, I Do believe that God exists,and it was Him that created everything in this Universe and others of which we do not know.I don't understand the hullabaloo in the other debators,and frankly,UNKERPAULIE and DREAMWEAVER scares the skin out of me.Instead of trying to find out the existence of God and where He came from,all I got in my head was a huge jumble of bombastic words and Einstein-like equations.See, I don?t get it.I am not a philosopher nor a scholar of religion.For God?s sake I graduated in the London University in the field of archaeology!I got all confused and lost focus on the topic and the reason why I?m here in the beginning.I thought if I had another?s views on this topic, it may help me do what is right in my time on Earth.Ssorry?..Only SANDYCANE made any real sense by being unpretentious and made some things clearer for me.I think,Through her, I had a bit more conviction that I am heading at least as near as possible to where I am supposed to go and to what I am suppose to do.Honestly,it?s as simple as that and Sandycane made sense without coming through like a ultra-scientist figuring out the origin of the universe. To simple-minded me, if there is no God then there will be nothing.Zilcth!He created you and me, the skies and seas,the plants and animals, and everything imaginable that you can think of.Even as simple an object as a pencil.First,there should be a man, who got tired of writing letters with dipping his feather into and ink pot every so often,then,he couldn?t correct any mistakes that he wrote so he sat down and thought,and PRESTO!There was the pencil, that came from a brain, that belonged to a man, who was created by God,who made the pencil from the wood of the tree that God created, and charcoal that God has also,Blessed us with.The End.What is more important to me personally, is HOW, I can serve Him.What is the purpose of my being, and your being?So through it all, we try our best to make the world a better place,like God intended,before greedy, corrupted evil minds,went and spoiled the whole thing.Now to put this back as it was suppose to be is next to impossible,but not unachievable?if we ALL do our part and not stray.Believe you me,I?m no preacher, far from it, but it seems especially now,God must be part of you,somewhere deep inside the soul of even the vilest of men.What is the point in proving that God does NOT exists,so that mankind can get the credit of creation?So that we originated from some amoeba from the sea?Or descendents of apes?Do you REALLY belief that?Geezz?I even believe in Angels,much less Jesus and God!I?m just not very sure that what I?m doing is what I am suppose to be doing.I?m afraid that what I should be doing,like devoting my life to the despondent is my mission, and as I have said before,I?m so not ready and capable of doing.I?m sorry I?m shallow.I give and work like a girl possesed,then spend and have fun like there is no tomorrow.Shamefully, I still enjoy ice-cream and watching cartoons like SpongeBob an Angry Beavers!But after communicating with Sandycane, I am a bit more confident in what I am doing.Sandycane,others, if there is something simple that you could explain to me to help me through my life,I would be ever SO greatfull.In turn, I could comfort others with more conviction in their time of need.Thank You Sandycane.I am now searching deeper on Jesus,and if you could tell me how you are so serene and sure of your existence,please,could you, would you share?I will be so ever grateful to even think that what little that I have done,counts for something.I still am and I think forever think if I have done right by God,in all my ignorance and cowardice and guilt with my lifestyle.This is now,so make the best of what you are able and let not the blind lead the blind. I ?m so afraid that I am one of the blind, so I look to the wisdom of all in this forum, especially SANDYCANE (boyaahh!)to please,provide me with a seeing stick,so I will not be in danger of dragging a whole bunch of blind people,over the edge,like a lemming leader.I am here to learn,so,please,TEACH ME Sandycane and everyone else who is kind enough,and patient enough to,but simplify it for my noodles to catch on and don?t be the Bogeyman and scare the living daylights out of simple-minded me.Thank You for reading my rantings,but I just want to get it right and pass it on to anyone who will care a hoot, especially the future generation.I don?t pretend to be a goody two shoes, but,this really bugs me.I feel like someone without a shadow,at times,and boy,is it SCARY??so??.\n May all your clouds be golden and all your days bright! Sweeeeeet?..Boyaahh and may your waves be gnarly!\n \n Loads of love emoticon_frazzled emoticon_rolleyes \n Angelface\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAngelface,\n Thank you for your beautiful, and honest reply emoticon_cry \n I considered replying in a personal message, but, I think the conversation fits pretty well with the topic, don't you?\n \n I'm not sure where to start. I think first, I'd like to say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being \"rich\". Money is not evil, it is the worship of money that is.\n There are alot of people who covet what others have, and are jealous of them. This is a sin against God.\n He has blessed you with financial security (at the moment ;) ) and the desire to help others, which you obviously do. One person cannot change the world.\n \n God has a plan for everyone, \"even the wicked\". I think that God allows suffering so that others can help. One of my favorite sayings is, \"What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.\" We are given hardships to test our faith, and make us stronger.\n \n Only a suggestion, but, maybe the thing that is missing in your life is a relationship with Jesus?\n I know from personal experience, I had the same \"symptoms\" you have now, and He was the cure. :p \n \n Anyway, you sound like a well balanced person, and I look forward to your reply.\n \n Sandy emoticon_xangel\n",
