Only a widespread economic depression might level that playing field and since the National Guard is busy elsewhere, social discord would be a major problem offsetting any cost of goods sold reductions.\n\n Yes, low, low labor costs make U.S. businesses more competitive and give everyone cheaper goods and services, but that is only one side of the entire equation. A hundred years ago, immigration worked quite well, but nowadays each new poor person in our country is one more person eligible for an abundant array of government services, and they impose heavy costs that are paid for by taxpayers. I read one recent estimate of an average of close to $2000 per person per year here in CA. \n \n In California, I can get my lawn manicured for $100 a month, but my state is going bankrupt paying for all these services for poor immigrants. You name the service, chances are that poor immigrants are drawing on it much more than they are contributing, and that affects everyone's bottom line. It also affects the quality of life as well, as evidenced in two ways here in CA: middle-income people from the southern part of the state are moving out of the state to the Great Basin; and in northern Cal. wealthier people create very expensive segregated communities that at least keep all the social ills that accompany poverty at a distance in some other neighborhood. Any why are businesses fleeing CA at top speed when this is the place with the cheapest labor? It's taxes and regulations instituted by a Democratic-dominant state gov't who 2 out of 3 immigrants votes for. \n \n You might respond that this situation is temporary; immigrants always move out of poverty eventually. To a large extent, it is not happening now with poor immigrants. Nearly 40% of Hispanics drop out of high school, and those numbers are almost that high for the 2nd or 3rd generations, and we all now what a dropout's future is. Poor communities are getting stuck there, and the marginialization breeds social problems. For example, there are roughly 100,000 gang members in CA alone--most are Hispanic. Destructive subcultures have been growing and hardening in these poor communities. We keep building more and more prisons here, and have higher imprisonment rates than ever before, but my city is seeing another crime wave even with so many gangbangers locked up. People who live in the middle of immigration and see it up close are asking themselves, \"Is the importation of all these social problems worth being able to get my strawberries for a few cents less?\"",

I've seen as much white trash while living in many states in the US as I have ethnic groups; the whites tend to stay in their 'home' areas while ethnic groups congregate in metropolitan areas.\n \n I have no argument about the fact that we've created our own social problems. When our industrial sector was in the long, fat run after WWII up until the '80s, it was easier to concede false prosperity to unions and social support to many who took the free ride than it was to say no. Regardless of which political power has been in office, I've never heard anyone slight the takers, and possibly lose a voting block or swing vote. Your government is here to help you is a common political slogan. \n \n I see no solutions to those problems other than running out of money. Politicians are not going to slight a group that now constitutes substantial numbers. Immigration, legal or otherwise, will continue as long as we offer a superior standard of living compared to other countries.

Look at North Korea. People are dying there everyday. Now how many of those people get to South Korea? How about old East Germany? Oppressed, starving, and separated from family members on the other side. How many made it over to West Germany? Putting up a strong border patrol simply works.

The US has tried and tried to help Mexico turn itself around but their government is far too corrupt. Perhaps it is time for us to fix this situation ourselves. If Mexico's government is going to continue to encourage trafficing illegals across our borders maybe we should treat them as our enemy and take them out.

Back when we were an unorganized group of states who believed in manifest destiny we went up against a Mexico that was twice the size of the current one while we were about half our current size. We crushed them from sea to shining sea and took Mexico City for ourselves. We had the opportunity to march to their Southern most border at that time if we wished to but the elected government at that time decided to cut a deal with them instead. What a mistake that turned out to be. Anyways, the simple fact is that we have done it before and we could easily do it again especially considering how short the distance would be between our home bases and the war zones. Iraq is an ocean away while Mexico is a river away and across the way from freaking Texas. Hell, send some angry Texans across the border alone and you will see devastation for the Mexicans.\n \n But forget all that. We could crush them economically as well and encourage rebellion in the nation. It is unstable there and our economic help to them is depended upon. Cut off the economic help and embargo their country. Stop any money being sent across their border from our side regardless of who is sending it to them ie illegals living here. Prevent the UN from ever stepping in to help them. It would just be a matter of time before they collapsed. At that point we could use our influence to help give rise to a true democratic party there who could turn the country around. To get them into office just promise to being providing them again with economic aid and open up trade with them once the democrats are in power. Use other force as necessary.

   "So then take the easy approach. Punish businesses who are caught hiring any illegals. Have any illegal who is caught sent over to Africa, not back home. Make the risks higher and the rewards lower. That way less will come here and it won't cost us much to do this.\n \n But forget all that.

You can push out the current government without firing a shot.\n\n \n \n Employers hire people based on two pieces of identification to complete what's called an I9 form (INS), compliance being mandatory with substantial fines resulting from non-compliance. A driver's license and SS card are the most common identification, Green Card and SS card being used by many legal and illegal immigrants. Thanks to modern technology, a fake Green or SS card can be bought in the parking lot of most minimarts. The forgeries are so good the INS has to run the numbers to determine validity, not a field operation, so they round up everyone that doesn't appear to be WASP in appearance and hold them in detention centers. Take it one step further and supply and demand economics step in; virtually every state has or is prosecuting DMV employees for supplying driver licenses on the side for a price to illegal immigrants. The latest one where I live, the second caught in the past three years, admitted to receiving $350,000 at $100 a pop. No wonder the DMV lines are so long, they don't have time for their regular work. \n \n You don't seem to understand the fact that we can't field the manpower or logistics required to control our borders now, much less if we collapsed Mexico's economy. Have you ever personally viewed an INS raid on a business suspected of employing illegal immigrants? I have and it presents visions of Hitler cleansing Nazi Germany. The bus leaves with it's load of prisoners, to be housed at our expense, until their documentation can be examined and those legitimate workers released while the illegals are eventually deported, where they immediately make plans to return. Many die in the deserts attempting it, but the Coyotes have long waiting lists to guide illegals across the US/Mexico Border. \n \n We have a social problem with no realistic solution. Until our economy began the transformation from industrial to service level, everyone turned their heads to illegal immigration. They welcomed workers who would accomplish tasks that became unpalatable to the lower class and new lower middle class in an economy that enjoyed full employment. Our economy was in control of most world markets and rich enough to provide substantial social programs for those unable or unwilling to make their contribution to society, as it shut them up and confined them to specific areas where they didn't mingle with others. Our lower class still can't bring themselves to wash cars, pick fruit, perform janitorial duties or most other forms of manual labor, not when free government rides are readily available for the picking, so illegal immigrants fill those positions with incomes that seem dirt poor to us but provide them with a standard of living they could only dream of in their native countries. How do you suggest turning that around without a major economic depression that forces US Citizens to accept jobs they now consider beneath them? \n \n You suggest another session of nation building with Mexico? Instill democracy at the point of a gun? That hasn't proven to be our strong suit in even very small countries.",

What does a drug bust look like? Both are doing something illegal and should be taken away on a bus. Ship those illegals off the Africa somewhere and lets see them try and come back here again. The expense alone would increase for them so much that coming here again would be much more difficult if they ever got the chance to do it again.\n \n \nWe have a social problem with no realistic solution.\n\n \n You do realize that this social problem is not going to go away on its own and it is going to hurt us big time in the future. Illegals leech money from our economy and send it to Mexico. Illegals are likely to be getting free money from our government through various programs. Illegals are more likely to commit serious crimes (Surprise surprise). They are a also going in numbers and people are just beginning to accept illegal immigration as a reality meaning it is going to get harder and harder to try and turn around this trend. Also lets not forget that an open border there is also available to terrorists. And I'm sorry to say it but perhaps we need a few terrorists get cross that border and kill a lot of people so we can just wake up to this reality. It is inevitable that it will happen and I hope you are not too shook up and surprised when it does because you had to have seen it coming.\n \n \nHow do you suggest turning that around without a major economic depression that forces US Citizens to accept jobs they now consider beneath them?\n\n \n Simple. Let the current illegals stay and become citizens while making sure that our borders are protected better in the future. The illegals that do not register are probably going to be criminals anyways so we can get rid of them at the same time which helps clean up crime. After a generation of this less money will be getting sent to Mexico, crime should drop in these areas, and hopefully Mexico will start facing the fact that they cannot just ship their problems off to us and they will take care of themselves.\n \n \nYou suggest another session of nation building with Mexico?

Plus you can tell that a lot of Mexicans want Mexico to be the US anyways. Like I said earlier, Mexico is visible from Texas as well. It isn't like we are an ocean away here. It wouldn't require a real war either. Popular support along with a little help from US would lead a rebellion against the current government.

I'm sure Stalin was for free school lunch. \n \n I don't have time to address your specific concerns about this policy right now, but I for one will not be scared away from issues or policy proposals because you try to associate them, whatever the stretch required, with bad people. \"Guilt by association\" is an adolescent debating strategy and only works on people who fear being labeled a racist more than death itself (which is WAY too many people these days). I have zero fear of that label; in fact nowadays if a person gets called that, I am inclined to assume they are probably honest people who have intellectual integrity.",
