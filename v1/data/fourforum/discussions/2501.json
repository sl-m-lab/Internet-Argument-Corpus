   "The amendment to the constitution to allow for the graduated income tax was approved during the civil war. SInce the union prevailed, the southern states never actually seceeded and were charged with back taxes not paid during the war. If we recognize that fact, shouldn't we also recognize that the amendment was not ratified by 3/5 of the state legislatures (since the southern legislatures did not vote) and therefore not legal.",

   "16th Amendment, 1913, was the legalization of income tax approved by 36 of 48 states (75%). Prior taxation was federal revenue acts initiated to pay for the Civil War, declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1895. If Bubba is paying on those back taxes, somebody should tell him a thing or two.",
