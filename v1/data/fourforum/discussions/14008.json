There is actually quite a bit more on Mohamed than Jesus, if for no other reason than he was 600 years later.\n\n \n The answer to this is in the credentials of Jesus himself. Unlike other religious leaders, Jesus was told about in great detail before he was even born. There are numerous prophecies that Jesus fulfilled such as the blood line he would be born through Gen 22:18, Matt 1:1, where he would be born at Micah 5:2, Matt.2:1, how he would be betrayed Ps.41:9, Zech.11:12-13, Jn.13:21-26, Matt.27:5-7. There are many more prophecies. The dead Sea Scrolls confirm the fact that the prophecies were written long before Jesus was born. Jesus also performed many miracles offering them as evidence as to who he was John 10:36-39. \n \n The fact that Jesus performed what the people considered miracles is confirmed outside of the bible by the Jewish Historian Josephus who lived AD.37-100. No other religious leader, has performed miracles that are confirmed by other credible historic sources. Jesus predicted his own death and resurrection and then actually rose from the dead. No other religious leader in history has ever done this. Truly no other religious leader in history even comes close to these types of credentials. Buddha, Muhammad, Confucius and other ancient leaders did not do any miracles verified by credible historical sources. They were not told about in detailed prophecies before they were born. Last of all they did not rise from the dead. When Buddha, Muhammad, Confucius and other ancient leaders died they remained dead!\n \n This makes what Jesus has to say, at least in my opinion, more credible than what Buddha, Muhammad or Confucius may have said. Let us also no\n forget that Jesus claimed to be the only way in which mankind could come to God the Father John 14:6. All evidence shows that we can either choose Jesus or cling to some other hope that does not have any real substance or credibility in known facts. \n \n \n \nI am having a moment, are you looking for details regarding the examples I gave or ???\n\n \n Some examples where Christians forced Jews and others to convert and how this was a 'standard.'\n \n \nIslam started 600 years after Christianity and is the 2nd largest and fastest growing. \n\n \n But data for Islam reveal that the growing number of Muslims is due primarily to immigration (in the West) and higher birth rates (worldwide)\n \n \nJudaism started in the desert with a nomadic goat herder and would probably be the largest religion if the world would stop Killing Jews. (I don't know that being the chosen of God has such a great benefit package to make it worth what they have gone thru).\n \n \n Actually it probably would if Christ had not shown up.\n \n \nAlso Hindu's, Buddhists as religions still around.\n \n \n 'Still around' doesn't have much going for it.\n \n \nThe Celts, \n\n \n It appears that despite its intolerance of the Celtic religion, the Christian church was never able to rid Paganism without trace and in many cases, Druidism had to be integrated into the practices of Christianity. The images of the egg and new-born animals used by the Celts to convey fertility, for example, were adopted as symbols of Easter, while the idea of rebirth was carried across as the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The hare, one of the strongest of all Pagan icons for its sacred powers connected to the Spring, was transformed into a character of ridicule in later times - the Easter Bunny. The holiday of Samhain became All Soul's Day.\n \n At times, however, the leaders of both religions did try to lend a sense of unity between the cultures. As a symbol of both Celtic and Christian traditions, the Celtic Cross was formed, combining the Christian cross with the circular and knotwork designs of the Celts. This symbol is still seen widely today, particularly in Ireland where a strong Christian tradition still pays homage to the Gaelic peoples in the art and architecture of the church. Even in the ancient Christian texts, we read of Joseph of Aramathia coming to the Pagan lands, and sharing greetings and blessings with the Druids.\n \n So 'forcibly converted' is not accurate I don't believe.\n \n \nGreeks, \n \n \n You'll have to substantiate this one.\n \n \nNorse all had powerful religions that lasted until they were converted mostly by force. \n\n \n \"Mostly' is there some way to substantiate this . Are you talking about Danes?\n \n \nOf the 5 statements there is nothing unique to Christianity that could or had already occurred in some similar fashion in various other religions.\n \n\n \n I think I will stand by what I noted.\n \n \nYou have already made it clear short of coming home to find Krishna on your couch asking if he can have a talk with you after Wheel of Fortune you aren't going to accept anything short of what you already believe.\n\n \n Frankly because I've seen basically everything of evidence there is to see. There is nothing new under the sun, it's been debated for hundreds of years.If you can actually come up with something new, I certainly will look at \n it seriously as I want to know the 'shortcomings' sis.\n \n \nChristians love to say it's personal, but it's a part of their everyday life.

Where he was born again is questionable, but could be. What was the point of the betrayel? He was walking in the open all over town. There are again reasonable questions concerning that event. Even if all the prophecies are true that doesn't mean much. As an example it's not meant to be serious but to show how easy it is to make prophecy work the way you want it to. Also it could very well be someone in the future.\n \n A Chassidic Rabbi Makes a Startling Discovery\n \n \n \n \nThe fact that Jesus performed what the people considered miracles is confirmed outside of the bible by the Jewish Historian Josephus who lived AD.37-100.

The Crown claimed all Jewish possessions. Most of their houses were burned.\n \n \nBut data for Islam reveal that the growing number of Muslims is due primarily to immigration (in the West) and higher birth rates (worldwide)\n\n \n And isn't that how pretty much most religion do most of their growth, being born into it.? \n \n \nFrankly because I've seen basically everything of evidence there is to see. There is nothing new under the sun, it's been debated for hundreds of years.\n\n \n There is always something new. Even if it is just a new perspective on something old.

   "Qur'an (Surah 17:1)\n \n\n \n I'll check that one out, but apparently you suggest that this has more credibility than the gospels?\n \n \n \nAnd Christians didn't break away from Judaism? Nor did they later persecute Jews?\n\n \n Yes, they did, and let's make a distinction between 'Christian's'. The Catholic Church has perpetuated some of the most heinous travesties imaginable. I am not a Catholic, and many who are Catholic have no understanding of what their church perpetuated. Let me ask you: Do you believe Christ would have done such a thing? Those bracelets, \"WWJD\", may seem tacky to a lot of people, but they are perhaps the single most telling description of Christianity. \n \n \nActually there is no record of any eyewitness other than the Apostles of anything concerning Jesus \n\n \n And actually that is true, but I believe it is reasonable that if the Jews can hand down their history word of mouth until it is finally put in writing, and be accepted, that the evidence is in the telling itself.\n \n \nThe genealogies of Jesus are riddled with problems. Where he was born again is questionable, but could be. What was the point of the betrayel? He was walking in the open all over town. There are again reasonable questions concerning that event. Even if all the prophecies are true that doesn't mean much. As an example it's not meant to be serious but to show how easy it is to make prophecy work the way you want it to. Also it could very well be someone in the future.\n\n \n Yes it could, everything of 2000 years ago is open to question, don't you think? However, for millions and millions, the gospels are evidence enough. \n \n \nMiracles can be attributed to just as credible sources as those of Jesus. \n \n\n \n Yes they can.\n \n \n \n \nGod says different:\n \n Hosea vi. 6 \"I desire mercy and not sacrifice,\" \n Prov. xvi. 6, \"By mercy and truth iniquity is purged [atoned for],\" \n Ps. lxxxix. 3, \"The world is built upon mercy,\n 'What shall be done with the sinner?' replieth, 'Let him repent, and he will be atoned for; was it not said: \"Good and upright is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way of repentance\" (Psalms xxv. 8).\n \n \"If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.\"II Chronicles 7:14 \n \"He who sacrifices thank-offerings glorifies me\" (Ps. 1. 23)\n\n \n And you quote the Old Testament and I say that is before the advent of Christ, and spoke to the people waiting on the Messiah.\n \n The Jews have been persecuted by the Church. \n Again WWJD? Would I persecute the Jews? \n \n \n \nAnd isn't that how pretty much most religion do most of their growth, being born into it.? \n\n \n I believe Christian missionaries have been the catalyst of most of the spread of Christianity. \n \n \nThere is always something new. Even if it is just a new perspective on something old. I would be disappointed if I somehow caused you to stray away from your faith. (I don't kid myself in thinking I would be able to, don't worry)\n\n \n There is always something new, even if it's just new arguments to replace those that failed to discredit as expected. \n \n No worries. No worries at all....:)",
