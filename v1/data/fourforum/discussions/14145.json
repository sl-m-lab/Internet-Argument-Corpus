   "Stimulus created more than 2.2 million jobs so far - Apr. 14, 2010\n \n \nThe government's Recovery Act is responsible for between 2.2 million and 2.8 million jobs through the first quarter of 2010, according to the latest stimulus report from President Obama's chief economic adviser.\n\n \n Oops...don't let me forget the last paragraph: The report is based on a mathematical formula that calculates the number of jobs likely saved or created by stimulus money. \n \n Furthermore, as someone who has had to advise on the stimulus distribution, let me tell you that state agencies had to report any money spent on salaries as jobs saved (based upon a formula for what a \"job equivalent\" is). Now, the state agency knows for sure the wouldn't have fired that many jobs without the stimulus. This fact is obvious since some of the stimulus will end and the jobs costs are equal to what was given. That and the state agencies told me directly they wouldn't fire that many people if any at all. \n \n So are you guys buying it? If not, did you support Obama and what do you think about this? Did this Stimulus fail?",

   "CNN has tilted rightward and I doubt it would diddle the numbers to favor Obama. In fact, this may balance out the \"Obama\" numbers:\n \nWhile the Obama administration credits the stimulus with lifting the United States from the recession, Republican critics also look to the nation's 9.7% unemployment rate as proof that the act fails to create long-term jobs.\n\n From the CNN article cited above.\n \n Furthermore, I just don't recall the Obama administration making claims of this magnitude. The only number I recall is the rather modest 162,000 new jobs, which Obama himself says is pitiful, but a teensy bit hopeful.",

Is \"President Obama's chief economic adviser\" not part of the administration either? Obama said it himself back in February that the stimulus created or saved 2 million (now up to 2.2-2.8). \n \n So are you buying it?",
